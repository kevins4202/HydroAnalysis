this study is to propose a simple and smooth hydraulic conductivity model for saturated frozen soil based on the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc considering that the volume of pore water approximately represents the pore volume the distribution of effective pore radii changed as a function of temperature was determined by combining the sfcc and the gibbs thomson equation based on the distribution of effective pore radii hagen poiseuille equation darcy s law relative hydraulic conductivity and tortuosity a simple and smooth hydraulic conductivity model for saturated frozen soil based on the sfcc was proposed to illustrate the model performance eight existing experimental cases were analyzed the results showed that predictions considering the three different tortuosity

predictive modeling power was related to the tortuosity function furthermore the model was further compared with the previous models the results of which showed the better performance of the proposed model the model is quite simple and timesaving to use when the sfcc and the saturated hydraulic conductivity are available this result provides a new idea for developing the hydraulic conductivity model of saturated frozen soil keywords saturated frozen soil unsaturated unfrozen soil hydraulic conductivity soil freezing characteristic curve 1 introduction water movement in frozen soil is determined by the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil knowledge of which is significant for the management of the ecological environment hayashi 2013 and soil environment around buildings peppin and style 2013 for instance the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can affect the formation of surface water and groundwater walvoord et al 2012 furthermore the conductivity also affects the frost heave deformation suffered by buildings in cold regions tai et al 2017 however measuring the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil in the laboratory is difficult the difficulties encountered include that water will be frozen during the infiltration process burt and williams 1976 an ice film may be formed at both ends of soil samples black and miller 1990 and leakage flow occurs horiguchi and miller 1980 which all will result in a failure of the experiment even with the abovementioned difficulties burt and williams 1976 horiguchi and miller 1980 tokoro et al 2010 watanabe and osada 2016 and zhang et al 2016 still successfully measured the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil in the laboratory the laboratory results provide a necessary condition for the development of a hydraulic conductivity model for frozen soil based on the experimental data some predictive models have been proposed and can be divided into three classes the first class is the empirical model horiguchi and miller 1980 nixon 1991 which has no strict derivation process and is just a fitting of the tested data the model is usually expressed as a function of temperature with one or more empirical parameters however the model parameters are difficult to determine and not valid for all soils the second class is the macroscopic model which has clear physical meanings but no strict derivation process the model can also be subdivided into two classes one class is the ice impedance model taylor and luthin 1978 jame and norum 1980 the model suggests that the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil is reduced to 1 i of the hydraulic conductivity of unfrozen unsaturated soil with same liquid water content owing to the ice impedance effect where i is the ice impedance factor however the model was criticized for arbitrary choice of the ice impedance factor newman and wilson 1997 subsequently the other class has been gradually proposed the model suggests that saturated frozen and unsaturated unfrozen soils with the same liquid water content have the same hydraulic conductivity since the ice in saturated frozen soil plays the same role as the air in unsaturated unfrozen soil during the seepage process tarnawski and wagner 1996 azmatch et al 2012 and chen and zhang 2020 successfully predicted the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil through the different hydraulic conductivity models for unsaturated unfrozen soil however the models of tarnawski and wagner 1996 and chen and zhang 2020 may not be able to accurately predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil with nonlog normal soil particle size distribution spsd the validity of azmatch et al 2012 model is limited by the clapeyron equation which was used to link the relationship between temperature and suction and was always controversial ma et al 2015 the third class is the statistical model which has clear physical meanings and strict derivation process weigert and schmidt 2005 proposed a statistical model based on the soil water characteristic curve swcc representing the pore size distribution curve psdc and the kelvin equation defining the pore radius they considered that the hydraulic conductivity at each water content decrease is proportional to r x 2 δ θ x where r x is the mean radius of the pore class and δ θ x is share of the pore class of the total volumetric water content and then the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be obtained by subtracting the hydraulic conductivity of frozen pores from the saturated hydraulic conductivity watanabe and flury 2008 considered that ice formed in the center of capillaries thus resulting in the opening of a circular annulus for water flow based on the freezing process of which a statistic model was derived based on swcc representing psdc the kelvin equation defining the unfrozen pore radius and the gibbs thomson equation defining the pore ice radius as expected since the psdc controls the swcc reasonable estimates of the psdc can be derived from the swcc later ming et al 2020 proposed a different model based on sfcc representing psdc the gibbs thomson equation defining the pore ice radius and the assumption that the larger water filled pores freeze first the relationship between sfcc and psdc was established through n j δ θ v π r j 2 l e where n j is the number of capillaries δ θ is the decreasing unfrozen water content r j is the pore radius l e is the real water flow path and v is the volume of the soil sample however all the above mentioned statistic models were presented in the form of summation which has two limitations one is that the predicted hydraulic conductivity curves are not smooth and have different shapes which makes it difficult to apply the hydraulic conductivity models to numerical saturated unsaturated flow problems since the model predictions are difficult to be fitted through an analytical formula the other is that all the models need to divide the swcc or sfcc into different water content intervals δ θ x so that the predicted hydraulic conductivity will be affected by the size of water content interval to some extent additionally the relative hydraulic conductivity is not used in the three models the use of relative hydraulic conductivity can make the hydraulic conductivity model more predictive power considering the above limitation a new simple and integral formula for hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil was derived based on sfcc representing psdc the gibbs thomson equation defining the unfrozen pore radius in frozen soil and the introduction of the relative hydraulic conductivity and tortuosity subsequently the predictive capacity of the model was illustrated by the existing experimental data moreover the performance of the model was further compared with the previous models 2 mathematical model of hydraulic conductivity for saturated frozen soil 2 1 hypotheses to develop the hydraulic conductivity model the following hypotheses were adopted in this study 1 soil pores are treated as a set of interconnected pores with different radii and random distribution and each soil cross section has the same pore size distribution 2 the hagen poiseuille equation and the gibbs thomson equation are valid in a single pore 3 sfcc is relevant to the pore size distribution function similar to swcc 4 the effect of wetting films and dissolved impurities on the hydraulic conductivity are ignored 5 during the freezing process when the temperature is t i c the capillaries with a radius smaller than c t i c are filled with water where c is a parameter on the contrary the water in the capillaries with a radius larger than c t i c is frozen thus reaching a frozen state the freezing process is shown in fig 1 2 2 derivation of the mathematical model based on assumptions 1 and 2 water flow within the pores can be described by the hagen poiseuille equation 1 u g υ r 2 8 δ h l e where u m s is the average water flow rate g n kg is the acceleration of gravity υ m 2 s is the kinematic viscosity r m is the pore radius δ h l e is the dimensionless hydraulic gradient δ h m is the hydraulic head difference and l e m is the real water flow path the contribution of full pores of radius r r d r to water content θ can be expressed as mualem 1976 mualem and dagan 1978 2 d θ f r d r where r m is the pore radius and f r is the volume pore distribution function the elementary pore contribution to the water flow rate can be expressed as 3 d v u f r d r u d θ then integrating dv over the entire pore radius range gives the total water flow rate v m s in the soil gates and lietz 1950 as 4 v θ u r min r θ u d v r min r θ u u d θ where r θ u m is the pore radius corresponding to the unfrozen water content θ u and r min m is the minimum pore radius corresponding to the minimum unfrozen water content θ min substituting eq 1 into eq 4 gives 5 v θ u g 8 υ δ h l e r min r θ u r 2 d θ the maximum unfrozen pore radius in frozen soil can be estimated by the gibbs thomson equation mitchell et al 2008 bai et al 2018 6 r g γ sl l f ρ i t m t m t k cos α sl where r g m is the gibbs thomson radius γ sl kj m 2 is the solid liquid interfacial free energy and α sl deg ree is the solid liquid contact angle l f kj kg is the latent heat of fusion ρ i kg m 3 is the density of ice t m k is the freezing temperature of bulk water t k k is the temperature in kelvin and t m t j k is the depression in freezing point it should be noted that cos α sl 1 is often adopted dash et al 1995 ishizaki et al 1996 watanabe and flury 2008 watanabe and wake 2008 the gibbs thomson equation indicates that the larger water filled pores freeze first the real water flow path can be expressed as 7 l e τ l where l m is the straight line distance over which the head drop occurs and τ is the dimensionless tortuosity substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 5 gives 8 v θ u g 8 υ τ 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 δ h l θ min θ u d θ t 2 g 8 υ τ 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 δ h l 0 θ u d θ t 2 where t c is the depression in the freezing point the value of which is equal to t m t j k to solve eq 8 the temperature t should be expressed as a function of unfrozen water content by means of sfcc it should be noted that compared with the water flow rate at the minimum and maximum water unfrozen content the water flow rate at the minimum water unfrozen content can be ignored hu et al 2020 comprehensively summarized past expressions for sfcc in which the θ u α t β was adopted in this study where α and β are fitting parameters the total water flow rate can also be expressed by darcy s law 9 v k δ h l where v m s is the seepage velocity and k m s is the hydraulic conductivity comparing eq 8 with eq 9 the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil can be expressed as 10 k θ u g 8 υ τ 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 0 θ u d θ t 2 let θ u θ sat then the saturated hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 11 k sat g 8 υ τ 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 where θ sat is the critical saturated water content corresponding to the maximum freezing temperature at which the water starts to freeze into ice it should be noted that the tortuosity varies with unfrozen water content and kinematic viscosity varies with the temperature thus eqs 10 and 11 can be revised as 12 k θ u g 8 υ t u τ θ u 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 0 θ u d θ t 2 13 k sat g 8 υ t s τ θ sat 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 where τ θ s and τ θ u are the tortuosity at water content of θ sat and θ u respectively υ t s and υ t u are the kinematic viscosity at the temperature associated with the water content of θ sat and θ u respectively combining eqs 12 and 13 the relative hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 14 k r θ u k θ u k sat υ t s τ θ sat υ t u τ θ u 0 θ u d θ t 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 then the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil can be rewritten as 15 k θ u k sat υ t s τ θ sat υ t u τ θ u 0 θ u d θ t 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 the kinematic viscosity is defined as 16 υ μ ρ w where μ pa s and ρ w kg m 3 are the dynamic viscosity and density of water respectively the dynamic viscosity thomas and sansom 1995 and the density of water khan 2000 can be expressed as 17 μ 0 6612 t 229 1 562 18 ρ w 916 5 83 39 e 5 94697 745 5 t 273 e 1623 553 t where t k is the absolute temperature the three tortuosity formulations for unsaturated unfrozen soil were applied to the saturated frozen soil with the same liquid water content based on the similarity of pore size distribution between the two soils chen and zhang 2020 fatt and dykstra 1951 suggested that the tortuosity is inversely proportional to r b and can be written as fatt and dykstra 1951 mualem and dagan 1978 klute and mualem 1986 19 τ f b r b 2 where b and b are constants it should be noted that b 1 2 given by fatt and dykstra 1951 was adopted in this study therefore considering the tortuosity τ f eq 15 can be revised as 20 k θ u k sat υ t s υ t u 0 θ u d θ t 2 b 0 θ sat d θ t 2 b it can be found from eq 20 that the parameter b is eliminated burdine 1953 introduced θ 2 to represent the influence of tortuosity on the hydraulic conductivity mualem and dagan 1978 assouline and or 2013 21 τ b θ 2 θ u θ r θ sat θ r 2 where θ is the standard volumetric water content and θ r cm 3 cm 3 is the residual water content then eq 15 can be revised as 22 k θ u θ 2 υ t s υ t u k sat 0 θ u d θ t 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 additionally comiti and renaud 1989 considered that the tortuosity can be expressed as a function of porosity as 23 τ y 1 0 41 ln 1 n where n is the soil porosity which can be approximately equal to the volume unfrozen water content then eq 15 can be revised as 24 k θ u 1 0 41 ln 1 θ sat 1 0 41 ln 1 θ u υ t s υ t u k sat 0 θ u d θ t 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 eqs 20 22 and 24 indicate that the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil can be determined only by sfcc and the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the calculation process is just a simple integration of sfcc with different unfrozen water content the model not considering the influence of tortuosity on hydraulic conductivity is defined as model i and the models considering the tortuosity of τ f τ b and τ y are defined as models ii iii and iv respectively which was used to discuss the influence of tortuosity on the hydraulic conductivity 3 results 3 1 soil samples to illustrate the model performance eight existing experimental cases williams and burt 1974 burt and williams 1976 horiguchi and miller 1980 tokoro et al 2010 watanabe and osada 2016 zhang et al 2016 were adopted in this study all the experiments reported the saturated hydraulic conductivity and sfcc which are required in model calculation table 1 summarized some physical properties of the soil samples including the soil types saturated water content θ sat saturated hydraulic conductivities k sat cm s bulk density ρ g cm 3 m cl m si and m sa are the clay d 0 002 mm the silt 0 002 d 0 05 mm and the sand 0 05 d 2 mm mass fractions 3 2 soil freezing characteristic curve fig 2 gives the sfccs of the soil samples as shown the shape of the sfccs are different the result indicates that the soils have different pore size distributions ming et al 2020 which resulting in the difference of the hydraulic conductivity the shape of the sfccs are controlled by soil type initial water content and dry density as is the hydraulic conductivity additionally it should be noted that the sfccs of carleton silt oneida clayey silt manchester silt tibet plateau silty clay and dl silt are expressed by the mass water content while the sfccs of tottori dune sand fujinomori silt loam and andisol sandy loam are expressed by the volumetric water content both kinds of sfccs can be used in the model calculation 3 3 calculated pore radius kinematic viscosity and tortuosity fig 3 a presents the pore radius of frozen soil at different temperatures which was calculated by eq 6 as shown the pore radius decreases linearly with the decreasing temperature in the log log coordinate the pores can be divided into the macropores r 25 nm mesopores 1 nm r 25 nm and micropores r 1 nm mitchell et al 2008 the critical temperature for dividing the macropores and mesopores can be determined from fig 3 a the value of which is about 1 01 it can be found that the soil pores are mainly composed of macropores and mesopores and the macropores will be frozen when the temperature drops to 1 01 fig 3 b presents the kinematic viscosity of unfrozen water at different temperatures which was calculated by eqs 16 18 as shown the kinematic viscosity increases slightly as the temperature decreases resulting in a decrease of water flow rate with decreasing temperature however it can be seen that as the temperature decreases from 0 to 10 the kinematic viscosity increases from 1 8 10 6 m2 s to 2 7 10 6 m2 s which indicates that the change in kinematic viscosity caused by temperature has little influence on the predicted hydraulic conductivity fig 4 presents the tortuosity of models ii iii and iv which was calculated by eqs 19 21 and 23 respectively as shown the tortuosity increases with decreasing temperature and unfrozen water content additionally the tortuosity τ f and τ b increases by several orders of magnitude with decreasing temperature and unfrozen water content while the tortuosity τ y only increases within one order of magnitude this result indicates that the selection of tortuosity has an obvious effect on the predicted hydraulic conductivity besides it should be noted that eq 15 can be reduced to k θ u k sat υ t s τ θ sat υ t u τ θ u θ u θ sat ξ where the ξ is a constant parameter the value of which is determined by the fitting equation θ u α t β of sfcc it can be found that this form of the proposed model is similar to that of the model proposed by chen and zhang 2020 however the different is that the parameter ξ in the model of chen and zhang 2020 is determined by the spsd chen et al 2021 pointed out that the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils would be better calculated through the sfcc rather than the spsd since the sfcc is more related to the hydraulic conductivity than the spsd therefore the proposed model would perform better than the model of chen and zhang 2020 and this comparison will be discussed in section 4 3 table 2 summarized the values of parameter ζ 3 4 predicted hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil fig 5 presents the predicted hydraulic conductivities of models i ii iii and iv for the eight saturated frozen soil samples respectively as shown the hydraulic conductivity of the four models changes similarly with the temperature and unfrozen water content that is the hydraulic conductivity decreases significantly with the decreasing temperature and unfrozen water content however it would be better to establish the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil and unfrozen water content instead of temperature for one thing the hydraulic conductivity of soils is affected directly by unfrozen water content instead of temperature since the temperature cannot directly change the pore structural characteristic of the porous material without water for another thing given the similarity of saturated frozen soil and unsaturated unfrozen soil and the fact that hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated unfrozen soil expressed as a function of liquid water content will not be affected by the hysteresis effect of swcc klute and mualem 1986 the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil expressed as a function of unfrozen water content is not expected to be affected by the hysteresis effect of sfcc 4 discussion 4 1 model verification to evaluate the model performance the hydraulic conductivities predicted by models i ii iii and iv were compared with the experimental values and the results were present in fig 6 the scatter points represent the experimental hydraulic conductivities and the lines represent the predicted hydraulic conductivities as shown in fig 6 a almost all the scatter points locate below the lines which show that the model i overestimates the tested values moreover this phenomenon was found to become obvious with the decrease in unfrozen water content which shows the necessity to consider the tortuosity in the model calculation as shown in fig 6 c almost all the scatter points are very close to the lines which shows the excellent performance of model ii the results indicate that predicted hydraulic conductivities considering tortuosity τ f b r b 2 were in excellent agreement with the tested data as shown in fig 6 e most of the scatter points are close to the lines and a few scatter points are far from the lines which shows the good performance of model iii the result indicates that predicted the hydraulic conductivities considering tortuosity τ b θ 2 were in good agreement with the tested data furthermore it can be found that the predictions of model iii generate an inflection point at very small unfrozen water content which was caused by tortuosity θ 2 however this phenomenon can be ignored since the unfrozen water content at this time is so minimal as shown in fig 6 g almost all the scatter points locate below the lines which shows that model iv overestimates the tested values the result indicates that the predicted hydraulic conductivities considering tortuosity τ y 1 0 41 ln 1 n overestimate the tested data the model performance was further illustrated by comparing the predicted hydraulic conductivity and tested data in the log k t vs log k p coordinates the results of which are shown in fig 6 b 6 d 6 f and 6 h where k f and k p are the tested and predicted hydraulic conductivities respectively it should be noted that the black lines green lines and red lines represent the cases that the predictions are equal to the tested values the predictions are equal to the tested values plus or minus the accepted experimental error of 2 10 n where n is the order of magnitude of the tested value and the predictions are equal to the tested values plus or minus one order of magnitude respectively the gray zone represents the acceptable test error zone and the pink zone represents an order of magnitude error zone as shown in fig 6 b only a few scatter points fall within the acceptable test error zone while most of the scatter points fall outside an order of magnitude error zone as shown in fig 6 d almost all the scatter points fall in the acceptable test error zone as shown in fig 6 f most of the scatter points fall within the acceptable test error zone and only a few scatter points fall outside an order of magnitude error zone as shown in fig 6 h similar results as those shown in fig 6 b can be observed since the tortuosity considered in model iv is small in conclusion the influence of tortuosity on the hydraulic conductivity cannot be ignored and the tortuosity of τ f b r b 2 performs best τ b θ 2 follows and τ y 1 0 41 ln 1 n performs worst the root mean square errors rmses of the four models were calculated as 25 rmse i 1 n ln k p ln k t 2 n where i is the count of the current data points and n is the number of data points the calculated values of rmse are summarized in table 3 as shown the rmses of model ii are lowest among the models followed by model iii model i and iv are highest which indicates that model ii performs best among the models 4 2 model valuation table 4 summarizes the previous hydraulic conductivity models for frozen soil based on the model similarity the models can be classified into macroscopic model statistical model and fractal model three classes the macroscopic model and statistical model have been discussed in the introduction the fractal model has a lower temperature limit for model validity and mainly depends on the throat radius which may result in underestimating the hydraulic conductivity compared with the macroscopic model the model proposed in this study has a strict derivation process without applying the clapeyron equation or assuming that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is equal to that of saturated frozen soil compared with the statistical model the proposed model does not need to divide the sfcc or swcc so that the model predictions are not affected by the divided unfrozen water content besides the proposed model is simple smooth and timesaving in that only a simple integration of sfcc at different water contents is required compared with the fractal model the proposed model considers the contribution of all the unfrozen pores and have no lower temperature limit for model validity however there also exists some model limitations first the model performance will be influenced by the tortuosity which is uncertain second the model does not consider the contribution of the unfrozen water film on the hydraulic conductivity which may result in underestimating the hydraulic conductivity nevertheless the influence was not expected to be pronounced owing to the small amount of unfrozen water film third the model does not consider the influence of the transverse ice lens on the hydraulic conductivity which may result in overestimating the hydraulic conductivity additionally table 4 summarizes the different parameters required in the above mentioned models to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil it is necessary to explain the role of the parameters in the models in the model of tarnawski and wagner 1996 the parameter b was calculated by the spsd the unfrozen water content was estimated by the swcc and spsd actually if the sfcc is known the unfrozen water content can be obtained directly from the sfcc in the model of azmatch et al 2012 the unfrozen water content was obtained from the sfcc the suction ψ was converted into the temperature through the clapeyron equation in the model of chen and zhang 2020 the parameter b was calculated by the spsd the unfrozen water content was obtained from the sfcc in the model of weigert and schmidt 2005 the liquid water content interval δ θ x was obtained from the swcc the pore radius r x was calculated by the kelvin equation in the model of watanabe and flury 2008 the number of capillaries n j was calculated from the swcc the radius of unfrozen capillaries r j was calculated by the kelvin equation the radius of the pore ice r ij was calculated by the gibbs thomson equation in the model of ming et al 2020 the unfrozen water content interval δ θ j was obtained from the sfcc the radius of the capillaries r j was calculated by the gibbs thomson equation and the unfrozen water film thickness was estimated by the van der waals forces in the model of chen et al 2019 the pore size dimension d was calculated by the volumetric unfrozen water content obtained from the sfcc the maximum pore radius r max was calculated by the gibbs thomson equation in this study the relation between temperature and unfrozen water content were obtained from the sfcc 4 3 model comparison to further evaluate the model proposed in this study the performance of which was compared with that of the models of chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 it should be noted that the model of chen and zhang 2020 was not discussed in this study which can be attributed to that this model belongs to the macroscopic model additionally the model of ming et al 2020 is similar to that of weigert and schmidt 2005 and watanabe and flury 2008 thus the latter were also not discussed in this study fig 7 and fig 8 present the model predictions and performance of chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 respectively table 5 summarized the rmses and armses average root mean square errors of the three models as shown the tortuous capillary model of ming et al 2020 performs best followed by the model ii of this study the straight capillary model of ming et al 2020 the model iii of this study the fractal model of chen et al 2019 the model iv of this study the model i of this study performs worst but in fact the model ii of this study among the models performs best since the models of chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 failed to correctly predict the tested hydraulic conductivity of tottori dune sand fujinomori silt loam and andisol sandy loam the phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that chen and zhang 2020 and ming et al 2020 models results are more sensitive to the soil freezing characteristic curves sfccs that is if the sfccs given in the references are a little inaccurate the models will overestimate or underestimate the measured hydraulic conductivity in this case the relative hydraulic conductivity would be better to be used which makes the model more predictive the reason is that with the help of the ratio relation of relative hydraulic conductivity and the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity the proposed model can weaken the influence of soil freezing characteristic curve on the calculation results of hydraulic conductivity so that the model calculation results are more accurate and the model has wider application that is the relative hydraulic conductivity makes the model results have to change from saturated hydraulic conductivity which makes the model results do not deviate from the measured values from the beginning the relative hydraulic conductivity is the same as the matching factor kunze et al 1968 which is used to correct the difference between the measured value and the calculated value moreover it can be found that the model predictions of chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 without introducing the relative hydraulic conductivity cannot change from the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity of unfrozen soil resulting in incomplete prediction results additionally compared with the model of ming et al 2020 model the model proposed in this study is smoother which makes the numerical saturated unsaturated flow problems easier to converge van genuchten 1980 additionally it should be pointed out that the model proposed in this study considered three tortuosity models while the models of the chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 just considered one tortuosity the model of chen et al 2019 considered the tortuosity τ b while the model of ming et al 2020 considered the tortuosity τ y it can be found that if the model of chen et al 2019 does not consider the influence of the tortuosity the model will overestimate the tested data while the model of ming et al 2020 can fit the tested data well even the tortuosity is not considered therefore this comparison indicates that the change of tortuosity of frozen soil with temperature have a critical influence on the hydraulic conductivity 5 conclusions this study proposed a simple smooth hydraulic conductivity model for saturated frozen soil based on sfcc the model performance was illustrated by the eight existing experimental cases the major conclusions are summarized as follows 1 a simple integral formula for hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil was derived based on the relationship between the sfcc and psdc the gibbs thomson equation defining the pore radius in frozen soil and the introduction of the tortuosity function 2 the model can be applied when the saturated hydraulic conductivity and sfcc are available moreover the model calculation process is quite simple and timesaving in that only a simple integration of sfcc at different unfrozen water content levels was required 3 the influence of tortuosity on hydraulic conductivity cannot be ignored since the model not considering the tortuosity performs worst additionally the model considering the tortuosity of τ f b r b 2 performs best 4 the model was further compared with the two previous models the results of which indicate that the proposed model has better predictive ability and smoother hydraulic conductivity curve credit authorship

4090,hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil is indispensable for describing water flow process in freezing soils however this conductivity is difficult to measure in the laboratory so the objective of

conductivity model for frozen soil based on the experimental data some predictive models have been proposed and can be divided into three classes the first class is the empirical model horiguchi and miller 1980 nixon 1991 which has no strict derivation process and is just a fitting of the tested data the model is usually expressed as a function of temperature with one or more empirical parameters however the model parameters are difficult to determine and not valid for all soils the second class is the macroscopic model which has clear physical meanings but no strict derivation process the model can also be subdivided into two classes one class is the ice impedance model taylor and luthin 1978 jame and norum 1980 the model suggests that the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil is reduced to 1 i of the hydraulic conductivity of unfrozen unsaturated soil with same liquid water content owing to the ice impedance effect where i is the ice impedance factor however the model was criticized for arbitrary choice of the ice impedance factor newman and wilson 1997 subsequently the other class has been gradually proposed the model suggests that saturated frozen and unsaturated unfrozen soils with the same liquid water content have the same hydraulic conductivity since the ice in saturated frozen soil plays the same role as the air in unsaturated unfrozen soil during the seepage process tarnawski and wagner 1996 azmatch et al 2012 and chen and zhang 2020 successfully predicted the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil through the different hydraulic conductivity models for unsaturated unfrozen soil however the models of tarnawski and wagner 1996 and chen and zhang 2020 may not be able to accurately predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil with nonlog normal soil particle size distribution spsd the validity of azmatch et al 2012 model is limited by the clapeyron equation which was used to link the relationship between temperature and suction and was always controversial ma et al 2015 the third class is the statistical model which has clear physical meanings and strict derivation process weigert and schmidt 2005 proposed a statistical model based on the soil water characteristic curve swcc representing the pore size distribution curve psdc and the kelvin equation defining the pore radius they considered that the hydraulic conductivity at each water content decrease is proportional to r x 2 δ θ x where r x is the mean radius of the pore class and δ θ x is share of the pore class of the total volumetric water content and then the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be obtained by subtracting the hydraulic conductivity of frozen pores from the saturated hydraulic conductivity watanabe and flury 2008 considered that ice formed in the center of capillaries thus resulting in the opening of a circular annulus for water flow based on the freezing process of which a statistic model was derived based on swcc representing psdc the kelvin equation defining the unfrozen pore radius and the gibbs thomson equation defining the pore ice radius as expected since the psdc controls the swcc reasonable estimates of the psdc can be derived from the swcc later ming et al 2020 proposed a different model based on sfcc representing psdc the gibbs thomson equation defining the pore ice radius and the assumption that the larger water filled pores freeze first the relationship between sfcc and psdc was established through n j δ θ v π r j 2 l e where n j is the number of capillaries δ θ is the decreasing unfrozen water content r j is the pore radius l e is the real water flow path and v is the volume of the soil sample however all the above mentioned statistic models were presented in the form of summation which has two limitations one is that the predicted hydraulic conductivity curves are not smooth and have different shapes which makes it difficult to apply the hydraulic conductivity models to numerical saturated unsaturated flow problems since the model predictions are difficult to be fitted through an analytical formula the other is that all the models need to divide the swcc or sfcc into different water content intervals δ θ x so that the predicted hydraulic conductivity will be affected by the size of water content interval to some extent additionally the relative hydraulic conductivity is not used in the three models the use of relative hydraulic conductivity can make the hydraulic conductivity model more predictive power considering the above limitation a new simple and integral formula for hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil was derived based on sfcc representing psdc the gibbs thomson equation defining the unfrozen pore radius in frozen soil and the introduction of the relative hydraulic conductivity and tortuosity subsequently the predictive capacity of the model was illustrated by the existing experimental data moreover the performance of the model was further compared with the previous models 2 mathematical model of hydraulic conductivity for saturated frozen soil 2 1 hypotheses to develop the hydraulic conductivity model the following hypotheses were adopted in this study 1 soil pores are treated as a set of interconnected pores with different radii and random distribution and each soil cross section has the same pore size distribution 2 the hagen poiseuille equation and the gibbs thomson equation are valid in a single pore 3 sfcc is relevant to the pore size distribution function similar to swcc 4 the effect of wetting films and dissolved impurities on the hydraulic conductivity are ignored 5 during the freezing process when the temperature is t i c the capillaries with a radius smaller than c t i c are filled with water where c is a parameter on the contrary the water in the capillaries with a radius larger than c t i c is frozen thus reaching a frozen state the freezing process is shown in fig 1 2 2 derivation of the mathematical model based on assumptions 1 and 2 water flow within the pores can be described by the hagen poiseuille equation 1 u g υ r 2 8 δ h l e where u m s is the average water flow rate g n kg is the acceleration of gravity υ m 2 s is the kinematic viscosity r m is the pore radius δ h l e is the dimensionless hydraulic gradient δ h m is the hydraulic head difference and l e m is the real water flow path the contribution of full pores of radius r r d r to water content θ can be expressed as mualem 1976 mualem and dagan 1978 2 d θ f r d r where r m is the pore radius and f r is the volume pore distribution function the elementary pore contribution to the water flow rate can be expressed as 3 d v u f r d r u d θ then integrating dv over the entire pore radius range gives the total water flow rate v m s in the soil gates and lietz 1950 as 4 v θ u r min r θ u d v r min r θ u u d θ where r θ u m is the pore radius corresponding to the unfrozen water content θ u and r min m is the minimum pore radius corresponding to the minimum unfrozen water content θ min substituting eq 1 into eq 4 gives 5 v θ u g 8 υ δ h l e r min r θ u r 2 d θ the maximum unfrozen pore radius in frozen soil can be estimated by the gibbs thomson equation mitchell et al 2008 bai et al 2018 6 r g γ sl l f ρ i t m t m t k cos α sl where r g m is the gibbs thomson radius γ sl kj m 2 is the solid liquid interfacial free energy and α sl deg ree is the solid liquid contact angle l f kj kg is the latent heat of fusion ρ i kg m 3 is the density of ice t m k is the freezing temperature of bulk water t k k is the temperature in kelvin and t m t j k is the depression in freezing point it should be noted that cos α sl 1 is often adopted dash et al 1995 ishizaki et al 1996 watanabe and flury 2008 watanabe and wake 2008 the gibbs thomson equation indicates that the larger water filled pores freeze first the real water flow path can be expressed as 7 l e τ l where l m is the straight line distance over which the head drop occurs and τ is the dimensionless tortuosity substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 5 gives 8 v θ u g 8 υ τ 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 δ h l θ min θ u d θ t 2 g 8 υ τ 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 δ h l 0 θ u d θ t 2 where t c is the depression in the freezing point the value of which is equal to t m t j k to solve eq 8 the temperature t should be expressed as a function of unfrozen water content by means of sfcc it should be noted that compared with the water flow rate at the minimum and maximum water unfrozen content the water flow rate at the minimum water unfrozen content can be ignored hu et al 2020 comprehensively summarized past expressions for sfcc in which the θ u α t β was adopted in this study where α and β are fitting parameters the total water flow rate can also be expressed by darcy s law 9 v k δ h l where v m s is the seepage velocity and k m s is the hydraulic conductivity comparing eq 8 with eq 9 the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil can be expressed as 10 k θ u g 8 υ τ 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 0 θ u d θ t 2 let θ u θ sat then the saturated hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 11 k sat g 8 υ τ 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 where θ sat is the critical saturated water content corresponding to the maximum freezing temperature at which the water starts to freeze into ice it should be noted that the tortuosity varies with unfrozen water content and kinematic viscosity varies with the temperature thus eqs 10 and 11 can be revised as 12 k θ u g 8 υ t u τ θ u 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 0 θ u d θ t 2 13 k sat g 8 υ t s τ θ sat 2 γ sl t m l f ρ i cos α sl 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 where τ θ s and τ θ u are the tortuosity at water content of θ sat and θ u respectively υ t s and υ t u are the kinematic viscosity at the temperature associated with the water content of θ sat and θ u respectively combining eqs 12 and 13 the relative hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 14 k r θ u k θ u k sat υ t s τ θ sat υ t u τ θ u 0 θ u d θ t 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 then the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil can be rewritten as 15 k θ u k sat υ t s τ θ sat υ t u τ θ u 0 θ u d θ t 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 the kinematic viscosity is defined as 16 υ μ ρ w where μ pa s and ρ w kg m 3 are the dynamic viscosity and density of water respectively the dynamic viscosity thomas and sansom 1995 and the density of water khan 2000 can be expressed as 17 μ 0 6612 t 229 1 562 18 ρ w 916 5 83 39 e 5 94697 745 5 t 273 e 1623 553 t where t k is the absolute temperature the three tortuosity formulations for unsaturated unfrozen soil were applied to the saturated frozen soil with the same liquid water content based on the similarity of pore size distribution between the two soils chen and zhang 2020 fatt and dykstra 1951 suggested that the tortuosity is inversely proportional to r b and can be written as fatt and dykstra 1951 mualem and dagan 1978 klute and mualem 1986 19 τ f b r b 2 where b and b are constants it should be noted that b 1 2 given by fatt and dykstra 1951 was adopted in this study therefore considering the tortuosity τ f eq 15 can be revised as 20 k θ u k sat υ t s υ t u 0 θ u d θ t 2 b 0 θ sat d θ t 2 b it can be found from eq 20 that the parameter b is eliminated burdine 1953 introduced θ 2 to represent the influence of tortuosity on the hydraulic conductivity mualem and dagan 1978 assouline and or 2013 21 τ b θ 2 θ u θ r θ sat θ r 2 where θ is the standard volumetric water content and θ r cm 3 cm 3 is the residual water content then eq 15 can be revised as 22 k θ u θ 2 υ t s υ t u k sat 0 θ u d θ t 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 additionally comiti and renaud 1989 considered that the tortuosity can be expressed as a function of porosity as 23 τ y 1 0 41 ln 1 n where n is the soil porosity which can be approximately equal to the volume unfrozen water content then eq 15 can be revised as 24 k θ u 1 0 41 ln 1 θ sat 1 0 41 ln 1 θ u υ t s υ t u k sat 0 θ u d θ t 2 0 θ sat d θ t 2 eqs 20 22 and 24 indicate that the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil can be determined only by sfcc and the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the calculation process is just a simple integration of sfcc with different unfrozen water content the model not considering the influence of tortuosity on hydraulic conductivity is defined as model i and the models considering the tortuosity of τ f τ b and τ y are defined as models ii iii and iv respectively which was used to discuss the influence of tortuosity on the hydraulic conductivity 3 results 3 1 soil samples to illustrate the model performance eight existing experimental cases williams and burt 1974 burt and williams 1976 horiguchi and miller 1980 tokoro et al 2010 watanabe and osada 2016 zhang et al 2016 were adopted in this study all the experiments reported the saturated hydraulic conductivity and sfcc which are required in model calculation table 1 summarized some physical properties of the soil samples including the soil types saturated water content θ sat saturated hydraulic conductivities k sat cm s bulk density ρ g cm 3 m cl m si and m sa are the clay d 0 002 mm the silt 0 002 d 0 05 mm and the sand 0 05 d 2 mm mass fractions 3 2 soil freezing characteristic curve fig 2 gives the sfccs of the soil samples as shown the shape of the sfccs are different the result indicates that the soils have different pore size distributions ming et al 2020 which resulting in the difference of the hydraulic conductivity the shape of the sfccs are controlled by soil type initial water content and dry density as is the hydraulic conductivity additionally it should be noted that the sfccs of carleton silt oneida clayey silt manchester silt tibet plateau silty clay and dl silt are expressed by the mass water content while the sfccs of tottori dune sand fujinomori silt loam and andisol sandy loam are expressed by the volumetric water content both kinds of sfccs can be used in the model calculation 3 3 calculated pore radius kinematic viscosity and tortuosity fig 3 a presents the pore radius of frozen soil at different temperatures which was calculated by eq 6 as shown the pore radius decreases linearly with the decreasing temperature in the log log coordinate the pores can be divided into the macropores r 25 nm mesopores 1 nm r 25 nm and micropores r 1 nm mitchell et al 2008 the critical temperature for dividing the macropores and mesopores can be determined from fig 3 a the value of which is about 1 01 it can be found that the soil pores are mainly composed of macropores and mesopores and the macropores will be frozen when the temperature drops to 1 01 fig 3 b presents the kinematic viscosity of unfrozen water at different temperatures which was calculated by eqs 16 18 as shown the kinematic viscosity increases slightly as the temperature decreases resulting in a decrease of water flow rate with decreasing temperature however it can be seen that as the temperature decreases from 0 to 10 the kinematic viscosity increases from 1 8 10 6 m2 s to 2 7 10 6 m2 s which indicates that the change in kinematic viscosity caused by temperature has little influence on the predicted hydraulic conductivity fig 4 presents the tortuosity of models ii iii and iv which was calculated by eqs 19 21 and 23 respectively as shown the tortuosity increases with decreasing temperature and unfrozen water content additionally the tortuosity τ f and τ b increases by several orders of magnitude with decreasing temperature and unfrozen water content while the tortuosity τ y only increases within one order of magnitude this result indicates that the selection of tortuosity has an obvious effect on the predicted hydraulic conductivity besides it should be noted that eq 15 can be reduced to k θ u k sat υ t s τ θ sat υ t u τ θ u θ u θ sat ξ where the ξ is a constant parameter the value of which is determined by the fitting equation θ u α t β of sfcc it can be found that this form of the proposed model is similar to that of the model proposed by chen and zhang 2020 however the different is that the parameter ξ in the model of chen and zhang 2020 is determined by the spsd chen et al 2021 pointed out that the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils would be better calculated through the sfcc rather than the spsd since the sfcc is more related to the hydraulic conductivity than the spsd therefore the proposed model would perform better than the model of chen and zhang 2020 and this comparison will be discussed in section 4 3 table 2 summarized the values of parameter ζ 3 4 predicted hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil fig 5 presents the predicted hydraulic conductivities of models i ii iii and iv for the eight saturated frozen soil samples respectively as shown the hydraulic conductivity of the four models changes similarly with the temperature and unfrozen water content that is the hydraulic conductivity decreases significantly with the decreasing temperature and unfrozen water content however it would be better to establish the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil and unfrozen water content instead of temperature for one thing the hydraulic conductivity of soils is affected directly by unfrozen water content instead of temperature since the temperature cannot directly change the pore structural characteristic of the porous material without water for another thing given the similarity of saturated frozen soil and unsaturated unfrozen soil and the fact that hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated unfrozen soil expressed as a function of liquid water content will not be affected by the hysteresis effect of swcc klute and mualem 1986 the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil expressed as a function of unfrozen water content is not expected to be affected by the hysteresis effect of sfcc 4 discussion 4 1 model verification to evaluate the model performance the hydraulic conductivities predicted by models i ii iii and iv were compared with the experimental values and the results were present in fig 6 the scatter points represent the experimental hydraulic conductivities and the lines represent the predicted hydraulic conductivities as shown in fig 6 a almost all the scatter points locate below the lines which show that the model i overestimates the tested values moreover this phenomenon was found to become obvious with the decrease in unfrozen water content which shows the necessity to consider the tortuosity in the model calculation as shown in fig 6 c almost all the scatter points are very close to the lines which shows the excellent performance of model ii the results indicate that predicted hydraulic conductivities considering tortuosity τ f b r b 2 were in excellent agreement with the tested data as shown in fig 6 e most of the scatter points are close to the lines and a few scatter points are far from the lines which shows the good performance of model iii the result indicates that predicted the hydraulic conductivities considering tortuosity τ b θ 2 were in good agreement with the tested data furthermore it can be found that the predictions of model iii generate an inflection point at very small unfrozen water content which was caused by tortuosity θ 2 however this phenomenon can be ignored since the unfrozen water content at this time is so minimal as shown in fig 6 g almost all the scatter points locate below the lines which shows that model iv overestimates the tested values the result indicates that the predicted hydraulic conductivities considering tortuosity τ y 1 0 41 ln 1 n overestimate the tested data the model performance was further illustrated by comparing the predicted hydraulic conductivity and tested data in the log k t vs log k p coordinates the results of which are shown in fig 6 b 6 d 6 f and 6 h where k f and k p are the tested and predicted hydraulic conductivities respectively it should be noted that the black lines green lines and red lines represent the cases that the predictions are equal to the tested values the predictions are equal to the tested values plus or minus the accepted experimental error of 2 10 n where n is the order of magnitude of the tested value and the predictions are equal to the tested values plus or minus one order of magnitude respectively the gray zone represents the acceptable test error zone and the pink zone represents an order of magnitude error zone as shown in fig 6 b only a few scatter points fall within the acceptable test error zone while most of the scatter points fall outside an order of magnitude error zone as shown in fig 6 d almost all the scatter points fall in the acceptable test error zone as shown in fig 6 f most of the scatter points fall within the acceptable test error zone and only a few scatter points fall outside an order of magnitude error zone as shown in fig 6 h similar results as those shown in fig 6 b can be observed since the tortuosity considered in model iv is small in conclusion the influence of tortuosity on the hydraulic conductivity cannot be ignored and the tortuosity of τ f b r b 2 performs best τ b θ 2 follows and τ y 1 0 41 ln 1 n performs worst the root mean square errors rmses of the four models were calculated as 25 rmse i 1 n ln k p ln k t 2 n where i is the count of the current data points and n is the number of data points the calculated values of rmse are summarized in table 3 as shown the rmses of model ii are lowest among the models followed by model iii model i and iv are highest which indicates that model ii performs best among the models 4 2 model valuation table 4 summarizes the previous hydraulic conductivity models for frozen soil based on the model similarity the models can be classified into macroscopic model statistical model and fractal model three classes the macroscopic model and statistical model have been discussed in the introduction the fractal model has a lower temperature limit for model validity and mainly depends on the throat radius which may result in underestimating the hydraulic conductivity compared with the macroscopic model the model proposed in this study has a strict derivation process without applying the clapeyron equation or assuming that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is equal to that of saturated frozen soil compared with the statistical model the proposed model does not need to divide the sfcc or swcc so that the model predictions are not affected by the divided unfrozen water content besides the proposed model is simple smooth and timesaving in that only a simple integration of sfcc at different water contents is required compared with the fractal model the proposed model considers the contribution of all the unfrozen pores and have no lower temperature limit for model validity however there also exists some model limitations first the model performance will be influenced by the tortuosity which is uncertain second the model does not consider the contribution of the unfrozen water film on the hydraulic conductivity which may result in underestimating the hydraulic conductivity nevertheless the influence was not expected to be pronounced owing to the small amount of unfrozen water film third the model does not consider the influence of the transverse ice lens on the hydraulic conductivity which may result in overestimating the hydraulic conductivity additionally table 4 summarizes the different parameters required in the above mentioned models to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil it is necessary to explain the role of the parameters in the models in the model of tarnawski and wagner 1996 the parameter b was calculated by the spsd the unfrozen water content was estimated by the swcc and spsd actually if the sfcc is known the unfrozen water content can be obtained directly from the sfcc in the model of azmatch et al 2012 the unfrozen water content was obtained from the sfcc the suction ψ was converted into the temperature through the clapeyron equation in the model of chen and zhang 2020 the parameter b was calculated by the spsd the unfrozen water content was obtained from the sfcc in the model of weigert and schmidt 2005 the liquid water content interval δ θ x was obtained from the swcc the pore radius r x was calculated by the kelvin equation in the model of watanabe and flury 2008 the number of capillaries n j was calculated from the swcc the radius of unfrozen capillaries r j was calculated by the kelvin equation the radius of the pore ice r ij was calculated by the gibbs thomson equation in the model of ming et al 2020 the unfrozen water content interval δ θ j was obtained from the sfcc the radius of the capillaries r j was calculated by the gibbs thomson equation and the unfrozen water film thickness was estimated by the van der waals forces in the model of chen et al 2019 the pore size dimension d was calculated by the volumetric unfrozen water content obtained from the sfcc the maximum pore radius r max was calculated by the gibbs thomson equation in this study the relation between temperature and unfrozen water content were obtained from the sfcc 4 3 model comparison to further evaluate the model proposed in this study the performance of which was compared with that of the models of chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 it should be noted that the model of chen and zhang 2020 was not discussed in this study which can be attributed to that this model belongs to the macroscopic model additionally the model of ming et al 2020 is similar to that of weigert and schmidt 2005 and watanabe and flury 2008 thus the latter were also not discussed in this study fig 7 and fig 8 present the model predictions and performance of chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 respectively table 5 summarized the rmses and armses average root mean square errors of the three models as shown the tortuous capillary model of ming et al 2020 performs best followed by the model ii of this study the straight capillary model of ming et al 2020 the model iii of this study the fractal model of chen et al 2019 the model iv of this study the model i of this study performs worst but in fact the model ii of this study among the models performs best since the models of chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 failed to correctly predict the tested hydraulic conductivity of tottori dune sand fujinomori silt loam and andisol sandy loam the phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that chen and zhang 2020 and ming et al 2020 models results are more sensitive to the soil freezing characteristic curves sfccs that is if the sfccs given in the references are a little inaccurate the models will overestimate or underestimate the measured hydraulic conductivity in this case the relative hydraulic conductivity would be better to be used which makes the model more predictive the reason is that with the help of the ratio relation of relative hydraulic conductivity and the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity the proposed model can weaken the influence of soil freezing characteristic curve on the calculation results of hydraulic conductivity so that the model calculation results are more accurate and the model has wider application that is the relative hydraulic conductivity makes the model results have to change from saturated hydraulic conductivity which makes the model results do not deviate from the measured values from the beginning the relative hydraulic conductivity is the same as the matching factor kunze et al 1968 which is used to correct the difference between the measured value and the calculated value moreover it can be found that the model predictions of chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 without introducing the relative hydraulic conductivity cannot change from the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity of unfrozen soil resulting in incomplete prediction results additionally compared with the model of ming et al 2020 model the model proposed in this study is smoother which makes the numerical saturated unsaturated flow problems easier to converge van genuchten 1980 additionally it should be pointed out that the model proposed in this study considered three tortuosity models while the models of the chen et al 2019 and ming et al 2020 just considered one tortuosity the model of chen et al 2019 considered the tortuosity τ b while the model of ming et al 2020 considered the tortuosity τ y it can be found that if the model of chen et al 2019 does not consider the influence of the tortuosity the model will overestimate the tested data while the model of ming et al 2020 can fit the tested data well even the tortuosity is not considered therefore this comparison indicates that the change of tortuosity of frozen soil with temperature have a critical influence on the hydraulic conductivity 5 conclusions this study proposed a simple smooth hydraulic conductivity model for saturated frozen soil based on sfcc the model performance was illustrated by the eight existing experimental cases the major conclusions are summarized as follows 1 a simple integral formula for hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil was derived based on the relationship between the sfcc and psdc the gibbs thomson equation defining the pore radius in frozen soil and the introduction of the tortuosity function 2 the model can be applied when the saturated hydraulic conductivity and sfcc are available moreover the model calculation process is quite simple and timesaving in that only a simple integration of sfcc at different unfrozen water content levels was required 3 the influence of tortuosity on hydraulic conductivity cannot be ignored since the model not considering the tortuosity performs worst additionally the model considering the tortuosity of τ f b r b 2 performs best 4 the model was further compared with the two previous models the results of which indicate that the proposed model has better predictive ability and smoother hydraulic conductivity curve credit authorship

4091,extensive construction of dams and increased human activities have greatly accelerated the homogenization of regional biotic communities the cumulative effects caused by dams and anthropogenic nutrient loading on the temporal turnover of phytoplankton communities are largely unexplored but of critical conservation importance for understanding reservoir ecosystem functioning here biodiversity patterns in eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities were investigated in a large reservoir over the last 80 years by sequencing dna preserved in sediment cores the succession of eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities recovered by sequencing of rrna gene markers exhibited a high degree of consistency with both showing evidence for significant changes in the 1970 s and 2000 s based on univariate and multivariate analyses temporal turnover indicated a marked loss of the taxonomic and phylogenetic structures of communities which became more similar through time due to the homogenous reservoir environment and concomitant ecological pressures from human activities specifically temporal homogenization of algal communities could be attributed to the damming of the reservoir in the 1960s that then affected the hydrological conditions of the reservoir and nutrient retention with increased anthropogenic nutrient loading favoring the growth of specific taxa like microcystis as evidenced from random forest machine learning and ecological network analyses thus these results demonstrate accelerated homogenization of algal communities in the reservoir due to the impacts of damming and nutrient enrichment these observations also call for a need to develop conservation strategies to maintain ecosystem resilience and prevent harmful blooms in reservoir systems keywords homogenization cyanobacteria eukaryotic algae eutrophication lake sediment sedimentary dna 1 introduction biological homogenization refers to the processes in which variations in taxonomic genetic or functional diversity are gradually lost due to species invasions and extinctions across spatial and temporal scales mckinney and lockwood 1999 olden and rooney 2006 petsch et al 2016 increasing evidence has demonstrated that homogenization of earth s biota is accelerating due to human activities and climate change which may lead to reduced resistance or resilience of ecosystems the loss of ecosystem functions deterioration of ecosystem goods and services and higher overall vulnerability to diseases garcia et al 2014 capinha et al 2015 knop 2016 monchamp et al 2018 consequently biological homogenization is a major threat to global terrestrial marine and freshwater ecosystems and has resulted in increased concern by researchers rahel 2000 capinha et al 2015 magurran et al 2015 keck et al 2020 fricke and svenning 2020 investigations of biotic homogenization have thus far focused on human activities i e intensification of trade and transportation that diminish natural barriers and that increase the prevalence of species introductions over time causing species compositional homogenization across historical biogeographic regions of terrestrial ecosystems capinha et al 2015 knop 2016 finderup et al 2019 fricke and svenning 2020 several studies have also demonstrated that environmental drivers influence the taxonomic homogenization of aquatic ecosystems including for communities of amphibians fish micro eukaryotes and water birds rahel 2000 magurran et al 2015 keck et al 2020 however the responses of phytoplankton diversity to environment changes in long term dynamics have been little studied monchamp et al 2018 phytoplankton are an extremely diverse polyphyletic group of microscopic photosynthetic eukaryotic algal protists and cyanobacteria and are the dominant primary producers of aquatic ecosystems where they play critical roles in transmitting energy and matter up food chains strom 2008 righetti et al 2019 eutrophication and global warming have favored the rapid growth of phytoplankton in lake and reservoir ecosystems leading to dramatic changes in algal community compositions including the dominance of potentially harmful cyanobacteria in addition to increasing frequencies of harmful bloom formation events that can threaten public health and aquatic ecosystems tse et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a thus understanding the mechanisms that influence algal community responses at the structural level to multiple external stressors is critical for immediately managing increased homogenization of aquatic ecosystem and maintain the stability of ecosystem functions and services righetti et al 2019 a few studies have attempted to reconstruct the historical community compositions of lake phytoplankton by sequencing sediment dna when long term monitoring data are not available tse et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a of these studies homogenization of cyanobacterial communities over the last century has been observed in ten european peri alpine lakes and is thought to have been triggered by climate change and eutrophication monchamp et al 2018 although the study focuses on spatial homogenization of cyanobacterial community from biogeographic perspective the patterns of phytoplankton community succession in long term time series particularly in lake and reservoir ecosystem have not been investigated reservoirs are artificial lakes and are hotspots of biodiversity loss due to associated hydrological alteration nutrient retention and habitat fragmentation poff et al 2007 stone 2016 barbarossa et al 2020 over 70 000 large dams are present globally and 57 percent of the earth s seasonal freshwater storage variability occurs in human managed reservoirs maavara et al 2015 cooley et al 2021 china is the most extensive dam building country globally and has more than 87 000 reservoirs of various sizes with a total water capacity of 706 billion m3 that provides the major sources of drinking water for chinese citizens shang et al 2019 the frequency and intensity of phytoplankton blooms have become increasingly severe in reservoirs in recent decades and are often associated with the dominance of only a few harmful taxa monchamp et al 2018 liu et al 2019 nevertheless it is unclear if the impoundment of dammed rivers accelerates the temporal homogenization of algal communities in the reservoir leading to dominance by some key tolerant taxon and subsequent decreased ecosystem resistance and resilience along with bloom formation and other ecological catastrophes in the present study dna from eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria were selectively amplified and sequenced from an archive comprising a finely laminated well dated sediment core from the yuqiao reservoir which represents a typical chinese reservoir the community structures and biodiversity patterns of eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial assemblages were then reconstructed for the last 80 years we hypothesized that dam construction and nutrient enrichment induces significant changes in eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities thus accelerating potential algal homogenization over broad temporal scales the main objectives of this study were to 1 explore the temporal homogenization of algal communities that is driven by human activities 2 identify the key dam tolerant taxa using machine learning and network analysis and 3 evaluate relationships of ecosystem resilience resistance with the homogenization of algae communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the yuqiao reservoir 40 02 n 117 34 e is one of the most important large reservoirs in northern china and is the major water source for tianjin city s drinking water for 15 61 million people the reservoir comprises a catchment area of 2060 km2 with a total storage capacity of 15 59 108 m3 and a surface area of 86 8 km2 fig 1 zhang et al 2019 the reservoir was built in 1959 to solve the drinking water shortage problem in tianjin and became an integral part of luanhe tianjin water diversion project after 1983 zhang et al 2019 the aquatic ecosystem of the reservoir has been seriously impaired over the last two decades by recurrent blooms of harmful cyanobacterial taxa like microcystis and planktothrix rubescens leading to serious threats for regional drinking water safety huo et al 2018 2 2 sediment coring dating and proxy analysis sampling was conducted in the center of the reservoir in april 2018 where stable sedimentary conditions exist fig 1 three sediment cores were collected at the sampling site with one used for molecular analyses and one each for physical and chemical analyses the sediment cores are described in detail in the supporting information the specific activities of 137cs were detected using gamma ray spectrometry ortec usa on a dspec jr 2 0 multi channel spectrometer coupled to a gwl 120 15 well detector sediment accumulation rates of 0 0553 g m 2 y 1 calculated by 137cs dating methods were used to calibrate the dating results fig s1 other paleo physicochemical and biological variables including analytical methods and vertical profiles are described in greater detail in the supporting information fig s2 2 3 molecular analyses 2 3 1 dna extraction strict laboratory procedures were applied to ensure the validity of the molecular sequencing data from sedimentary archives all instruments used for dna extraction and pcr amplification were scrubbed with 6 sodium hypochlorite and placed in a laminar flow hood under a uv lamp for at least 30 min prior to use dna was extracted from 0 5 g homogenized sediment from each stratum using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio carlsbad usa according to the manufacturer s protocols a negative control for every six samples was carried through the dna extraction procedure and treated in the same manner as the samples except for the use of pure water instead of sediment samples dna extracts were quantified using a nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa all dna blank controls did not exhibit obvious dna presence thereby confirming a low risk of external dna contamination during extraction procedures 2 3 2 pcr amplification two sets of primers were used to amplify rrna genes for eukaryotic algae ea the v7 region of eukaryotic 18s rrna genes was amplified using the pcr primers 960f and nsr1438 resulting in the amplification of a 260 bp fragment capo et al 2017 for cyanobacteria cya cyanobacterial specific primers cya359f and cya781r were used to amplify an approximately 400 bp fragment from the v3 and v4 hypervariable regions of 16s rrna genes tse et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2020 after dna extraction two pairs of primers shown in table s1 were used to construct next generation sequencing libraries using a two step amplification procedure first the fragments were amplified using the ea and cya primer pairs followed by purification with an agencourt ampure xp purification kit beckman coulter inc the purified products were then amplified using primers with illumina specific adapters attached along with a unique sample barcode pcr reactions in the first step were performed in a total 50 µl volume containing 10 µl of buffer 2 µl of q5 high fidelity dna polymerase and 1 mm of each dntp primers were added to concentrations of 3 µm step 1 and 2 5 µm step 2 the amplification conditions included an initial denaturation at 94 c for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 1 s at 94 c 20 s at the respective annealing temperature ea 55 c cya 60 c and 30 s at 72 c all followed by a final extension at 72 c for 5 min ibrahim et al 2020 pcr products were purified with an omega d6492 02 cycle pure kit and concentrations were measured on a nanodrop 2000 instrument amplicons were then sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina usa 2 3 3 bioinformatics processing paired end reads were merged using flash v 1 2 7 http ccb jhu edu software flash specifying a minimum overlap length of 10 bp and a maximum mismatch ratio of the overlap region as 0 2 magoč and salzberg 2011 merged raw tags were then filtered and clustered as follows 1 merged tags with more than six mismatches to primer sequences were discarded using the fastx toolkit 2 tags with an average quality score 20 over a 50 bp sliding window were truncated using trimmomatic http www usadellab org cms page trimmomatic and tags shorter than 75 of all tag lengths after quality control were removed bolger et al 2014 3 the uchime tool in mothur http drive5 com uchime was used to remove chimeric sequences edgar et al 2011 4 quality filtered sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 nucleotide identity threshold using the qiime uclust module otus with relative abundances 0 005 among all sequences were removed from the dataset to limit possible confounding influences of these artefactual sequences otus were then taxonomically classified by searching against the silva databases release119 http www arb silva de using the rdp classifier within qiime caporaso et al 2010 otus affiliated with non eukaryotic algal eukaryotes e g metazoans embryophytes fungi and protozoa and non cyanobacteria bacteria were removed from each library ibrahim et al 2020 rarefied otu tables of ea and cya abundances were then used to estimate the α diversity of the eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities based on several metrics including otu richness the shannon diversity index and the pielou index using the vegan package for r jost and tungurahua 2006 2 3 4 abundances of mcya genes the mcya cd 1f and 1r pcr primers were designed to target mcya genes within cyanobacterial genera that can produce microcystins including planktothrix microcystis and dolichospermum among others tse et al 2018 detailed mcya amplification methods were previously described zhang et al 2021a briefly pcr products were visualized using a 1 agarose gel with sybr safe dna gel stain and abundances were quantified with an abi viia 7 real time pcr system applied biosystems california usa 2 4 statistical analyses 2 4 1 cluster analysis temporal variation in the relative abundances of ea and cya taxonomic groups were plotted using tilia v2 2 1 and clustered using constrained incremental sums of squares cluster analysis coniss to further evaluate the timing and hierarchy of significant changes in community structures multivariate regression tree mrt analysis was conducted using the mvpart package for r de ath 2002 the results from the two clustering techniques coniss and mrt were combined to identify significant change points in ea and cya community structures based on taxonomic groups and otus respectively both the common and rare otu subsets of the ea and cya communities were analyzed among the historical time period phases identified within the mrt analysis common otus were defined as those found in all samples from a given time period while rare otus are those present in less than 25 of the samples for a given time period monchamp et al 2018 2 4 2 taxonomic diversity analysis to track changes among ea and cya community structures in different historical periods ordinations were performed after applying rank order transformations on the two otu datasets using the metamds function in the r package vegan bray curtis relative abundances of otus and jaccard presence absence of otus pairwise distance metrics were used to construct nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds ordinations permutational multivariate analyses of variance permanova and analysis of similarities anosim tests were used to evaluate differences in community composition based on bray curtis dissimilarities over the last 80 years using 999 permutations distance based redundancy analysis dbrda was used with the rda function of the vegan package to investigate significant factors that explained variation in ea and cya community structures following principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix 2 4 3 phylogenetic diversity analysis the representative sequences for each eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial otu were aligned with the clusterw algorithm and used to infer a phylogeny using maximum likelihood ml methods in the mega software package sudhir et al 2018 community variation was then estimated using the phylogenetic based unweighted unifrac distance metric and visualized using nmds in the phylomeasures and vegan packages for r differences in the phylogenetic based community variation among the three periods were then evaluated with permanova and anosim tests conducted with unweighted unifrac dissimilarities and 999 permutations in addition the phylogenetic diversity pd faith 1992 of the ea and cy communities was calculated using the phylogenetic tree and with the picante package for r the observed phylogenetic diversity values were compared with the predicted values from a random model using the standardized effect size of pd measurement with the ses pd function in picante runs 999 iterations 1000 2 4 4 random forest modelling to identify key otus associated with the homogenization of ea and cya communities the relative abundances of ea and cya otus were regressed against the concentrations of sedimentary tp tn and toc using the rf machine learning algorithm to establish six models to correlate ea and cya composition with nutrient variables random forest rf classifications were used to identify the ea and cya otus that exhibited the most sensitive responses to environmental factors i e sedimentary tp tn and toc using the randomforest package for r first a subset of the dataset was used for training and was obtained by randomly extracting sample points from the overall dataset classification and regression trees cart were then trained with each subset training dataset the final predictive rf result is then the mean value of all cart prediction results ranked otus based on order of feature importance were then determined over 500 iterations the otus considered important were identified using 10 fold cross validation with five replicates 2 4 5 co occurrence network analysis non random co occurrence patterns of ea and cya communities were evaluated with the checkerboard score c score metric under a null model that preserved differences among otus barberán et al 2012 c scores from 10 000 simulations were compared against those for the observed communities two co occurrence networks were then constructed by calculating correlation coefficients based on otu relative abundances in addition to an association metric based on the presence absence of otus the abundance based co occurrence network was inferred from a spearman s correlation matrix wherein co occurrences were identified as those observed with robust correlations correlation coefficient ρ 0 5 and were statistically significant p 0 01 junker and schreiber 2008 to reduce the probability of false positive results p values were adjusted using the false discovery rate fdr correction eight co occurrence networks were constructed and visualized using the gephi software program v 0 9 2 and the fruchterman reingold algorithm including ea and cya community networks for the whole study period and the different historical periods to evaluate the topological properties of co occurrence networks network metrics were evaluated that are relevant for ecological community roles and functioning faust and raes 2012 including average degree diameter density weighted modularity clustering coefficients and average path length in addition association metric based co occurrence networks were constructed as previously described zhang et al 2021 briefly the skewness of the otu frequency distribution was measured to assess asymmetry in the frequency distribution of otu co occurrences clustering coefficients were calculated to describe the realized fraction of all possible co occurrences between otus linked to a common network 3 results 3 1 composition of historical eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities multiple methodological precautions were employed to achieve robust and accurate sedimentary dna profiles see supplementary information for details as based on previous studies describing methods for sequencing sedimentary dna from well dated lake reservoir cores in order to investigate historical algal communities when long term monitoring data is lacking capo et al 2017 monchamp et al 2018 tse et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a the total reservoir core inventories from 21 sediment layers comprised 978 755 and 1 624 429 micro eukaryote and cyanobacterial rrna sequence reads assigned to 824 and 676 otus respectively after amplification with taxa specific primer sets otus affiliated with non eukaryotic algae and non cyanobacteria were removed from the respective libraries leading to a total of 185 647 and 1 178 159 remaining reads that clustered into 148 and 81 eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial otus respectively table s2 no evidence was observed for differential dna degradation among taxa based on the numbers of otus and sequences that were recovered fig 2 table s2 combined with previous studies focused on long term dynamics of lacustrine biodiversity using sedimentary dna the decay of dna is likely a marginal confounding variable and the differential preservation of dna across layers is unlikely to significantly affect the results reported in this study capo et al 2017 keck et al 2020 ibrahim et al 2020 diverse communities of ea and cya were identified and comprised nine eukaryotic algal phyla and three orders of cyanobacteria table 1 fig 2 adl et al 2019 chlorophyceae was the most abundant eukaryotic phytoplankton group 19 followed by chrysophyceae 15 1 mediophyceae 14 06 and bacillariophyceae 11 57 synechococcus and microcystis were the most abundant cyanobacteria with relative abundances of 57 39 and 30 42 respectively table 1 significant changes in ea and cya community compositions were both detected in the 1970 s and the 2000 s based on coniss analysis of taxonomic variation fig 2 a simultaneous increase in the relative abundances of florideophyceae was observed in ea data set after the 1970s with a concomitant gradual disappearance of cylindrospermopsis and dolichospermum in the cya dataset in addition the relative abundances of the ea group mediophyceae and microcystis cyanobacteria markedly increased after the 2000 s fig 2 thus the three successional stages of the algal community were the 1930 s 1970 s the 1970 s 2000 s and after the 2000 s which are consistent with variation in sediment physicochemical indices fig 2 fig s2 nutrient tn tp and toc levels and primary productivity chl a and β carotene indices were low in the 1930 s 1970 s but gradually increased in the 1970 s 2000 s then rapidly increasing after the 2000 s fig s2 3 2 temporal changes in eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial community diversity α diversity measurements for the ea and cya communities as measured by otu richness the shannon diversity index and the pielou evenness index did not exhibit systematic decreases across time fig 3 estimated richness varied over time ranging from 38 to 113 otus for ea and from 30 to 57 otus for cya while the slopes of the long term relationships between otu richness and time were positive for both ea and cya communities fig 3a ea and cya community otu richness in the second historical phase 1970 s 2000 s were significantly higher than in the first stage 1930 s 1970 s fig 3d p 0 01 in addition the shannon diversity index of cya communities decreased among the three periods while that of ea communities increased from the first period to the second period and then remained at the relatively high level in the third period 2000 s thus the overall slope of the long term relationship between shannon diversity and time was negative for cya and positive for ea fig 3 the pielou evenness of the ea and cya communities both notably decreased across the three historical periods fig 3 p 0 01 the numbers of common otus i e found in all samples for a given period increased during the three periods conversely the number of rare otus for ea and cya communities i e found in 25 of samples for a given period decreased during the three historical phases fig 3 homogenization of ea and cya communities was observed based on both taxonomic bray curtis and jaccard and phylogenetic unweighted unifrac community metrics in addition to multivariate beta diversity analysis conducted using taxonomic based bray curtis and jaccard distances fig 4 figs s4 s5 mrt analysis results of ea and cya community composition was consistent with those from coniss analysis providing grouping information for beta diversity analyses fig 4 nmds ordinations of bray curtis jaccard and unweighted unifrac distances provided similar results suggesting a strong reduction in temporal beta diversity for both ea and cya communities as evinced by reduced sample dispersion ellipses among the three historical phases fig 4 fig s4 fig s5 permanova tests confirmed that community groups from each period exhibited significantly different group centroids p 0 001 indeed dissimilarities based on bray curtis jaccard and unweighted unifrac distances were all significantly reduced in the three groups r 0 p 0 05 indicating decreased taxonomic and phylogenetic similarity of ea and cya communities along the temporal gradient representing the historical phases of the reservoir the observed changes in ea and cya community structure co occurred with decreased average dissimilarity across the three historical phases based on unweighted unifrac distances thereby suggesting a general homogenization of phylogenetic community structure over time surprisingly the faith s pd of the ea and cya communities did not exhibit decreasing temporal trends as expected fig s6 which may be due to increased diversity of phylogenetic tree branches accompanying increased otu richness over time in addition the standardized effect sizes of pd for the ea and cya communities were 0 fig s6 suggesting that the observed pd values were lower than expected at random implicating human activity disturbances in these non random patterns 3 3 key drivers and important taxa involved in historical state changes the temporal homogenization of ea and cya communities may be driven by many factors including damming increased nutrient loading and ongoing climate change dbrda ordination allowed finer resolved analysis of the correlations between otu datasets and measured environmental variables fig s7 the environmental variable dataset explained 76 1 and 88 0 of the variation in ea and cya community structures respectively the correlations of tp tn and toc parameters as noted by vector length were larger than that for annual average temperature and annual average daily precipitation suggesting that nutrient variables were more strongly correlated with variation in ea and cya communities than were meteorological factors almost all of the samples were distributed along the positive direction of tp tn and toc vectors after the 1970 s indicating that nutrient loads have increased since then due to dam retention and anthropogenic sources importantly these parameters eventually became the key factors that strongly affected ea and cya community compositional variation ibrahim et al 2020 the rf machine models explained 60 2 and 65 of ea and cya community variance related to tp concentrations along with 57 8 and 67 1 related to tn concentrations respectively and 60 1 and 69 7 related to toc concentrations respectively fig 5 fig s8 to identify important otus correlated with nutrient variables 10 fold cross validation with five replicates was conducted otus corresponding to the minimum cross validation error were considered as important otus within the range of nutrient concentration gradient in this study the relative abundance of the majority of key otus exhibited a positive correlation with nutrient concentration including otu40 mediophyceae otu48 bacillariophyceae and otu36 mediophyceae in the ea dataset and otu31 planktothrix otu21 pseudanabaena otu2 microcystis and otu52 synechococcus in the cya dataset and only the minority of key otus showed a hump shaped relationship between relative abundance and nutrient concentration e g otu67 chrysophyceae fig 5 fig s8 3 4 changes in the ecological co occurrence network of otus non random co occurrence patterns were observed across the entire ea and cya datasets based on checkerboard unit calculations and c scores of 7 79 for ea and 5 04 for cya fig s9 randomized matrices for eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities n 10 000 exhibited estimated mean c scores of 12 13 0 08 and 6 27 0 11 respectively which significantly differed from those of observed communities co occurrence network analysis based on cramér s association indicated decreased skewness values of otu associations from 0 51 to 1 33 for ea communities and from 0 63 to 1 28 for cya communities over the entire 1930 2018 study period fig 6 co occurrence networks based on spearman s correlations exhibited significant differences in topological structures among the three historical periods fig s10 table s3 the ea networks consisted of 148 nodes connected by 1 163 edges for the entire period 122 nodes connected by 595 edges for the 1930 s 1970 s 142 nodes connected by 759 edges for the 1970 s 2000 s and 122 nodes connected by 534 edges after the 2000 s the cya networks for the whole period comprised 79 nodes connected by 553 edges and 73 70 and 65 nodes for the three stages respectively that were connected by 357 263 and 232 edges respectively fig s10 table s3 the proportion of negative edges in the ea networks increased from 10 42 in the first period to 27 54 and 25 09 in the second and third stages respectively further the proportions of negative edges in the cya networks rose from 7 00 in the first period to 10 65 and 9 91 in the second and third stages respectively the otus with the highest degrees in the cya networks across the three stages were otu68 synechococcus otu17 cylindrospermopsis and otu2 microcystis with degrees of 27 18 and 15 respectively the clustering coefficients of the eight networks were all higher than 0 4 suggesting the presence of modular structures newman 2006 the weighted modularity values of the ea networks in the three historical stages were 0 753 1 349 and 1 574 respectively and the values for cya networks were 0 446 0 737 and 0 744 respectively overall the ea and cya networks comprised highly connected otus that were structured among densely connected modules forming clustered topologies as would be expected for real world networks that are more significantly clustered than random graphs table s3 4 discussion 4 1 homogenization of algal communities driven by damming and nutrient enrichment the composition of the ea and cya communities from the sedimentary archive in the yuqiao reservoir exhibited similar temporal progression throughout the last 80 years fig 2 univariate and multivariate analyses implied that the most significant shift in the communities occurred after damming in the 1970 s followed by additional shifts accompanying nutrient enrichment in the 2000 s fig 3 fig 4 observed changes in ea and cya community structures coincided with increased similarities among communities suggesting a general homogenization of the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of the communities over time i e a loss of β diversity dornelas et al 2014 monchamp et al 2018 systematic loss of α diversity was not detected for the ea and cya communities throughout the study period regardless of the α diversity metric being considered fig 3 these differences could be due to turnover metrics e g β diversity incorporating shifts in species composition and potentially providing more sensitive indicators of community change than do α diversity metrics dornelas et al 2014 the observed biotic homogenization is consistent with previous studies demonstrating homogenization of fish communities microbial decomposers and grassland plant and animal communities following increased human induced environmental pressures magurran et al 2015 gossner et al 2016 gonzález orozco et al 2016 a similar response was observed for european peri alpine lakes with phylogenetic homogenization of cyanobacterial communities among the ten lakes occurring over a century due to effects from climate change and eutrophication monchamp et al 2018 interactions between damming and nutrient enrichment likely play important roles in the ecosystem functioning of the reservoir study system according to the significant correlation between community structures and measured environmental variables fig s7 hydrologic regimes can affect phytoplankton biomass levels in addition to community structures via influences on photosynthetically active radiation and nutrient dynamics in water columns vanessa et al 2010 xu et al 2020 rivers are highly selective and heterogeneous environments where only a few phytoplankton taxa can achieve dominance including for instance benthic taxa that dominate fast flowing upstream sites while centric diatoms dominate turbulent and turbid midstream sites and coccal green algae dominate shallow downstream sites reynolds 2003 dam construction and reservoir impoundment can lead to increased water residence times improved light conditions increased nutrient retention and sediment trapping that amplify primary production activities and promote the succession of dominant phytoplankton from river dominant taxa i e diatoms and or dinoflagellates to lake dominant taxa i e chlorophyta and or cyanobacteria xiao et al 2011 xu et al 2020 consistent with the results of this study fig 2 numerous studies have demonstrated that homogenizing river flow regimes due to damming is an unfolding global problem and has been invoked as one of the reasons for declining freshwater biodiversity and particularly algal biodiversity poff et al 2007 maavara et al 2015 barbarossa et al 2020 phytoplankton successional patterns are primarily regulated by changes in available nutrients through time ibrahim et al 2020 river damming affects anthropogenic nutrient enrichment by trapping some nutrients in reservoirs and slowing the water flow maavara et al 2015 long term monitoring data has shown that tn and tp concentrations in the yuqiao reservoir have significantly increased since the 1980s with tn and tp concentrations reaching a maximum of 2 4 mg l 1 and 90 μg l 1 in 1994 respectively zhang et al 2019 the catchment comprises a traditional farming zone including approximately 39 22 farmland that leads to agricultural runoff as the main nutrient loading source into the reservoir huo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 paleolimnological proxy analysis also suggested that trophic state metrics e g sedimentary tn tp and toc concomitantly increase with increased primary productivity proxies e g sedimentary chl a and β carotene in the reservoir fig s2 indicating that nutrients promoted phytoplankton growth over time paerl huisman 2008 excess nutrient discharge can facilitate extreme phytoplankton overgrowth to the point of community suffocation liu et al 2019 as demonstrated by the occurrence of microcystis blooms in the reservoir during summers of recent years huo et al 2018 concomitantly eutrophication characteristics may filter out some taxa that are adapted to oligotrophic environments i e dinophyceae leading to dominance by nutrient tolerant taxa like chlorophyceae and most cyanobacteria capo et al 2017 keck et al 2020 in addition null modeling and ecological network analysis also provided evidence that the temporal turnover observed for ea and cya communities was primarily driven by human activities damming and subsequent nutrient enrichment rather than via ecological drift fig 6 fig s9 overall the temporal homogenization of phytoplankton communities can arise due to reduced environmental heterogeneity that is linked to external forcing like eutrophication and damming thereby selecting for a reduced diversity of species and traits monchamp et al 2018 fricke and svenning 2020 4 2 key otus dominating homogenized communities temporal homogenization of algal communities appeared to favor the growth of specific taxa that are able to thrive in environments with more stable water columns and where nutrient concentrations continually increased poff et al 2007 maavara et al 2015 righetti et al 2019 rf analysis identified several ea and cya taxa that exhibited markedly increased abundances concomitant with increasing nutrient levels fig 5 fig s8 including the ea otus otu40 mediophyceae otu48 bacillariophyceae and otu36 mediophyceae in addition to the cya otus otu31 planktothrix otu21 pseudanabaena otu2 microcystis and otu52 synechococcus interestingly several bacillariophyta taxa e g the mediophyceae and bacillariophyceae were observed to be sensitive to changes in tp tn and toc concentrations rather than the chlorophyceae although the latter are traditionally used as phytoplankton based indices to evaluate lake trophic status capo et al 2017 observed sensitive cyanobacterial genera including microcystis indicated increased abundances of filamentous and colonial taxa that are able to regulate buoyancy relative to other cyanobacteria consistent with previous studies reporting phytoplankton compositional shifts in favor of colony forming taxa in lakes due to variation in nutrient concentrations and climate change related effects monchamp et al 2018 tse et al 2018 some taxa within the chroococcales nostocales and oscillatoriales can regulate cell buoyancy to periodically float and sink in order to capture light at the surface and nutrients in deeper areas of the photic zone rendering these organisms ecological r strategists reynolds 2003 moreover pcr detection of mcya genes from sediments confirmed the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial taxa in the reservoir in recent years fig s2 suggesting that the risk of cyanotoxin occurrence may be associated with microcystis abundances tse et al 2018 ea and cya communities are distributed along niches based on their nutritional preferences and functional characteristics paerl huisman 2008 network analysis can help identify non random interactions among taxa and provide a comprehensive view of algal ecosystem associations fuhrman 2009 wang et al 2019 co occurrence network analysis based on cramér s associations indicated decreased skewness of otu degrees over time fig 6 suggesting that exogenous influences like hydrologic regulation and nutrient loading could drive shifts from diverse microhabitats that support heterogeneous communities to homogenous microhabitats that support populations occupying similar resource niches thereby altering otu clustering and consequently patterns of their degree distributions wang et al 2019 fricke and svenning 2020 in addition co occurrence network analyses based on spearman s correlations exhibited significant differences among the three successional stages of ea and cya community structures with increasing percentages of negative edges increased weighted modularity values and increased small world coefficients fig s10 table s3 these observations may indicate possible competition for resources that was not alleviated by increased nutrient concentrations in addition the markedly increased algal biomass supports the hypothesis of resource driven co occurrence patterns banerjee et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a high mean degrees high closeness centrality and low betweenness centrality values were used to identify putative keystone taxa of the cya community among the three successional stages including otu68 synechococcus otu17 cylindrospermopsis and otu2 microcystis these keystone taxa are frequently referred to as ecosystem engineers that drive changes in community structures fuhrman 2009 banerjee et al 2018 4 3 implications for reservoir management the accelerating rate of biological homogenization may render ecosystems incapable of compensating biodiversity loss thereby reducing the ability of an ecosystem to resist change though self organization that would enable it to retain its essential structure and recover from a disturbed state back to its original state i e resilience and reversibility scheffer et al 2001 poff et al 2007 fricke and svenning 2020 the consequences of community homogenization were regarded as i the high vulnerability to environmental changes due to synchrony among communities ii the decrease in resilience and resistance after some disturbances iii and damage in ecosystem functions and services olden 2006 petsch 2016 the acceleration of algal homogenization in the reservoir ecosystem due to human activities and hydrological regulation may reduce the resilience and reversibility of the ecosystem to environmental change resulting in cyanobacterial outbreaks or green algae dominated blooms and ecosystem disasters paerl and huisman 2008 vanessa et al 2010 monchamp et al 2018 decreased temporal β diversity coinciding with regional changes in hydrological conditions and anthropogenic nutrient loading indicates problems in the reservoir ecosystem that might not be reversible through the application of traditional management schemes that focus solely on phosphorus reduction paerl et al 2016 thus an immediate concern is the ability to identify possible conservation strategies to maintain or restore regional differences that could support ecosystem resilience and biodiversity in the reservoir garcia et al 2014 monchamp et al 2018 the results of this study and the observation of ecological homogenization provide new evidence that the construction of the dam and subsequent increased nutrient loading resulted in regime shifts of phytoplankton communities that are important factors to consider for lake protection and bloom control scheffer et al 2001 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b the extensive construction of dams or sluices in reservoirs or lakes in china consequently favors the growth of algae due to hydrostatic conditions leading to the appearance of toxic algae and cyanobacteria moreover these events lead to gradual blooms of green algae along with the homogenization of algal communities as observed due to human induced eutrophication and sluice controlling of lake chaohu zhang et al 2021b to mitigate eutrophication and diminish the proliferation of harmful blooms in reservoirs it is necessary to reduce the negative effects caused by dam construction e g altered hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient enrichment that accelerate algal homogenization rates poff et al 2007 petsch et al 2016 liu et al 2019 moreover further efforts are needed to investigate the relationships between algal community homogenization and human activities and whether it is possible to mitigate algal homogenization and harmful blooms by reducing human activities like nutrient loading paerl et al 2016 finderup et al 2019 5 conclusions in conclusion the compositions of ea and cya communities were identified using molecular markers from a yuqiao reservoir sediment core archive which spans the last 80 years community structures exhibited a high degree of consistency among the ea and cya datasets univariate and multivariate analyses documented distinct communities in successional phases with the first major change occurring in the 1970 s due to dam construction and a second change occurring in the 2000 s in association with nutrient enrichment the loss of ea and cya community taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity over time suggested a temporal homogenization of algal communities corresponding to damming and eutrophication several taxa including microcystis were detected as keystone taxa that were dominant populations associated with algal homogenization and were sensitive to changes in nutrient concentrations these results highlight the importance of understanding the contributions of damming and nutrient enrichment towards algal homogenization in addition to the application of careful management policies for reducing nutrient

4091,extensive construction of dams and increased human activities have greatly accelerated the homogenization of regional biotic communities the cumulative effects caused by dams and anthropogenic nutrient loading on the temporal turnover of phytoplankton communities are largely unexplored but of critical conservation importance for understanding reservoir ecosystem functioning here biodiversity patterns in eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities were investigated in a large reservoir over the last 80 years by sequencing dna preserved in sediment cores the succession of eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities recovered by sequencing of rrna gene markers exhibited a high degree of consistency with both showing evidence for significant changes in the 1970 s and 2000 s based on univariate and multivariate analyses temporal turnover indicated a marked loss of the taxonomic and phylogenetic structures of communities which became more similar through time due to the homogenous reservoir environment and concomitant ecological pressures from human activities specifically temporal homogenization of algal communities could be attributed to the damming of the reservoir in the 1960s that then affected the hydrological conditions of the reservoir and nutrient retention with increased anthropogenic nutrient loading favoring the growth of specific taxa like microcystis as evidenced from random forest machine learning and ecological network analyses thus these results demonstrate accelerated homogenization of algal communities in the reservoir due to the impacts of damming and nutrient enrichment these observations also call for a need to develop conservation strategies to maintain ecosystem resilience and prevent harmful blooms in reservoir systems keywords homogenization cyanobacteria eukaryotic algae eutrophication lake sediment sedimentary dna 1 introduction biological homogenization refers to the processes in which variations in taxonomic genetic or functional diversity are gradually lost due to species invasions and extinctions across spatial and temporal scales mckinney and lockwood 1999 olden and rooney 2006 petsch et al 2016 increasing evidence has demonstrated that homogenization of earth s biota is accelerating due to human activities and climate change which may lead to reduced resistance or resilience of ecosystems the loss of ecosystem functions deterioration of ecosystem goods and services and higher overall vulnerability to diseases garcia et al 2014 capinha et al 2015 knop 2016 monchamp et al 2018 consequently biological homogenization is a major threat to global terrestrial marine and freshwater ecosystems and has resulted in increased concern by researchers rahel 2000 capinha et al 2015 magurran et al 2015 keck et al 2020 fricke and svenning 2020 investigations of biotic homogenization have thus far focused on human activities i e intensification of trade and transportation that diminish natural barriers and that increase the prevalence of species introductions over time causing species compositional homogenization across historical biogeographic regions of terrestrial ecosystems capinha et al 2015 knop 2016 finderup et al 2019 fricke and svenning 2020 several studies have also demonstrated that environmental drivers influence the taxonomic homogenization of aquatic ecosystems including for communities of amphibians fish micro eukaryotes and water birds rahel 2000 magurran et al 2015 keck et al 2020 however the responses of phytoplankton diversity to environment changes in long term dynamics have been little studied monchamp et al 2018 phytoplankton are an extremely diverse polyphyletic group of microscopic photosynthetic eukaryotic algal protists and cyanobacteria and are the dominant primary producers of aquatic ecosystems where they play critical roles in transmitting energy and matter up food chains strom 2008 righetti et al 2019 eutrophication and global warming have favored the rapid growth of phytoplankton in lake and reservoir ecosystems leading to dramatic changes in algal community compositions including the dominance of potentially harmful cyanobacteria in addition to increasing frequencies of harmful bloom formation events that can threaten public health and aquatic ecosystems tse et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a thus understanding the mechanisms that influence algal community responses at the structural level to multiple external stressors is critical for immediately managing increased homogenization of aquatic ecosystem and maintain the stability of ecosystem functions and services righetti et al 2019 a few studies have attempted to reconstruct the historical community compositions of lake phytoplankton by sequencing sediment dna when long term monitoring data are not available tse et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a of these studies homogenization of cyanobacterial communities over the last century has been observed in ten european peri alpine lakes and is thought to have been triggered by climate change and eutrophication monchamp et al 2018 although the study focuses on spatial homogenization of cyanobacterial community from biogeographic perspective the patterns of phytoplankton community succession in long term time series particularly in lake and reservoir ecosystem have not been investigated reservoirs are artificial lakes and are hotspots of biodiversity loss due to associated hydrological alteration nutrient retention and habitat fragmentation poff et al 2007 stone 2016 barbarossa et al 2020 over 70 000 large dams are present globally and 57 percent of the earth s seasonal freshwater storage variability occurs in human managed reservoirs maavara et al 2015 cooley et al 2021 china is the most extensive dam building country globally and has more than 87 000 reservoirs of various sizes with a total water capacity of 706 billion m3 that provides the major sources of drinking water for chinese citizens shang et al 2019 the frequency and intensity of phytoplankton blooms have become increasingly severe in reservoirs in recent decades and are often associated with the dominance of only a few harmful taxa monchamp et al 2018 liu et al 2019 nevertheless it is unclear if the impoundment of dammed rivers accelerates the temporal homogenization of algal communities in the reservoir leading to dominance by some key tolerant taxon and subsequent decreased ecosystem resistance and resilience along with bloom formation and other ecological catastrophes in the present study dna from eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria were selectively amplified and sequenced from an archive comprising a finely laminated well dated sediment core from the yuqiao reservoir which represents a typical chinese reservoir the community structures and biodiversity patterns of eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial assemblages were then reconstructed for the last 80 years we hypothesized that dam construction and nutrient enrichment induces significant changes in eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities thus accelerating potential algal homogenization over broad temporal scales the main objectives of this study were to 1 explore the temporal homogenization of algal communities that is driven by human activities 2 identify the key dam tolerant taxa using machine learning and network analysis and 3 evaluate relationships of ecosystem resilience resistance with the homogenization of algae communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the yuqiao reservoir 40 02 n 117 34 e is one of the most important large reservoirs in northern china and is the major water source for tianjin city s drinking water for 15 61 million people the reservoir comprises a catchment area of 2060 km2 with a total storage capacity of 15 59 108 m3 and a surface area of 86 8 km2 fig 1 zhang et al 2019 the reservoir was built in 1959 to solve the drinking water shortage problem in tianjin and became an integral part of luanhe tianjin water diversion project after 1983 zhang et al 2019 the aquatic ecosystem of the reservoir has been seriously impaired over the last two decades by recurrent blooms of harmful cyanobacterial taxa like microcystis and planktothrix rubescens leading to serious threats for regional drinking water safety huo et al 2018 2 2 sediment coring dating and proxy analysis sampling was conducted in the center of the reservoir in april 2018 where stable sedimentary conditions exist fig 1 three sediment cores were collected at the sampling site with one used for molecular analyses and one each for physical and chemical analyses the sediment cores are described in detail in the supporting information the specific activities of 137cs were detected using gamma ray spectrometry ortec usa on a dspec jr 2 0 multi channel spectrometer coupled to a gwl 120 15 well detector sediment accumulation rates of 0 0553 g m 2 y 1 calculated by 137cs dating methods were used to calibrate the dating results fig s1 other paleo physicochemical and biological variables including analytical methods and vertical profiles are described in greater detail in the supporting information fig s2 2 3 molecular analyses 2 3 1 dna extraction strict laboratory procedures were applied to ensure the validity of the molecular sequencing data from sedimentary archives all instruments used for dna extraction and pcr amplification were scrubbed with 6 sodium hypochlorite and placed in a laminar flow hood under a uv lamp for at least 30 min prior to use dna was extracted from 0 5 g homogenized sediment from each stratum using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio carlsbad usa according to the manufacturer s protocols a negative control for every six samples was carried through the dna extraction procedure and treated in the same manner as the samples except for the use of pure water instead of sediment samples dna extracts were quantified using a nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa all dna blank controls did not exhibit obvious dna presence thereby confirming a low risk of external dna contamination during extraction procedures 2 3 2 pcr amplification two sets of primers were used to amplify rrna genes for eukaryotic algae ea the v7 region of eukaryotic 18s rrna genes was amplified using the pcr primers 960f and nsr1438 resulting in the amplification of a 260 bp fragment capo et al 2017 for cyanobacteria cya cyanobacterial specific primers cya359f and cya781r were used to amplify an approximately 400 bp fragment from the v3 and v4 hypervariable regions of 16s rrna genes tse et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2020 after dna extraction two pairs of primers shown in table s1 were used to construct next generation sequencing libraries using a two step amplification procedure first the fragments were amplified using the ea and cya primer pairs followed by purification with an agencourt ampure xp purification kit beckman coulter inc the purified products were then amplified using primers with illumina specific adapters attached along with a unique sample barcode pcr reactions in the first step were performed in a total 50 µl volume containing 10 µl of buffer 2 µl of q5 high fidelity dna polymerase and 1 mm of each dntp primers were added to concentrations of 3 µm step 1 and 2 5 µm step 2 the amplification conditions included an initial denaturation at 94 c for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 1 s at 94 c 20 s at the respective annealing temperature ea 55 c cya 60 c and 30 s at 72 c all followed by a final extension at 72 c for 5 min ibrahim et al 2020 pcr products were purified with an omega d6492 02 cycle pure kit and concentrations were measured on a nanodrop 2000 instrument amplicons were then sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina usa 2 3 3 bioinformatics processing paired end reads were merged using flash v 1 2 7 http ccb jhu edu software flash specifying a minimum overlap length of 10 bp and a maximum mismatch ratio of the overlap region as 0 2 magoč and salzberg 2011 merged raw tags were then filtered and clustered as follows 1 merged tags with more than six mismatches to primer sequences were discarded using the fastx toolkit 2 tags with an average quality score 20 over a 50 bp sliding window were truncated using trimmomatic http www usadellab org cms page trimmomatic and tags shorter than 75 of all tag lengths after quality control were removed bolger et al 2014 3 the uchime tool in mothur http drive5 com uchime was used to remove chimeric sequences edgar et al 2011 4 quality filtered sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 nucleotide identity threshold using the qiime uclust module otus with relative abundances 0 005 among all sequences were removed from the dataset to limit possible confounding influences of these artefactual sequences otus were then taxonomically classified by searching against the silva databases release119 http www arb silva de using the rdp classifier within qiime caporaso et al 2010 otus affiliated with non eukaryotic algal eukaryotes e g metazoans embryophytes fungi and protozoa and non cyanobacteria bacteria were removed from each library ibrahim et al 2020 rarefied otu tables of ea and cya abundances were then used to estimate the α diversity of the eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities based on several metrics including otu richness the shannon diversity index and the pielou index using the vegan package for r jost and tungurahua 2006 2 3 4 abundances of mcya genes the mcya cd 1f and 1r pcr primers were designed to target mcya genes within cyanobacterial genera that can produce microcystins including planktothrix microcystis and dolichospermum among others tse et al 2018 detailed mcya amplification methods were previously described zhang et al 2021a briefly pcr products were visualized using a 1 agarose gel with sybr safe dna gel stain and abundances were quantified with an abi viia 7 real time pcr system applied biosystems california usa 2 4 statistical analyses 2 4 1 cluster analysis temporal variation in the relative abundances of ea and cya taxonomic groups were plotted using tilia v2 2 1 and clustered using constrained incremental sums of squares cluster analysis coniss to further evaluate the timing and hierarchy of significant changes in community structures multivariate regression tree mrt analysis was conducted using the mvpart package for r de ath 2002 the results from the two clustering techniques coniss and mrt were combined to identify significant change points in ea and cya community structures based on taxonomic groups and otus respectively both the common and rare otu subsets of the ea and cya communities were analyzed among the historical time period phases identified within the mrt analysis common otus were defined as those found in all samples from a given time period while rare otus are those present in less than 25 of the samples for a given time period monchamp et al 2018 2 4 2 taxonomic diversity analysis to track changes among ea and cya community structures in different historical periods ordinations were performed after applying rank order transformations on the two otu datasets using the metamds function in the r package vegan bray curtis relative abundances of otus and jaccard presence absence of otus pairwise distance metrics were used to construct nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds ordinations permutational multivariate analyses of variance permanova and analysis of similarities anosim tests were used to evaluate differences in community composition based on bray curtis dissimilarities over the last 80 years using 999 permutations distance based redundancy analysis dbrda was used with the rda function of the vegan package to investigate significant factors that explained variation in ea and cya community structures following principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix 2 4 3 phylogenetic diversity analysis the representative sequences for each eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial otu were aligned with the clusterw algorithm and used to infer a phylogeny using maximum likelihood ml methods in the mega software package sudhir et al 2018 community variation was then estimated using the phylogenetic based unweighted unifrac distance metric and visualized using nmds in the phylomeasures and vegan packages for r differences in the phylogenetic based community variation among the three periods were then evaluated with permanova and anosim tests conducted with unweighted unifrac dissimilarities and 999 permutations in addition the phylogenetic diversity pd faith 1992 of the ea and cy communities was calculated using the phylogenetic tree and with the picante package for r the observed phylogenetic diversity values were compared with the predicted values from a random model using the standardized effect size of pd measurement with the ses pd function in picante runs 999 iterations 1000 2 4 4 random forest modelling to identify key otus associated with the homogenization of ea and cya communities the relative abundances of ea and cya otus were regressed against the concentrations of sedimentary tp tn and toc using the rf machine learning algorithm to establish six models to correlate ea and cya composition with nutrient variables random forest rf classifications were used to identify the ea and cya otus that exhibited the most sensitive responses to environmental factors i e sedimentary tp tn and toc using the randomforest package for r first a subset of the dataset was used for training and was obtained by randomly extracting sample points from the overall dataset classification and regression trees cart were then trained with each subset training dataset the final predictive rf result is then the mean value of all cart prediction results ranked otus based on order of feature importance were then determined over 500 iterations the otus considered important were identified using 10 fold cross validation with five replicates 2 4 5 co occurrence network analysis non random co occurrence patterns of ea and cya communities were evaluated with the checkerboard score c score metric under a null model that preserved differences among otus barberán et al 2012 c scores from 10 000 simulations were compared against those for the observed communities two co occurrence networks were then constructed by calculating correlation coefficients based on otu relative abundances in addition to an association metric based on the presence absence of otus the abundance based co occurrence network was inferred from a spearman s correlation matrix wherein co occurrences were identified as those observed with robust correlations correlation coefficient ρ 0 5 and were statistically significant p 0 01 junker and schreiber 2008 to reduce the probability of false positive results p values were adjusted using the false discovery rate fdr correction eight co occurrence networks were constructed and visualized using the gephi software program v 0 9 2 and the fruchterman reingold algorithm including ea and cya community networks for the whole study period and the different historical periods to evaluate the topological properties of co occurrence networks network metrics were evaluated that are relevant for ecological community roles and functioning faust and raes 2012 including average degree diameter density weighted modularity clustering coefficients and average path length in addition association metric based co occurrence networks were constructed as previously described zhang et al 2021 briefly the skewness of the otu frequency distribution was measured to assess asymmetry in the frequency distribution of otu co occurrences clustering coefficients were calculated to describe the realized fraction of all possible co occurrences between otus linked to a common network 3 results 3 1 composition of historical eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities multiple methodological precautions were employed to achieve robust and accurate sedimentary dna profiles see supplementary information for details as based on previous studies describing methods for sequencing sedimentary dna from well dated lake reservoir cores in order to investigate historical algal communities when long term monitoring data is lacking capo et al 2017 monchamp et al 2018 tse et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a the total reservoir core inventories from 21 sediment layers comprised 978 755 and 1 624 429 micro eukaryote and cyanobacterial rrna sequence reads assigned to 824 and 676 otus respectively after amplification with taxa specific primer sets otus affiliated with non eukaryotic algae and non cyanobacteria were removed from the respective libraries leading to a total of 185 647 and 1 178 159 remaining reads that clustered into 148 and 81 eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial otus respectively table s2 no evidence was observed for differential dna degradation among taxa based on the numbers of otus and sequences that were recovered fig 2 table s2 combined with previous studies focused on long term dynamics of lacustrine biodiversity using sedimentary dna the decay of dna is likely a marginal confounding variable and the differential preservation of dna across layers is unlikely to significantly affect the results reported in this study capo et al 2017 keck et al 2020 ibrahim et al 2020 diverse communities of ea and cya were identified and comprised nine eukaryotic algal phyla and three orders of cyanobacteria table 1 fig 2 adl et al 2019 chlorophyceae was the most abundant eukaryotic phytoplankton group 19 followed by chrysophyceae 15 1 mediophyceae 14 06 and bacillariophyceae 11 57 synechococcus and microcystis were the most abundant cyanobacteria with relative abundances of 57 39 and 30 42 respectively table 1 significant changes in ea and cya community compositions were both detected in the 1970 s and the 2000 s based on coniss analysis of taxonomic variation fig 2 a simultaneous increase in the relative abundances of florideophyceae was observed in ea data set after the 1970s with a concomitant gradual disappearance of cylindrospermopsis and dolichospermum in the cya dataset in addition the relative abundances of the ea group mediophyceae and microcystis cyanobacteria markedly increased after the 2000 s fig 2 thus the three successional stages of the algal community were the 1930 s 1970 s the 1970 s 2000 s and after the 2000 s which are consistent with variation in sediment physicochemical indices fig 2 fig s2 nutrient tn tp and toc levels and primary productivity chl a and β carotene indices were low in the 1930 s 1970 s but gradually increased in the 1970 s 2000 s then rapidly increasing after the 2000 s fig s2 3 2 temporal changes in eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial community diversity α diversity measurements for the ea and cya communities as measured by otu richness the shannon diversity index and the pielou evenness index did not exhibit systematic decreases across time fig 3 estimated richness varied over time ranging from 38 to 113 otus for ea and from 30 to 57 otus for cya while the slopes of the long term relationships between otu richness and time were positive for both ea and cya communities fig 3a ea and cya community otu richness in the second historical phase 1970 s 2000 s were significantly higher than in the first stage 1930 s 1970 s fig 3d p 0 01 in addition the shannon diversity index of cya communities decreased among the three periods while that of ea communities increased from the first period to the second period and then remained at the relatively high level in the third period 2000 s thus the overall slope of the long term relationship between shannon diversity and time was negative for cya and positive for ea fig 3 the pielou evenness of the ea and cya communities both notably decreased across the three historical periods fig 3 p 0 01 the numbers of common otus i e found in all samples for a given period increased during the three periods conversely the number of rare otus for ea and cya communities i e found in 25 of samples for a given period decreased during the three historical phases fig 3 homogenization of ea and cya communities was observed based on both taxonomic bray curtis and jaccard and phylogenetic unweighted unifrac community metrics in addition to multivariate beta diversity analysis conducted using taxonomic based bray curtis and jaccard distances fig 4 figs s4 s5 mrt analysis results of ea and cya community composition was consistent with those from coniss analysis providing grouping information for beta diversity analyses fig 4 nmds ordinations of bray curtis jaccard and unweighted unifrac distances provided similar results suggesting a strong reduction in temporal beta diversity for both ea and cya communities as evinced by reduced sample dispersion ellipses among the three historical phases fig 4 fig s4 fig s5 permanova tests confirmed that community groups from each period exhibited significantly different group centroids p 0 001 indeed dissimilarities based on bray curtis jaccard and unweighted unifrac distances were all significantly reduced in the three groups r 0 p 0 05 indicating decreased taxonomic and phylogenetic similarity of ea and cya communities along the temporal gradient representing the historical phases of the reservoir the observed changes in ea and cya community structure co occurred with decreased average dissimilarity across the three historical phases based on unweighted unifrac distances thereby suggesting a general homogenization of phylogenetic community structure over time surprisingly the faith s pd of the ea and cya communities did not exhibit decreasing temporal trends as expected fig s6 which may be due to increased diversity of phylogenetic tree branches accompanying increased otu richness over time in addition the standardized effect sizes of pd for the ea and cya communities were 0 fig s6 suggesting that the observed pd values were lower than expected at random implicating human activity disturbances in these non random patterns 3 3 key drivers and important taxa involved in historical state changes the temporal homogenization of ea and cya communities may be driven by many factors including damming increased nutrient loading and ongoing climate change dbrda ordination allowed finer resolved analysis of the correlations between otu datasets and measured environmental variables fig s7 the environmental variable dataset explained 76 1 and 88 0 of the variation in ea and cya community structures respectively the correlations of tp tn and toc parameters as noted by vector length were larger than that for annual average temperature and annual average daily precipitation suggesting that nutrient variables were more strongly correlated with variation in ea and cya communities than were meteorological factors almost all of the samples were distributed along the positive direction of tp tn and toc vectors after the 1970 s indicating that nutrient loads have increased since then due to dam retention and anthropogenic sources importantly these parameters eventually became the key factors that strongly affected ea and cya community compositional variation ibrahim et al 2020 the rf machine models explained 60 2 and 65 of ea and cya community variance related to tp concentrations along with 57 8 and 67 1 related to tn concentrations respectively and 60 1 and 69 7 related to toc concentrations respectively fig 5 fig s8 to identify important otus correlated with nutrient variables 10 fold cross validation with five replicates was conducted otus corresponding to the minimum cross validation error were considered as important otus within the range of nutrient concentration gradient in this study the relative abundance of the majority of key otus exhibited a positive correlation with nutrient concentration including otu40 mediophyceae otu48 bacillariophyceae and otu36 mediophyceae in the ea dataset and otu31 planktothrix otu21 pseudanabaena otu2 microcystis and otu52 synechococcus in the cya dataset and only the minority of key otus showed a hump shaped relationship between relative abundance and nutrient concentration e g otu67 chrysophyceae fig 5 fig s8 3 4 changes in the ecological co occurrence network of otus non random co occurrence patterns were observed across the entire ea and cya datasets based on checkerboard unit calculations and c scores of 7 79 for ea and 5 04 for cya fig s9 randomized matrices for eukaryotic algal and cyanobacterial communities n 10 000 exhibited estimated mean c scores of 12 13 0 08 and 6 27 0 11 respectively which significantly differed from those of observed communities co occurrence network analysis based on cramér s association indicated decreased skewness values of otu associations from 0 51 to 1 33 for ea communities and from 0 63 to 1 28 for cya communities over the entire 1930 2018 study period fig 6 co occurrence networks based on spearman s correlations exhibited significant differences in topological structures among the three historical periods fig s10 table s3 the ea networks consisted of 148 nodes connected by 1 163 edges for the entire period 122 nodes connected by 595 edges for the 1930 s 1970 s 142 nodes connected by 759 edges for the 1970 s 2000 s and 122 nodes connected by 534 edges after the 2000 s the cya networks for the whole period comprised 79 nodes connected by 553 edges and 73 70 and 65 nodes for the three stages respectively that were connected by 357 263 and 232 edges respectively fig s10 table s3 the proportion of negative edges in the ea networks increased from 10 42 in the first period to 27 54 and 25 09 in the second and third stages respectively further the proportions of negative edges in the cya networks rose from 7 00 in the first period to 10 65 and 9 91 in the second and third stages respectively the otus with the highest degrees in the cya networks across the three stages were otu68 synechococcus otu17 cylindrospermopsis and otu2 microcystis with degrees of 27 18 and 15 respectively the clustering coefficients of the eight networks were all higher than 0 4 suggesting the presence of modular structures newman 2006 the weighted modularity values of the ea networks in the three historical stages were 0 753 1 349 and 1 574 respectively and the values for cya networks were 0 446 0 737 and 0 744 respectively overall the ea and cya networks comprised highly connected otus that were structured among densely connected modules forming clustered topologies as would be expected for real world networks that are more significantly clustered than random graphs table s3 4 discussion 4 1 homogenization of algal communities driven by damming and nutrient enrichment the composition of the ea and cya communities from the sedimentary archive in the yuqiao reservoir exhibited similar temporal progression throughout the last 80 years fig 2 univariate and multivariate analyses implied that the most significant shift in the communities occurred after damming in the 1970 s followed by additional shifts accompanying nutrient enrichment in the 2000 s fig 3 fig 4 observed changes in ea and cya community structures coincided with increased similarities among communities suggesting a general homogenization of the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of the communities over time i e a loss of β diversity dornelas et al 2014 monchamp et al 2018 systematic loss of α diversity was not detected for the ea and cya communities throughout the study period regardless of the α diversity metric being considered fig 3 these differences could be due to turnover metrics e g β diversity incorporating shifts in species composition and potentially providing more sensitive indicators of community change than do α diversity metrics dornelas et al 2014 the observed biotic homogenization is consistent with previous studies demonstrating homogenization of fish communities microbial decomposers and grassland plant and animal communities following increased human induced environmental pressures magurran et al 2015 gossner et al 2016 gonzález orozco et al 2016 a similar response was observed for european peri alpine lakes with phylogenetic homogenization of cyanobacterial communities among the ten lakes occurring over a century due to effects from climate change and eutrophication monchamp et al 2018 interactions between damming and nutrient enrichment likely play important roles in the ecosystem functioning of the reservoir study system according to the significant correlation between community structures and measured environmental variables fig s7 hydrologic regimes can affect phytoplankton biomass levels in addition to community structures via influences on photosynthetically active radiation and nutrient dynamics in water columns vanessa et al 2010 xu et al 2020 rivers are highly selective and heterogeneous environments where only a few phytoplankton taxa can achieve dominance including for instance benthic taxa that dominate fast flowing upstream sites while centric diatoms dominate turbulent and turbid midstream sites and coccal green algae dominate shallow downstream sites reynolds 2003 dam construction and reservoir impoundment can lead to increased water residence times improved light conditions increased nutrient retention and sediment trapping that amplify primary production activities and promote the succession of dominant phytoplankton from river dominant taxa i e diatoms and or dinoflagellates to lake dominant taxa i e chlorophyta and or cyanobacteria xiao et al 2011 xu et al 2020 consistent with the results of this study fig 2 numerous studies have demonstrated that homogenizing river flow regimes due to damming is an unfolding global problem and has been invoked as one of the reasons for declining freshwater biodiversity and particularly algal biodiversity poff et al 2007 maavara et al 2015 barbarossa et al 2020 phytoplankton successional patterns are primarily regulated by changes in available nutrients through time ibrahim et al 2020 river damming affects anthropogenic nutrient enrichment by trapping some nutrients in reservoirs and slowing the water flow maavara et al 2015 long term monitoring data has shown that tn and tp concentrations in the yuqiao reservoir have significantly increased since the 1980s with tn and tp concentrations reaching a maximum of 2 4 mg l 1 and 90 μg l 1 in 1994 respectively zhang et al 2019 the catchment comprises a traditional farming zone including approximately 39 22 farmland that leads to agricultural runoff as the main nutrient loading source into the reservoir huo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 paleolimnological proxy analysis also suggested that trophic state metrics e g sedimentary tn tp and toc concomitantly increase with increased primary productivity proxies e g sedimentary chl a and β carotene in the reservoir fig s2 indicating that nutrients promoted phytoplankton growth over time paerl huisman 2008 excess nutrient discharge can facilitate extreme phytoplankton overgrowth to the point of community suffocation liu et al 2019 as demonstrated by the occurrence of microcystis blooms in the reservoir during summers of recent years huo et al 2018 concomitantly eutrophication characteristics may filter out some taxa that are adapted to oligotrophic environments i e dinophyceae leading to dominance by nutrient tolerant taxa like chlorophyceae and most cyanobacteria capo et al 2017 keck et al 2020 in addition null modeling and ecological network analysis also provided evidence that the temporal turnover observed for ea and cya communities was primarily driven by human activities damming and subsequent nutrient enrichment rather than via ecological drift fig 6 fig s9 overall the temporal homogenization of phytoplankton communities can arise due to reduced environmental heterogeneity that is linked to external forcing like eutrophication and damming thereby selecting for a reduced diversity of species and traits monchamp et al 2018 fricke and svenning 2020 4 2 key otus dominating homogenized communities temporal homogenization of algal communities appeared to favor the growth of specific taxa that are able to thrive in environments with more stable water columns and where nutrient concentrations continually increased poff et al 2007 maavara et al 2015 righetti et al 2019 rf analysis identified several ea and cya taxa that exhibited markedly increased abundances concomitant with increasing nutrient levels fig 5 fig s8 including the ea otus otu40 mediophyceae otu48 bacillariophyceae and otu36 mediophyceae in addition to the cya otus otu31 planktothrix otu21 pseudanabaena otu2 microcystis and otu52 synechococcus interestingly several bacillariophyta taxa e g the mediophyceae and bacillariophyceae were observed to be sensitive to changes in tp tn and toc concentrations rather than the chlorophyceae although the latter are traditionally used as phytoplankton based indices to evaluate lake trophic status capo et al 2017 observed sensitive cyanobacterial genera including microcystis indicated increased abundances of filamentous and colonial taxa that are able to regulate buoyancy relative to other cyanobacteria consistent with previous studies reporting phytoplankton compositional shifts in favor of colony forming taxa in lakes due to variation in nutrient concentrations and climate change related effects monchamp et al 2018 tse et al 2018 some taxa within the chroococcales nostocales and oscillatoriales can regulate cell buoyancy to periodically float and sink in order to capture light at the surface and nutrients in deeper areas of the photic zone rendering these organisms ecological r strategists reynolds 2003 moreover pcr detection of mcya genes from sediments confirmed the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial taxa in the reservoir in recent years fig s2 suggesting that the risk of cyanotoxin occurrence may be associated with microcystis abundances tse et al 2018 ea and cya communities are distributed along niches based on their nutritional preferences and functional characteristics paerl huisman 2008 network analysis can help identify non random interactions among taxa and provide a comprehensive view of algal ecosystem associations fuhrman 2009 wang et al 2019 co occurrence network analysis based on cramér s associations indicated decreased skewness of otu degrees over time fig 6 suggesting that exogenous influences like hydrologic regulation and nutrient loading could drive shifts from diverse microhabitats that support heterogeneous communities to homogenous microhabitats that support populations occupying similar resource niches thereby altering otu clustering and consequently patterns of their degree distributions wang et al 2019 fricke and svenning 2020 in addition co occurrence network analyses based on spearman s correlations exhibited significant differences among the three successional stages of ea and cya community structures with increasing percentages of negative edges increased weighted modularity values and increased small world coefficients fig s10 table s3 these observations may indicate possible competition for resources that was not alleviated by increased nutrient concentrations in addition the markedly increased algal biomass supports the hypothesis of resource driven co occurrence patterns banerjee et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a high mean degrees high closeness centrality and low betweenness centrality values were used to identify putative keystone taxa of the cya community among the three successional stages including otu68 synechococcus otu17 cylindrospermopsis and otu2 microcystis these keystone taxa are frequently referred to as ecosystem engineers that drive changes in community structures fuhrman 2009 banerjee et al 2018 4 3 implications for reservoir management the accelerating rate of biological homogenization may render ecosystems incapable of compensating biodiversity loss thereby reducing the ability of an ecosystem to resist change though self organization that would enable it to retain its essential structure and recover from a disturbed state back to its original state i e resilience and reversibility scheffer et al 2001 poff et al 2007 fricke and svenning 2020 the consequences of community homogenization were regarded as i the high vulnerability to environmental changes due to synchrony among communities ii the decrease in resilience and resistance after some disturbances iii and damage in ecosystem functions and services olden 2006 petsch 2016 the acceleration of algal homogenization in the reservoir ecosystem due to human activities and hydrological regulation may reduce the resilience and reversibility of the ecosystem to environmental change resulting in cyanobacterial outbreaks or green algae dominated blooms and ecosystem disasters paerl and huisman 2008 vanessa et al 2010 monchamp et al 2018 decreased temporal β diversity coinciding with regional changes in hydrological conditions and anthropogenic nutrient loading indicates problems in the reservoir ecosystem that might not be reversible through the application of traditional management schemes that focus solely on phosphorus reduction paerl et al 2016 thus an immediate concern is the ability to identify possible conservation strategies to maintain or restore regional differences that could support ecosystem resilience and biodiversity in the reservoir garcia et al 2014 monchamp et al 2018 the results of this study and the observation of ecological homogenization provide new evidence that the construction of the dam and subsequent increased nutrient loading resulted in regime shifts of phytoplankton communities that are important factors to consider for lake protection and bloom control scheffer et al 2001 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b the extensive construction of dams or sluices in reservoirs or lakes in china consequently favors the growth of algae due to hydrostatic conditions leading to the appearance of toxic algae and cyanobacteria moreover these events lead to gradual blooms of green algae along with the homogenization of algal communities as observed due to human induced eutrophication and sluice controlling of lake chaohu zhang et al 2021b to mitigate eutrophication and diminish the proliferation of harmful blooms in reservoirs it is necessary to reduce the negative effects caused by dam construction e g altered hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient enrichment that accelerate algal homogenization rates poff et al 2007 petsch et al 2016 liu et al 2019 moreover further efforts are needed to investigate the relationships between algal community homogenization and human activities and whether it is possible to mitigate algal homogenization and harmful blooms by reducing human activities like nutrient loading paerl et al 2016 finderup et al 2019 5 conclusions in conclusion the compositions of ea and cya communities were identified using molecular markers from a yuqiao reservoir sediment core archive which spans the last 80 years community structures exhibited a high degree of consistency among the ea and cya datasets univariate and multivariate analyses documented distinct communities in successional phases with the first major change occurring in the 1970 s due to dam construction and a second change occurring in the 2000 s in association with nutrient enrichment the loss of ea and cya community taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity over time suggested a temporal homogenization of algal communities corresponding to damming and eutrophication several taxa including microcystis were detected as keystone taxa that were dominant populations associated with algal homogenization and were sensitive to changes in nutrient concentrations these results highlight the importance of understanding the contributions of damming and nutrient enrichment towards algal homogenization in addition to the application of careful management policies for reducing nutrient loading to limit biodiversity loss within reservoir ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement hanxiao zhang data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft

4092,groundwater level gwl of coastal aquifers are strongly influenced by the ocean tide at sub daily to seasonal scale similarly gwl are influenced by storm induced ocean wave surge lasting few hours to a day there has not been a detailed study on the conjunctive impact of such tidal and storm waves on coastal groundwater and its vulnerability through our coastal and field laboratory observations at one of the world s most extreme climate affected regions the ganges river mega delta we delineate the influence of ocean wave surge impacts on the shallow 24 m below ground level m bgl and deep 115 m bgl aquifers gwl our study on the multi layered delta front aquifers adjoining the tropical bob shows that the high temporal resolution gwl fluctuation due to wave surges are instantaneous rapid and synchronous at all depths of the aquifers the potential rise of ocean waves caused by tropical cyclone bulbul november 2019 significantly increases the gwl both in shallow and deeper aquifer using multivariate statistics and machine learning techniques we have attempted to quantify the rise of gwl during each of the ocean wave surge event the model shows good predictability for deeper groundwater however it is unable to quantify the shallower gwl of each of the ocean wave surge during storm events such phenomenon indicates aquifer vulnerability thereby posing an emerging threat to drinking water availability to millions of groundwater dependent inhabitants in coastal areas globally which may rapidly intensify with increasing rates of tropical cyclones and sea level rise in recent times and impending future keywords groundwater storm surge sundarbans cyclone bay of bengal 1 introduction groundwater level gwl fluctuations in the coastal aquifers are highly concerning being hydrulically connected to the sea thus are vulnerable to salinization ratner narovlansky et al 2020 werner et al 2013 the shallow aquifers connection is often evident near shore while deeper aquifers are extended to far offshore distance and have assumed connection with sea ratner narovlansky et al 2020 post et al 2013 das et al 2021a b coastal aquifers are responsive to the ocean tides and earth tides kooi and groen 2001 morrissey et al 2010 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 in a semi diurnal to diurnal to seasonal scale burgess et al 2017 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 is a resultant of mechanical loading burgess et al 2017 the mechanical loading varies within the range of 0 67 0 87 in the bengal aquifer system bas which is a function of the earth and ocean tides burgess et al 2017 the potential rise of incoming ocean wave give rise to the gwl by creating matrix pressure burgess et al 2017 debnath and mukherjee 2016 the incorporation of seasonal and tidal amplitudes of gwl in the measurement of terrestrial water storage is an essential component and established whereas instantaneous rise of gwl due to ocean wave surge over the periods ranging from hours to days has not reported yet so the quantification of the gwl rise due to ocean wave surge could be measure of the acute and long term aquifer vulnerability delta front aquifers of the indus ganges brahmaputra igb basin are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters like cyclones and extreme rainfall events tropical cyclones are predominant in the northern indian ocean during pre especially during may and post monsoon seasons especially during october and november and are important weather events of the tropics singh and rout 1999 the variation in hydraulic heads enhances the rapid transport of saline water to the fresh groundwater aquifer after each of the natural calamities like typhoon and cyclones are reported illangasekare et al 2006 vithanage et al 2012a vithanage et al 2012b cardenas et al 2015 while acute response during the ocean wave surge is overlooked apart from addressing the already established long term changes in groundwater response to ocean surge inundation it is now important to address the short term acute response of ocean wave surge events on gwl machine learning techniques have recently gained much highlight in the field of hydrology especially in monitoring and prediction of groundwater both quantitatively and qualitatively and also in the field of forecasting during the extreme climatic events like flood and draught events sadler et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021 li et al 2020 ruiz aĺvarez et al 2021 some popular machine learning models e g artificial neural networks anns support vector machines svms and random forests rfs are popularly known for their versatile applications and also recent applications in hydrologic forecasting studies anns are non linear computational tools inspired by the biological signal processing in neurons and does not require an obvious formulation for the physical relations related to any given problem sahoo et al 2006 multi layered feed forward networks mfn are the extensively used ann structures in the field of hydrology and studies related to management of water resources maier and dandy 1996 govindaraju and rao 2013 maier and dandy 2000 a study by taormina et al 2012 demonstrated the application of ann model for predicting long term changes in groundwater storage level changes in the unconfined coastal aquifer of venice and recommended ann as alternative for physics based models the support vector machines svms is a popular supervised learning system developed on the basis of statistical learning theory vapnik 1998 svms have been for their successful applications in flood phenomenon wu et al 2019 sharifi garmdareh et al 2018 landslides miao et al 2018 and groundwater level and quality related studies sivapragasam and liong 2005 bedi et al 2020 the regularization of the loss function in the svms allows better generalization of the data and helps to avoid overfitting svms are also known to operate quite well in cases of low data availability kecman 2001 the rfs are another supervised learning techniques and are becoming very much popular in recent times rfs have known application in almost all the aspects of hydrology like flood events sadler et al 2018 schoppa et al 2020 park et al 2018 drought groundwater quality chakraborty et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021 podgorski et al 2018 groundwater quantity jyolsna et al 2021 and impact of climate change li et al 2020 ruiz aĺvarez et al 2021 the rfs can efficiently handle problems such as existence of multi colinearity within the predictors noise bias and overfitting the selected machine learning techniques are used in this study with their own advantages and limitations to provide a numerical support of the hypothesis of the quantification of ocean wave surge induced gwl rise during extreme climate events like tropical cyclone and atmospheric depressions the present study is aimed to investigate the direct hydraulic connection with the ocean tides and gwl fluctuation in semi diurnal to diurnal scale and even during the ocean wave surge extreme climate conditions are one of the reasons of ocean wave surge total ten ocean wave surges during the extreme events are considered for the respective study period of 2017 to 2019 which includes tropical cyclone titli october 2018 fani may 2019 and bulbul november 2019 the considered extreme climate conditions are atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone which potentially giving rise to the ocean wave surge the geopotential height gph at 500 hpa is considered as a proxy of cyclone indicator keable et al 2002 moore and dixon 2015 wang et al 2016 the lowering of gravity adjusted gph from mean sea level during atmospheric low pressure events like atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone is considered as a local indicator the cyclone centre s linear distance to the study location with the local barometric pressure bp change is used in this study as an indicator parameter for the present study s extreme climate conditions as of nearer the landfall of cyclones from the study site higher the impacts the study is conducted with the aim of 1 understanding the response of shallow as well as deep gwl to ocean tide and wave surge and 2 the application of advanced machine learning techniques to evaluate the importance of selected predictor variables to quantify the gwl fluctuations at variable ocean wave surge conditions 2 methodology 2 1 study area description hydrologically the study area experiences warm and humid climatic conditions throughout the year due to proximity to the tropic of cancer and the bay of bengal bob mukherjee et al 2007b the sundarbans annual average rainfall is 1639 mm year 2008 2018 imd based on the varied moisture sources responsible for rainfall and temperatures the end of february to june is considered as pre monsoon july to september as monsoon and october to the beginning of february as the post monsoon season das and mukherjee 2019 das et al 2021a the annual total rainfall amount for last 15 years of that respective study area is in decreasing trend during the study period the highest amount of rainfall was observed in 2019 total 2070 mm than 2017 total 1675 mm and 2018 total 1606 mm similarly the highest monsoonal rainfall was observed in 2019 1106 mm than the 2017 1024 mm and 2018 900 mm fig 1 c 2 2 hydrostratigraphy lithological structure of the bengal basin has been explained by mukherjee et al 2007a to validate the aquifer aquitard framework lithological information of the study area was collected from the mukherjee et al 2007a and government of west bengal database lithologically the aquifer of the studied area was classified into three zones viz i shallow upper aquifer ii the main aquifer and iii the deeper aquifer the southern part of the bengal basin has as the shallow upper aquifer up to 60 m below ground level m bgl the main aquifer is semi confined to locally unconfined which consists of medium to coarse grained sand with alternate gravel layers its thickness varies from 75 m in southern part up to depth of 140 to 150 m bgl the deeper confined aquifer 150 m separated from the main aquifer by a clay layer consists of medium to coarse sands with inter beds of silt and clay the main aquifer thickness in southern part of the basin 200 m have several intermediate depth clay aquitards which divide main aquifer from the laterally connected confined aquifers mukherjee et al 2007a 2 3 piezometry absolute gwl and atmospheric pressure were recorded at half hourly intervals for three consecutive years 2017 2019 fig 1c the piezometers were suspended approximately 5 10 m below the static water level whereas a barologger was installed in an air filled section of shallow well with same data record interval solinist levelogger 3001 was used for continuous gwl monitoring for the shallow as well as deeper wells accuracy of 0 05 full scale a barologger was used with an accuracy of 0 05 kpa for continuous atmospheric pressure measurement the gwl was normalized by the measured atmospheric pressure through barologger and calibrated with the manual infield measurement the wells were constructed using rotary drilling and permanent casing is made by pvc pipes while temporary casing through bentonite during drilling process they were flushed after construction for 8 h at one hour interval for each of the wells separately the installed shallow and deep wells are denoted as the sw and dw for this respective study two closely placed observation wells were screened at the depth of 15 sw15 and 115 dw115 meter below ground level m bgl at location c and other two shallow observation wells are placed at different locations at a depth of 14 sw14 and 24 m sw24 at location a and e fig 1b wells are located differently from nearshore sw14 and sw24 and 3 5 km inland sw15 and dw115 from the shoreline fig 1b the sw15 and dw115 have recorded data from may 2017 to december 2019 sw14 and sw24 have recorded data from may 2017 to january 2018 only 2 4 data used 2 4 1 input variables the selected input variables for the present study are ocean wave height gph distance from the cyclonic center and bp change ocean wave height or the tidal height are well established influencing factors of gwl fluctuations due to its control on aquifer matrix pressure reported in multiple studies van der kamp 1972 li and jiao 2001 guo et al 2007 xia et al 2007 burgess et al 2017 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 the rise of ocean wave height is much higher in cyclonic and atmospheric low pressure events than the normal lunar tidal fluctuations and for the reason being it was considered as one of the major input variables for this present study the gph is a gravity adjusted reference height to measure the atmospheric pressure anomaly by its fluctuations from the reference height gph is globally accepted indicator parameter of cyclones and is used in this study to indicate the atmospheric disturbances near the study area keable et al 2002 moore and dixon 2015 wang et al 2016 the distance of the eye of a cyclone to the study location is also important as closer the distance higher the impact of landfall and fall of local bp so the distance of eye of a cyclone and local change in bp are on of the major important variable to control the gwl fluctuation 2 4 1 1 ocean wave height reanalyzed wave data are widely in wave climate studies in global and regional scales stopa and cheung 2014 anoop et al 2014 reanalysis provides a numerical description of the climate by combining altimeter data with models era interim the reanalysis data of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf has 6 hr temporal resolution and 1 spatial resolution dee et al 2011 era5 is fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis data used in this present study has higher level of accuracy muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 era5 is satellite altimetry data with 50 km spatial resolution was used in hourly scale for each of the selected atmospheric depression events near coastal area of sundarbans 2 4 1 2 geopotential height gph gph approximates the actual height of a pressure surface above mean sea level geo potential height gph at 500 hpa was considered as cyclone indicator keable et al 2002 moore and dixon 2015 wang et al 2016 atmospheric geopotential model data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf with a grid size of 0 25 0 25 at pressure level of 50 hpa was used the linear distance of center of cyclone was calculated from the studied location the gph was calculated from the geopotential by dividing the gravitational acceleration of the earth 9 80665 m s2 the lowering of gravity adjusted gph from mean sea level during atmospheric low pressure events like atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone is considered as a local indicator the linear distance to the eye of cyclone was calculated from the studied location fig 2 available 0 6 12 and

gph bp and distance from the cyclone eye was determined by pearson correlation with the correlation coefficient denoted by ρ 2 4 2 rainfall the district wise monthly rainfall data was collected from the indian meteorological department imd for 2017 and 2018 https mausam imd gov in imd latest contents index rainfall state new php similarly daily gridded data for 2017 and 2018 was collected from the imd cpc 0 50 x0 50 global daily unified gauge based analysis of precipitation data was used for the daily rainfall of 2019 2 5 noise removal from groundwater level by fast fourier transform fft gwl of both shallow and deeper wells are significantly influenced by ocean tide in the semi diurnal scale and by the ocean wave surges during the atmospheric low pressure events two scales of noise were removed from the wave and groundwater hydrograph using fft and then inverse fast fourier transform was applied ifft for the conversion to actual groundwater and wave hydrograph for the study requirement we have removed the gwl and ocean wave height noise due to daily earth tide fluctuations and seasonal changes in hydrograph the fft was mainly applied to identify the storm surge induced spikes in groundwater hydrographs with the ocean wave height after the removal of daily and seasonal noise the ifft was applied to get the actual level of groundwater and ocean wave in selected atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone the fft and ifft was computed using the numpy package of python3 2 6 artificial intelligence and machine learning based models we have used three machine learning models in our study to evaluate how well the gph bp distance from cyclone center and wave height as predictors of gwl for the sw and dw the applied models are artificial neural network ann support vector regression svr and random forest regression rfr we have tried these models to prove our hypothesis by using all ten events as calibration data and validated by two among them each of the events has its own respective 6 h interval data starting at 0 h and the time span of the data depends on the appearance of the particular cyclone in bob as a low pressure zone and continues till its disappearance a total of 563 data points were used to calibrate the models for the sw and 334 data points were used to calibrate the models for the dw two events during october 2017 e3 with 28 data points and another in may 2019 severe cyclone fani e9 with 25 data points were used to validate the models for both deep and shallow aquifers 2 6 1 artificial neural network ann for the ann model a feed forward network with a back propagation training algorithm and 8 hidden layers was used in this study back propagation bp algorithm reduces the network error by utilizing the gradient descent approach and used widely to train the neural networks govindaraju and rao 2013 maier and dandy 2000 haykin 1994 the goal of developing an ann is to generalize the relationship of input and output variables in the form of 1 y j f x i where x is a vector of n dimensional input variables xi i 1 2 n yj is the output vector of m dimensions yj j 1 2 m in any mfn structure a layered architecture of the processing units or the neurons is adopted having an input generally one hidden and an output layer the input layer introduces normalized or filtered input variable s in the network the hidden layer processes the input data and the model output for the provided input data are gained through the output layer processing units in the hidden and output layers are connected to each units in the preceding layer and a weighting factor is carried by each connection in feed forward back propagation networks these weighted connections are activated from the input layer to output layer in forward direction only wang et al 2009 assuming a feed forward network consisting i input neurons j hidden neurons and k output neurons the neural network can be expressed as 2 y k s 1 j 1 j w j s 2 i 1 i w i x i where x i is the input vector yk is the output vector and w i and w j are weights of the neurons in the input hidden layer and output layer respectively s1 ands2 are the activation functions we have used a logistic sigmoid type function here 3 s x 1 1 e x the training function used here was levenberg marquardt optimization the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm is the modified classic newton algorithm and most widely used ranganathan 2004 2 6 2 support vector regression svr the support vector machine svm here support vector regression svr as we have performed regression using svm is a popular supervised learning system developed based on statistical learning theory vapnik 1998 in contradiction with ann where the network structure is decided before training the model svm does not have a priori determined structure input vectors supporting the svm structure is automatically selected through a training process of the model svm functions based on vapnik 1998 theory is described below where r x k y k n k 1 is used as the set of n samples x k is the input space vector of gwl geopotential height pressure and distance from cyclone centre and y k is the desired output which is the predicted gwl in our study the function of a svm regression estimator is given by zaji et al 2016 mojumder et al 2016 4 f x w x b 5 r s v m s c 1 2 w 2 c 1 n i 1 n l x k y k where w is weight vector x is a high dimensional space feature for mapping the input space vector x is a bias and c 1 n i 1 n l x k y k denotes the empirical error the core concept of svms are based on the idea of identifying a separable hyper plane of two classes in a classification problem wang et al 2009 these hyper planes of svms constructed in an infinite dimensional space can be used for classification regression or other type of problems the construction of the hyper planes is achieved by mapping the original data into a feature space in terms of using suitable kernel function unlike other machine learning algorithms the performance of svm models are not affected by local minima and have the ability to design and use the modular component tripathi et al 2006 it is a very challenging task to find the optimal hyper plane due to the dual optimization problem lagrange multipliers are effectively used to overcome this problem to solve eq 5 e insensitivity loss function was introduced by vapnik 6 min w b ξ ξ 1 2 w 2 2 c i 1 n ξ k ξ k s u b j e c t t o y k w t x k b ε ξ k w t x k b y k ε ξ k ξ k ξ k 0 k 1 2 3 n where ξ k and ξ k are slack variables penalizing the training errors by the loss function over the error tolerance ε c is the error penalty factor for regulating the difference between the regularization term and empirical error equation 6 is generally resolved in dual form imposing karush kuhn tucker kkt optimality condition and lagrangian multipliers input vectors which have the lagrangian multipliers within the kkt condition support the estimator structure and are called support vectors 2 6 3 random forest regression random forests are another popular machine learning algorithm that can handle both classification and regression problems very efficiently which was introduced by breiman 2001 rf is a non linear ensemble learning technique that constructs a large number of random de correlated decision trees and gives the final output as the average of the results of all the trees hastie et al 2009 the principal of rf models is to construct multivariate decision trees using the predictor variables xi and response variables y based on a set of decision rules these decision rules are created by recursive portioning of the input data set into smaller sets successively by binary splits using a single predictor variable and a simple model e g a constant is then applied to the response and predictor variables each binary split is determined by minimization of a cost function between the actual response and the predicted response resulting from a specific split this results in a tree model with each branch representing a split and the terminal nodes representing the average outcomes for a specific set of rules bishop 2006 prasad et al 2006 hutengs and vohland 2016 regression trees are well known to handle large data sets and modelling complex relationships between in the data accounting non linear relationships between the response and predictor variables but when fully grown they tends to overfit due to the complexity of tree james et al 2013 rf handle this problem by introducing randomization into each tree and averaging a large number of these trees randomization is achieved by growing each tree with a random bootstrapped sample of the training data and a random subset of predictor variables to create the splitting rules breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 to grow an individual unpruned regression tree t b with a random bootstrapped sampled data following steps are involved 1 m number of predictor variables from total p variables are selected in the model 2 variables that provides best split and corresponding splitting points are selected and 3 the input data is then split finally ensemble of many such trees b is computed to make predictions hastie et al 2009 7 y x i 1 b b 1 b t b x i variable importance is another key feature of rf models the importance of any variable to predict the response variable is calculated by the improvement in performance with each split of all the individual trees the variables are then attributed with the performance improvements for the splits at particular nodes and aggregated over all the hastie et al 2009 to fit a rf model total number of trees b and variables to be selected at each split is required to be specified 2 6 4 model performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the three models for predicting the gwl during cyclonic events we have used four parameters namely correlation co efficient r2 root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the correlation measures the linear association among the observed and predicted values but does not consider the bias in the prediction and thus not robust mae is the measure of average magnitudes of errors in prediction and for this preferred for calculating average errors than rmse willmott and matsuura 2005 the nse is a skill accuracy measure that compares the magnitude of residual variance noise with the measured variance in data information mccuen et al 2006 the nse value ranges from infinity to 1 a nse value of 1 denotes a perfect match between observed and predicted values while nse 0 denotes observed values are better predictor from the predicted ones 8 r 2 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 10 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 11 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i is the observed value o is the mean of the observed values and p i is the predicted value 3 results 3 1 variation of ocean wave height the ocean sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights lengths and directions the wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind sea waves directly affected by local winds and swell so changes in wave height are directly related to the change in the atmospheric pressure gradient the wave height also has a diurnal and semidiurnal variation with tidal cycle and is simultaneously respondent to the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclones the ocean wave heights have seasonal variations of minimum 0 m to maximum 1 9 m the lowest wave height was observed during the pre monsoon season of 2018 while the highest was also observed during the monsoon season of 2018 the recorded highest wave height was 1 9 m observed during the month of july 2018 due to the storm surge the sudden rise of wave height is higher than the seasonal fluctuations during the atmospheric depression and the tropical cyclones the maximum rise was observed 5 5 m during the tropical cyclone fani may 2019 while the second highest rise was 4 2 m observed during the tropical cyclone bulbul november 2019 fig 1c the average minimum and maximum rise in wave height are 1 and 3 m respectively during all atmospheric low pressure events which was higher than the temporal average ocean wave height 3 2 groundwater level fluctuation gwl of the studied area have substantial variations across the seasons during the studied period both at shallow and deeper depth aquifers the gwl varies from 0 21 to 1 84 m bgl for shallow aquifer and 1 68 to 2 65 m bgl for deeper aquifer respectively fig 1c the groundwater fluctuation shows a maximum rise of 1 6 and 1 m for the shallow and deeper aquifer respectively excluding the sudden peaks during ocean wave surge fig 1c during the monsoon the gwl rise is aggravated by the local rainfall recharge of the shallow unconfined aquifer while deeper gwl rise was a result of regional recharge and inland terrestrial freshwater flow towards downstream das and mukherjee 2019 the temporal scale variation of gwl for both depths is synchronous and no substantial lag was observed synchronous gwl fluctuations of the shallow and deep aquifer across the season is a possible indication of hydraulic connection reported by das and mukherjee 2019 fig 1c the gwl of shallow and deep aquifers has a hydraulic connection with the ocean wave surge das et al 2021b fig 3 a b the semi diurnal scale variation of ocean tide is strongly connected to the gwl fluctuation of shallow depth aquifer fig 3a while deeper gwl fluctuation is similar in daily to seasonal scale figs 1c 3b the sudden gwl spikes are observed during each of the ocean wave surge the highest gwl rise was recorded in both for the shallow and deeper aquifer when ocean wave height rise is 4 2 m at the time of tropical cyclone bulbul e10 the ocean wave surge induced gwl rise is more than half of the seasonal fluctuations during bulbul at dw115 gwl rose for 0 67 m 67 25 cm and at sw15 groundwater overflowed the top of the piezometer which is above the ground surface the second highest gwl fluctuation was recorded during e2 ad in july 2017 where gwl rise were 88 8 33 9 64 3 and 26 8 cm at sw15 dw115 sw14 and sw24 respectively fig 4 a during the tropical cyclone titli october 2018 e8 the rise in gwl was observed to be 9 6 and 9 2 cm for sw15 and dw115 fig 4 f respectively the rise in gwl during tropical cyclone fani was 13 1 and 6 4 cm for sw15 and dw115 respectively may 2019 e9 fig 5 c a similar trend of gwl rise was recorded during all of the extreme climate events table 1 and fig 4a f 3 3 variation in geopotential height gph the changes in gph was recorded only from the studied location to identify the local influences due to regional changes in atmospheric pressure to document the height difference in meter at 500 hpa for tropical cyclone and atmospheric depression from their birth to decay the variation of the gph is based on the intensity of the atmospheric depression and distance from the studied location closer distance of atmospheric depression and cyclones eye lower the gph near respective study the recorded highest gph was 5892 m and the recorded lowest was 5798 m the recorded lowest gph was observed during the tropical cyclone bulbul when the eye of the cyclone was on at 51 km far from the measured distance while for tropical cyclone fani the recorded lowest gph was 5813 m the closest distance was 127 km which is higher than the distance of tropical cyclone bulbul similarly based on the closeness of the trajectory through which the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone were moved from the origin to decay have their own respective fall in gph table 1 and fig 5 3 4 barometric pressure bp change temporally bp varies within the range of 10 167 10 350 m the highest bp was recorded during the post monsoon seasons and the lowest was recorded during each monsoon season of the studied year atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone are the product of atmospheric low pressure events and the range of fluctuations of bp during each of the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone was close to the temporal variations each of the fall of bp is related to the ocean wave surge the highest fall of bp was recorded when ocean wave height is 4 2 m during tropical cyclone bulbul the maximum fluctuation of barometric pressure was recorded during the tropical cyclone bulbul 0 244 m and fani 0 154 m the fluctuation of bp for each of the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone events was presented in figs 4 and 5 3 5 statistical significance of ocean wave surge with groundwater level rise and other extreme climate proxies the ocean wave height has a significant inversely proportional relationship with the local bp change ρ 0 335 p 0 05 distance ρ 0 341 p 0 05 and gph ρ 0 358 p 0 05 the gwl rise and ocean wave surge is also positively correlated non significant this distance of atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone shows a significant positive correlation with local gph ρ 0 480 p 0 05 and bp ρ 0 260 p 0 05 the lowest value of bp is observed during the highest release of groundwater pressure head during the extreme climate events fig 5 the lowering of gravity adjusted gph during atmospheric low pressure events atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone and is positively correlated with local bp fall ρ 0 575 p 0 05 the extreme climate event dependent changes in gph is significantly related to the gwl fluctuations both for the shallow sw15 ρ 0 169 p 0 05 and deeper well dw115 ρ 0 287 p 0 05 3 6 application of artificial intelligence to quantify the groundwater level 3 6 1 quantification and calibration of groundwater level during variable ocean wave form for shallow aquifer total 546 data were used for the development of the model for the shallow aquifer an ann model with one hidden layer and 12 neurons was constructed to predict the water level in the shallow aquifer the r2 rmse mae and nse values of the ann model for the calibration data were were 0 53 0 19 0 15 and 0 53 respectively the svr model was built with rbf kernel and cost 25 gamma 4 and epsilon 0 1 as tuning parameters the values performance parameters for this svr model 0 83 0 13 0 12 and 0 78 as r2 rmse mae and nse respectively the rfr model was developed using 1200 trees and one variable to split each node the r2 rmse mae and nse values of the rfr model for the calibration data were 0 79 0 14 0 11 and 0 76 respectively for the calibration of model 23 data from e3 event and 28 data from e9 event was used both for the shallow and deep aquifers the performance of the models were considerable for the calibration data but all the models failed to predict the water level in the e3 as suggested by the nse values in table 2 which shows the performance evaluation of the three models on the two validation cyclonic events fig 6 a c for the e9 of the validation data the svr model outperformed the other two models fig 6b d rfr model identified distance from cyclone as the most important predictor for water level fluctuations in the shallow aquifer which is similar to the deep aquifer 3 6 2 quantification and calibration of groundwater level during variable ocean wave form for deep aquifer total 334 data were used for the development of the model for deep aquifer the ann was constructed using one hidden layer and 15 neurons the values of r2 rmse mae and nse of the ann model were 0 57 0 18 0 03 and 0 57 respectively for the calibration data the svr model was developed using the radial bias function rbf kernel and a set of tuning parameters cost 5 gamma 2 epsilon 0 1 the r2 rmse mae and nse values were 0 84 0 18 0 16 and 0 55 for the calibration data for the svr model the rfr model was developed with 1200 trees and using one variable to split each node the rfr model was able to predict reasonably the calibration phrase while performed satisfactorily in the validation phase the values of r2 rmse mae and nse of the rfr model were 0 89 0 12 0 09 and 0 82 respectively for the calibration data the svr model performed better than the rfr and ann model in predicting both the validation events e3 and e9 fig 6e f g h the svm and rfr models performance was much better than the ann model for both calibration and validation data the performances of the three models on the validation data were evaluated in table 2 3 6 3 model testing total 17 data from the tropical cyclone titli e5 was used for the testing of model after the calibration and validation the output showed that the model is able to predict the gwl of deep aquifers and failed to predict the shallow gwl the model output showed rfr r2 0 76 have higher predictability of gwl than the ann r2 0 50 and svm r2 0 54 for deep groundwater none of the shallow groundwater prediction showed the acceptable range r2 0 3 for all three models the possible reasons for the lower predictability of the model for the shallow depth were discussed later in the limitation of the study section 4 4 4 discussions 4 1 influence of ocean tide and wave surge on groundwater level after removing specific noise by fft of ocean wave surge the observed gwl of shallow and deeper depths has semidiurnal to diurnal fluctuations synchronous to the tidal cycle fig 3a b the amplitudes of gwl due to tidal cycle were higher and sharp in deeper aquifer than the shallower ones fig 3 the overall rise of gwl of the shallow aquifer was higher that of the diurnal tidal fluctuations and is similar to the trend of ocean tide the synchronous change in shallow gwl with the ocean wave defines the strong hydraulic connection with the seawater of bob fig 3 the sharper amplitudes of tidal cycle translated to the deeper groundwater is possibly be a resultant of the extension of semi permeable roof of deeper aquifer to the sea van der kamp 1972 li and jiao 2001 guo et al 2007 xia et al 2007 the sharper tidal amplitudes in groundwater is possibly due to the termination or breaching of the clay of the extended roof of deeper units ratner narovlansky et al 2020 ocean wave surges have severe impacts on the gwl which is rapid the linear regression study shows that there was a positive relationship non significant between ocean wave surge and gwl rise fig 7 d higher the rise of ocean wave height potentially give rise to the gwl both in shallow and deeper aquifer and the reported highest response was observed during the tropical cyclone fani e9 and bulbul e10 table 1 the ocean wave surge induced gwl rise are instantaneous for both of the shallow and deeper aquifer the variation of gwl in shallow aquifer is found to be higher than the deeper ones groundwater from all the depths has changes in water level due to wave surges and earth tide but gwl change s amplitude is higher in extreme climate events when wave height was higher fig 8 the tide induced semidiurnal to diurnal fluctuations of gwl of both shallow and deeper groundwater was removed by the fft the extreme acute rise of gwl are respondent of the ocean wave surge with a different lag time response fig 5 8 the rise of ocean wave height amplitude has a sharp rise and it s also reflected from the gwl of both shallow and deep aquifers fig 3 during each of the ocean wave surge highest peak was observed after the gwl peak fig 3 extreme climate are formed mostly at the southern part of the bob and eventually it moved to the northern bob before the tropical cyclone makes landfall the influence of increasing ocean wave was translated to the gwl through the extended aquifer matrix to the deep sea the peak of gwl rise with ocean wave height is sharper and closer to the ocean wave height when the event was passed closer or make land fall near to the study location like during the tropical cyclone bulbul e10 and fani e9 fig 8i j the wave surge during the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone moves in towards the shoreline with the higher water column height the ocean wave surge may generate increased pore pressure in the coastal aquifers debnath and mukherjee 2016 yu et al 2016 which would eventually be translated to increased pressure head and consequent rise in the hydraulic head burgess et al 2017 the applied artificial intelligence model is unable to predict gwl for all the tested events for shallow depths for sw all three models were able to predict the gwl for e9 tropical cyclonee fani may 2019 table 2 and gwl demonstrated good correlation r 0 78 fig 6 however the models did not perform well to measure the gwl fluctuations during e3 r 0 10 0 21 for shallow aquifer fig 6 surface runoff moisture holding capacity and changes in the bulk density of vadose zone is possibly playing a major role in aquifer poroelastic response during the extreme climate events https www dgs udel edu delaware geology effect tropical storms irene and lee groundwater levels well qb35 08 may the incorporation of the influence of vadose zone would help in better predictability of gwl in all the tested events mostly on the shallow unconfined aquifer 4 2 fate of groundwater level fluctuation due to ocean wave surge incorporation of the mechanical loading is important for the actual measure of the groundwater storage or the groundwater replenishment measure but the sudden rise of the gwl due to ocean wave surge was not considered even in the storage calculations so the quantification of the gwl rise due to wave surge is a possible measure of the acute and long term aquifer vulnerability the gwl was risen to the vadose zone for some of the shallow wells and showed evidences of well overflow in shallow sw15 well due to rise of ocean wave height during the tropical cyclone bulbul the risen gwl has interaction with the water in vadose zone and similarly with flooded water over the surface for the overflown groundwater eventually after the fall of ocean wave height gwl have a declining trend which eventually transport the contaminated unsaturated water to the saturated fresh groundwater layer the transportation of surficial contaminants from the surface after the ocean wave surge was observed during the haiyan s storm surge san antonio texas and the indian ocean 2004 tsunami at southern india and sri lanka due to enhanced groundwater pumping illangasekare et al 2006 vithanage et al 2012a vithanage et al 2012b 4 3 implication of ocean wave surge on the aquifer vulnerability gwl in unconfined aquifer have very low response to bp fluctuations due to overlaying thin unsaturated zone while deeper groundwater has significant amount of response to bp as it lies underneath the confining units jacob 1950 vertical hydraulic conductivity plays an important role in shallow and deeper groundwater as the impermeable clay layer is distributed ubiquitously in different depths layers the study area has a very low dispersivity due to low vertical hydraulic conductivity gwl in shallow and deeper aquifers is significantly responding in each of the major ocean wave surge even in this low dispersivity fluctuations of gwl in each of the extreme ocean wave surge condition can be used to determine the changes in vertical dispersivity and it would be a measure of aquifer vulnerability our study depicting the gwl rise in each of the ocean wave surge and change are instantaneous and similar between the shallow and deep aquifer and are measurable by the applied machine learning models which have good predictability especially for the deeper groundwater the results suggest that the selected variables dist wave height bp and gph can be effectively used for deeper aquifer as predictors of gwl response during future extreme climate conditions the variable importance feature of the rfr model identified distance of cyclone as the most important variable to measure gwl in the deeper aquifer followed by the wave height gph and bp during extreme climate conditions 4 4 limitations of the study the aquifer poroelastic response on groundwater storage of coastal aquifers has already been established by the burgess et al 2017 the mechanical loading varies within the range of 0 67 0 87 of the bengal basin is a respondent to the earth and ocean tides burgess et al 2017 this study area s measured loading efficiency is 0 98 for shallow unconfined and 0 53 for deeper confined semiconfined aquifer the loading efficiency was calculated by the simple indirect linear equations of b c 1 where b is the barometric efficiency and c is the loading efficiency by following the method of jacob 1950 the b was calculated by the simple linear regression of water column pressure and the corresponding change in atmospheric pressure merritt 2004 but during each of the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone there was a certain amount of rainfall that might have a significant impact of the mechanical loading need to incorporate for the true measurement of groundwater storage the reported study of van der kamp and maathuis 1991 anochikwa 2010 and anochikwa et al 2012 measured the influence of soil moisture at unsaturated zone have significant contribution on aquifer matrix loading to quantify the actual groundwater level the stagnant water over the groundwater surface due to rainfall and percolated water in the upper unconfining unit s vadose zone influences groundwater storage due to unavailability of point or location wise rainfall data soil moisture and unsaturated water in vadose zone we cannot incorporate and quantify the poroelastic response during extreme conditions which have direct impact on the gwl response for shallow depth during the tropical cyclone and atmospheric depressions while deep aquifers are free from it so this paper only dealt with the fluctuation and the magnitude of gwl during each of the ocean wave surge events and examined the applicability and importance of the applied predictor variables for the quantification of gwl 5 conclusions the study delineates the influence of variable ocean wave form on multi depth 14 115 m bgl gwl fluctuation our study in the multi layered delta front aquifers adjoining the tropical bob shows that the gwl rise and change are instantaneous and synchronous at all depths of the aquifers with no substantial time lag the rise of gwl is higher in shallow depth than the deep depth the highest gwl rise in shallow and deeper aquifer in this physically hydraulically disconnected aquifer was recorded during the high ocean wave surge tropical cyclone bulbul of 4 2 m gwl rise is higher than the diurnal tidal fluctuations both in shallow and deep groundwater during each of the ocean wave surge events the impact of ec induced ocean wave surge on gwl even in this low vertically dispersive and complex hydrostratigraphic system of the sundarbans delta front aquifers could measure aquifer vulnerability applied machine learning techniques are also performed well and have yielded significant correlation for validation of tested events predictability is found to be better for deeper groundwater than at shallower depths such climate induced gradient flow can possibly increase groundwater s vulnerability which is the main source of drinking water for hundreds and thousands of inhabitants in the mega delta by mixing with the contaminants just beneath the land surface thus the increasing rates of extreme climatic events in recent times and in the near future can pose a previously unexplored potential threat to groundwater sourced drinking water quality exposing millions of groundwater dependent inhabitants in coastal areas to risk 6 credit statement kd and am conceived the idea of the study and the

4092,groundwater level gwl of coastal aquifers are strongly influenced by the ocean tide at sub daily to seasonal scale similarly gwl are influenced by storm induced ocean wave surge lasting few hours to a day there has not been a detailed study on the conjunctive impact of such tidal and storm waves on coastal groundwater and its vulnerability through our coastal and field laboratory observations at one of the world s most extreme climate affected regions the ganges river mega delta we delineate the influence of ocean wave surge impacts on the shallow 24 m below ground level m bgl and deep 115 m bgl aquifers gwl our study on the multi layered delta front aquifers adjoining the tropical bob shows that the high temporal resolution gwl fluctuation due to wave surges are instantaneous rapid and synchronous at all depths of the aquifers the potential rise of ocean waves caused by tropical cyclone bulbul november 2019 significantly increases the gwl both in shallow and deeper aquifer using multivariate statistics and machine learning techniques we have attempted to quantify the rise of gwl during each of the ocean wave surge event the model shows good predictability for deeper groundwater however it is unable to quantify the shallower gwl of each of the ocean wave surge during storm events such phenomenon indicates aquifer vulnerability thereby posing an emerging threat to drinking water availability to millions of groundwater dependent inhabitants in coastal areas globally which may rapidly intensify with increasing rates of tropical cyclones and sea level rise in recent times and impending future keywords groundwater storm surge sundarbans cyclone bay of bengal 1 introduction groundwater level gwl fluctuations in the coastal aquifers are highly concerning being hydrulically connected to the sea thus are vulnerable to salinization ratner narovlansky et al 2020 werner et al 2013 the shallow aquifers connection is often evident near shore while deeper aquifers are extended to far offshore distance and have assumed connection with sea ratner narovlansky et al 2020 post et al 2013 das et al 2021a b coastal aquifers are responsive to the ocean tides

mechanical loading burgess et al 2017 the mechanical loading varies within the range of 0 67 0 87 in the bengal aquifer system bas which is a function of the earth and ocean tides burgess et al 2017 the potential rise of incoming ocean wave give rise to the gwl by creating matrix pressure burgess et al 2017 debnath and mukherjee 2016 the incorporation of seasonal and tidal amplitudes of gwl in the measurement of terrestrial water storage is an essential component and established whereas instantaneous rise of gwl due to ocean wave surge over the periods ranging from hours to days has not reported yet so the quantification of the gwl rise due to ocean wave surge could be measure of the acute and long term aquifer vulnerability delta front aquifers of the indus ganges brahmaputra igb basin are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters like cyclones and extreme rainfall events tropical cyclones are predominant in the northern indian ocean during pre especially during may and post monsoon seasons especially during october and november and are important weather events of the tropics singh and rout 1999 the variation in hydraulic heads enhances the rapid transport of saline water to the fresh groundwater aquifer after each of the natural calamities like typhoon and cyclones are reported illangasekare et al 2006 vithanage et al 2012a vithanage et al 2012b cardenas et al 2015 while acute response during the ocean wave surge is overlooked apart from addressing the already established long term changes in groundwater response to ocean surge inundation it is now important to address the short term acute response of ocean wave surge events on gwl machine learning techniques have recently gained much highlight in the field of hydrology especially in monitoring and prediction of groundwater both quantitatively and qualitatively and also in the field of forecasting during the extreme climatic events like flood and draught events sadler et al 2018 chakraborty

techniques are used in this study with their own advantages and limitations to provide a numerical support of the hypothesis of the quantification of ocean wave surge induced gwl rise during extreme climate events like tropical cyclone and atmospheric depressions the present study is aimed to investigate the direct hydraulic connection with the ocean tides and gwl fluctuation in semi diurnal to diurnal scale and even during the ocean wave surge extreme climate conditions are one of the reasons of ocean wave surge total ten ocean wave surges during the extreme events are considered for the respective study period of 2017 to 2019 which includes tropical cyclone titli october 2018 fani may 2019 and bulbul november 2019 the considered extreme climate conditions are atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone which potentially giving rise to the ocean wave surge the geopotential height gph at 500 hpa is considered as a proxy of cyclone indicator keable et al 2002 moore and dixon 2015 wang et al 2016 the lowering of gravity adjusted gph from mean sea level during atmospheric low pressure events like atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone is considered as a local indicator the

been explained by mukherjee et al 2007a to validate the aquifer aquitard framework lithological information of the study area was collected from the mukherjee et al 2007a and government of west bengal database lithologically the aquifer of the studied area was classified into three zones viz i shallow upper aquifer ii the main aquifer and iii the deeper aquifer the southern part of the bengal basin has as the shallow upper aquifer up to 60 m below ground level m bgl the main aquifer is semi confined to locally unconfined which consists of medium to coarse grained sand with alternate gravel layers its thickness varies from 75 m in southern part up to depth of 140 to 150 m bgl the deeper confined aquifer 150 m separated from the main aquifer by a clay layer consists of medium to coarse sands with inter beds of silt and clay the main aquifer thickness in southern part of the basin 200 m have several intermediate depth clay aquitards which divide main aquifer from the laterally connected confined aquifers mukherjee et al 2007a 2 3 piezometry absolute gwl and atmospheric pressure were recorded at half hourly intervals for three consecutive years 2017 2019 fig 1c the piezometers were suspended approximately 5 10 m below the static water level whereas a barologger was installed in an air filled section of shallow well with same data record interval solinist levelogger 3001 was used for continuous gwl monitoring for the shallow as well as deeper wells accuracy of 0 05 full scale a barologger was used with an accuracy of 0 05 kpa for continuous atmospheric pressure measurement the gwl was normalized by the measured atmospheric pressure through barologger and calibrated with the manual infield measurement the wells were constructed using rotary drilling and permanent casing is made by pvc pipes while temporary casing through bentonite during drilling process they were flushed after construction for 8 h at one hour interval for each of the wells separately the installed shallow and deep wells are denoted as the sw and dw for this respective study two closely placed observation wells were screened at the depth of 15 sw15 and 115 dw115 meter below ground level m bgl at location c and other two shallow observation wells are placed at different locations at a depth of 14 sw14 and 24 m sw24 at location a and e fig 1b wells are located differently from nearshore sw14 and sw24 and 3 5 km inland sw15 and dw115 from the shoreline fig 1b the sw15 and dw115 have recorded data from may 2017 to december 2019 sw14 and sw24 have recorded data from may 2017 to january 2018 only 2 4 data used 2 4 1 input variables the selected input variables for the present study are ocean wave height gph distance from the cyclonic center and bp change ocean wave height or the tidal height are well established influencing factors of gwl fluctuations due to its control on aquifer matrix pressure reported in multiple studies van der kamp 1972 li and jiao 2001 guo et al 2007 xia et al 2007 burgess et al 2017 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 the rise of ocean wave height is much higher in cyclonic and atmospheric low pressure events than the normal lunar tidal fluctuations and for the reason being it was considered as one of the major input variables for this present study the gph is a gravity adjusted reference height to measure the atmospheric pressure anomaly by its fluctuations from the reference height gph is globally accepted indicator parameter of cyclones and is used in this study to indicate the atmospheric disturbances near the study area keable et al 2002 moore and dixon 2015 wang et al 2016 the distance of the eye of a cyclone to the study location is also important as closer the distance higher the impact of landfall and fall of local bp so the distance of eye of a cyclone and local change in bp are on of the major important variable to control the gwl fluctuation 2 4 1 1 ocean wave height reanalyzed wave data are

gph bp and distance from the cyclone eye was determined by pearson correlation with the correlation coefficient denoted by ρ 2 4 2 rainfall the district wise monthly rainfall data was collected from the indian meteorological department imd for 2017 and 2018 https mausam imd gov in imd latest contents index rainfall state new php similarly daily gridded data for 2017 and 2018 was collected from the imd cpc 0 50 x0 50 global daily unified gauge based analysis of precipitation data was used for the daily rainfall of 2019 2 5 noise removal from groundwater level by fast fourier transform fft gwl of both shallow and deeper wells are significantly influenced by ocean tide in the semi diurnal scale and by the ocean wave surges during the atmospheric low pressure events two scales of noise were removed from the wave and groundwater hydrograph using fft and then inverse fast fourier transform was applied ifft for the conversion to actual groundwater and wave hydrograph for the study requirement we have removed the gwl and ocean wave height noise due to daily earth tide fluctuations and seasonal changes in hydrograph the fft was mainly applied to identify the storm surge induced spikes in groundwater hydrographs with the ocean wave height after the removal of daily and seasonal noise the ifft was applied to get the actual level of groundwater and ocean wave in selected atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone the fft and ifft was computed using the numpy package of python3 2 6 artificial intelligence and machine learning based models we have used three machine learning models in our study to evaluate how well the gph bp distance from cyclone center and wave height as predictors of gwl for the sw and dw the applied models are artificial neural network ann support vector regression svr and random forest regression rfr we have tried these models to prove our hypothesis by using all ten events as calibration data and validated by two among them each of the events has its own respective 6 h interval data starting at 0 h and the time span of the data depends on the appearance of the particular cyclone in bob as a low pressure zone and continues till its disappearance a total of 563 data points were used to calibrate the models for the sw and 334 data points were used to calibrate the models for the dw two events during october 2017 e3 with 28 data points and another in may 2019 severe cyclone fani e9 with 25 data points were used to validate the models for both deep and shallow aquifers 2 6 1 artificial neural network ann for the ann model a feed forward network with a back propagation training algorithm and 8 hidden layers was used in this study back propagation bp algorithm reduces the network error by utilizing the gradient descent approach and used widely to train the neural networks govindaraju and rao 2013 maier and dandy 2000 haykin 1994 the goal of developing an ann is to generalize the relationship of input and output variables in the form of 1 y j f x i where x is a vector of n dimensional input variables xi i 1 2 n yj is the output vector of m dimensions yj j 1 2 m in any mfn structure a layered architecture of the processing units or the neurons is adopted having an input generally one hidden and an output layer the input layer introduces normalized or filtered input variable s in the network the hidden layer processes the input data and the model output for the provided input data are gained through the output layer processing units in the hidden and output layers are connected to each units in the preceding layer and a weighting factor is carried by each connection in feed forward back propagation networks these weighted connections are activated from the input layer to output layer in forward direction only wang et al 2009 assuming a feed forward network consisting i input neurons j hidden neurons and k output neurons the neural network can be expressed as 2 y k s 1 j 1 j w j s 2 i 1 i w i x i where x i is the input vector yk is the output vector and w i and w j are weights of the neurons in the input hidden layer and output layer respectively s1 ands2 are the activation functions we have used a logistic sigmoid type function here 3 s x 1 1 e x the training function used here was levenberg marquardt optimization the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm is the modified classic newton algorithm and most widely used ranganathan 2004 2 6 2 support vector regression svr the support vector machine svm here support vector regression svr as we have performed regression using svm is a popular supervised learning system developed based on statistical learning theory vapnik 1998 in contradiction with ann where the network structure is decided before training the model svm does not have a priori determined structure input vectors supporting the svm structure is automatically selected through a training process of the model svm functions based on vapnik 1998 theory is described below where r x k y k n k 1 is used as the set of n samples x k is the input space vector of gwl geopotential height pressure and distance from cyclone centre and y k is the desired output which is the predicted gwl in our study the function of a svm regression estimator is given by zaji et al 2016 mojumder et al 2016 4 f x w x b 5 r s v m s c 1 2 w 2 c 1 n i 1 n l x k y k where w is weight vector x is a high dimensional space feature for mapping the input space vector x is a bias and c 1 n i 1 n l x k y k denotes the empirical error the core concept of svms are based on the idea of identifying a separable hyper plane of two classes in a classification problem wang et al 2009 these hyper planes of svms constructed in an infinite dimensional space can be used for classification regression or other type of problems the construction of the hyper planes is achieved by mapping the original data into a feature space in terms of using suitable kernel function unlike other machine learning algorithms the performance of svm models are not affected by local minima and have the ability to design and use the modular component tripathi et al 2006 it is a very challenging task to find the optimal hyper plane due to the dual optimization problem lagrange multipliers are effectively used to overcome this problem to solve eq 5 e insensitivity loss function was introduced by vapnik 6 min w b ξ ξ 1 2 w 2 2 c i 1 n ξ k ξ k s u b j e c t t o y k w t x k b ε ξ k w t x k b y k ε ξ k ξ k ξ k 0 k 1 2 3 n where ξ k and ξ k are slack variables penalizing the training errors by the loss function over the error tolerance ε c is the error penalty factor for regulating the difference between the regularization term and empirical error equation 6 is generally resolved in dual form imposing karush kuhn tucker kkt optimality condition and lagrangian multipliers input vectors which have the lagrangian multipliers within the kkt condition support the estimator structure and are called support vectors 2 6 3 random forest regression random forests are another popular machine learning algorithm that can handle both classification and regression problems very efficiently which was introduced by breiman 2001 rf is a non linear ensemble learning technique that constructs a large number of random de correlated decision trees and gives the final output as the average of the results of all the trees hastie et al 2009 the principal of rf models is to construct multivariate decision trees using the predictor variables xi and response variables y based on a set of decision rules these decision rules are created by recursive portioning of the input data set into smaller sets successively by binary splits using a single predictor variable and a simple model e g a constant is then applied to the response and predictor variables each binary split is determined by minimization of a cost function between the actual response and the predicted response resulting from a specific split this results in a tree model with each branch representing a split and the terminal nodes representing the average outcomes for a specific set of rules bishop 2006 prasad et al 2006 hutengs and vohland 2016 regression trees are well known to handle large data sets and modelling complex relationships between in the data accounting non linear relationships between the response and predictor variables but when fully grown they tends to overfit due to the complexity of tree james et al 2013 rf handle this problem by introducing randomization into each tree and averaging a large number of these trees randomization is achieved by growing each tree with a random bootstrapped sample of the training data and a random subset of predictor variables to create the splitting rules breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 to grow an individual unpruned regression tree t b with a random bootstrapped sampled data following steps are involved 1 m number of predictor variables from total p variables are selected in the model 2 variables that provides best split and corresponding splitting points are selected and 3 the input data is then split finally ensemble of many such trees b is computed to make predictions hastie et al 2009 7 y x i 1 b b 1 b t b x i variable importance is another key feature of rf models the importance of any variable to predict the response variable is calculated by the improvement in performance with each split of all the individual trees the variables are then attributed with the performance improvements for the splits at particular nodes and aggregated over all the hastie et al 2009 to fit a rf model total number of trees b and variables to be selected at each split is required to be specified 2 6 4 model performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the three models for predicting the gwl during cyclonic events we have used four parameters namely correlation co efficient r2 root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the correlation measures the linear association among the observed and predicted values but does not consider the bias in the prediction and thus not robust mae is the measure of average magnitudes of errors in prediction and for this preferred for calculating average errors than rmse willmott and matsuura 2005 the nse is a skill accuracy measure that compares the magnitude of residual variance noise with the measured variance in data information mccuen et al 2006 the nse value ranges from infinity to 1 a nse value of 1 denotes a perfect match between observed and predicted values while nse 0 denotes observed values are better predictor from the predicted ones 8 r 2 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 10

height the ocean sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights lengths and directions the wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind sea waves directly affected by local winds and swell so changes in wave height are directly related to the change in the atmospheric pressure gradient the wave height also has a diurnal and semidiurnal variation with tidal cycle and is simultaneously respondent to the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclones the ocean wave heights have seasonal variations of minimum 0 m to maximum 1 9 m the lowest wave height was observed during the pre monsoon season of 2018 while the highest was also observed during the monsoon season of 2018 the recorded highest wave height was 1 9 m observed during the month of july 2018 due to the storm surge the sudden rise of wave height is higher than the seasonal fluctuations during the atmospheric depression and the tropical cyclones the maximum rise was observed 5 5 m during the tropical cyclone fani may 2019 while the second highest rise was 4 2 m observed during the tropical cyclone bulbul november 2019 fig 1c the average minimum and maximum rise in wave height are 1 and 3 m respectively during all atmospheric low pressure events which was higher than the temporal average ocean wave height 3 2 groundwater level fluctuation gwl of the studied area have substantial variations across the seasons during the studied period both at shallow and deeper depth aquifers the gwl varies from 0 21 to 1 84 m bgl for shallow aquifer and 1 68 to 2 65 m bgl for deeper aquifer respectively fig 1c the groundwater fluctuation shows a maximum rise of 1 6 and 1 m for the shallow and deeper aquifer respectively excluding the sudden peaks during ocean wave surge fig 1c during the monsoon the gwl rise is aggravated by the local rainfall recharge of the shallow unconfined aquifer while deeper gwl rise was a result of regional recharge and inland terrestrial freshwater flow towards downstream das and mukherjee 2019 the temporal scale variation of gwl for both depths is synchronous and no substantial lag was observed synchronous gwl fluctuations of the shallow and deep aquifer across the season is a possible indication of hydraulic connection reported by das and mukherjee 2019 fig 1c the gwl of shallow and deep aquifers has a hydraulic connection with the ocean wave surge das et al 2021b fig 3 a b the semi diurnal scale variation of ocean tide is strongly connected to the gwl fluctuation of shallow depth aquifer fig 3a while deeper gwl fluctuation is similar in daily to seasonal scale figs 1c 3b the sudden gwl spikes are observed during each of the ocean wave surge the highest gwl rise was recorded in both for the shallow and deeper aquifer when ocean wave height rise is 4 2 m at the time of tropical cyclone bulbul e10 the ocean wave surge induced gwl rise is more than half of the seasonal fluctuations during bulbul at dw115 gwl rose for 0 67 m 67 25 cm and at sw15 groundwater overflowed the top of the piezometer which is above the ground surface the second highest gwl fluctuation was recorded during e2 ad in july 2017 where gwl rise were 88 8 33 9 64 3 and 26 8 cm at sw15 dw115 sw14 and sw24 respectively fig 4 a during the tropical cyclone titli october 2018 e8 the rise in gwl was observed to be 9 6 and 9 2 cm for sw15 and dw115 fig 4 f respectively the rise in gwl during tropical cyclone fani was 13 1 and 6 4 cm for sw15 and dw115 respectively may 2019 e9 fig 5 c a similar trend of gwl rise was recorded during all of the extreme climate events table 1 and fig 4a f 3 3 variation in geopotential height gph the changes in gph was recorded only from the studied location to identify the local influences due to regional changes in atmospheric pressure to document the height difference in meter at 500 hpa for tropical cyclone and atmospheric depression from their birth to decay the variation of the gph is based on the intensity of the atmospheric depression and distance from the studied location closer distance of atmospheric depression and cyclones eye lower the gph near respective study the recorded highest gph was 5892 m and the recorded lowest was 5798 m the recorded lowest gph was observed during the tropical cyclone bulbul when the eye of the cyclone was on at 51 km far from the measured distance while for tropical cyclone fani the recorded lowest gph was 5813 m the closest distance was 127 km which is higher than the distance of tropical cyclone bulbul similarly based on the closeness of the trajectory through which the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone were moved from the origin to decay have their own respective fall in gph table 1 and fig 5 3 4 barometric pressure bp change temporally bp varies within the range of 10 167 10 350 m the highest bp was recorded during the post monsoon seasons and the lowest was recorded during each monsoon season of the studied year atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone are the product of atmospheric low pressure events and the range of fluctuations of bp during each of the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone was close to the temporal variations each of the fall of bp is related to the ocean wave surge the highest fall of bp was recorded when ocean wave height is 4 2 m during tropical cyclone bulbul the maximum fluctuation of barometric pressure was recorded during the tropical cyclone bulbul 0 244 m and fani 0 154 m the fluctuation of bp for each of the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone events was presented in figs 4 and 5 3 5 statistical significance of ocean wave surge with groundwater level rise and other extreme climate proxies the ocean wave height has a significant inversely proportional relationship with the local bp change ρ 0 335 p 0 05 distance ρ 0 341 p 0 05 and gph ρ 0 358 p 0 05 the gwl rise and ocean wave surge is also positively correlated non significant this distance of atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone shows a significant positive correlation with local gph ρ 0 480 p 0 05 and bp ρ 0 260 p 0 05 the lowest value of bp is observed during the highest release of groundwater pressure head during the extreme climate events fig 5 the lowering of gravity adjusted gph during atmospheric low pressure events atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone and is positively correlated with local bp fall ρ 0 575 p 0 05 the extreme climate event dependent changes in gph is significantly related to the gwl fluctuations both for the shallow sw15 ρ 0 169 p 0 05 and deeper well dw115 ρ 0 287 p 0 05 3 6 application of artificial intelligence to quantify the groundwater level 3 6 1 quantification and calibration of groundwater level during variable ocean wave form for shallow aquifer total 546 data were used for the development of the model for the shallow aquifer an ann model with one hidden layer and 12 neurons was constructed to predict the water level in the shallow aquifer the r2 rmse mae and nse values of the ann model for the calibration data were were 0 53 0 19 0 15 and 0 53 respectively the svr model was built with rbf kernel and cost 25 gamma 4 and epsilon 0 1 as tuning parameters the values performance parameters for this svr model 0 83 0 13 0 12 and 0 78 as r2 rmse mae and nse respectively the rfr model was developed using 1200 trees and one variable to split each node the r2 rmse mae and nse values of the rfr model for the calibration data were 0 79 0 14 0 11 and 0 76 respectively for the calibration of model 23 data from e3 event and 28 data from e9 event was used both for the shallow and deep aquifers the performance of the models were considerable for the calibration data but all the models failed to predict the water level in the e3 as suggested by the nse values in table 2 which shows the performance evaluation of the three models on the two validation cyclonic events fig 6 a c for the e9 of the validation data the svr model outperformed the other two models fig 6b d rfr model identified distance from cyclone as the most important predictor for water level fluctuations in the shallow aquifer which is similar to the deep aquifer 3 6 2 quantification and calibration of groundwater level during variable ocean wave form for deep aquifer total 334 data were used for the development of the model for deep aquifer the ann was constructed using one hidden layer and 15 neurons the values of r2 rmse mae and nse of the ann model were 0 57 0 18 0 03 and 0 57 respectively for the calibration data the svr model was developed using the radial bias function rbf kernel and a set of tuning parameters cost 5 gamma 2 epsilon 0 1 the r2 rmse mae and nse values were 0 84 0 18 0 16 and 0 55 for the calibration data for the svr model the rfr model was developed with 1200 trees and using one variable to split each node the rfr model was able to predict reasonably the calibration phrase while performed satisfactorily in the validation phase the values of r2 rmse mae and nse of the rfr model were 0 89 0 12 0 09 and 0 82 respectively for the calibration data the svr model performed better than the rfr and ann model in predicting both the validation events e3 and e9 fig 6e f g h the svm and rfr models performance was much better than the ann model for both calibration and validation data the performances of the three models on the validation data were evaluated in table 2 3 6 3 model testing total 17 data from the tropical cyclone titli e5 was used for the testing of model after the calibration and validation the output showed that the model is able to predict the gwl of deep aquifers and failed to predict the shallow gwl the model output showed rfr r2 0 76 have higher predictability of gwl than the ann r2 0 50 and svm r2 0 54 for deep groundwater none of the shallow groundwater prediction showed the acceptable range r2 0 3 for all three models the possible reasons for the lower predictability of the model for the shallow depth were discussed later in the limitation of the study section 4 4 4 discussions 4 1 influence of ocean tide and wave surge on groundwater level after removing specific noise by fft of ocean wave surge the observed gwl of shallow and deeper depths has semidiurnal to diurnal fluctuations synchronous to the tidal cycle fig 3a b the amplitudes of gwl due to tidal cycle were higher and sharp in deeper aquifer than the shallower ones fig 3 the overall rise of gwl of the shallow aquifer was higher that of the diurnal tidal fluctuations and is similar to the trend of ocean tide the synchronous change in shallow gwl with the ocean wave defines the strong hydraulic connection with the seawater of bob fig 3 the sharper amplitudes of tidal cycle translated to the deeper groundwater is possibly be a resultant of the extension of semi permeable roof of deeper aquifer to the sea van der kamp 1972 li and jiao 2001 guo et al 2007 xia et al 2007 the sharper tidal amplitudes in groundwater is possibly due to the termination or breaching of the clay of the extended roof of deeper units ratner narovlansky et al 2020 ocean wave surges have severe impacts on the gwl which is rapid the linear regression study shows that there was a positive relationship non significant between ocean wave surge and gwl rise fig 7 d higher the rise of ocean wave height potentially give rise to the gwl both in shallow and deeper aquifer and the reported highest response was observed during the tropical cyclone fani e9 and bulbul e10 table 1 the ocean wave surge induced gwl rise are instantaneous for both of the shallow and deeper aquifer the variation of gwl in shallow aquifer is found to be higher than the deeper ones groundwater from all the depths has changes in water level due to wave surges and earth tide but gwl change s amplitude is higher in extreme climate events when wave height was higher fig 8 the tide induced semidiurnal to diurnal fluctuations of gwl of both shallow and deeper groundwater was removed by the fft the extreme acute rise of gwl are respondent of the ocean wave surge with a different lag time response fig 5 8 the rise of ocean wave height amplitude has a sharp rise and it s also reflected from the gwl of both shallow and deep aquifers fig 3 during each of the ocean wave surge highest peak was observed after the gwl peak fig 3 extreme climate are formed mostly at the southern part of the bob and eventually it moved to the northern bob before the tropical cyclone makes landfall the influence of increasing ocean wave was translated to the gwl through the extended aquifer matrix to the deep sea the peak of gwl rise with ocean wave height is sharper and closer to the ocean wave height when the event was passed closer or make land fall near to the study location like during the tropical cyclone bulbul e10 and fani e9 fig 8i j the wave surge during the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone moves in towards the shoreline with the higher water column height the ocean wave surge may generate increased pore pressure in the coastal aquifers debnath and mukherjee 2016 yu et al 2016 which would eventually be translated to increased pressure head and consequent rise in the hydraulic head burgess et al 2017 the applied artificial intelligence model is unable to predict gwl for all the tested events for shallow depths for sw all three models were able to predict the gwl for e9 tropical cyclonee fani may 2019 table 2 and gwl demonstrated good correlation r 0 78 fig 6 however the models did not perform well to measure the gwl fluctuations during e3 r 0 10 0 21 for shallow aquifer fig 6 surface runoff moisture holding capacity and changes in the bulk density of vadose zone is possibly playing a major role in aquifer poroelastic response during the extreme climate events https www dgs udel edu delaware geology effect tropical storms irene and lee groundwater levels well qb35 08 may the incorporation of the influence of vadose zone would help in better predictability of gwl in all the tested events mostly on the shallow unconfined aquifer 4 2 fate of groundwater level fluctuation due to ocean wave surge incorporation of the mechanical loading is important for the actual measure of the groundwater storage or the groundwater replenishment measure but the sudden rise of the gwl due to ocean wave surge was not considered even in the storage calculations so the quantification of the gwl rise due to wave surge is a possible measure of the acute and long term aquifer vulnerability the gwl was risen to the vadose zone for some of the shallow wells and showed evidences of well overflow in shallow sw15 well due to rise of ocean wave height during the tropical cyclone bulbul the risen gwl has interaction with the water in vadose zone and similarly with flooded water over the surface for the overflown groundwater eventually after the fall of ocean wave height gwl have a declining trend which eventually transport the contaminated unsaturated water to the saturated fresh groundwater layer the transportation of surficial contaminants from the surface after the ocean wave surge was observed during the haiyan s storm surge san antonio texas and the indian ocean 2004 tsunami at southern india and sri lanka due to enhanced groundwater pumping illangasekare et al 2006 vithanage et al 2012a vithanage et al 2012b 4 3 implication of ocean wave surge on the aquifer vulnerability gwl in unconfined aquifer have very low response to bp fluctuations due to overlaying thin unsaturated zone while deeper groundwater has significant amount of response to bp as it lies underneath the confining units jacob 1950 vertical hydraulic conductivity plays an important role in shallow and deeper groundwater as the impermeable clay layer is distributed ubiquitously in different depths layers the study area has a very low dispersivity due to low vertical hydraulic conductivity gwl in shallow and deeper aquifers is significantly responding in each of the major ocean wave surge even in this low dispersivity fluctuations of gwl in each of the extreme ocean wave surge condition can be used to determine the changes in vertical dispersivity and it would be a measure of aquifer vulnerability our study depicting the gwl rise in each of the ocean wave surge and change are instantaneous and similar between the shallow and deep aquifer and are measurable by the applied machine learning models which have good predictability especially for the deeper groundwater the results suggest that the selected variables dist wave height bp and gph can be effectively used for deeper aquifer as predictors of gwl response during future extreme climate conditions the variable importance feature of the rfr model identified distance of cyclone as the most important variable to measure gwl in the deeper aquifer followed by the wave height gph and bp during extreme climate conditions 4 4 limitations of the study the aquifer poroelastic response on groundwater storage of coastal aquifers has already been established by the burgess et al 2017 the mechanical loading varies within the range of 0 67 0 87 of the bengal basin is a respondent to the earth and ocean tides burgess et al 2017 this study area s measured loading efficiency is 0 98 for shallow unconfined and 0 53 for deeper confined semiconfined aquifer the loading efficiency was calculated by the simple indirect linear equations of b c 1 where b is the barometric efficiency and c is the loading efficiency by following the method of jacob 1950 the b was calculated by the simple linear regression of water column pressure and the corresponding change in atmospheric pressure merritt 2004 but during each of the atmospheric depression and tropical cyclone there was a certain amount of rainfall that might have a significant impact of the mechanical loading need to incorporate for the true measurement of groundwater storage the reported study of van der kamp and maathuis 1991 anochikwa 2010 and anochikwa et al 2012 measured the influence of soil moisture at unsaturated zone have significant contribution on aquifer matrix loading to quantify the actual groundwater level the stagnant water over the groundwater surface due to rainfall and percolated water in the upper unconfining unit s vadose zone influences groundwater storage due to unavailability of point or location wise rainfall data soil moisture and unsaturated water in vadose zone we cannot incorporate and quantify the poroelastic response during extreme conditions which have direct impact on the gwl response for shallow depth during the tropical cyclone and atmospheric depressions while deep aquifers are free from it so this paper only dealt with the fluctuation and the magnitude of gwl during each of the ocean wave surge events and examined the applicability and importance of the applied predictor variables for the quantification of gwl 5 conclusions the study delineates the influence of variable ocean wave form on multi depth 14 115 m bgl gwl fluctuation our study in the multi layered delta front aquifers adjoining the tropical bob shows that the gwl rise and change are instantaneous and synchronous at all depths of the aquifers with no substantial time lag the rise of gwl is higher in shallow depth than the deep depth the highest gwl rise in shallow and deeper aquifer in this physically hydraulically disconnected aquifer was recorded during the high ocean wave surge tropical cyclone bulbul of 4 2 m gwl rise is higher than the diurnal tidal fluctuations both in shallow and deep groundwater during each of the ocean wave surge events the impact of ec induced ocean wave surge on gwl even in this low vertically dispersive and complex hydrostratigraphic system of the sundarbans delta front aquifers could measure aquifer vulnerability applied machine learning techniques are also performed well and have yielded significant correlation for validation of tested events predictability is found to be better for deeper groundwater than at shallower depths such climate induced gradient flow can possibly increase groundwater s vulnerability which is the main source of drinking water for hundreds and thousands of inhabitants in the mega delta by mixing with the contaminants just beneath the land surface thus the increasing rates of extreme climatic events in recent times and in the near future can pose a previously unexplored potential threat to groundwater sourced drinking water quality exposing millions of groundwater dependent inhabitants in coastal areas to risk 6 credit statement kd and am conceived the idea of the study and the

4093,tropical montane cloud forests tmcf are threatened ecosystems despite their capacity to maintain high dry season baseflow a number of conservation policies including payments for hydrological services have been implemented to protect these forests however since most of the modeling tools used to assess the impacts of these policies were developed for temperate zones more work is needed to understand and improve the applicability of popular models in tropical contexts this study uses local evapotranspiration and streamflow datasets to calibrate and validate an improved version of the soil and water assessment tool model for the tropics swat t vegetation growth and canopy water storage capacity were calibrated using field data three methods provided by swat t to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet were compared penman monteith swat t pm hargreaves swat t ha and priestly taylor swat t pt sensitivity analysis and calibration of daily streamflow were conducted at the catchment scale 34 km2 furthermore the calibrated models were validated at three sites with evapotranspiration data and at four distinct micro catchments 0 137 0 446 km2 with gauged streamflow data overall swat t satisfactorily simulated streamflow during the calibration period producing acceptable goodness of fit indices however the model incorrectly predicted the dominance of lateral flow instead of the deep groundwater flow observed from isotope based studies swat t ha performed better than swat t pm and swat t pt but all models underestimated the influence of rainfall interception losses since evaporation is limited by daily pet in forests finally swat t largely over and underestimated mean annual daily low flow in pastures and forests respectively taken together these results indicate that improvements in the parametrization of rainfall interception and deep subsurface flow dynamics in swat t are required to improve applicability of this modeling tool in tropical montane

hydrology especially in tropical montane areas characterized by high loss of forested area limited data to constrain ecohydrological processes less suitable modeling tools and high spatial variability in climate vegetation and soils hansen et al 2013 hamel et al 2017 wright et al 2018 better understanding and modeling of hydrological responses with a focus on the incorporation of local datasets for multiple sites and processes in tropical montane settings is key to the effective implementation monitoring and success of conservation policies lópez ramírez et al 2020 guswa et al 2014 the soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based continuous daily hydrological model that allows the simultaneous simulation of hydrology and plant growth arnold et al 1998 heidari et al 2019 in swat a basin is partitioned into sub basins which in turn are subdivided into hydrological response units hrus that represent a unique combination of land use soil type and slope class neitsch et al 2011 swat includes five storage types to calculate the water balance snow the canopy the soil profile and the shallow and deep aquifers neitsch et al 2011 swat uses empirical potential evapotranspiration pet methods to estimate actual et including the temperature based hargreaves ha hargreaves and samani 1985 radiation based priestley taylor pt priestley and taylor 1972 and the combined energy mass transfer penman monteith pm monteith 1965 methods a comprehensive outline of et calculations in swat is presented by abiodun et al 2018 the literature suggests that different methods perform better under certain climatic conditions especially in data scarce regions i e alemayehu et al 2015 samadi 2017 moreover while the pet is a commonly used index in estimating et forest pet values at the landscape level are often indirectly estimated using models that were developed for short crops and under specific climatic conditions lu et al 2005 and more work is needed to better understand their applicability in tropical montane regions archibald and walter 2013 applications across a wide range of topographic soils and land use conditions have demonstrated the broad utility of swat for simulating streamflow responses francesconi et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 van liew et al 2007 quintero et al 2009 francesconi et al 2016 tuppad et al 2010 plesca et al 2012 including in tropical montane cloud forests tmcf in mexico underlain by impermeable soils with high dominance of surface runoff salas martínez et al 2014 sánchez galindo et al 2017 however most model evaluations have relied only on statistics comparing simulated and measured flow at the outlet arnold et al 2015 a recent introduction of signature metrics for different parts of the flow duration curve has shown that it is possible to achieve a balanced hydrograph with the swat model haas et al 2015 pfannerstill et al 2014 nonetheless calibrating swat simultaneously for very high and very low flows is still challenging shrestha et al 2018 pfannerstill et al 2014 assessing and improving the applicability of the swat model across the spectrum of catchment characteristics e g substrate permeability streamflow generation mechanisms present in tropical montane areas requires more thorough calibration procedures and multi site validation with ancillary data and local understanding of the main water budget components recently strauch and volk 2013 and alemayehu et al 2017 suggested improvements to swat to better represent vegetation growth in tropical areas swat t and hence improve water balance simulations swat assumes that vegetation enters a dormant period at the end of each growing season i e during the autumn and winter at which point the leaf area index lai is set to a minimum value close to zero neitsch et al 2011 lai is assumed to decline linearly to its specified minimum when leaf senescence exceeds leaf growth neitsch et al 2011 these assumptions do not realistically represent the seasonal dynamics phenology of foliage in the tropics in general or in the study area in particular williams linera 1999 alemayehu et al 2017 since many tropical plant species exhibit drought controlled dormancy or continuous growth throughout the year strauch and volk 2013 in swat t the plant growth subroutine was modified to better represent the phenological patterns encountered at low latitudes 20 n to 20 s alemayehu et al 2017 swat t incorporates the logistic decline curve to model leaf senescence as suggested by strauch and volk 2013 additionally in this model the beginning of the new growth cycle for trees and perennials is triggered by a soil moisture index which occurs within a period defined by the user as the months at the end of the dry season sos1 and the beginning of the rainy season sos2 results from alemayehu et al 2017 in the mara basin kenya tanzania showed that swat t achieved higher correlations between observed and simulated lai than the standard swat and improved the simulation of evapotranspiration and streamflow of the studied period by around 12 as swat t has not been evaluated in other contexts we sought to apply this model in areas characterized by tmcf in this study we calibrated and validated the swat t model to simulate discharge and evapotranspiration in areas influenced by tmcf located in central veracruz mexico we hypothesize that by contrasting calibrated swat t models using local vegetation and ecohydrological parameters such as lai and canopy storage capacity against hydrologic observations e g streamflow and evapotranspiration we can identify model strengths and areas of improvement for analyzing the water budget response in these environments specifically a we validate calibrated swat t models with local evapotranspiration data in three sites with a focus on the performance of the pet methods available in the model b we assess the accuracy of the swat t model to simulate streamflow at the outlet of the gavilanes catchment 34 km2 and c we validate the calibrated swat t models with streamflow observed in four nested micro catchments 0 137 0 446 km2 within the study area two particularly novel aspects of our work are that 1 it validates the swat t model with evapotranspiration and streamflow data at hru level in areas with contrasting land covers and that 2 it identifies areas for improving the applicability of swat t for science and policy applications in tropical montane areas underlain by permeable soils 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the research was carried out in the gavilanes catchment 34 km2 and four micro catchments 0 137 0 446 km2 located within the catchments of the pixquiac and gavilanes rivers 106 and 34 km2 respectively which are tributaries of the upper antigua river basin 1565 km2 the gavilanes catchment is the main source of water for the city of coatepec veracruz mexico garcía et al 2004 while the pixquiac catchment provides 38 of the water supply for the veracruz state capital of xalapa paré and gerez 2012 numerous water extractions upstream of the gauging station in the pixquiac river prohibited the inclusion of this catchment in our analysis the gavilanes catchment was originally dominated by tmcf and is located in central veracruz mexico elevations in the catchment range from 1226 m a s l to 2962 m a s l fig 1 its general climate is temperate humid garcia 2004 with about 80 of the annual rainfall occurring during the wet season may october mean annual rainfall ranges from 1385 mm to 3185 mm and 1900 mm as elevation increases from 1210 m a s l to 2100 m a s l and 3000 m a s l respectively mean daily temperatures decreases from 19 to 5 c from 1200 to 3000 m a s l muñoz villers et al 2016 annual values of cloud water interception account for 2 of the total rainfall in the region holwerda et al 2010 we selected micro catchments based on the dominance of four land use land cover lulc types within each micro catchment see the lulc map in fig 1b including mature forest mf intermediate forest if shade coffee sc and pasture ip together these four lulc types comprise around 70 of lulc in this study area von thaden et al 2019 with much of the remaining area covered by pine forest pi a detailed description of the characteristics of the micro catchments is provided in table 1 and more details can be found in lópez ramírez et al 2020 the mf micro catchment is dominated by old growth tmcf 50 years old with low disturbance if is mainly covered by 40 year old tmcf 77 of the area and scattered pastureland and annual crops mainly maize located in the upper parts of the catchment the mean tree height in these two micro catchments is similar and ranges between 20 and 25 m vizcaíno bravo et al 2020 they also have a similar mean leaf area index lai see table 1 the sc micro catchment has been completely covered by shade coffee agroforestry for 80 years marín castro et al 2016 with 94 of the land area dominated by this land cover this production system retains some tree cover to provide shade to the coffee but it exhibits a lower lai 4 3 m2 m 2 the ip micro catchment was largely cleared more than 40 years ago lópez ramírez et al 2020 since then pastures have been heavily grazed by sheep goats and cows 63 of the land area patches of young secondary forest and built infrastructure roads and dwellings occupy the remainder 29 and 8 respectively the soils in these areas are mainly classified as umbric andosols derived from volcanic ash with clay and silty clay as dominant textures campos 2010 paré and gerez 2012 mineral soil horizons are characterized by low bulk densities 0 7 g cm 3 across land cover types due to the abundance of non crystalline materials and organic matter thick organic horizons 5 15 cm often overlie the mineral soil in tmcfs but typically not in pastures and coffee plantations soil profiles are generally deep a b horizons 1 m and c cr horizons 10 m on ridges and backslopes and moderately well developed karlsen 2010 favoring good water storage the soils in the region are generally underlain by andesitic saprolite with high permeabilities ranging from 0 05 to 0 08 mm hr 1 karlsen 2010 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 although we did not measure bedrock hydraulic properties here we observed the presence of saturated saprolite on various road cuts in our study sites field saturated soil hydraulic conductivities are generally higher in tmcf areas in comparison to pasture and shade coffee lópez ramírez et al 2020 2 2 model set up and data preparation the swat t model was set up for land use conditions representing the year 2013 von thaden et al 2019 the land cover map contained seven classifications pine mature forest intermediate forest crop pasture coffee and human settlements these land cover classes were input into the model setup using the categories from the swat database that are presented in table b1 in appendix b the complete set of characteristics of each category can be reviewed in the swat plant database neitsch et al 2011 we used the soil classes from the inegi database inegi 2007 and field data to populate the soil database in swat t see table 2 and appendix a for more details the model was set up to capture the elevation slope land use and soil classes corresponding to the predominant conditions in the gavilanes catchment and in the four monitored micro catchments table 1 arcswat version 2012 winchell et al 2013 was used to set up the swat t model a digital elevation model dem with a 15 m resolution inegi 2012 was used to delineate the catchments the study area was divided into 17 sub catchments two slope classes were defined using the mean slope as the dividing threshold with slope ranges of 0 35 and 35 respectively the sub catchments were further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus small hrus were removed from the model setup and their areas were apportioned to the remaining hrus her et al 2015 specifically for land cover hrus with shares of the total area below thresholds of 5 for soils land cover and soils combinations with shares of the area below thresholds of 20 and for slope land cover soils and slope combinations with shares of the area below thresholds of 20 these thresholds were selected for retaining the dominant land covers maintaining individual hrus for the four monitored micro catchments and keeping the computational costs manageable in total the model setup resulted in 140 hrus which represented around 80 of the total area we set up three swat t models to evaluate three empirical potential evapotranspiration pet methods available in the model to estimate the actual et swat t ha used the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 swat t pt the priestley taylor formulation priestley and taylor 1972 and swat t pm the penman monteith method monteith 1965 the list of hydroclimatological and spatial data used to set up the swat t models is presented in table 2 maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation data were compiled from ten weather stations four from the mexican national weather service smn 2020 three from lópez ramírez et al 2020 and three operated by the national autonomous university of mexico unam monthly average relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were available only for the unam and lópez ramírez 2020 stations which were assigned to the rest of the weather stations considering the similarity in terms of elevation and the shortest distance this monthly data was used to inform the swat weather generator 2 3 plant growth and canopy interception calibration 2 3 1 leaf area index we combined ground based leaf area index lai measurements with modis satellite products maximum lai was measured with the lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor 2019 over a 500 m transect in eight plots with dominant land covers at different elevations two mf two if two sc one ip and one pi fig 1b these measurements were taken during the rainy season july 8 to august 20 2019 in the early morning hours 6 45 a m to 8 00 a m before sunset or under cloudy conditions to avoid scattering effects the modis satellite provide estimates of lai on a 500 m grid every eight days at a world scale myneni et al 2015 we extracted and analyzed 231 modis lai composites from june 2014 to august 2019 to estimate the average daily lai values for 8 pixels with homogeneous land covers representative of our lai sampling sites clouds were masked and mean lai values were predicted for each day of the year by fitting local polynomial regressions ripley 1998 in the stats package r core team 2019 to the eight day modis lai estimates pooled across years 2014 2019 finally we rescaled the smoothed daily lai using the observed lai for each of our sites in pine forests we used the default swat max lai value 5 0 since we did not have an accurate needle to shoot area ratio to adjust the observed lai in general we observed that the modis algorithm myneni et al 2015 produced acceptable results in the broadleaf forest mf and if while it significantly overestimated lai in the sc and in the ip fig 2 the smoothed and rescaled modis lai models were used to calibrate the swat t vegetation growth module for simulating lai fig 2 table b1 appendix b presents the swat t model parameters that were adjusted during the manual calibration process initially the minimum lai alai min and maximum potential lai blai for each land cover class were based on the ground based modis lai model which corresponds well with independent measurements in the study area gonzález martínez and holwerda 2018 the shape coefficients for the lai curve frgrw1 frgrw2 laimx1 laimx2 and the remaining parameters were adjusted by a trial and error process based on values reported in the literature i e strauch and volk 2013 alemayehu et al 2017 such that the swat t simulated lai mimics the rescaled modis lai 2 3 2 plant growth and canopy interception calibration in the study region the tmcf consists of a mix of deciduous semi deciduous e g leaf exchanging and evergreen species of tropical and temperate biogeographical origins williams linera 1999 williams linera et al 2013 most of the semi deciduous species are of temperate origin and the timing of the leaf exchange is not controlled by water availability instead these species shed their leaves during the early and mid dry season and leaf out during the mid to late dry season borchert et al 2005 we manually defined the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season sos1 january and sos2 february respectively where a new vegetation growth cycle takes place two parameters are used to avoid unrealistic results such as a false starts of the growing cycle during the dry season due to short spell rainfall alemayehu et al 2017 the swat t parameters that control the shape the magnitude and the temporal dynamics of lai were manually adjusted to reproduce the values of the rescaled modis lai for each land cover class table b1 in appendix b this procedure was repeated for the parameterization of the maximum canopy storage capacity canmx canmx was determined for mature forest 3 3 mm intermediate forest 1 8 mm pine 1 2 mm and shade coffee 1 6 mm these values were obtained from measurements of throughfall and stemflow in these land covers at different elevations in the study catchments gonzález martínez and holwerda 2018 holwerda et al 2010 holwerda et al 2013 muñoz villers et al 2012 2015 2 4 sensitivity analysis and calibration for streamflow at the gavilanes catchment 2 4 1 streamflow at the gavilanes catchment we used a two year daily streamflow series from the gavilanes catchment streamflow gauge 2 may 2015 30 april 2017 water levels were measured every 10 min using water level sensors paired with barometric pressure recorders recorded levels were converted to streamflow l s 1 using experimental stage discharge relationships based on rating curves derived from salt dilution measurements of discharge guzmán huerta 2019 the streamflow data were resampled mean to daily timesteps fig 3 2 4 2 selection of sensitive parameters in a parameter screening we ran a global sensitivity analysis gsa for the simulation of discharge at the gavilanes catchment outlet for the swat t models using each pet method to identify the most influential parameters we explored 23 model parameters that are frequently calibrated in swat to simulate discharge see arnold et al 2012 mehdi et al 2018 schürz et al 2019 meins 2013 for a description of the relevant model parameters controlling the water balance the ranges and types of parameter changes represent typical procedures often found in the swat literature an overview of the model parameters that were identified as influential and that were further used in the model is provided in table b2 appendix b we employed the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast algorithm cukier et al 1973 included in the r fast package reusser 2015 and integrated as part of the swatplusr workflow schürz 2019 to screen and rank the model parameters a parameter was selected as important if it was within the most sensitive parameters employing the kling gupta efficiency criterion kge for daily streamflow including its three components gupta et al 2009 the gsa performed for the model parameters of the three swat t models yielded similar results for the first 13 independent parameters therefore we employed 13 parameters during the calibration of the three models table b2 in appendix b 2 4 3 identification of non unique parameter sets calibration to facilitate the analysis of the swat t model performance and separate the effects of particular pet methods on model output we selected a series of simulations with non unique parameter sets schürz et al 2019 we simulated daily discharge for each swat t model using the latin hypercube sampling method with the r package lhs carnell 2019 to select 3000 random samples for the parameter combinations of the 13 most influential parameters that we had previously identified we evaluated simulations using signature metrics and a statistical performance metric kge the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation rsr moriasi et al 2007 was calculated for five segments of the flow duration curve fdc very high 0 5 days of exceedance high 5 20 medium 20 70 low 70 95 and very low flows 95 100 as suggested by pfannerstill et al 2014 rsr varies from an optimal value of 0 which indicates a perfect model simulation to a large positive value this evaluation method has been shown to lead to an improved selection of good calibration runs since it captures different parts of the hydrograph pfannerstill et al 2014 we simultaneously identified the best 1500 runs out of 3000 for the five signature metrics minimize rsr followed by the selection and comparison of the best ten simulations with maximum kge for each swat t model swat t ha swat t pt and swat t pm 2 4 4 temporally distributed parameter sensitivity analysis the temporally distributed parameter sensitivity analysis tdsa is used to identify deficiencies in the model structure as a function of time of year pfannerstill et al 2015 haas et al 2015 guse et al 2014 guse et al 2016 guse et al 2019 a tdsa was applied to the three swat t models to obtain daily temporal parameter sensitivities which were later summarized at monthly intervals guse et al 2016 to derive information about the dominant hydrological processes during the wet and dry seasons we simulated daily discharge for each model in the gavilanes catchment again using the latin hypercube sampling to select 1500 random samples for the combinations of eight parameters table b3 in appendix b from the thirteen parameters used for calibration table b2 in appendix b seven parameters were selected to assess parameter sensitivity for each hydrologic process surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow evaporation and soil water storage canmx was added in the tdsa for rainfall interception we did not consider the routing parameters ch k2 ch n2 alpha bnk as they are related to channels for lateral flow groundwater and evaporation we used only parameters previously reported in other swat studies e g guse et al 2014 guse et al 2019 leaving hru slp dep imp and epco out of the tdsa analysis the parameters that control surface runoff soil water storage lateral flow and rainfall interception were modified spatially while the parameters controlling groundwater were altered globally due to the lack of spatially distributed empirical data for a detailed description of the model parameters and the associated processes please refer to neitsch et al 2011 to study the temporal dynamics of the parameterization of daily discharge simulations for the three pet methods we employed the r package tempawn schürz 2020 which calculates the daily pawn pianosi and wagener 2015 the name of the method was derived from the authors names sensitivity index according to pianosi and wagener 2018 for each time step of a simulation pawn is moment independent and is a suitable method for asymmetrically distributed outputs of models zadeh et al 2017 pawn pianosi and wagener 2015 has shown to be effective for parameter ranking including various applications with the swat model zadeh et al 2017 pianosi and wagener 2018 schürz et al 2019 a dummy variable is artificially introduced that cannot affect the output but provides an indication of the extent of approximation errors if the sensitivity index of a parameter is smaller than the dummy variable then we can conclude that this factor is not influential pianosi and wagener 2018 2 5 validation of streamflow in four micro catchments 2 5 1 streamflow at four micro catchments within each micro catchment fig 1c streamflow and rainfall were measured from 2015 to 2019 for streamflow v notch weirs were installed at each micro catchment outlet and the water level was logged every 1 5 min using a solinst water level sensor model 3001 paired with a barometric pressure recorder model 3001 we calculated the streamflow l s 1 using field derived rating curves generated via volumetric and salt dilution measurements of discharge moore 2005 please see lópez ramírez et al 2020 for more details 2 5 2 validation of streamflow in four micro catchments we evaluated the performance of the three calibrated swat t models swat t ha swat t pt and swat t pm for streamflow simulation at four sites all calibrated parameters identified non unique parameter sets were subsequently applied individually a parameter set at a time to the swat t models mehdi et al 2018 and the model simulations were evaluated in four hrus representing the dominant land cover in the corresponding micro catchments table 1 mf 100 if 77 sc 94 and ip 63 the location and weather data of these hrus are the same as in the corresponding micro catchments and the hrus represent the dominant soil slope and elevation conditions observed in the micro catchments first we visually compared the simulated and observed fdcs second we estimated the percentage bias pbias criteria for the annual ratio between average daily runoff and average daily rainfall q p for the mean annual daily high flow q5 and for the mean annual daily low flow q95 2 6 validation of evapotranspiration at three sites 2 6 1 evapotranspiration at three sites water and energy fluxes were measured at three sites over different time periods to calculate evapotranspiration et et was calculated as the sum of rainfall interception i and dry canopy evaporation or transpiration et in a mature and an intermediate montane cloud forest located at an altitude of about 2100 m fig 1b et values were derived from continuous sapflow measurements from january november 2007 37 trees for mature forest and 13 trees for intermediate forest and i values were quantified using throughfall and stemflow measurements in plots between september 2006 and june 2007 in the intermediate forest and between april 2007 and april 2008 in the mature forest see holwerda et al 2010 and muñoz villers et al 2012 for more details in a shaded coffee plantation located at an altitude of 1210 m fig 1b et and i were calculated using the eddy covariance method and measurements of throughfall and stemflow respectively september 2006 august 2008 see holwerda et al 2013 for more details in these studies the et results were also expressed as a fraction of the fao penman monteith reference evapotranspiration et0 this metric facilitates comparison of independent site vegetation transpiration rates relative to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere allen et al 1998 the interception results were expressed as a fraction of the mean annual rainfall p for the mature forest et was 787 mm 92 of et0 and i was 613 mm 18 of p in the intermediate forest et was 788 mm 92 of et0 and i was 315 mm 9 of p and in the shade coffee et was 992 mm 89 of et0 while i was 110 mm 8 of p 2 6 2 validation of evapotranspiration at three sites we compared the evapotranspiration et predicted by the three swat t models with et estimated from meteorological data and locally derived indices of interception divided by precipitation i p and transpiration divided by reference evapotranspiration et et0 first we calculated the mean annual precipitation mp and the mean reference evapotranspiration met0 following allen et al 1998 and using the available meteorological data for the study period 4 years at three sites next the interception i was estimated as the product of i p and mp and the et was obtained by multiplying met0 by et et0 finally et was estimated by adding i and et table 5 these et values were compared with et predicted in the corresponding hrus by the calibrated swat t models using the best set of previously identified parameters table b4 in appendix b model parameters additionally we estimated the simulated rainfall interception sim i swat t as the difference between et predicted by the calibrated swat t models and et predicted by the calibrated swat t models when the canopy storage capacity canmx is set to zero table 5 3 results 3 1 leaf area index calibration we evaluated the degree of agreement between daily modis lai and the lai simulated by the calibrated swat t using visual comparisons and statistical measures from the qualitative inspection see fig 2 it is apparent that the annual growth cycle of each land cover class from the calibrated swat t model corresponds well with the modis lai model rescaled with field data in quantitative terms the calibrated models exhibited generally strong correlations 0 67 mf 0 89 if 0 92 ip 0 47 pi and 0 64 sc during the calibration period the greatest mismatch in lai was found for pi most likely because the pine trees have bundles of needles rather than broad leaves the 25 75th percentiles in fig 2 show the effect of temperature primarily related to the elevation gradient on the computation of lai sc exhibited narrower bands than the other land covers because it is mainly distributed between 1100 and 1500 m a s l it can be observed that the lai bands become wider at the end of the annual cycle because the growth model uses the accumulated number of heat units 3 2 streamflow calibration at the gavilanes catchment visual comparisons of daily simulated streamflow hydrographs with observed streamflow over the calibration period for the three models swat t ha swat t pt and swat t pm suggest a good fit fig 3a the quantitative results presented in table 3 indicate that swat t ha had a higher kge and nse and a lower pbias than the other two models the swat t pm model had the poorest ability of the calibrated models to reproduce observed streamflow lower nse and kge and larger pbias these statistical results were consistent with the results from the signature metric analysis where swat t ha consistently had the lowest rsr for the five parts of the fdc and swat t pm the largest these results are also evident in fig 3b where we can observe narrower uncertainty bands for swat t ha at very low flows however the three models produced similar results exhibiting high rsr values table 3 indicates that the three swat t models overestimated the observed discharge mean pbias for swat t pm 24 mean pbias for swat t pt 12 mean pbias for swat t ha 5 the water balance presented in table c1 appendix c confirms these findings and shows that swat t pm predicted the lowest pet 807 mm and et 665 mm and the highest total streamflow 1407 mm followed by swat t pt pet 977 mm et 926 mm total streamflow 1203 mm and swat t ha pet 1179 mm et 1098 mm total streamflow 1085 mm overall the water balance table c1 indicates a low influence of surface runoff 4 16 of total streamflow in all models and a dominance of lateral flow 40 to 72 of total streamflow in all models in the streamflow response 3 3 temporally distributed parameter sensitivity analysis the monthly averages of sensitivity results fig 4 for the six model processes were very similar for the three models swat t ha swat t pm and swat t pt a marked dominance of lateral flow was detected throughout the year with an important contribution of groundwater the highest significance of groundwater parameters occurred in october and november during the transition between the wet and dry seasons hydrograph recession a low influence of surface runoff was observed except in the middle of the rainy season july september when this runoff component plays a slightly more significant role evapotranspiration interception and soil water storage parameters had a low influence on streamflow fig 4 this result was expected because the water deficit for evapotranspiration is low throughout the year 3 4 validation of streamflow in the four micro catchments the selection of a specific pet method influences the calculations of et and in turn affects the water balance qualitatively the three models swat t ha swat t pm and swat t pt showed good performance in simulating different phases of the fdc for mf and sc additionally all three models accurately simulated the high mid and low flows in the if fig 5 however swat t clearly failed to capture the very low flows observed in if an unexpected result was that the model largely overestimated the low and very low flow dynamics in the ip probably due to the global calibration of groundwater parameters the statistical results table 4 confirm these findings where the three swat t models exhibited extremely high mean pbias 400 for mean annual daily low flow q95 in the ip micro catchment additionally the three models underestimated q95 in the mf and if hrus for mean annual daily high flow q5 the swat t pm and swat t pt models exhibited slightly better performance than swat t ha for average water balance conditions q p the swat t ha model produced a general underestimation while swat t pt showed mixed results and the swat t pm method produced a general overestimation 3 5 validation of evapotranspiration at three sites comparisons of et as predicted by the best calibrated models swat t ha swat t pm and swat t pt with et estimated based on i p and et et0 derived from local measurements see section 2 6 for explanation revealed that et simulated by swat t ha more closely matched et based on local data than the other two models table 5 however our results also show that swat t ha overestimates et in sc by 247 mm 22 at lower elevations 1210 m a s l while underestimating et in mf by 310 mm 22 and in if by 58 mm 5 at about 2100 m a s l swat t pm and swat t pt caused a higher underestimation of et for the same forest sites the simulated rainfall interception capacity varied from 36 mm yr 1 sim i swat t pt to 109 mm yr 1 sim i swat t pm representing 4 of the water balance for all sites and models table 5 4 discussion 4 1 validation of calibrated swat t models with local evapotranspiration data at three sites with focus on the performance of the pet methods available in the model the adequate selection of a pet method and the accurate simulation of leaf area index and rainfall interception influence the computation of evapotranspiration in the swat t model and affect the water balance swat t alemayehu et al 2017 was capable of accurately simulating lai in the study area fig 2 overall the rescaled modis lai model effectively represented the annual growth dynamics when compared with independent lai observations in mature forest the average lai measured for the dry and wet seasons was 4 1 and 5 9 respectively gonzález martínez and holwerda 2018 the lai model also provided good results when compared with shade coffee plantations where the minimum lai was 2 7 in december 2016 and the maximum lai was 3 9 in july 2017 holwerda and meesters 2019 furthermore the swat t simulated lai corresponded well with the modis lai annual growth model an average r2 of 0 71 for all land covers the formulation of swat t did not allow realistic simulation of the effect of rainfall interception in forested areas rainfall interception in the study region has been reported in the literature to be about 18 and 9 of p in mature and intermediate forests respectively holwerda et al 2010 muñoz villers et al 2012 and around 8 of p in a shade coffee plantation holwerda et al 2013 these values strongly suggest that in these environments interception is an important component of the water balance for mature forests and that the conversion of mature forests to other land covers such as shade coffee is associated with a decrease in rainfall interception as high as 10 of p all of the swat t models in our study underestimated rainfall interception i 4 of p for all land covers see table 5 furthermore the temporally distributed sensitivity analysis fig 4 indicated that interception has a low effect on streamflow for all the swat t models these results can be explained by the fact that swat t limits daily evaporation from the canopy by daily pet fig 1 of abiodun et al 2018 neitsch et al 2011 and thus underestimates the actual evaporation from the wet forest canopy see below for further discussion this point requires further review and we suggest that the swat t model should allow the canopy storage capacity to empty daily as assumed by simpler widely accepted interception models such as the liu model liu 2001 more attention should be given to the appropriate selection of pet methods for swat model applications although we found low influence of evapotranspiration et interception i and soil water storage parameters in the daily sensitivity analysis fig 4 we observed that the pet method impacted model performance table 3 and significantly affected the water balance table c1 et accounts for 30 40 of rainfall in the headwater catchments where most recharge occurs muñoz villers et al 2012 muñoz villers et al 2015 muñoz villers et al 2016 these et results agree with values of et 19 50 reported in other tropical montane mesoscale catchments i e crespo et al 2012 beck et al 2013 we attribute the low influence of et i and soil water storage parameters to the availability of water throughout the year and the limited capacity of the swat t model to simulate interception in forested areas nevertheless our findings support that the choice of the pet estimation method influences the swat t model performance to simulate discharge as suggested by alemayehu et al 2015 the models parameterized with radiation based methods swat t pt and swat t pm significantly underestimated et in the upper parts of the cloud forest zone table 5 and consequently limited the models capacity to accommodate evaporation from the forests in the lower areas fog occurrence is practically absent only 2 of the time holwerda 2010 nonetheless fog is more frequent around 32 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 in the middle and upper sections of the cloud forest belt and it is probable that a higher presence of fog is associated with higher epiphyte densities that may contribute to higher canopy storage capacities in these areas gonzález martínez and holwerda 2018 these high interception capacities may in turn enhance wet canopy evaporation in forested areas driven by negative downward sensible heat flux rather than sustained by radiant energy alone stewart 1977 mizutani et al 1997 the aerodynamic term in the pm equation accounts for sensible heat advection however in swat t the pm method will underestimate wet canopy evaporation because it uses the surface resistance of alfalfa 100 s m 1 neitsch et al 2011 while the actual surface resistance is zero under such conditions moreover this pet method calculates aerodynamic resistance considering a crop height of 40 cm neitsch et al 2011 this yields a value for aerodynamic resistance about 5 times larger than that of forest contributing to the underestimation of pet in the pt method the aerodynamic term is represented by the pt coefficient 1 28 neitsch et al 2011 however shuttleworth and calder 1979 suggested that this is not sufficient to account for the high evaporation rates from wet forest canopies i e energy input from sensible heat advection can be several times greater than that from radiation the model parameterized with the temperature based method swat t ha generally produced higher et estimates table 5 higher values of pet compensate for the low capacity of the model to represent the evaporation of intercepted rainfall in forests but also lead to overestimation of transpiration rates in other land covers it is likely that the pt method also overestimates forest transpiration when using the pt and ha methods swat t does not explicitly model the effect of the lai on transpiration for lai 3 0 neitsch et al 2011 therefore the et values simulated by swat t for mf and if are very similar when using the ha and pt methods table 5 both methods underestimate the effect of vegetation cover on hydrological flows in conclusion the swat t ha model performed better but not for the right reasons and the use of this approach overestimated et in areas with lower interception capacity such as shade coffee especially in the lower parts of the catchment where the presence of fog is less important 4 2 assessment of the accuracy of the swat t model to simulate streamflow at the outlet of the gavilanes catchment 34 km2 the swat t model was able to satisfactorily simulate streamflow during the calibration period as shown in fig 3 and confirmed by acceptable goodness of fit indices table 3 the incorporation of a multi metric framework that considers five segments of the fdc pfannerstill et al 2014 improved the identification of the best parameter sets however calibrating the models was challenging for very high and low flow conditions in our study we were able to improve the model calibration by relaxing the conditions for the simultaneous selection of the best 50 quantile for the five segments of the fdc while other researchers have used more restrictive conditions for selecting simulations including the best 20 quantile by pfannerstill et al 2014 and the best 25 quantile by guse et al 2020 we observed that our more relaxed approach was effective in enhancing overall model performance and parameter identification the temporally distributed sensitivity analysis suggested a low influence of surface runoff an intermediate influence of groundwater and the dominance of lateral flow in estimating streamflow response fig 4 this finding agrees with the water balance table c1 which indicates that surface runoff accounts for about 4 to 16 of the total streamflow while lateral subsurface flow controls around 40 to 72 of the streamflow response this finding agrees with a recent study in a neighboring catchment of similar size 60 6 km2 where lópez hernández 2019 examined 159 storm events and found that only 3 7 of total streamflow were contributed by surface runoff nevertheless muñoz villers et al 2016 reported long mean baseflow transit times between 1 2 and 2 7 years for the gavilanes catchment and 11 nested subcatchments 0 1 to 34 km2 suggesting that deep subsurface flow paths rather than shallow lateral flow is the dominant flow path for runoff generation muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 2013 these results agree with the high permeability observed at the soil bedrock interface 5 30 mm h 1 a structural deficit in the swat t model can explain the contradiction in between the swat t prediction of lateral flow as the most important process when evidence suggests that deep subsurface flow paths are dominant in swat t groundwater is divided into a shallow and a deep aquifer the shallow aquifer represents an unconfined aquifer that may discharge into the channel the deep aquifer is described as a confined aquifer that does not contribute to the streamflow neitsch et al 2011 the swat t model s reliance on a single active groundwater storage compartment is insufficient for describing both the fast recession phase and the low flow with the same parameter set luo et al 2012 guse et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2014 in this regard the parameter gwdelay presents a tradeoff between both discharge phases table b3 and table b4 in appendix b if gwdelay represents a fast recession with a short number of days the model produces a large amount of water available for contribution to streamflow on the other end a longer gwdelay is required to represent the slow water release during the long low flow periods pfannerstill et al 2014 streamflow measurements in our study catchment indicated a long recession phase so the calibration resulted in a large value for gwdelay around 400 days see table b4 appendix b consequently the shallow aquifer releases the water more slowly and the system behaves more like a semipermeable layer providing conditions that inaccurately imply the dominance of lateral flow hu and li 2018 in summary local evidence suggested that discharge in our catchment is determined by the volume of water in storage and should be characterized by nonlinear rate coefficients kirchner 2009 while swat t assumes that the variation in groundwater flow is linearly related to the rate of change in water table height neitsch et al 2011 4 3 validation of the calibrated swat t models with streamflow observed in four nested micro catchments 0 137 0 446 km2 within the study area examining the performance of the swat t model simulations of streamflow in micro catchments with contrasting land cover is useful since these results can help to better understand the strengths and limitations of the model at hru scale some authors have noted that swat shows a tendency to underperform in either very low or very high discharge events particularly in forested areas qiu et al 2012 the three models swat t ha swat t pm and swat t pt were capable of satisfactorily estimating annual runoff coefficients and mean annual daily high flows q5 in all land covers although the best results were obtained for mf and sc fig 5 table 4 major discrepancies were observed for the mean annual daily low flows especially in the if and ip micro catchments table 4 previous studies in this region suggest that managed land covers such as pasture can increase the variability of the streamflow response but indicators such as the mean annual runoff coefficient q p and the mean annual daily high flow q5 tend to be largely determined by elevation and slope lópez ramírez et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2013 this phenomenon was captured well by swat t models where higher runoff coefficients were observed at higher elevations ramírez et al 2017 sáenz et al 2014 for slope swat t predicted higher peak flows in steeper slopes which is consistent with the higher mean annual daily high flows q5 observed in steeper slopes by lópez ramírez et al 2020 and muñoz villers et al 2013 steeper slopes have also been associated with higher quickflow and lower time to peak responses mu et al 2015 nainar et al 2018 overall the calibrated swat t models produced acceptable q p and mean annual daily high flows q5 predictions pbias 25 for most of the land covers we attribute this result to the dense network of climate stations available fig 1 and the use of slope in the definition of hrus in terms of dry season baseflow local studies indicate that both mature and intermediate forests exhibit higher mean annual daily low flows q95 than pastureland and shade coffee lópez ramírez et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2013 which is consistent with the sponge effect hypothesis for forests bruijnzeel 2004 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 ogden et al 2013 muñoz villers et al 2015 our swat t results however point in the opposite direction with the model substantially overestimating mean annual daily low flow in the ip micro catchment for all models pbias 400 see table 4 and underestimating mean annual daily low flow for all the models in the mf and if micro catchments table 4 this finding has serious implications when using hydrological models to analyze the effects of land use changes e g deforestation reforestation and natural regeneration on water budgets we attribute this result to the dominance of global calibration of parameters controlling lateral and groundwater flow fig 4 spatially distributed empirical data is rarely available for these processes 4 3 1 potential limitations of this approach in our global sensitivity analysis we did not consider the impact of model setup number of sub basins and hrus however our study addresses the uncertainty associated with model parameterizations allowing the visualization of the effects of non unique parameter sets many authors recognize that the impact of this factor is generally more significant than model setup by several orders of magnitude schürz et al 2019 jha et al 2004 the selection of hrus considers a land cover threshold of 5 given the significant computation time required to run this analysis this threshold was used to reduce the computational costs without significantly compromising the simulation accuracy however we recognize that this practice reduces the effects of small land covers at the outlet schürz et al 2019 uncertainty in data such as the rainfall interception and evaporation used in this study may be very high due to the complex terrain finally we were not able to completely isolate the response of unique hrus because the four studied micro catchments were not entirely covered by a unique land use and slope class table 1 these heterogeneities may have influenced our results 5 conclusions swat t was capable of accurately mimicking the annual vegetation growth simulating streamflow at the main outlet and predicting a low influence of surface runoff in zones of tropical montane cloud forest in central veracruz mexico however the model incorrectly predicted the dominance of lateral flow versus deep groundwater flow as observed by isotope based studies our results thus support the hypothesis that the single active aquifer formulation of swat is unable to adequately reproduce the complex response in groundwater dominated catchments the model parameterized with the ha method for pet computation swat t ha produced the best goodness of fit results for streamflow and evapotranspiration all the swat t model variants resulted in an underestimation of forest evaporation under the wet conditions of the cloud forest zone of central veracruz temperature based pet methods swat t ha perform better in these areas but for the wrong reasons since the use of these approaches overestimates pet and et rates in areas with lower interception capacity i e non forested the incorporation of simpler and more widely accepted interception models such as liu model liu 2001 may improve these results for the right reasons swat t satisfactorily reproduced the q p and mean annual daily high flows in contrasting land covers mf if sc ip however the model overestimated the mean annual daily low flow in the ip micro catchment and underestimated it in the mf and if micro catchments this result suggests that the use of the swat t models in cloud forests underlain by permeable substrates where ground water flow controls the hydrological response requires improvement in calibration procedures to incorporate local knowledge regarding the land use effects on the baseflow sustenance overall structural improvements informed by field data are required to better understand and model the hydrology in swat t our findings showed that the incorporation of local datasets from multiple locations and processes during the modeling calibration and validation is key to advance hydrological modeling tools 6 funding sources this research was founded by a us national science

4093,tropical montane cloud forests tmcf are threatened ecosystems despite their capacity to maintain high dry season baseflow a number of conservation policies including payments for hydrological services have been implemented to protect these forests however since most of the modeling tools used to assess the impacts of these policies were developed for temperate zones more work is needed to understand and improve the applicability of popular models in tropical contexts this study uses local evapotranspiration and streamflow datasets to calibrate and validate an improved version of the soil and water assessment tool model for the tropics swat t vegetation growth and canopy water storage capacity were calibrated using field data three methods provided by swat t to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet were compared penman monteith swat t pm hargreaves swat t ha and priestly taylor swat t pt sensitivity analysis and calibration of daily streamflow were conducted at the catchment scale 34 km2 furthermore the calibrated models were validated at three sites with evapotranspiration data and at four distinct micro catchments 0 137 0 446 km2 with gauged streamflow data overall swat t satisfactorily simulated streamflow during the calibration period producing acceptable goodness of fit indices however the model incorrectly predicted the dominance of lateral flow instead of the deep groundwater flow observed from isotope based studies swat t ha performed better than swat t pm and swat t pt but all models underestimated the influence of rainfall interception losses since evaporation is limited by daily pet in forests finally swat t largely over and underestimated mean annual daily low flow in pastures and forests respectively taken together these results indicate that improvements in the parametrization of rainfall interception and deep subsurface flow dynamics in swat t are required to improve applicability of this modeling tool in tropical montane

challenging shrestha et al 2018 pfannerstill et al 2014 assessing and improving the applicability of the swat model across the spectrum of catchment characteristics e g substrate permeability streamflow generation mechanisms present in tropical montane areas requires more thorough calibration procedures and multi site validation with ancillary data and local understanding of the main water budget components recently strauch and volk 2013 and alemayehu et al 2017 suggested improvements to swat to better represent vegetation growth in tropical areas swat t and hence improve water balance simulations swat assumes that vegetation enters a dormant period at the end of each growing season i e during the autumn and winter at which point the leaf area index lai is set to a minimum value close to zero neitsch et al 2011 lai is assumed to decline linearly to its specified minimum when leaf senescence exceeds leaf growth neitsch et al 2011 these assumptions do not realistically represent the seasonal dynamics phenology of foliage in the tropics in general or in the study area in particular williams linera 1999 alemayehu et al 2017 since many tropical plant species exhibit drought controlled dormancy or continuous growth throughout the year strauch and volk 2013 in swat t the plant growth subroutine was modified to better represent the phenological patterns encountered at low latitudes 20 n to 20 s alemayehu et al 2017 swat t incorporates the logistic decline curve to model leaf senescence as suggested by strauch and volk 2013 additionally in this model the beginning of the new growth cycle for trees and perennials is triggered by a soil moisture index which occurs within a period defined by the user as the months at the end of the dry season sos1 and the beginning of the rainy season sos2 results from alemayehu et al 2017 in the mara basin kenya tanzania showed that swat t achieved higher correlations between observed and simulated lai than the standard swat and improved the simulation of evapotranspiration and streamflow of the studied period by around 12 as swat t has not been evaluated in other contexts we sought to apply this model in areas characterized by tmcf in this study we calibrated and validated the swat t model to simulate discharge and evapotranspiration in areas influenced by tmcf located in central veracruz mexico we hypothesize that by contrasting calibrated swat t models using local vegetation and ecohydrological parameters such as lai and canopy storage capacity against hydrologic observations e g streamflow and evapotranspiration we can identify model strengths and areas of improvement for analyzing the water budget response in these environments specifically a we validate calibrated swat t models with local evapotranspiration data in three sites with a focus on the performance of the pet methods available in the model b we assess the accuracy of the swat t model to simulate streamflow at the outlet of the gavilanes catchment 34 km2 and c we validate the calibrated swat t models with streamflow observed in four nested micro catchments 0 137 0 446 km2 within the study area two particularly novel aspects of our work are that 1 it validates the swat t model with evapotranspiration and streamflow data at hru level in areas with contrasting land covers and that 2 it identifies areas for improving the applicability of swat t for science and policy applications in tropical montane areas underlain by permeable soils 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the research was carried out in the gavilanes catchment 34 km2 and four micro catchments 0 137 0 446 km2 located within the catchments of the pixquiac and gavilanes rivers 106 and 34 km2 respectively which are tributaries of the upper antigua river basin 1565 km2 the gavilanes catchment is the main source of water for the city of coatepec veracruz mexico garcía et al 2004 while the pixquiac catchment provides 38 of the water supply for the veracruz state capital of xalapa paré and gerez 2012 numerous water extractions upstream of the gauging station in the pixquiac river prohibited the inclusion of this catchment in our analysis the gavilanes catchment was originally dominated by tmcf and is located in central veracruz mexico elevations in the catchment range from 1226 m a s l to 2962 m a s l fig 1 its general climate is temperate humid garcia 2004 with about 80 of the annual rainfall occurring during the wet season may october mean annual rainfall ranges from 1385 mm to 3185 mm and 1900 mm as elevation increases from 1210 m a s l to 2100 m a s l and 3000 m a s l respectively mean daily temperatures decreases from 19 to 5 c from 1200 to 3000 m a s l muñoz villers et al 2016 annual values of cloud water interception account for 2 of the total rainfall in the region holwerda et al 2010 we selected micro catchments based on the dominance of four land use land cover lulc types within each micro catchment see the lulc map in fig 1b including mature forest mf intermediate forest if shade coffee sc and pasture ip together these four lulc types comprise around 70 of lulc in this study area von thaden et al 2019 with much of the remaining area covered by pine forest pi a detailed description of the characteristics of the micro catchments is provided in table 1 and more details can be found in lópez ramírez et al 2020 the mf micro catchment is dominated by old growth tmcf 50 years old with low disturbance if is mainly covered by 40 year old tmcf 77 of the area and scattered pastureland and annual crops mainly maize located in the upper parts of the catchment the mean tree height in these two micro catchments is similar and ranges between 20 and 25 m vizcaíno bravo et al 2020 they also have a similar mean leaf area index lai see table 1 the sc micro catchment has been completely covered by shade coffee agroforestry for 80 years marín castro et al 2016 with 94 of the land area dominated by this land cover this production system retains some tree cover to provide shade to the coffee but it exhibits a lower lai 4 3 m2 m 2 the ip micro catchment was largely cleared more than 40 years ago lópez ramírez et al 2020 since then pastures have been heavily grazed by sheep goats and cows 63 of the land area patches of young secondary forest and built infrastructure roads and dwellings occupy the remainder 29 and 8 respectively the soils in these areas are mainly classified as umbric andosols derived from volcanic ash with clay and silty clay as dominant textures campos 2010 paré and gerez 2012 mineral soil horizons are characterized by low bulk densities 0 7 g cm 3 across land cover types due to the abundance of non crystalline materials and organic matter thick organic horizons 5 15 cm often overlie the mineral soil in tmcfs but typically not in pastures and coffee plantations soil profiles are generally deep a b horizons 1 m and c cr horizons 10 m on ridges and backslopes and moderately well developed karlsen 2010 favoring good water storage the soils in the region are generally underlain by andesitic saprolite with high permeabilities ranging from 0 05 to 0 08 mm hr 1 karlsen 2010 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 although we did not measure bedrock hydraulic properties here we observed the presence of saturated saprolite on various road cuts in our study sites field saturated soil hydraulic conductivities are generally higher in tmcf areas in comparison to pasture and shade coffee lópez ramírez et al 2020 2 2 model set up and data preparation the swat t model was set up for land use conditions representing the year 2013 von thaden et al 2019 the land cover map contained seven classifications pine mature forest intermediate forest crop pasture coffee and human settlements these land cover classes were input into the model setup using the categories from the swat database that are presented in table b1 in appendix b the complete set of characteristics of each category can be reviewed in the swat plant database neitsch et al 2011 we used the soil classes from the inegi database inegi 2007 and field data to populate the soil database in swat t see table 2 and appendix a for more details the model was set up to capture the elevation slope land use and soil classes corresponding to the predominant conditions in the gavilanes catchment and in the four monitored micro catchments table 1 arcswat version 2012 winchell et al 2013 was used to set up the swat t model a digital elevation model dem with a 15 m resolution inegi 2012 was used to delineate the catchments the study area was divided into 17 sub catchments two slope classes were defined using the mean slope as the dividing threshold with slope ranges of 0 35 and 35 respectively the sub catchments were further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus small hrus were removed from the model setup and their areas were apportioned to the remaining hrus her et al 2015 specifically for land cover hrus with shares of the total area below thresholds of 5 for soils land cover and soils combinations with shares of the area below thresholds of 20 and for slope land cover soils and slope combinations with shares of the area below thresholds of 20 these thresholds were selected for retaining the dominant land covers maintaining individual hrus for the four monitored micro catchments and keeping the computational costs manageable in total the model setup resulted in 140 hrus which represented around 80 of the total area we set up three swat t models to evaluate three empirical potential evapotranspiration pet methods available in the model to estimate the actual et swat t ha used the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 swat t pt the priestley taylor formulation priestley and taylor 1972 and swat t pm the penman monteith method monteith 1965 the list of hydroclimatological and spatial data used to set up the swat t models is presented in table 2 maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation data were compiled from ten weather stations four from the mexican national weather service smn 2020 three from lópez ramírez et al 2020 and three operated by the national autonomous university of mexico unam monthly average relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were available only for the unam and lópez ramírez 2020 stations which were assigned to the rest of the weather stations considering the similarity in terms of elevation and the shortest distance this monthly data was used to inform the swat weather generator 2 3 plant growth and canopy interception calibration 2 3 1 leaf area index we combined ground based leaf area index lai measurements with modis satellite products maximum lai was measured with the lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor 2019 over a 500 m transect in eight plots with dominant land covers at different elevations two mf two if two sc one ip and one pi fig 1b these measurements were taken during the rainy season july 8 to august 20 2019 in the early morning hours 6 45 a m to 8 00 a m before sunset or under cloudy conditions to avoid scattering effects the modis satellite provide estimates of lai on a 500 m grid every eight days at a world scale myneni et al 2015 we extracted and analyzed 231 modis lai composites from june 2014 to august 2019 to estimate the average daily lai values for 8 pixels with homogeneous land covers representative of our lai sampling sites clouds were masked and mean lai values were predicted for each day of the year by fitting local polynomial regressions ripley 1998 in the stats package r core team 2019 to the eight day modis lai estimates pooled across years 2014 2019 finally we rescaled the smoothed daily lai using the observed lai for each of our sites in pine forests we used the default swat max lai value 5 0 since we did not have an accurate needle to shoot area ratio to adjust the observed lai in general we observed that the modis algorithm myneni et al 2015 produced acceptable results in the broadleaf forest mf and if while it significantly overestimated lai in the sc and in the ip fig 2 the smoothed and rescaled modis lai models were used to calibrate the swat t vegetation growth module for simulating lai fig 2 table b1 appendix b presents the swat t model parameters that were adjusted during the manual calibration process initially the minimum lai alai min and maximum potential lai blai for each land cover class were based on the ground based modis lai model which corresponds well with independent measurements in the study area gonzález martínez and holwerda 2018 the shape coefficients for the lai curve frgrw1 frgrw2 laimx1 laimx2 and the remaining parameters were adjusted by a trial and error process based on values reported in the literature i e strauch and volk 2013 alemayehu et al 2017 such that the swat t simulated lai mimics the rescaled modis lai 2 3 2 plant growth and canopy interception calibration in the study region the tmcf consists of a mix of deciduous semi deciduous e g leaf exchanging and evergreen species of tropical and temperate biogeographical origins williams linera 1999 williams linera et al 2013 most of the semi deciduous species are of temperate origin and the timing of the leaf exchange is not controlled by water availability instead these species shed their leaves during the early and mid dry season and leaf out during the mid to late dry season borchert et al 2005 we manually defined the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season sos1 january and sos2 february respectively where a new vegetation growth cycle takes place two parameters are used to avoid unrealistic results such as a false starts of the growing cycle during the dry season due to short spell rainfall alemayehu et al 2017 the swat t parameters that control the shape the magnitude and the temporal dynamics of lai were manually adjusted to reproduce the values of the rescaled modis lai for each land cover class table b1 in appendix b this procedure was repeated for the parameterization of the maximum canopy storage capacity canmx canmx was determined for mature forest 3 3 mm intermediate forest 1 8 mm pine 1 2 mm and shade coffee 1 6 mm these values were obtained from measurements of throughfall and stemflow in these land covers at different elevations in the study catchments gonzález martínez and holwerda 2018 holwerda et al 2010 holwerda et al 2013 muñoz villers et al 2012 2015 2 4 sensitivity analysis and calibration for streamflow at the gavilanes catchment 2 4 1 streamflow at the gavilanes catchment we used a two year daily streamflow series from the gavilanes catchment streamflow gauge 2 may 2015 30 april 2017 water levels were measured every 10 min using water level sensors paired with barometric pressure recorders recorded levels were converted to streamflow l s 1 using experimental stage discharge relationships based on rating curves derived from salt dilution measurements of discharge guzmán huerta 2019 the streamflow data were resampled mean to daily timesteps fig 3 2 4 2 selection of sensitive parameters in a parameter screening we ran a global sensitivity analysis gsa for the simulation of discharge at the gavilanes catchment outlet for the swat t models using each pet method to identify the most influential parameters we explored 23 model parameters that are frequently calibrated in swat to simulate discharge see arnold et al 2012 mehdi et al 2018 schürz et al 2019 meins 2013 for a description of the relevant model parameters controlling the water balance the ranges and types of parameter changes represent typical procedures often found in the swat literature an overview of the model parameters that were identified as influential and that were further used in the model is provided in table b2 appendix b we employed the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast algorithm cukier et al 1973 included in the r fast package reusser 2015 and integrated as part of the swatplusr workflow schürz 2019 to screen and rank the model parameters a parameter was selected as important if it was within the most sensitive parameters employing the kling gupta efficiency criterion kge for daily streamflow including its three components gupta et al 2009 the gsa performed for the model parameters of the three swat t models yielded similar results for the first 13 independent parameters therefore we employed 13 parameters during the calibration of the three models table b2 in appendix b 2 4 3 identification of non unique parameter sets calibration to facilitate the analysis of the swat t model performance and separate the effects of particular pet methods on model output we selected a series of simulations with non unique parameter sets schürz et al 2019 we simulated daily discharge for each swat t model using the latin hypercube sampling method with the r package lhs carnell 2019 to select 3000 random samples for the parameter combinations of the 13 most influential parameters that we had previously identified we evaluated simulations using signature metrics and a statistical performance metric kge the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation rsr moriasi et al 2007 was calculated for five segments of the flow duration curve fdc very high 0 5 days of exceedance high 5 20 medium 20 70 low 70 95 and very low flows 95 100 as suggested by pfannerstill et al 2014 rsr varies from an optimal value of 0 which indicates a perfect model simulation to a large positive value this evaluation method has been shown to lead to an improved selection of good calibration runs since it captures different parts of the hydrograph pfannerstill et al 2014 we simultaneously identified the best 1500 runs out of 3000 for the five signature metrics minimize rsr followed by the selection and comparison of the best ten simulations with maximum kge for each swat t model swat t ha swat t pt and swat t pm 2 4 4 temporally distributed parameter sensitivity analysis the temporally distributed parameter sensitivity analysis tdsa is used to identify deficiencies in the model structure as a function of time of year pfannerstill et al 2015 haas et al 2015 guse et al 2014 guse et al 2016 guse et al 2019 a tdsa was applied to the three swat t models to obtain daily temporal parameter sensitivities which were later summarized at monthly intervals guse et al 2016 to derive information about the dominant hydrological processes during the wet and dry seasons we simulated daily discharge for each model in the gavilanes catchment again using the latin hypercube sampling to select 1500 random samples for the combinations of eight parameters table b3 in appendix b from the thirteen parameters used for calibration table b2 in appendix b seven parameters were selected to assess parameter sensitivity for each hydrologic process surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow evaporation and soil water storage canmx was added in the tdsa for rainfall interception we did not consider the routing parameters ch k2 ch n2 alpha bnk as they are related to channels for lateral flow groundwater and evaporation we used only parameters previously reported in other swat studies e g guse et al 2014 guse et al 2019 leaving hru slp dep imp and epco out of the tdsa analysis the parameters that control surface runoff soil water storage lateral flow and rainfall interception were modified spatially while the parameters controlling groundwater were altered globally due to the lack of spatially distributed empirical data for a detailed description of the model parameters and the associated processes please refer to neitsch et al 2011 to study the temporal dynamics of the parameterization of daily discharge simulations for the three pet methods we employed the r package tempawn schürz 2020 which calculates the daily pawn pianosi and wagener 2015 the name of the method was derived from the authors names sensitivity index according to pianosi and wagener 2018 for each time step of a simulation pawn is moment independent and is a suitable method for asymmetrically distributed outputs of models zadeh et al 2017 pawn pianosi and wagener 2015 has shown to be effective for parameter ranking including various applications with the swat model zadeh et al 2017 pianosi and wagener 2018 schürz et al 2019 a dummy variable is artificially introduced that cannot affect the output but provides an indication of the extent of approximation errors if the sensitivity index of a parameter is smaller than the dummy variable then we can conclude that this factor is not influential pianosi and wagener 2018 2 5 validation of streamflow in four micro catchments 2 5 1 streamflow at four micro catchments within each micro catchment fig 1c streamflow and rainfall were measured from 2015 to 2019 for streamflow v notch weirs were installed at each micro catchment outlet and the water level was logged every 1 5 min using a solinst water level sensor model 3001 paired with a barometric pressure recorder model 3001 we calculated the streamflow l s 1 using field derived rating curves generated via volumetric and salt dilution measurements of discharge moore 2005 please see lópez ramírez et al 2020 for more details 2 5 2 validation of streamflow in four micro catchments we evaluated the performance of the three calibrated swat t models swat t ha swat t pt and swat t pm for streamflow simulation at four sites all calibrated parameters identified non unique parameter sets were subsequently applied individually a parameter set at a time to the swat t models mehdi et al 2018 and the model simulations were evaluated in four hrus representing the dominant land cover in the corresponding micro catchments table 1 mf 100 if 77 sc 94 and ip 63 the location and weather data of these hrus are the same as in the corresponding micro catchments and the hrus represent the dominant soil slope and elevation conditions observed in the micro catchments first we visually compared the simulated and observed fdcs second we estimated the percentage bias pbias criteria for the annual ratio between average daily runoff and average daily rainfall q p for the mean annual daily high flow q5 and for the mean annual daily low flow q95 2 6 validation of evapotranspiration at three sites 2 6 1 evapotranspiration at three sites water and energy fluxes were measured at three sites over different time periods to calculate evapotranspiration et et was calculated as the sum of rainfall interception i and dry canopy evaporation or transpiration et in a mature and an intermediate montane cloud forest located at an altitude of about 2100 m fig 1b et values were derived from continuous sapflow measurements from january november 2007 37 trees for mature forest and 13 trees for intermediate forest and i values were quantified using throughfall and stemflow measurements in plots between september 2006 and june 2007 in the intermediate forest and between april 2007 and april 2008 in the mature forest see holwerda et al 2010 and muñoz villers et al 2012 for more details in a shaded coffee plantation located at an altitude of 1210 m fig 1b et and i were calculated using the eddy covariance method and measurements of throughfall and stemflow respectively september 2006 august 2008 see holwerda et al 2013 for more details in these studies the et results were also expressed as a fraction of the fao penman monteith reference evapotranspiration et0 this metric facilitates comparison of independent site vegetation transpiration rates relative to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere allen et al 1998 the interception results were expressed as a fraction of the mean annual rainfall p for the mature forest et was 787 mm 92 of et0 and i was 613 mm 18 of p in the intermediate forest et was 788 mm 92 of et0 and i was 315 mm 9 of p and in the shade coffee et was 992 mm 89 of et0 while i was 110 mm 8 of p 2 6 2 validation of evapotranspiration at three sites we compared the evapotranspiration et predicted by the three swat t models with et estimated from meteorological data and locally derived indices of interception divided by precipitation i p and transpiration divided by reference evapotranspiration et et0 first we calculated the mean annual precipitation mp and the mean reference evapotranspiration met0 following allen et al 1998 and using the available meteorological data for the study period 4 years at three sites next the interception i was estimated as the product of i p and mp and the et was obtained by multiplying met0 by et et0 finally et was estimated by adding i and et table 5 these et values were compared with et predicted in the corresponding hrus by the calibrated swat t models using the best set of previously identified parameters table b4 in appendix b model parameters additionally we estimated the simulated rainfall interception sim i swat t as the difference between et predicted by the calibrated swat t models and et predicted by the calibrated swat t models when the canopy storage capacity canmx is set to zero table 5 3 results 3 1 leaf area index calibration we evaluated the degree of agreement between daily modis lai and the lai simulated by the calibrated swat t using visual comparisons and statistical measures from the qualitative inspection see fig 2 it is apparent that the annual growth cycle of each land cover class from the calibrated swat t model corresponds well with the modis lai model rescaled with field data in quantitative terms the calibrated models exhibited generally strong correlations 0 67 mf 0 89 if 0 92 ip 0 47 pi and 0 64 sc during the calibration period the greatest mismatch in lai was found for pi most likely because the pine trees have bundles of needles rather than broad leaves the 25 75th percentiles in fig 2 show the effect of temperature primarily related to the elevation gradient on the computation of lai sc exhibited narrower bands than the other land covers because it is mainly distributed between 1100 and 1500 m a s l it can be observed that the lai bands become wider at the end of the annual cycle because the growth model uses the accumulated number of heat units 3 2 streamflow calibration at the gavilanes catchment visual comparisons of daily simulated streamflow hydrographs with observed streamflow over the calibration period for the three models swat t ha swat t pt and swat t pm suggest a good fit fig 3a the quantitative results presented in table 3 indicate that swat t ha had a higher kge and nse and a lower pbias than the other two models the swat t pm model had the poorest ability of the calibrated models to reproduce observed streamflow lower nse and kge and larger pbias these statistical results were consistent with the results from the signature metric analysis where swat t ha consistently had the lowest rsr for the five parts of the fdc and swat t pm the largest these results are also evident in fig 3b where we can observe narrower uncertainty bands for swat t ha at very low flows however the three models produced similar results exhibiting high rsr values table 3 indicates that the three swat t models overestimated the observed discharge mean pbias for swat t pm 24 mean pbias for swat t pt 12 mean pbias for swat t ha 5 the water balance presented in table c1 appendix c confirms these findings and shows that swat t pm predicted the lowest pet 807 mm and et 665 mm and the highest total streamflow 1407 mm followed by swat t pt pet 977 mm et 926 mm total streamflow 1203 mm and swat t ha pet 1179 mm et 1098 mm total streamflow 1085 mm overall the water balance table c1 indicates a low influence of surface runoff 4 16 of total streamflow in all models and a dominance of lateral flow 40 to 72 of total streamflow in all models in the streamflow response 3 3 temporally distributed parameter sensitivity analysis the monthly averages of sensitivity results fig 4 for the six model processes were very similar for the three models swat t ha swat t pm and swat t pt a marked dominance of lateral flow was detected throughout the year with an important contribution of groundwater the highest significance of groundwater parameters occurred in october and november during the transition between the wet and dry seasons hydrograph recession a low influence of surface runoff was observed except in the middle of the rainy season july september when this runoff component plays a slightly more significant role evapotranspiration interception and soil water storage parameters had a low influence on streamflow fig 4 this result was expected because the water deficit for evapotranspiration is low throughout the year 3 4 validation of streamflow in the four micro catchments the selection of a specific pet method influences the calculations of et and in turn affects the water balance qualitatively the three models swat t ha swat t pm and swat t pt showed good performance in simulating different phases of the fdc for mf and sc additionally all three models accurately simulated the high mid and low flows in the if fig 5 however swat t clearly failed to capture the very low flows observed in if an unexpected result was that the model largely overestimated the low and very low flow dynamics in the ip probably due to the global calibration of groundwater parameters the statistical results table 4 confirm these findings where the three swat t models exhibited extremely high mean pbias 400 for mean annual daily low flow q95 in the ip micro catchment additionally the three models underestimated q95 in the mf and if hrus for mean annual daily high flow q5 the swat t pm and swat t pt models exhibited slightly better performance than swat t ha for average water balance conditions q p the swat t ha model produced a general underestimation while swat t pt showed mixed results and the swat t pm method produced a general overestimation 3 5 validation of evapotranspiration at three sites comparisons of et as predicted by the best calibrated models swat t ha swat t pm and swat t pt with et estimated based on i p and et et0 derived from local measurements see section 2 6 for explanation revealed that et simulated by swat t ha more closely matched et based on local data than the other two models table 5 however our results also show that swat t ha overestimates et in sc by 247 mm 22 at lower elevations 1210 m a s l while underestimating et in mf by 310 mm 22 and in if by 58 mm 5 at about 2100 m a s l swat t pm and swat t pt caused a higher underestimation of et for the same forest sites the simulated rainfall interception capacity varied from 36 mm yr 1 sim i swat t pt to 109 mm yr 1 sim i swat t pm representing 4 of the water balance for all sites and models table 5 4 discussion 4 1 validation of calibrated swat t models with local evapotranspiration data at three sites with focus on the performance of the pet methods available in the model the adequate selection of a pet method and the accurate simulation of leaf area index and rainfall interception influence the computation of evapotranspiration in the swat t model and affect the water balance swat t alemayehu et al 2017 was capable of accurately simulating lai in the study area fig 2 overall the rescaled modis lai model effectively represented the annual growth dynamics when compared with independent lai observations in mature forest the average lai measured for the dry and wet seasons was 4 1 and 5 9 respectively gonzález martínez and holwerda 2018 the lai model also provided good results when compared with shade coffee plantations where the minimum lai was 2 7 in december 2016 and the maximum lai was 3 9 in july 2017 holwerda and meesters 2019 furthermore the swat t simulated lai corresponded well with the modis lai annual growth model an average r2 of 0 71 for all land covers the formulation of swat t did not allow realistic simulation of the effect of rainfall interception in forested areas rainfall interception in the study region has been reported in the literature to be about 18 and 9 of p in mature and intermediate forests respectively holwerda et al 2010 muñoz villers et al 2012 and around 8 of p in a shade coffee plantation holwerda et al 2013 these values strongly suggest that in these environments interception is an important component of the water balance for mature forests and that the conversion of mature forests to other land covers such as shade coffee is associated with a decrease in rainfall interception as high as 10 of p all of the swat t models in our study underestimated rainfall interception i 4 of p for all land covers see table 5 furthermore the temporally distributed sensitivity analysis fig 4 indicated that interception has a low effect on streamflow for all the swat t models these results can be explained by the fact that swat t limits daily evaporation from the canopy by daily pet fig 1 of abiodun et al 2018 neitsch et al 2011 and thus underestimates the actual evaporation from the wet forest canopy see below for further discussion this point requires further review and we suggest that the swat t model should allow the canopy storage capacity to empty daily as assumed by simpler widely accepted interception models such as the liu model liu 2001 more attention should be given to the appropriate selection of pet methods for swat model applications although we found low influence of evapotranspiration et interception i and soil water storage parameters in the daily sensitivity analysis fig 4 we observed that the pet method impacted model performance table 3 and significantly affected the water balance table c1 et accounts for 30 40 of rainfall in the headwater catchments where most recharge occurs muñoz villers et al 2012 muñoz villers et al 2015 muñoz villers et al 2016 these et results agree with values of et 19 50 reported in other tropical montane mesoscale catchments i e crespo et al 2012 beck et al 2013 we attribute the low influence of et i and soil water storage parameters to the availability of water throughout the year and the limited capacity of the swat t model to simulate interception in forested areas nevertheless our findings support that the choice of the pet estimation method influences the swat t model performance to simulate discharge as suggested by alemayehu et al 2015 the models parameterized with radiation based methods swat t pt and swat t pm significantly underestimated et in the upper parts of the cloud forest zone table 5 and consequently limited the models capacity to accommodate evaporation from the forests in the lower areas fog occurrence is practically absent only 2 of the time holwerda 2010 nonetheless fog is more frequent around 32 alvarado barrientos et al 2014 in the middle and upper sections of the cloud forest belt and it is probable that a higher presence of fog is associated with higher epiphyte densities that may contribute to higher canopy storage capacities in these areas gonzález martínez and holwerda 2018 these high interception capacities may in turn enhance wet canopy evaporation in forested areas driven by negative downward sensible heat flux rather than sustained by radiant energy alone stewart 1977 mizutani et al 1997 the aerodynamic term in the pm equation accounts for sensible heat advection however in swat t the pm method will underestimate wet canopy evaporation because it uses the surface resistance of alfalfa 100 s m 1 neitsch et al 2011 while the actual surface resistance is zero under such conditions moreover this pet method calculates aerodynamic resistance considering a crop height of 40 cm neitsch et al 2011 this yields a value for aerodynamic resistance about 5 times larger than that of forest contributing to the underestimation of pet in the pt method the aerodynamic term is represented by the pt coefficient 1 28 neitsch et al 2011 however shuttleworth and calder 1979 suggested that this is not sufficient to account for the high evaporation rates from wet forest canopies i e energy input from sensible heat advection can be several times greater than that from radiation the model parameterized with the temperature based method swat t ha generally produced higher et estimates table 5 higher values of pet compensate for the low capacity of the model to represent the evaporation of intercepted rainfall in forests but also lead to overestimation of transpiration rates in other land covers it is likely that the pt method also overestimates forest transpiration when using the pt and ha methods swat t does not explicitly model the effect of the lai on transpiration for lai 3 0 neitsch et al 2011 therefore the et values simulated by swat t for mf and if are very similar when using the ha and pt methods table 5 both methods underestimate the effect of vegetation cover on hydrological flows in conclusion the swat t ha model performed better but not for the right reasons and the use of this approach overestimated et in areas with lower interception capacity such as shade coffee especially in the lower parts of the catchment where the presence of fog is less important 4 2 assessment of the accuracy of the swat t model to simulate streamflow at the outlet of the gavilanes catchment 34 km2 the swat t model was able to satisfactorily simulate streamflow during the calibration period as shown in fig 3 and confirmed by acceptable goodness of fit indices table 3 the incorporation of a multi metric framework that considers five segments of the fdc pfannerstill et al 2014 improved the identification of the best parameter sets however calibrating the models was challenging for very high and low flow conditions in our study we were able to improve the model calibration by relaxing the conditions for the simultaneous selection of the best 50 quantile for the five segments of the fdc while other researchers have used more restrictive conditions for selecting simulations including the best 20 quantile by pfannerstill et al 2014 and the best 25 quantile by guse et al 2020 we observed that our more relaxed approach was effective in enhancing overall model performance and parameter identification the temporally distributed sensitivity analysis suggested a low influence of surface runoff an intermediate influence of groundwater and the dominance of lateral flow in estimating streamflow response fig 4 this finding agrees with the water balance table c1 which indicates that surface runoff accounts for about 4 to 16 of the total streamflow while lateral subsurface flow controls around 40 to 72 of the streamflow response this finding agrees with a recent study in a neighboring catchment of similar size 60 6 km2 where lópez hernández 2019 examined 159 storm events and found that only 3 7 of total streamflow were contributed by surface runoff nevertheless muñoz villers et al 2016 reported long mean baseflow transit times between 1 2 and 2 7 years for the gavilanes catchment and 11 nested subcatchments 0 1 to 34 km2 suggesting that deep subsurface flow paths rather than shallow lateral flow is the dominant flow path for runoff generation muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 2013 these results agree with the high permeability observed at the soil bedrock interface 5 30 mm h 1 a structural deficit in the swat t model can explain the contradiction in between the swat t prediction of lateral flow as the most important process when evidence suggests that deep subsurface flow paths are dominant in swat t groundwater is divided into a shallow and a deep aquifer the shallow aquifer represents an unconfined aquifer that may discharge into the channel the deep aquifer is described as a confined aquifer that does not contribute to the streamflow neitsch et al 2011 the swat t model s reliance on a single active groundwater storage compartment is insufficient for describing both the fast recession phase and the low flow with the same parameter set luo et al 2012 guse et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2014 in this regard the parameter gwdelay presents a tradeoff between both discharge phases table b3 and table b4 in appendix b if gwdelay represents a fast recession with a short number of days the model produces a large amount of water available for contribution to streamflow on the other end a longer gwdelay is required to represent the slow water release during the long low flow periods pfannerstill et al 2014 streamflow measurements in our study catchment indicated a long recession phase so the calibration resulted in a large value for gwdelay around 400 days see table b4 appendix b consequently the shallow aquifer releases the water more slowly and the system behaves more like a semipermeable layer providing conditions that inaccurately imply the dominance of lateral flow hu and li 2018 in summary local evidence suggested that discharge in our catchment is determined by the volume of water in storage and should be characterized by nonlinear rate coefficients kirchner 2009 while swat t assumes that the variation in groundwater flow is linearly related to the rate of change in water table height neitsch et al 2011 4 3 validation of the calibrated swat t models with streamflow observed in four nested micro catchments 0 137 0 446 km2 within the study area examining the performance of the swat t model simulations of streamflow in micro catchments with contrasting land cover is useful since these results can help to better understand the strengths and limitations of the model at hru scale some authors have noted that swat shows a tendency to underperform in either very low or very high discharge events particularly in forested areas qiu et al 2012 the three models swat t ha swat t pm and swat t pt were capable of satisfactorily estimating annual runoff coefficients and mean annual daily high flows q5 in all land covers although the best results were obtained for mf and sc fig 5 table 4 major discrepancies were observed for the mean annual daily low flows especially in the if and ip micro catchments table 4 previous studies in this region suggest that managed land covers such as pasture can increase the variability of the streamflow response but indicators such as the mean annual runoff coefficient q p and the mean annual daily high flow q5 tend to be largely determined by elevation and slope lópez ramírez et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2013 this phenomenon was captured well by swat t models where higher runoff coefficients were observed at higher elevations ramírez et al 2017 sáenz et al 2014 for slope swat t predicted higher peak flows in steeper slopes which is consistent with the higher mean annual daily high flows q5 observed in steeper slopes by lópez ramírez et al 2020 and muñoz villers et al 2013 steeper slopes have also been associated with higher quickflow and lower time to peak responses mu et al 2015 nainar et al 2018 overall the calibrated swat t models produced acceptable q p and mean annual daily high flows q5 predictions pbias 25 for most of the land covers we attribute this result to the dense network of climate stations available fig 1 and the use of slope in the definition of hrus in terms of dry season baseflow local studies indicate that both mature and intermediate forests exhibit higher mean annual daily low flows q95 than pastureland and shade coffee lópez ramírez et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2013 which is consistent with the sponge effect hypothesis for forests bruijnzeel 2004 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 ogden et al 2013 muñoz villers et al 2015 our swat t results however point in the opposite direction with the model substantially overestimating mean annual daily low flow in the ip micro catchment for all models pbias 400 see table 4 and underestimating mean annual daily low flow for all the models in the mf and if micro catchments table 4 this finding has serious implications when using hydrological models to analyze the effects of land use changes e g deforestation reforestation and natural regeneration on water budgets we attribute this result to the dominance of global calibration of parameters controlling lateral and groundwater flow fig 4 spatially distributed empirical data is rarely available for these processes 4 3 1 potential limitations of this approach in our global sensitivity analysis we did not consider the impact of model setup number of sub basins and hrus however our study addresses the uncertainty associated with model parameterizations allowing the visualization of the effects of non unique parameter sets many authors recognize that the impact of this factor is generally more significant than model setup by several orders of magnitude schürz et al 2019 jha et al 2004 the selection of hrus considers a land cover threshold of 5 given the significant computation time required to run this analysis this threshold was used to reduce the computational costs without significantly compromising the simulation accuracy however we recognize that this practice reduces the effects of small land covers at the outlet schürz et al 2019 uncertainty in data such as the rainfall interception and evaporation used in this study may be very high due to the complex terrain finally we were not able to completely isolate the response of unique hrus because the four studied micro catchments were not entirely covered by a unique land use and slope class table 1 these heterogeneities may have influenced our results 5 conclusions swat t was capable of accurately mimicking the annual vegetation growth simulating streamflow at the main outlet and predicting a low influence of surface runoff in zones of tropical montane cloud forest in central veracruz mexico however the model incorrectly predicted the dominance of lateral flow versus deep groundwater flow as observed by isotope based studies our results thus support the hypothesis that the single active aquifer formulation of swat is unable to adequately reproduce the complex response in groundwater dominated catchments the model parameterized with the ha method for pet computation swat t ha produced the best goodness of fit results for streamflow and evapotranspiration all the swat t model variants resulted in an underestimation of forest evaporation under the wet conditions of the cloud forest zone of central veracruz temperature based pet methods swat t ha perform better in these areas but for the wrong reasons since the use of these approaches overestimates pet and et rates in areas with lower interception capacity i e non forested the incorporation of simpler and more widely accepted interception models such as liu model liu 2001 may improve these results for the right reasons swat t satisfactorily reproduced the q p and mean annual daily high flows in contrasting land covers mf if sc ip however the model overestimated the mean annual daily low flow in the ip micro catchment and underestimated it in the mf and if micro catchments this result suggests that the use of the swat t models in cloud forests underlain by permeable substrates where ground water flow controls the hydrological response requires improvement in calibration procedures to incorporate local knowledge regarding the land use effects on the baseflow sustenance overall structural improvements informed by field data are required to better understand and model the hydrology in swat t our findings showed that the incorporation of local datasets from multiple locations and processes during the modeling calibration and validation is key to advance hydrological modeling tools 6 funding sources this research was founded by a us national science

4094,due to global climate change and urbanization more attention has been paid to decipher the nonstationary multivariate risk analysis from the perspective of probability distribution establishment in this study a multivariate nonstationary hazard assessment of annual extreme rainfall events extracted from daily precipitation data observed at eight meteorological stations in haihe river basin china was done in three phases 1 several statistical tests such as nonparametric trend tests log likelihood ratio lr tests and change point cp tests were applied to both the marginal distributions and the dependence structures to decipher different forms of nonstationarity 2 estimation of the time varying parameter for the marginal and joint probability distributions by maximum likelihood method and 3 calculation of hydrologic design quantiles at different average annual reliability levels arr during a certain design life period in terms of hazard assessment according to the results the attributes and their dependence structure belonging to several stations show nonstationarity because of existed trend in model parameter or change point in the process of hazard assessment the nonstationarity of dependence structure would produce less impact on arr based designed quantile estimation than the nonstationarity of marginal distribution on the one hand on the other hand it would add more uncertainty of quantile estimation for hydrologic design keywords multivariate hazard assessment time varying copula annual average reliability nonstationarity trend analysis 1 introduction due to climate change and increasing urbanization heavy rains induced floods have occurred more frequently all over the world in recent decades which is becoming a major deterrent to the sustainable development of social economy mishra and singh 2009 donat et al 2016 ali and mishra 2018 various kinds of social activities such as infrastructure constructions agricultural irrigation and ecological maintenance would be influenced by hydrometeorological extreme events a systematic risk analysis of these extreme events would provide sufficient strategies for decision makers a multitude of studies have addressed the effect of climate change and urbanization on hydrological design to alleviate associated risks traditional hydrological frequency analysis is based on the stationary assumption which recommends that environmental impact indexes such as climatic factors and land use rate have a constant mechanism that affects hydrological variables all the time madsen et al 2017 milly et al 2015 the feasibility of hydrological risk analysis based on stationary assumptions is being challenged because of the multiple effects of climate change urbanization and heat island effects accordingly water authorities should amend the present design and management strategies to develop nonstationary distribution models under climate change therefore it is urgent to develop an efficient and systematic risk analysis approach from time dependent side to serve for hydraulic design of hydrological infrastructures in recent years nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis has received a great deal of attention because of increasing attention to climate change chen and sun 2017 call et al 2017 ghanbari et al 2019 the time varying moment approach is widely used to involve time variant probabilistic parameters for mimicking the changing behavior of extreme hydrometeorological variables under univariate cases in recent years zhang et al 2015 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2018 du et al 2015 modelled nonstationary low flow series in weihe river basin china based on the generalized additive models in location scale and shape gamlss framework results showed that inappropriately estimated statistical parameters would lead to the overstatement of risk corresponding to a low flow event gu et al 2016 incorporated time climate indices precipitation and temperature into the gamlss model to detect nonstationarity in flood frequency for the univariate case nonstationary risk analysis based on the time varying moment approach can be decomposed into four steps 1 descriptive and exploratory monitoring of hydrological sequences and monitoring of outliers 2 implementation of the stationarity hypothesis to verify the nonstationarity of hydrological series 3 development of a hydrological frequency analysis model and estimation of model parameters using different covariates and 4 risk assessment based on the selected frequency model the above studies were conducted under nonstationary conditions for univariate cases while it is known that natural hydrometeorological extreme events are multivariate characterized by multi attribute properties which can be statistically correlated it is therefore desirable to develop a multivariate model to simulate the probabilistic behavior of two or more properties salvadori and de michele 2004 firstly proposed the copula approach a useful tool for modelling the structure of dependence between hydrological variables regardless of the types of marginal distributions to deal with the multivariate frequency analysis after that copulas have been widely used for multivariate frequency analysis of rainfall extreme events zhang and singh 2007 kao and govindaraju 2008 rauf and zeephongsekul 2014 vandenberghe et al 2010 droughts de michele et al 2013 serinaldi et al 2009 shiau 2006 song and singh 2010 wong et al 2010 floods grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 zhang and singh 2006 however these studies assumed a time invariant dependence pattern ignoring the influence of climate change and hence did not consider the impact of nonstationarity on the dependence structure recently studies on multivariate distribution fitting have addressed the superiority of dynamic copula based method to model the nonstationary dependence structure which are generally caused by complex environment and rapid urbanization milly et al 2015 former studies have detected nonstationarity in dependence structures liu et al 2017 aissia et al 2014 yilmaz and perera 2014 their results showed that the joint probability varied significantly over time for different non stationary models jiang et al 2015 also did a multivariate risk analysis using the time varying copula method incorporating time and reservoir index as covariates for low flow series extracted from two neighboring observed stations traditional solutions of hydrological extreme events involve return period based methods which are usually calculated as the inverse of annual exceedance probability for a given magnitude under stationary conditions in a univariate case in a multivariate case the univariate return period can be extended to joint return periods of hydrological variables salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori and de michele 2010 salvadori et al 2013 while non stationary distribution models provide flexibility to analyze the variability of a hydrological variable they are also incongruent with many of the traditional metrics used in water resources planning for example the development of drainage standards is vulnerable to the standard of extreme rainfall return period which means drainage facilities have been designed to withstand the extreme rainfall event of a specified return period the multivariate hydrologic and hydraulic design can be influenced by the existence of nonstationarity in both the marginal and joint distributions the exceedance probability of a given extreme event would be different from year to year leading to an inconstant and non unique value of the conventional return period thus the notion of static return period of an extreme rainfall event e g 100 year extreme rainfall event 200 year extreme rainfall event is no longer reliable for hydraulic design under nonstationary conditions salas and obeysekera 2014 jiang et al 2015 yan et al 2017 as a result rootzén and katz 2013 first mentioned the concept of design life level dll to quantify the hazard of a given extreme rainfall magnitude over the hydrological structure s life time note that following the idea of rootzén and katz 2013 we regard the term hydrological hazard as the possibility of a certain extreme event occurring and not as a quantification of expected losses it is a logical extension to handle the nonstationarity of the concept of hazard of failure jakob et al 2013 which is more frequently used to quantify the hazard of hydrologic extremes under stationarity read and vogel 2015 extended the dll method to average annual reliability aar method to estimate the hydrologic design value considering nonstationarity in general these risk based methods can provide similar results of hydraulic design for hydrological infrastructure yan et al 2017 however the cases of multivariate hydrologic designs especially under nonstationary conditions using the time varying copula and design life level based risk methods have great potentiality in future studies therefore the objective of this study is to do hazard assessment of multivariate extreme rainfall events involving the following steps first change point cp tests are used for both the marginal distributions and the dependence structures to check the potential change point in the second phase we check different forms of linear and nonlinear trends in the parameters of both marginal distribution and copula models based on maximum likelihood method and likelihood ratio lr tests coles 2001 katz et al 2002 zhang et al 2004 meantime the goodness of fit tests are also investigated for both stationary and time varying marginal and copula models finally average annual reliability based arr hazard assessment is extended to multivariate cases to derive the design value of extreme rainfall event in this paper we investigated two kinds of extreme rainfall attributes 1 annual extreme rainfall volume ps annual total precipitation of the daily precipitation more than the 90th percentile threshold for each year and intensity im annual maximum daily precipitation the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the next section presents the methodology adopted in this study section 3 discusses the results of proposed model applied to haihe river basin china section 4 presents the final conclusion through the proposed model 2 methodology for the sake of the multiple attributes of extreme rainfall events and dynamic variations of the joint behavior of the extreme variables ps and im in this study we aim to apply the nonstationary copula methods to model the time varying behavior of extreme hydrometeorological processes copulas with the advantage of modelling the dependence structure independently of the marginal distributions of variables in comparison to multivariate extreme distribution the multivariate generalized pareto distribution and the multivariate gev are now becoming a standard tool for multivariate frequency analysis of extreme variables shiau 2006 song and singh 2010 wong et al 2010 here copula models are regarded as the joint probability distribution function we used the nonstationary copula models to quantify the variations of the probabilistic distribution patterns of extreme events shifts from year to year under the impact of a broad range of anthropogenic activities including climate change according to vezzoli et al 2017 and salvadori et al 2018 a comprehensive statistical analysis which can check the presence of trend and change point should be carried out before we incorporate the nonstationarity into the multivariate hazard assessment following the study of salvadori et al 2018 the non parametric change point statistical tests were implemented to check that whether the marginal or joint distributions are sensitive to changes these tests can be manipulated in the r package npcp kojadinovic 2017 we also used pattern recovery using trend filtering prutf for identifying unknown change points which can discriminate the patterns of nonstationarity between discontinuous change with change points and smooth change mehrizi and chenouri 2020 on the other hand univariate and multivariate mann kendall tests are investigated to detect the monotonic trend in the margins and the dependence structure details of these above tests can be found in the references serinaldi and kilsby 2016 kojadinovic and naveau 2017 in this study likelihood ratio tests lr of the time varying models against the stationary models based on the maximum likelihood method are proposed to detect the linear or nonlinear trends in the parameters coles 2001 katz et al 2002 details of the lr tests will be introduced in section 2 1 as shown in fig 1 in the process of selecting the best nonstationary models we follow strict testing procedures 1 ml based method was used to estimate the parameter of candidate models gof tests are firstly implemented to choose admissible copulas with estimated parameters several copula models here these above admissible models are defined as model set m gof 2 and then lr tests were manipulated on the basis of admissible models in gof manipulated to check whether trend caused nonstationarity did exist in model parameters or not here the above models having nonstationarity in parameters whose p value of lr tests is smaller than 0 05 are defined as model set m lr 3 and then we selected the best model with the smallest aicc from m lr and the best model is defined as m best according to the flowchart m best m lr m gof doing so with a series of individual tests at level α 0 05 leads to a totally uncontrolled type i error so we try our best to follow strict testing procedures in the process of selecting the best nonstationary models to control global type error i adopting independent gof tests for copula and margins and selecting stations with long observed years are another two efforts to control type error i copulas are highly respected tools to build multivariate distribution models of dependence structures between random variables regardless of their marginal distribution types detailed information of theoretical derivation about copulas can be found in nelsen 2006 for the practical guidelines from hydrological point of view it is recommended to refer to salvadori et al 2007 the changing climate has led to nonstationarity of individual hydrological series or the dependence between hydrological variables to realize this situation a time varying copula based model can describe the time dependent characteristics for dependence structure of hydrological variables let x y represent a hydrological pair the joint probability distribution of multivariables through time varying copula and marginal distribution model can then be presented as 1 f x y x y θ f x y t c f x x θ x t f y y θ y t θ c t c u v θ c t where c denotes the copula function f x y denotes the joint function f x and f y represent the marginal functions of hydrological variable ps and im in this study θ f x y t θ x t θ x t θ c t θ x t and θ x t represent the time varying marginal distribution parameters which would be a vector when distribution has several parameters θ c t is the dynamic copula parameter all of these parameters would be a linear or nonlinear function of time and u and v are the marginal cumulative probabilities 2 1 time varying marginal distribution in this part five kinds of probability distributions table 1 commonly used in the hydrological extreme value analysis beirlant et al 2004 were set as the alternative marginal patterns two kinds of 3 parameter distribution generalized extreme value gev pearson type iii piii and three kinds of 2 parameter distributions gamma weibull and lognormal considering the external expressions of nonstationarity of the marginal distributions the time dependent trend would be existed in all of the parameters including location parameter μ scale parameter σ and also the location parameter κ meanwhile the relationship between each parameter and the time year in this study would be exhibited in linear or nonlinear forms as a result both the linear and quadratic models are assumed as the possible function relation between parameter and time for illustration there are three kinds of function for location parameter plus the stationary situation which can be presented as follows 2 μ t constant μ 0 μ 1 t μ 0 μ 1 t μ 2 t 2 where t denotes time in this study t max is set to be equal to the sample size n μ 0 μ 1 and μ 2 are the new parameter for the time varying marginal distribution since each parameter has 3 kinds of function relations there are 27 kinds of candidate marginal distribution models for 3 parameter distribution and 9 kinds for the 2 parameter distribution considering the different range of parameters different constraint functions need to be added to ensure that the parameters are well defined details of the candidate marginal patterns for these above five distributions can be found in table s1 a d as shown in table s1 a b the complexity of the time varying models will increase as incorporation of time as the covariate into more parameters let st represent the stationary model for the extreme attribute ps and im in this study and let nst be the time varying model with trend existed in the parameter in the same way let ll 1 and ll 0 denote the log likelihoods under model st and nst the log likelihood ratio statistics lr would converge to the χ δ 2 distribution with δ being the divergence of the parameter number between the st and nst models and lr tests can be formulated as follows coles 2001 3 lr 2 ll 1 ll 0 the lr statistics can be regarded as a good criterion to check whether the null trend hypothesis h 0 t h e r e i s n o t r e n d f o r t h e d i s t r i b u t i o n p a r a m e t e r can be rejected or not if the value of lr is more than the upper α point of the χ δ 2 distribution the above null assumption can be rejected at a significance level of α in this study α is equal to 5 obviously it is easy to expand the lr tests into bivariate situation for copula parameter once the lr tests recommend that a linear or nonlinear trend do exist in a selected time varying distribution model the goodness of fit gof k s tests based on kolmogorov smirnov k s test at a significance level of 5 would be investigated to verify the fit of the potential time varying or stationary margins frank and massey 1951 and the corrected akaike information criterion aic c which is a more rigorous model selection criterion than commonly used aic criterion was implemented to quantify the fitting performance of the distribution models aicc hurvich and tsai 1989 the aicc can be computed as follows 4 aic c 2 k 2 ln l 2 k k 1 n k 1 a i c 2 k k 1 n k 1 where k is number of parameters while n is sample size the correction version of aic criterion is more efficient when the sample size is small or when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample size in order to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter estimation the parametric bootstrap efron and tibshirani 1993 method was also implemented 2 2 time varying copula similar to the above process of selecting the time varying moment model for the extreme rainfall attribute ps or im in this study the dependence structure between ps and im under nonstationary conditions would be developed by time varying copula in this study the candidate copula models table 2 consist of five kinds of 1 parameter copula joe frank gumbel clayton and gaussian and five kinds of 2 parameter copulas clayton gumbel bb1 student t joe gumbel bb6 joe clayton bb7 and joe frank bb8 each copula can be rotated at 90 180 survival copula 270 degrees for this study the rotated copula at 90 and 270 degrees are not considered because of the kendall s tau values corresponding to each dependence structure of ps and im for each station are positive table 7 a furthermore the above copula models can be implemented in r package cdvine brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 parallel to the establishment of time varying marginal models the relationship of the copula parameter might also be exhibited in linear or nonlinear forms taking the 1 parameter copula as an instance its parameter θ c t including the stationary copula can be assumed as three forms as follows 5 θ c t constant θ 0 θ 1 t θ 0 θ 1 t θ 2 t 2 where t denotes time in this study t is set as t 0 1958 1 where t 0 is calendar year 1958 2017 is just observed period θ 0 θ 1 and θ 2 are the new parameter for the time varying copula considering the different range of parameters different constraint functions need to ensure that the parameters are well defined finally there are close to 100 kinds of copula models for the potential dependence structure of each pair which might exhibit a certain trend table s2 a f inspired by the study of genest et al 2009 we tried to promote the goodness of fit test for copulas based on empirical copula gof ec to time varying copula fitting approximate p values of gof ec can be obtained via specially adapted monte carlo methods a parametric bootstrap procedure to approximate p values of gof ec for time varying copula models is described in appendix a the corrected akaike information criterion aicc hurvich and tsai 1989 was also employed here to make an objective selection of the best copula models from the potential admissible copulas which have passed the above gof ec test similar to the process in marginal distribution the presence of trend in the copula parameter was determined by computation of lr see equation 3 2 3 multivariate hazard assessment based on the average annual reliability aar for hydrological management engineering administrators focus more on the failure probability during the design life period of hydraulic structures condon et al 2015 inspired by average annual reliability aar method to quantify the probability that a hydraulic system would be safe over its planning period in univariate case salas and obeysekera 2014 read and vogel 2015 we would like to expand the arr based metrics to the multivariate case let jep t x y be the time varying joint exceedance probability of a certain extreme rainfall event x y which quantify the occurrence probability of a more perilous extreme event than x y in a specific hazard scenario arr value under nonstationary situations can be formulated as follows 6 a a a r x y t t 0 t 1 w t 1 jep t x y 7 t 1 3 t 1 t 0 3 here we used the above function to divide the design period into three sections is the floor function that eliminates all decimal places then the weight coefficient w t can be calculated as follows 8 w t 1 a 2 t 1 t 0 2 t 1 3 a 1 1 t 1 3 t 0 t t 0 t 1 3 a 1 a 2 t 1 t 0 2 t 1 3 a 1 1 t 1 3 t 0 t 1 3 t t 0 2 t 1 3 a 2 a 2 t 1 t 0 2 t 1 3 a 1 1 t 1 3 t 0 2 t 1 3 t t 1 here 1 a 1 a 2 which can make the revised measure give more weights to joint exceedance probability in more recent times a 1 and a 2 is a flexible coefficient which can be decided by the decision maker in this study we set a 1 2 and a 2 3 where t 0 is the initial year of the design life period for the hydraulic structure t 1 is just the terminal year of the hydraulic structure from the perspective of bivariate case the joint exceedance probabilities jep of extreme rainfall threshold can be calculated through four hazard scenarios in a stationary situation salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori et al 2011 salvadori et al 2013 salvadori et al 2016 the event is x x y y they are and scenario corresponding to the probability of p x x y y or scenario corresponding to p x x y y kendall scenario which could transform the bivariate extreme event into univariate case through the kendall s distribution and finally a survival kendall scenario with a bounded safer region than the kendall scenario there is still discussion on which form of the jep could be more appropriate in water resources planning and project design bender et al 2014 the scope of this study is not on which hazard scenario based aar is appropriate in water resources planning and project design but on the whether nonstationary patterns margins or copula would impose great impact on the design value at a certain aar level so we calculated aar from the and hazard scenario of interest here to evaluate effects of the different kinds of nonstationarity over the design value at each aar level it can be calculated as follows 9 jep t and 1 f x x θ x t f y y θ y t c u v θ c t and the time varying joint return period jrp t and can also be calculated by the above equation 10 jrp t and 1 1 f x x θ x t f y y θ y t c u v θ c t for the practical engineering design the engineers focus more on extreme rainfall quantiles at different aar levels aar 0 1 0 2 0 9 according to equation 8 it is not easy to calculate the extreme rainfall quantiles furthermore the quantile pairs in bivariate case for a certain joint exceedance probability would be numerous in multivariate extreme value analysis since all data pairs u v on the same joint return period level have the same joint exceedance probability however some combinations of a given probability are at least in theory more likely than others therefore the most likely technique is just select the most likely design event which theoretically has the largest joint probability density likelihood among all possible design event salvadori et al 2011 the most likely design realization δ ml of a certain aar level aar η can be derived as follows 11 δ ml a a r η argmax aar x y η f xy x y argmax aar x y η c x y f x f y here the most likely design realization δ ml can be calculated from the theoretical point of view we propose the following algorithm to derive the numeric solution for the quantile pairs of most likely event at each aar level based on parametric bootstrap method efron and tibshirani 1993 algorithm 1 1 estimate the parameter set θ x t θ y t θ c t based on the original observations for the best selected nonstationary models if it exists based on lr gof tests 2 generate i i d observations x 1 sim y 1 sim x 2 sim y 2 sim x n sim y n sim from the above nonstationary model 3 estimate the new parameter set from the simulated observations x i sim y i sim i 1 2 n 4 generate the parameter of marginal distribution and copula for each year from t 0 to t 1 5 generate a sample set with a length n for x with an equal interval for example 0 2 from the minimum value to maximum value of original observation the sample set with a length m of y is implemented in the same way and the n m matrix would be generated it can represent the quantile pair for the extreme rainfall event 6 calculate n m times of the aar value at the design life period t 0 t 1 select dozens of quantile pairs ξ by abs arr ξ l which is a small value as 0 0001 l is the potential arr level select the quantile pair with joint probability density function equation 11 being the largest from the quantile pair set ξ 7 repeat steps 2 and 6 b times with b the number of bootstrap repetitions 3 application 3 1 study area and data collection the area selected for the study is haihe river basin china which belongs to the temperate east asian monsoon climate zone fig 2 in summer heavy rains take place and temperature and humidity are high caused by marine air masses the annual rainfall has a great spatial and temporal variability across the basin due to the inconsistency of intensity retreat time and influence of the pacific subtropical high over the years natural disasters such as urban floods and mountain torrents induced by extreme rainfall events in the basin have caused huge losses to the social economy and people s lives and property and have been highly valued by decision making authorities as a result time varying copula based multivariate risk analysis of this basin is conducive to providing reliable strategies and alternative options for water resources risk based decision making daily rainfall data from haihe river basin observed at 8 stations were analyzed for the proposed nonstationary model detailed information on these 8 gauges is presented in table s3 according to various data ranges shown in table s3 the rainfall series from 1958 to 2017 was selected as the final version and the detailed information of the basic statistics is shown in table s4 3 2 preprocessing analysis before developing a nonstationary frequency analysis model it is essential to examine nonstationarities of extreme precipitation attributes ps and im as well as the structure of dependence between these two attributes table 3 shows results of nonparametric tests detecting trends and change points for two attributes of rainfall extremes ps and im as well as the dependence structure between them first time series of these two rainfall extremes ps and im for all 8 stations can pass the ljung box test with 20 lags p value 0 05 in table 3 which means the series is serially independent extreme observations are mutually independent with no serial autocorrelation so it is appropriate to apply the standardized mann kendall mk test to evaluate the statistical significance of trend without any modification serinaldi and kilsby 2016 firstly change point tests should be firstly be implemented to detect whether the change point exist in the univariate and bivariate cases from table 3 a change point of 1979 can be detected at ps attribute and the dependence structure between ps and im for station 7 at the significance level of 5 p value 0 033 for ps and p value 0 025 for ps im pair so the single ps series and ps im pair series were spilt out as two parts with the year 1979 being the broken point then univariate and multivariate mk tests were implemented for the above subseries compared to the mann kendall trend statistics derived from the original data sample size equal to 60 direction of trend has been changed from negative direction to positive direction no matter in univariate or multivariate case but all the trend statistics for station 7 did not show a significant downward or upward trend at 5 critical α level no further change point can be detected in the two sub periods before and after 1979 after change point analysis the following stations 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 with no change points should be investigated by the mk tests as shown in table 3 only ps of station 1 exhibited a significant downward trend at a significance level of 5 from univariate trend analysis while dependence structure of ps and im for station 6 showed a significant downward trend from multivariate trend analysis from nonparametric tests rainfall extremes of other stations did not show significant monotonic trend except station 1 and 6 since the mk tests are designed to detect the possible monotonic trend for the mean value of the extremes log likelihood ratio tests lr of the time varying models against the stationary models should be investigated to detect the trend of the distribution parameter because there would be a particular situation for a certain distribution i e gev distribution with opposing trends in location and scale parameter which would lead to an insignificant trend tested z 1 96 by mk tests in the extremes zhang et al 2004 hence even if precipitation extremes at a certain station may recommend statistically weak trends both the nonstationary and stationary models are established for each station in the following section to calculate the lr statistics 3 3 marginal distribution fitting and parameter trend analysis based on lr tests results of trend and change point tests performed in section 3 2 pointed out the necessity to take the nonstationarity of marginal distribution fitting into consideration tables 4a and 4b shows performances of nonstationary vs stationary models for these 8 stations following salvadori et al 2018 the series containing change point was handled firstly based on the pattern recovery using trend filtering prutf approach fig 3 only the discontinuous change can be identified at ps series of station 7 since the change point is existed in ps of station 7 at the year 1979 the marginal distribution fitting is implemented for psb the ps time series before change point 1979 and psc the ps time series after change point 1979 all the possible stationary or nonstationary models are fitted for these two spilt series according to the results of lr tests the p value of lr tests for the time varying models against corresponding the stationary models are larger than 5 which means there is no significant trend for parameters for psb and psc of station 7 and then kolmogorov smirnov k s based gof tests were implemented for the potential marginal models almost all the models could pass the gof tests at significant level of 5 based on the smallest aicc selection criterion the gao0 and logno0 model was the best one for psb and psc respectively to quantify uncertainty of the parameter estimation the parametric bootstrap method was incorporated to estimate the 90 uncertainty interval as shown in tables 4a and 4b secondly the marginal series with no change point were investigated in the same way both of attributes in station 2 3 and 4 and im in station 7 exhibited no trend in the distribution parameters by the lr tests so stationary models with smallest aicc value are selected as the best fitted models meanwhile all the selected models can pass the gof k s tests at a significant level of 5 for these above 4 stations the lr tests recommend no trend for ps and im extracted from these 4 stations which in accordance with mann kendall mk results shown in table 3 for station 1 the time varying model logno5 was selected as the best model for ps while stationary logno0 model was the best one and the trend in parameter of station 1 is also in accordance with the mk results in section 4 2 however as shown in table 3 b the trend in the parameter existed in im of station 5 ps of station 6 and 8 based on the lr tests at the 5 significance level which recommends another situation different from the previous mk tests according to the study of zhang et al 2004 the parameter trend analysis based on of the lr test are not always directly consistent with those of the mk tests to explore the causes of above divergence the trends of each parameter of time varying model logn6 for im of station 5 and ps of station 6 plus model logn8 for ps of station 8 are plotted in fig 4 as knows to all the mean value of lognormal distribution can be presented as follows 11 e t x e x p μ t σ t 2 2 where e t p s is just the time varying mean value of extreme value ps or im μ t is the time varying location parameter while σ t is just the time varying scale parameter for the im of station 5 the location parameter exhibited a linear downward trend but the scale parameter firstly exhibited a nonlinear upward trend before the year 1980 23 1958 1 and then a downward trend after 1980 which is defined as a nonmonotonic trend nmt in this study it is the same situation for ps of station 6 with a different turning point 1991 when it comes to the ps of station 8 both of the location and scale parameter exhibited a nonmonotonic trend with different points of inflexion in general the two parameters of the marginal distribution for these 3 stations all experienced an opposing trend period transparent green area in fig 4 which just covers the scenario noted by the study of zhang et al 2004 opposing trends existed in two parameters would lead to an insignificant trend tested by mk tests in the extremes focus on the z statistics of mk tests table 3 and the opposing trend range we find that the more the range of the opposing trend period was the less the absolute value of z would be since the nonstationary models with time as covariates it can be used to predict the extreme value in the future considering new dataset being added to the original data the parameters of the time varying models would be updated in this study we assume the parameters of the selected time varying models did not change a lot in the future 5 years so the estimated time varying models from the original extreme series were used to predict year 2018 2022 t 61 65 based on the same assumption the ending year of design life period in the following aar based quantiles calculation is set as 2022 as shown in fig 5 mean value of ps from station 1 and station 6 exhibited a downward trend while mean value of im from station 5 and ps from station 8 exhibited a nmt trend for the predicted period the predicted nonstationary marginal distributions for the extremes extracted from these 4 stations presented smaller mean values than those of the stationary distributions furthermore the divergence of mean values between them are becoming larger as time goes on for station 1 5 and 6 but for ps from station 8 the divergence of mean values between them are becoming smaller as time goes on 3 4 copula fitting once a marginal distribution was estimated based on above analysis the dependence structure for im and ps can be investigated by the time varying or time invariant copula functions as shown in table s2 a f almost 100 kinds of copula models for the potential dependence structure with different forms of trend were analyzed according to the lr ratio test making pre analyzing of the dependence in the data is definitely fundamental to reduce copula model alternatives according to table 7 kendall s taus of ps and im for all the stations are positive which recommends the clayton gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 copula rotated at 90 and 270 degrees are not suitable for describing dependence structure these rotated copulas at 90 and 270 degrees can only serve for negative dependence so original 31 kinds of copulas can be reduced into 17 kinds of copulas and for dependence structure of ps and im for station 1 the lower and upper tail dependence are not evident according to scatterplot of pseudo observations top left in fig 6 gaussian or frank copula with no tail dependence table s5 maybe the potential copula models and for dependence structure of ps and im for station 2 3 4 5 and 6 the lower and upper tail dependence are evident according to scatterplot of pseudo observations fig 6 which recommends student t bb1 bb7 survival bb1 and bb7 copula could be potential copula models with tail dependence coefficients table s3 finally the lower tail dependence of ps and im for station 8 is evident while the upper tail dependence is not evident according to scatterplot of pseudo observations bottom right in fig 3 clayton survival gumbel survival joe survival bb6 and survival bb8 would be potential copula models totally speaking the efficiency of copula model selection was significantly improved by identifying the different kinds of tail dependence parallel to the operating procedure of the marginal distribution salvadori et al 2018 the rainfall extreme pairs ps im from station 7 was cut into two parts as shown in table 5a firstly the copula parameter and parameter uncertainty was estimated by maximum likelihood method combined with parametric bootstrap method the anderson darling goodness of fit test based on rosenblatt s transformation ad rt was also implemented for check the fit of copula based on the smallest aicc criterion and lr tests fr0 and sgu0 model was the best one for the two divided pair series before and after 1979 respectively secondly the distribution fitting was investigated for the dependence structure with no change point according to the lr tests parameter trend only existed in the dependence structure of ps and im from station 6 and the best time varying copula model is model cg7 table 5b for other stations the best copula models can be derived in the same way table 5a focus on the nonstationary copula models for station 6 kendall s tau of the im and ps was estimated during the observed and predicted periods fig 5 as shown in fig 7 the estimated tau experienced a downward trend before t is equal to 12 then an upward trend until t being 36 it finally experienced a downward trend compared to the tau estimated from stationary copula the tau estimated from nonstationary copula would be smaller than that from stationary angles 3 5 time varying joint return period jrp calculation after selecting the best fitted time varying distributions and copula for the extreme rainfall attributes ps and im which showed trend caused station 1 5 6 8 and change point caused station 7 nonstationarity the design values of the indexes characterizing annual extreme rainfall events were computed based on the time varying joint return period jrp under and scenario equation 10 firstly the jrp isolines at levels equaling 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 and 500 years for station 1 5 6 and 8 are presented with trend caused nonstationarity existed in their extreme rainfall attributes fig 8 and figures s1 a d since the sample size is 60 1958 2017 jrp isolines of these two indexes at different return levels can be generated at each year which would plot 60 jrp isolines pictures for simplicity the jrp isolines at year 1962 1977 1992 and 2017 were shown in this part to show the performance of the time varying copula models the results of the nonstationary models are also compared with the outputs of the currently used time independent stationary models stationary margins and stationary copulas the critical return period green lines in fig 8 at return level equaling 50 years covering most of the observed data points red points in fig 8 is used as the milestone to better illustrate the flow of the dynamic jrp through time due to the decreasing trend of parameters of marginal distribution fitted for ps at station 1 table 4b the jrp isolines indicate a decreasing trend of the design values of ps from the horizontal perspective of the plots figure s1 a when it comes to station 5 the design values of im showed an increasing trend from 1962 to 1977 and then a decreasing trend from 1977 to 2017 figure s1 b although the nonstationairty of station 8 is similar to the trend caused nonstationarity in ps at station 1 the design values of ps at station 8 exhibited a faster decline rate compared with those derived from station 1 the design values of ps showed a decreasing trend from 1962 to 1977 and then an increasing trend from 1977 to 2017 fig 8 at station 6 here it should be noted that the trend caused nonstationarity was not only identified in the ps but also identified in the dependence structure of two indexes due to the limited number of plots we just analyzed here the overall variation and estimated possible turning points as the plots presented and the exact pattern of the variation of the joint return period of these four stations can be obtained from the complete set of plots different from the trend caused nonsationarity the design values proposed by the nonstationary models caused by change point at station 7 was also shown in fig 8 e the design values of the ps attribute became smaller after change point if we use the stationary models to estimate the risk of the certain extreme rainfall event during 1958 1978 or 1979 2017 we would underestimate the corresponding risk ignoring the change point caused nonstationarity furthermore the divergence of jpp estimation at a certain quantile pair p s 80 i m 80 for station 1 5 6 7 and 8 under stationary and nonstationary cases is evident table 6 totally speaking whether the trend caused nonstationarity or change point caused nonstationarity would both lead to the variations of the design values over time which would recommend the necessity of average annual reliability aar to substitute for joint return period section 3 6 3 6 nonstationary hazard assessment based on aar metrics for univariate and bivariate cases in order to make a deep comparison of the average annual reliability arr calculation based on nonstationary models with stationary model the arr quantiles with 90 confidence bands were investigated both in univariate and bivariate cases in this study t 0 and t 1 is set as 1983 and 2022 respectively as presented in section 4 3 the ending year of design life period was chosen as 2022 considering the instabilities of parameter estimation for the time varying models with more added data which would be observed in the future years for illustration the design life period is set from 1983 to 2022 t 26 to 65 furthermore the parametric bootstrap pb method was incorporated to quantify the uncertainty of quantile estimation based on aar metrics let we suppose that a hydraulic infrastructure was built in 1983 the following analysis was investigated to explore the reliability of the building next 40 years since its completion 1983 from the perspective of hazard assessment under univariate condition the ps of station 7 exhibited nonstationarity due to the existence of change point at year 1979 according to analyzed results at section 3 2 3 3 ps of station 1 6 8 and im of station 5 showed nonstationarity because of the trend in marginal distribution parameters so we estimated the quantiles and its uncertainty interval of each nonstationary attribute ps or im at each arr level based on pb method we also compared the results of quantiles corresponding to nonstationary marginal models nsmm with that of stationary marginal models smm which was aimed to detect what would happen if we ignored its nonstationarity figure s2 focus on the quantile estimation based on nsmm red solid line and smm black solid line all the results from these five stations showed the obtained quantiles for design period 1983 2022 from nsmm model were lower than that from the smm model and the difference of the quantiles between these two models would intensify as the increase of arr level in addition the uncertainty intervals of the quantiles for these two models increase with the arr level in general the smm models ignoring the nonstationarity of the extreme variable which was caused by trend or change point would overestimate the designed quantiles at a certain arr level under univariate condition for bivariate cases algorithm 1 shown in section 2 3 was implemented to derive the numeric solution for the quantile pairs of most likely event at each aar level from and hazard scenario different from analysis of the designed quantiles under univariate case the bivariate nonstationary behaviors were more complex due to the existence of nonstationarity 1 nonstationarity existed only in marginal distribution 2 nonstationarity existed only in copula 3 both of the above two scenarios salvadori et al 2018 in this study the nonstationary behavior of ps im pair of station 1 5 and 8 only existed in marginal distributions the nonstationary behavior of ps im pair of station 6 and 7 existed both in margins and copula this study focused on what would happen to the quantile estimation if the nonstationarity was ignored so we defined three cases of hazard assessment models 1 nonstationary models with nonstationary margins and nonstationary copula case 1 nsm c1 2 nonstationary models with nonstationary margins and stationary copula case 2 nsm c2 3 stationary models with stationary margins and stationary copula sm c3 since ps im pair of station 1 5 and 8 belongs to nsm c2 the model sm c3 was only analyzed because our study focused on the impact of quantile estimation if we ignored the nonstationarity of the margins parallel to ps im pair of station 1 5 and 8 the quantile pairs ps im of station 6 and 7 was investigated from the nsm c1 nsm c2 and sm c3 firstly the quantile pairs corresponding to each arr level of station 1 5 8 can be derived based on algorithm 1 fig 9 for station 1 and 8 the quantile of ps from proposed nsm c2 model was lower than that from sm c3 model which ignored the nonstationarity of ps furthermore the divergence intensified at higher arr level the same conclusion can be drawn from im of station 5 for im of station 1 and 8 the estimated quantile showed no difference at arr interval 0 1 0 9 for these two models for ps of station 5 the consistent region of quantiles for these two models fell in 0 2 0 8 in general ignoring the nonstationarity of marginal distribution caused by trend would overestimate quantile estimation of the extreme attribute with the nonstationarity and have little impact on the extreme attribute with no stationarity figure s4 showed the quantile pair estimation for station 6 and 7 which have nonstationarity both in margins and copula because of different reasons trend for station 6 and change point for station 7 focus on the ps from nsm c1 green solid line and nsm c2 red solid line model the quantile curves from these two models are almost coincident no matter for station 6 or 7 for the ps from nsm c2 and sm c3 the estimated quantile curve showed an evident difference from the above two comparison the copula nonstationarity has less impact on the designed quantiles compared to the nonstationarity of marginal distribution no matter due to trend or change point for the im of station 6 which did not cover nonstationarity these three quantile curves from three models are almost consistent especially at high arr levels which indicated the same conclusion as that of station 1 5 and 8 however for im of station 7 the quantile at model nsm c1 showed a difference with that of models nsm c2 and sm c1 which recommends the nonstationarity of copula would have an impact on the extreme attribute im of station 7 with no stationarity since the difference of 90 quantile uncertainty interval between the stationary and nonstationary models under univariate and bivariate cases was not evident at each arr level the mean value of the confidence interval mci at several typical arr levels are calculated for different models under univariate condition figure s4 the mci of nonstationary marginal model nsmm at station 1 5 6 7 and 8 is bigger than that of the stationary marginal model smm which means the nonstationarity of margins would recommend more uncertainty to the quantile estimation at univariate case compared with stationary marginal models when it comes to the bivariate case different results can be found fig 10 since the best fitted model see section 3 3 and 3 4 for station 1 5 and 8 is the nonstationary marginal distribution and stationary copulas and we focus on the impact of ignoring the nonstationarity copula did not have nonstationarity for dependence structure of ps im at these stations according to analyzed results in section 3 4 the mci of the nsm c2 and sm c3 at these three stations has been calculated to explore the impact of ignoring the marginal nonstationarity in the same way mci of nsm 1 nsm 2 and sm 3 at station 6 and 7 is calculated because the best fitted model at these two stations has the nonstationarity both in marginal distribution and copula the mci of the quantile ps or im from nsm c2 is smaller than that from sm c3 which is different from the results in univariate case focus on the quantile uncertainty at station 6 and 7 the mci of nsm c1 model was the largest one among all three models compared to the divergence of mci between nsm c2 and sm c3 the nonstationarity of copula would recommend wider confidence interval for the designed quantile estimation than the nonstationary margins and stationary models 4 conclusions the feasibility of hydrological frequency and hazard assessment on the basis of stationary assumptions is being challenged due to the multiple effects of climate change urbanization and heat island effects as a response a nonstationary bivariate hazard assessment through the time varying marginal distribution and copula based model is performed over the extreme rainfall events observed at eight stations in haihe river basin the time dependent copula and marginal distribution models are applied to two extreme rainfall attributes ps and im extracted from daily rainfall data of eight stations in haihe river basin china from the perspective of joint exceedance probabilities jep of extreme rainfall events at and scenario the design values and their confidence intervals of the two indexes based on average annual reliability aar method were computed and shown by parametric bootstrap method the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 from a statistician s point of view it is of great necessity to implement strict testing procedures adopt independent gof tests for copula and margins select stations with sample size make pre analyzing of the dependence in order to control global type i error 2 based on the arr designed quantile estimation at univariate case ignoring the nonstationarity of marginal distribution caused by trend would overestimate quantile estimation of the extreme attribute with the nonstationarity while it would have little impact on the extreme attribute with no stationarity 3 different from the conclusion of the quantile estimation under univariate condition the nonstationarity of copula has less impact on the designed arr based quantiles compared to the nonstationarity of marginal distribution no matter due to trend or change point on the one hand on the other hand the nonstationarity of dependence structure would add more uncertainty to the hazard assessment compared to the nonstationarity of margins this study emphasizes the significance of incorporating nonstationarity into multivariate hazard through the investigation of univariate and multivariate arr based quantile pairs of the extreme attribute series the extended bivariate nonstationary arr based hazard assessment method could be not only applied to implement hydrological design under stationary conditions but also under nonstationary conditions the proposed nonstationary models can be applied to deal with the encounter problem of extreme rainfall events occurred at different locations from more refined temporal and spatial scale which would be an important and interesting topic by the means of time varying

4094,due to global climate change and urbanization more attention has been paid to decipher the nonstationary multivariate risk analysis from the perspective of probability distribution establishment in this study a multivariate nonstationary hazard assessment of annual extreme rainfall events extracted from daily precipitation data observed at eight meteorological stations in haihe river basin china was done in three phases 1 several statistical tests such as nonparametric trend tests log likelihood ratio lr tests and change point cp tests were applied to both the marginal distributions and the dependence structures to decipher different forms of nonstationarity 2 estimation of the time varying parameter for the marginal and joint probability distributions by maximum likelihood method and 3 calculation of hydrologic design quantiles at different average annual reliability levels arr during a certain design life period in terms of hazard assessment according to the results the attributes and their dependence structure belonging to several stations show nonstationarity because of existed trend in model parameter or change point in the process of hazard assessment the nonstationarity of dependence structure would produce less impact on arr based designed quantile estimation than the nonstationarity of marginal distribution on the one hand on the other hand it would add more uncertainty of quantile estimation for hydrologic design keywords multivariate hazard assessment time varying copula annual average reliability nonstationarity trend analysis 1 introduction due to climate change and increasing urbanization heavy rains induced floods have occurred more frequently all over the world in recent decades which is becoming a major deterrent to the sustainable development of social economy mishra and singh 2009 donat et al 2016 ali and mishra 2018 various kinds of social activities such as infrastructure constructions agricultural irrigation and ecological maintenance would be influenced by hydrometeorological extreme events a systematic risk analysis of these extreme events would provide sufficient strategies for decision makers a multitude of studies have addressed the effect of climate change and urbanization on hydrological design to alleviate associated risks traditional hydrological frequency analysis is based on the stationary assumption which recommends that environmental impact indexes such as climatic factors and land use rate have a constant mechanism that affects hydrological variables all the time madsen et al 2017 milly et al 2015 the feasibility of hydrological risk analysis based on stationary assumptions is being challenged because of the multiple effects of climate change urbanization and heat island effects accordingly water authorities should amend the present design and management strategies to develop nonstationary distribution models under climate change therefore it is urgent to develop an efficient and systematic risk analysis approach from time dependent side to serve for hydraulic design of hydrological infrastructures in recent years nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis has received a great deal of attention because of increasing attention to climate change chen and sun 2017 call et al 2017 ghanbari et al 2019 the time varying moment approach is widely used to involve time variant probabilistic parameters for mimicking the changing behavior of extreme hydrometeorological variables under univariate cases in recent years zhang et al 2015 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2018 du et al 2015 modelled nonstationary low flow series in weihe river basin china based on the generalized additive models in location scale and shape gamlss framework results showed that inappropriately estimated statistical parameters would lead to the overstatement of risk corresponding to a low flow event gu et al 2016 incorporated time climate indices precipitation and temperature into the gamlss model to detect nonstationarity in flood frequency for the univariate case nonstationary risk analysis based on the time varying moment approach can be decomposed into four steps 1 descriptive and exploratory monitoring of hydrological sequences and monitoring of outliers 2 implementation of the stationarity hypothesis to verify the nonstationarity of hydrological series 3 development of a hydrological frequency analysis model and estimation of model parameters using different covariates and 4 risk assessment based on the selected frequency model the above studies were conducted under nonstationary conditions for univariate cases while it is known that natural hydrometeorological extreme events are multivariate characterized by multi attribute properties which can be statistically correlated it is therefore desirable to develop a multivariate model to simulate the probabilistic behavior of two or more properties salvadori and de michele 2004 firstly proposed the copula approach a useful tool for modelling the structure of dependence between hydrological variables regardless of the types of marginal distributions to deal with the multivariate frequency analysis after that copulas have been widely used for multivariate frequency analysis of rainfall extreme events zhang and singh 2007 kao and govindaraju 2008 rauf and zeephongsekul 2014 vandenberghe et al 2010 droughts de michele et al 2013 serinaldi et al 2009 shiau 2006 song and singh 2010 wong et al 2010 floods grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 zhang and singh 2006 however these studies assumed a time invariant dependence pattern ignoring the influence of climate change and hence did not consider the impact of nonstationarity on the dependence structure recently studies on multivariate distribution fitting have addressed the superiority of dynamic copula based method to model the nonstationary dependence structure which are generally caused by complex environment and rapid urbanization milly et al 2015 former studies have detected nonstationarity in dependence structures liu et al 2017 aissia et al 2014 yilmaz and perera 2014 their results showed that the joint probability varied significantly over time for different non stationary models jiang et al 2015 also did a multivariate risk analysis using the time varying copula method incorporating time and reservoir index as covariates for low flow series extracted from two neighboring observed stations traditional solutions of hydrological extreme events involve return period based methods which are usually calculated as the inverse of annual exceedance probability for a given magnitude under stationary conditions in a univariate case in a multivariate case the univariate return period can be extended to joint return periods of hydrological variables salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori and de michele 2010 salvadori et al 2013 while non stationary distribution models provide flexibility to analyze the variability of a hydrological variable they are also incongruent with many of the traditional metrics used in water resources planning for example the development of drainage standards is vulnerable to the standard of extreme rainfall return period which means drainage facilities have been designed to withstand the extreme rainfall event of a specified return period the multivariate hydrologic and hydraulic design can be influenced by the existence of nonstationarity in both the marginal and joint distributions the exceedance probability of a given extreme event would be different from year to year leading to an inconstant and non unique value of the conventional return period thus the notion of static return period of an extreme rainfall event e g 100 year extreme rainfall event 200 year extreme rainfall event is no longer reliable for hydraulic design under nonstationary conditions salas and obeysekera 2014 jiang et al 2015 yan et al 2017 as a result rootzén and katz 2013 first mentioned the concept of design life level dll to quantify the hazard of a given extreme rainfall magnitude over the hydrological structure s life time note that following the idea of rootzén and katz 2013 we regard the term hydrological hazard as the possibility of a certain extreme event occurring and not as a quantification of expected losses it is a logical extension to handle the nonstationarity of the concept of hazard of failure jakob et al 2013 which is more frequently used to quantify the hazard of hydrologic extremes under stationarity read and vogel 2015 extended the dll method to average annual reliability aar method to estimate the hydrologic design value considering nonstationarity in general these risk based methods can provide similar results of hydraulic design for hydrological infrastructure yan et al 2017 however the cases of multivariate hydrologic designs especially under nonstationary conditions using the time varying copula and design life level based risk methods have great potentiality in future studies therefore the objective of this study is to do hazard assessment of multivariate extreme rainfall events involving the following steps first change point cp tests are used for both the marginal distributions and the dependence structures to check the potential change point in the second phase we check different forms of linear and nonlinear trends in the parameters of both marginal distribution and copula models based on maximum likelihood method and likelihood ratio lr tests coles 2001 katz et al 2002 zhang et al 2004 meantime the goodness of fit tests are also investigated for both stationary and time varying marginal and copula models finally average annual reliability based arr hazard assessment is extended to multivariate cases to derive the design value of extreme rainfall event in this paper we investigated two kinds of extreme rainfall attributes 1 annual extreme rainfall volume ps annual total precipitation of the daily precipitation more than the 90th percentile threshold for each year and intensity im annual maximum daily precipitation the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the next section presents the methodology adopted in this study section 3 discusses the results of proposed model applied to haihe river basin china section 4 presents the final conclusion through the proposed model 2 methodology for the sake of the multiple attributes of extreme rainfall events and dynamic variations of the joint behavior of the extreme variables ps and im in this study we aim to apply the nonstationary copula methods to model the time varying behavior of extreme hydrometeorological processes copulas with the advantage of modelling the dependence structure independently of the marginal distributions of variables in comparison to multivariate extreme distribution the multivariate generalized pareto distribution and the multivariate gev are now becoming a standard tool for multivariate frequency analysis of extreme variables shiau 2006 song and singh 2010 wong et al 2010 here copula models are regarded as the joint probability distribution function we used the nonstationary copula models to quantify the variations of the probabilistic distribution patterns of extreme events shifts from year to year under the impact of a broad range of anthropogenic activities including climate change according to vezzoli et al 2017 and salvadori et al 2018 a comprehensive statistical analysis which can check the presence of trend and change point should be carried out before we incorporate the nonstationarity into the multivariate hazard assessment following the study of salvadori et al 2018 the non parametric change point statistical tests were implemented to check that whether the marginal or joint distributions are sensitive to changes these tests can be manipulated in the r package npcp kojadinovic 2017 we also used pattern recovery using trend filtering prutf for identifying unknown change points which can discriminate the patterns of nonstationarity between discontinuous change with change points and smooth change mehrizi and chenouri 2020 on the other hand univariate and multivariate mann kendall tests are investigated to detect the monotonic trend in the margins and the dependence structure details of these above tests can be found in the references serinaldi and kilsby 2016 kojadinovic and naveau 2017 in this study likelihood ratio tests lr of the time varying models against the stationary models based on the maximum likelihood method are proposed to detect the linear or nonlinear trends in the parameters coles 2001 katz et al 2002 details of the lr tests will be introduced in section 2 1 as shown in fig 1 in the process of selecting the best nonstationary models we follow strict testing procedures 1 ml based method was used to estimate the parameter of candidate models gof tests are firstly implemented to choose admissible copulas with estimated parameters several copula models here these above admissible models are defined as model set m gof 2 and then lr tests were manipulated on the basis of admissible models in gof manipulated to check whether trend caused nonstationarity did exist in model parameters or not here the above models having nonstationarity in parameters whose p value of lr tests is smaller than 0 05 are defined as model set m lr 3 and then we selected the best model with the smallest aicc from m lr and the best model is defined as m best according to the flowchart m best m lr m gof doing so with a series of individual tests at level α 0 05 leads to a totally uncontrolled type i error so we try our best to follow strict testing procedures in the process of selecting the best nonstationary models to control global type error i adopting independent gof tests for copula and margins and selecting stations with long observed years are another two efforts to control type error i copulas are highly respected tools to build multivariate distribution models of dependence structures between random variables regardless of their marginal distribution types detailed information of theoretical derivation about copulas can be found in nelsen 2006 for the practical guidelines from hydrological point of view it is recommended to refer to salvadori et al 2007 the changing climate has led to nonstationarity of individual hydrological series or the dependence between hydrological variables to realize this situation a time varying copula based model can describe the time dependent characteristics for dependence structure of hydrological variables let x y represent a hydrological pair the joint probability distribution of multivariables through time varying copula and marginal distribution model can then be presented as 1 f x y x y θ f x y t c f x x θ x t f y y θ y t θ c t c u v θ c t where c denotes the copula function f x y denotes the joint function f x and f y represent the marginal functions of hydrological variable ps and im in this study θ f x y t θ x t θ x t θ c t θ x t and θ x t represent the time varying marginal distribution parameters which would be a vector when distribution has several parameters θ c t is the dynamic copula parameter all of these parameters would be a linear or nonlinear function of time and u and v are the marginal cumulative probabilities 2 1 time varying marginal distribution in this part five kinds of probability distributions table 1 commonly used in the hydrological extreme value analysis beirlant et al 2004 were set as the alternative marginal patterns two kinds of 3 parameter distribution generalized extreme value gev pearson type iii piii and three kinds of 2 parameter distributions gamma weibull and lognormal considering the external expressions of nonstationarity of the marginal distributions the time dependent trend would be existed in all of the parameters including location parameter μ scale parameter σ and also the location parameter κ meanwhile the relationship between each parameter and the time year in this study would be exhibited in linear or nonlinear forms as a result both the linear and quadratic models are assumed as the possible function relation between parameter and time for illustration there are three kinds of function for location parameter plus the stationary situation which can be presented as follows 2 μ t constant μ 0 μ 1 t μ 0 μ 1 t μ 2 t 2 where t denotes time in this study t max is set to be equal to the sample size n μ 0 μ 1 and μ 2 are the new parameter for the time varying marginal distribution since each parameter has 3 kinds of function relations there are 27 kinds of candidate marginal distribution models for 3 parameter distribution and 9 kinds for the 2 parameter distribution considering the different range of parameters different constraint functions need to be added to ensure that the parameters are well defined details of the candidate marginal patterns for these above five distributions can be found in table s1 a d as shown in table s1 a b the complexity of the time varying models will increase as incorporation of time as the covariate into more parameters let st represent the stationary model for the extreme attribute ps and im in this study and let nst be the time varying model with trend existed in the parameter in the same way let ll 1 and ll 0 denote the log likelihoods under model st and nst the log likelihood ratio statistics lr would converge to the χ δ 2 distribution with δ being the divergence of the parameter number between the st and nst models and lr tests can be formulated as follows coles 2001 3 lr 2 ll 1 ll 0 the lr statistics can be regarded as a good criterion to check whether the null trend hypothesis h 0 t h e r e i s n o t r e n d f o r t h e d i s t r i b u t i o n p a r a m e t e r can be rejected or not if the value of lr is more than the upper α point of the χ δ 2 distribution the above null assumption can be rejected at a significance level of α in this study α is equal to 5 obviously it is easy to expand the lr tests into bivariate situation for copula parameter once the lr tests recommend that a linear or nonlinear trend do exist in a selected time varying distribution model the goodness of fit gof k s tests based on kolmogorov smirnov k s test at a significance level of 5 would be investigated to verify the fit of the potential time varying or stationary margins frank and massey 1951 and the corrected akaike information criterion aic c which is a more rigorous model selection criterion than commonly used aic criterion was implemented to quantify the fitting performance of the distribution models aicc hurvich and tsai 1989 the aicc can be computed as follows 4 aic c 2 k 2 ln l 2 k k 1 n k 1 a i c 2 k k 1 n k 1 where k is number of parameters while n is sample size the correction version of aic criterion is more efficient when the sample size is small or when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample size in order to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter estimation the parametric bootstrap efron and tibshirani 1993 method was also implemented 2 2 time varying copula similar to the above process of selecting the time varying moment model for the extreme rainfall attribute ps or im in this study the dependence structure between ps and im under nonstationary conditions would be developed by time varying copula in this study the candidate copula models table 2 consist of five kinds of 1 parameter copula joe frank gumbel clayton and gaussian and five kinds of 2 parameter copulas clayton gumbel bb1 student t joe gumbel bb6 joe clayton bb7 and joe frank bb8 each copula can be rotated at 90 180 survival copula 270 degrees for this study the rotated copula at 90 and 270 degrees are not considered because of the kendall s tau values corresponding to each dependence structure of ps and im for each station are positive table 7 a furthermore the above copula models can be implemented in r package cdvine brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 parallel to the establishment of time varying marginal models the relationship of the copula parameter might also be exhibited in linear or nonlinear forms taking the 1 parameter copula as an instance its parameter θ c t including the stationary copula can be assumed as three forms as follows 5 θ c t constant θ 0 θ 1 t θ 0 θ 1 t θ 2 t 2 where t denotes time in this study t is set as t 0 1958 1 where t 0 is calendar year 1958 2017 is just observed period θ 0 θ 1 and θ 2 are the new parameter for the time varying copula considering the different range of parameters different constraint functions need to ensure that the parameters are well defined finally there are close to 100 kinds of copula models for the potential dependence structure of each pair which might exhibit a certain trend table s2 a f inspired by the study of genest et al 2009 we tried to promote the goodness of fit test for copulas based on empirical copula gof ec to time varying copula fitting approximate p values of gof ec can be obtained via specially adapted monte carlo methods a parametric bootstrap procedure to approximate p values of gof ec for time varying copula models is described in appendix a the corrected akaike information criterion aicc hurvich and tsai 1989 was also employed here to make an objective selection of the best copula models from the potential admissible copulas which have passed the above gof ec test similar to the process in marginal distribution the presence of trend in the copula parameter was determined by computation of lr see equation 3 2 3 multivariate hazard assessment based on the average annual reliability aar for hydrological management engineering administrators focus more on the failure probability during the design life period of hydraulic structures condon et al 2015 inspired by average annual reliability aar method to quantify the probability that a hydraulic system would be safe over its planning period in univariate case salas and obeysekera 2014 read and vogel 2015 we would like to expand the arr based metrics to the multivariate case let jep t x y be the time varying joint exceedance probability of a certain extreme rainfall event x y which quantify the occurrence probability of a more perilous extreme event than x y in a specific hazard scenario arr value under nonstationary situations can be formulated as follows 6 a a a r x y t t 0 t 1 w t 1 jep t x y 7 t 1 3 t 1 t 0 3 here we used the above function to divide the design period into three sections is the floor function that eliminates all decimal places then the weight coefficient w t can be calculated as follows 8 w t 1 a 2 t 1 t 0 2 t 1 3 a 1 1 t 1 3 t 0 t t 0 t 1 3 a 1 a 2 t 1 t 0 2 t 1 3 a 1 1 t 1 3 t 0 t 1 3 t t 0 2 t 1 3 a 2 a 2 t 1 t 0 2 t 1 3 a 1 1 t 1 3 t 0 2 t 1 3 t t 1 here 1 a 1 a 2 which can make the revised measure give more weights to joint exceedance probability in more recent times a 1 and a 2 is a flexible coefficient which can be decided by the decision maker in this study we set a 1 2 and a 2 3 where t 0 is the initial year of the design life period for the hydraulic structure t 1 is just the terminal year of the hydraulic structure from the perspective of bivariate case the joint exceedance probabilities jep of extreme rainfall threshold can be calculated through four hazard scenarios in a stationary situation salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori et al 2011 salvadori et al 2013 salvadori et al 2016 the event is x x y y they are and scenario corresponding to the probability of p x x y y or scenario corresponding to p x x y y kendall scenario which could transform the bivariate extreme event into univariate case through the kendall s distribution and finally a survival kendall scenario with a bounded safer region than the kendall scenario there is still discussion on which form of the jep could be more appropriate in water resources planning and project design bender et al 2014 the scope of this study is not on which hazard scenario based aar is appropriate in water resources planning and project design but on the whether nonstationary patterns margins or copula would impose great impact on the design value at a certain aar level so we calculated aar from the and hazard scenario of interest here to evaluate effects of the different kinds of nonstationarity over the design value at each aar level it can be calculated as follows 9 jep t and 1 f x x θ x t f y y θ y t c u v θ c t and the time varying joint return period jrp t and can also be calculated by the above equation 10 jrp t and 1 1 f x x θ x t f y y θ y t c u v θ c t for the practical engineering design the engineers focus more on extreme rainfall quantiles at different aar levels aar 0 1 0 2 0 9 according to equation 8 it is not easy to calculate the extreme rainfall quantiles furthermore the quantile pairs in bivariate case for a certain joint exceedance probability would be numerous in multivariate extreme value analysis since all data pairs u v on the same joint return period level have the same joint exceedance probability however some combinations of a given probability are at least in theory more likely than others therefore the most likely technique is just select the most likely design event which theoretically has the largest joint probability density likelihood among all possible design event salvadori et al 2011 the most likely design realization δ ml of a certain aar level aar η can be derived as follows 11 δ ml a a r η argmax aar x y η f xy x y argmax aar x y η c x y f x f y here the most likely design realization δ ml can be calculated from the theoretical point of view we propose the following algorithm to derive the numeric solution for the quantile pairs of most likely event at each aar level based on parametric bootstrap method efron and tibshirani 1993 algorithm 1 1 estimate the parameter set θ x t θ y t θ c t based on the original observations for the best selected nonstationary models if it exists based on lr gof tests 2 generate i i d observations x 1 sim y 1 sim x 2 sim y 2 sim x n sim y n sim from the above nonstationary model 3 estimate the new parameter set from the simulated observations x i sim y i sim i 1 2 n 4 generate the parameter of marginal distribution and copula for each year from t 0 to t 1 5 generate a sample set with a length n for x with an equal interval for example 0 2 from the minimum value to maximum value of original observation the sample set with a length m of y is implemented in the same way and the n m matrix would be generated it can represent the quantile pair for the extreme rainfall event 6 calculate n m times of the aar value at the design life period t 0 t 1 select dozens of quantile pairs ξ by abs arr ξ l which is a small value as 0 0001 l is the potential arr level select the quantile pair with joint probability density function equation 11 being the largest from the quantile pair set ξ 7 repeat steps 2 and 6 b times with b the number of bootstrap repetitions 3 application 3 1 study area and data collection the area selected for the study is haihe river basin china which belongs to the temperate east asian monsoon climate zone fig 2 in summer heavy rains take place and temperature and humidity are high caused by marine air masses the annual rainfall has a great spatial and temporal variability across the basin due to the inconsistency of intensity retreat time and influence of the pacific subtropical high over the years natural disasters such as urban floods and mountain torrents induced by extreme rainfall events in the basin have caused huge losses to the social economy and people s lives and property and have been highly valued by decision making authorities as a result time varying copula based multivariate risk analysis of this basin is conducive to providing reliable strategies and alternative options for water resources risk based decision making daily rainfall data from haihe river basin observed at 8 stations were analyzed for the proposed nonstationary model detailed information on these 8 gauges is presented in table s3 according to various data ranges shown in table s3 the rainfall series from 1958 to 2017 was selected as the final version and the detailed information of the basic statistics is shown in table s4 3 2 preprocessing analysis before developing a nonstationary frequency analysis model it is essential to examine nonstationarities of extreme precipitation attributes ps and im as well as the structure of dependence between these two attributes table 3 shows results of nonparametric tests detecting trends and change points for two attributes of rainfall extremes ps and im as well as the dependence structure between them first time series of these two rainfall extremes ps and im for all 8 stations can pass the ljung box test with 20 lags p value 0 05 in table 3 which means the series is serially independent extreme observations are mutually independent with no serial autocorrelation so it is appropriate to apply the standardized mann kendall mk test to evaluate the statistical significance of trend without any modification serinaldi and kilsby 2016 firstly change point tests should be firstly be implemented to detect whether the change point exist in the univariate and bivariate cases from table 3 a change point of 1979 can be detected at ps attribute and the dependence structure between ps and im for station 7 at the significance level of 5 p value 0 033 for ps and p value 0 025 for ps im pair so the single ps series and ps im pair series were spilt out as two parts with the year 1979 being the broken point then univariate and multivariate mk tests were implemented for the above subseries compared to the mann kendall trend statistics derived from the original data sample size equal to 60 direction of trend has been changed from negative direction to positive direction no matter in univariate or multivariate case but all the trend statistics for station 7 did not show a significant downward or upward trend at 5 critical α level no further change point can be detected in the two sub periods before and after 1979 after change point analysis the following stations 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 with no change points should be investigated by the mk tests as shown in table 3 only ps of station 1 exhibited a significant downward trend at a significance level of 5 from univariate trend analysis while dependence structure of ps and im for station 6 showed a significant downward trend from multivariate trend analysis from nonparametric tests rainfall extremes of other stations did not show significant monotonic trend except station 1 and 6 since the mk tests are designed to detect the possible monotonic trend for the mean value of the extremes log likelihood ratio tests lr of the time varying models against the stationary models should be investigated to detect the trend of the distribution parameter because there would be a particular situation for a certain distribution i e gev distribution with opposing trends in location and scale parameter which would lead to an insignificant trend tested z 1 96 by mk tests in the extremes zhang et al 2004 hence even if precipitation extremes at a certain station may recommend statistically weak trends both the nonstationary and stationary models are established for each station in the following section to calculate the lr statistics 3 3 marginal distribution fitting and parameter trend analysis based on lr tests results of trend and change point tests performed in section 3 2 pointed out the necessity to take the nonstationarity of marginal distribution fitting into consideration tables 4a and 4b shows performances of nonstationary vs stationary models for these 8 stations following salvadori et al 2018 the series containing change point was handled firstly based on the pattern recovery using trend filtering prutf approach fig 3 only the discontinuous change can be identified at ps series of station 7 since the change point is existed in ps of station 7 at the year 1979 the marginal distribution fitting is implemented for psb the ps time series before change point 1979 and psc the ps time series after change point 1979 all the possible stationary or nonstationary models are fitted for these two spilt series according to the results of lr tests the p value of lr tests for the time varying models against corresponding the stationary models are larger than 5 which means there is no significant trend for parameters for psb and psc of station 7 and then kolmogorov smirnov k s based gof tests were implemented for the potential marginal models almost all the models could pass the gof tests at significant level of 5 based on the smallest aicc selection criterion the gao0 and logno0 model was the best one for psb and psc respectively to quantify uncertainty of the parameter estimation the parametric bootstrap method was incorporated to estimate the 90 uncertainty interval as shown in tables 4a and 4b secondly the marginal series with no change point were investigated in the same way both of attributes in station 2 3 and 4 and im in station 7 exhibited no trend in the distribution parameters by the lr tests so stationary models with smallest aicc value are selected as the best fitted models meanwhile all the selected models can pass the gof k s tests at a significant level of 5 for these above 4 stations the lr tests recommend no trend for ps and im extracted from these 4 stations which in accordance with mann kendall mk results shown in table 3 for station 1 the time varying model logno5 was selected as the best model for ps while stationary logno0 model was the best one and the trend in parameter of station 1 is also in accordance with the mk results in section 4 2 however as shown in table 3 b the trend in the parameter existed in im of station 5 ps of station 6 and 8 based on the lr tests at the 5 significance level which recommends another situation different from the previous mk tests according to the study of zhang et al 2004 the parameter trend analysis based on of the lr test are not always directly consistent with those of the mk tests to explore the causes of above divergence the trends of each parameter of time varying model logn6 for im of station 5 and ps of station 6 plus model logn8 for ps of station 8 are plotted in fig 4 as knows to all the mean value of lognormal distribution can be presented as follows 11 e t x e x p μ t σ t 2 2 where e t p s is just the time varying mean value of extreme value ps or im μ t is the time varying location parameter while σ t is just the time varying scale parameter for the im of station 5 the location parameter exhibited a linear downward trend but the scale parameter firstly exhibited a nonlinear upward trend before the year 1980 23 1958 1 and then a downward trend after 1980 which is defined as a nonmonotonic trend nmt in this study it is the same situation for ps of station 6 with a different turning point 1991 when it comes to the ps of station 8 both of the location and scale parameter exhibited a nonmonotonic trend with different points of inflexion in general the two parameters of the marginal distribution for these 3 stations all experienced an opposing trend period transparent green area in fig 4 which just covers the scenario noted by the study of zhang et al 2004 opposing trends existed in two parameters would lead to an insignificant trend tested by mk tests in the extremes focus on the z statistics of mk tests table 3 and the opposing trend range we find that the more the range of the opposing trend period was the less the absolute value of z would be since the nonstationary models with time as covariates it can be used to predict the extreme value in the future considering new dataset being added to the original data the parameters of the time varying models would be updated in this study we assume the parameters of the selected time varying models did not change a lot in the future 5 years so the estimated time varying models from the original extreme series were used to predict year 2018 2022 t 61 65 based on the same assumption the ending year of design life period in the following aar based quantiles calculation is set as 2022 as shown in fig 5 mean value of ps from station 1 and station 6 exhibited a downward trend while mean value of im from station 5 and ps from station 8 exhibited a nmt trend for the predicted period the predicted nonstationary marginal distributions for the extremes extracted from these 4 stations presented smaller mean values than those of the stationary distributions furthermore the divergence of mean values between them are becoming larger as time goes on for station 1 5 and 6 but for ps from station 8 the divergence of mean values between them are becoming smaller as time goes on 3 4 copula fitting once a marginal distribution was estimated based on above analysis the dependence structure for im and ps can be investigated by the time varying or time invariant copula functions as shown in table s2 a f almost 100 kinds of copula models for the potential dependence structure with different forms of trend were analyzed according to the lr ratio test making pre analyzing of the dependence in the data is definitely fundamental to reduce copula model alternatives according to table 7 kendall s taus of ps and im for all the stations are positive which recommends the clayton gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 copula rotated at 90 and 270 degrees are not suitable for describing dependence structure these rotated copulas at 90 and 270 degrees can only serve for negative dependence so original 31 kinds of copulas can be reduced into 17 kinds of copulas and for dependence structure of ps and im for station 1 the lower and upper tail dependence are not evident according to scatterplot of pseudo observations top left in fig 6 gaussian or frank copula with no tail dependence table s5 maybe the potential copula models and for dependence structure of ps and im for station 2 3 4 5 and 6 the lower and upper tail dependence are evident according to scatterplot of pseudo observations fig 6 which recommends student t bb1 bb7 survival bb1 and bb7 copula could be potential copula models with tail dependence coefficients table s3 finally the lower tail dependence of ps and im for station 8 is evident while the upper tail dependence is not evident according to scatterplot of pseudo observations bottom right in fig 3 clayton survival gumbel survival joe survival bb6 and survival bb8 would be potential copula models totally speaking the efficiency of copula model selection was significantly improved by identifying the different kinds of tail dependence parallel to the operating procedure of the marginal distribution salvadori et al 2018 the rainfall extreme pairs ps im from station 7 was cut into two parts as shown in table 5a firstly the copula parameter and parameter uncertainty was estimated by maximum likelihood method combined with parametric bootstrap method the anderson darling goodness of fit test based on rosenblatt s transformation ad rt was also implemented for check the fit of copula based on the smallest aicc criterion and lr tests fr0 and sgu0 model was the best one for the two divided pair series before and after 1979 respectively secondly the distribution fitting was investigated for the dependence structure with no change point according to the lr tests parameter trend only existed in the dependence structure of ps and im from station 6 and the best time varying copula model is model cg7 table 5b for other stations the best copula models can be derived in the same way table 5a focus on the nonstationary copula models for station 6 kendall s tau of the im and ps was estimated during the observed and predicted periods fig 5 as shown in fig 7 the estimated tau experienced a downward trend before t is equal to 12 then an upward trend until t being 36 it finally experienced a downward trend compared to the tau estimated from stationary copula the tau estimated from nonstationary copula would be smaller than that from stationary angles 3 5 time varying joint return period jrp calculation after selecting the best fitted time varying distributions and copula for the extreme rainfall attributes ps and im which showed trend caused station 1 5 6 8 and change point caused station 7 nonstationarity the design values of the indexes characterizing annual extreme rainfall events were computed based on the time varying joint return period jrp under and scenario equation 10 firstly the jrp isolines at levels equaling 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 and 500 years for station 1 5 6 and 8 are presented with trend caused nonstationarity existed in their extreme rainfall attributes fig 8 and figures s1 a d since the sample size is 60 1958 2017 jrp isolines of these two indexes at different return levels can be generated at each year which would plot 60 jrp isolines pictures for simplicity the jrp isolines at year 1962 1977 1992 and 2017 were shown in this part to show the performance of the time varying copula models the results of the nonstationary models are also compared with the outputs of the currently used time independent stationary models stationary margins and stationary copulas the critical return period green lines in fig 8 at return level equaling 50 years covering most of the observed data points red points in fig 8 is used as the milestone to better illustrate the flow of the dynamic jrp through time due to the decreasing trend of parameters of marginal distribution fitted for ps at station 1 table 4b the jrp isolines indicate a decreasing trend of the design values of ps from the horizontal perspective of the plots figure s1 a when it comes to station 5 the design values of im showed an increasing trend from 1962 to 1977 and then a decreasing trend from 1977 to 2017 figure s1 b although the nonstationairty of station 8 is similar to the trend caused nonstationarity in ps at station 1 the design values of ps at station 8 exhibited a faster decline rate compared with those derived from station 1 the design values of ps showed a decreasing trend from 1962 to 1977 and then an increasing trend from 1977 to 2017 fig 8 at station 6 here it should be noted that the trend caused nonstationarity was not only identified in the ps but also identified in the dependence structure of two indexes due to the limited number of plots we just analyzed here the overall variation and estimated possible turning points as the plots presented and the exact pattern of the variation of the joint return period of these four stations can be obtained from the complete set of plots different from the trend caused nonsationarity the design values proposed by the nonstationary models caused by change point at station 7 was also shown in fig 8 e the design values of the ps attribute became smaller after change point if we use the stationary models to estimate the risk of the certain extreme rainfall event during 1958 1978 or 1979 2017 we would underestimate the corresponding risk ignoring the change point caused nonstationarity furthermore the divergence of jpp estimation at a certain quantile pair p s 80 i m 80 for station 1 5 6 7 and 8 under stationary and nonstationary cases is evident table 6 totally speaking whether the trend caused nonstationarity or change point caused nonstationarity would both lead to the variations of the design values over time which would recommend the necessity of average annual reliability aar to substitute for joint return period section 3 6 3 6 nonstationary hazard assessment based on aar metrics for univariate and bivariate cases in order to make a deep comparison of the average annual reliability arr calculation based on nonstationary models with stationary model the arr quantiles with 90 confidence bands were investigated both in univariate and bivariate cases in this study t 0 and t 1 is set as 1983 and 2022 respectively as presented in section 4 3 the ending year of design life period was chosen as 2022 considering the instabilities of parameter estimation for the time varying models with more added data which would be observed in the future years for illustration the design life period is set from 1983 to 2022 t 26 to 65 furthermore the parametric bootstrap pb method was incorporated to quantify the uncertainty of quantile estimation based on aar metrics let we suppose that a hydraulic infrastructure was built in 1983 the following analysis was investigated to explore the reliability of the building next 40 years since its completion 1983 from the perspective of hazard assessment under univariate condition the ps of station 7 exhibited nonstationarity due to the existence of change point at year 1979 according to analyzed results at section 3 2 3 3 ps of station 1 6 8 and im of station 5 showed nonstationarity because of the trend in marginal distribution parameters so we estimated the quantiles and its uncertainty interval of each nonstationary attribute ps or im at each arr level based on pb method we also compared the results of quantiles corresponding to nonstationary marginal models nsmm with that of stationary marginal models smm which was aimed to detect what would happen if we ignored its nonstationarity figure s2 focus on the quantile estimation based on nsmm red solid line and smm black solid line all the results from these five stations showed the obtained quantiles for design period 1983 2022 from nsmm model were lower than that from the smm model and the difference of the quantiles between these two models would intensify as the increase of arr level in addition the uncertainty intervals of the quantiles for these two models increase with the arr level in general the smm models ignoring the nonstationarity of the extreme variable which was caused by trend or change point would overestimate the designed quantiles at a certain arr level under univariate condition for bivariate cases algorithm 1 shown in section 2 3 was implemented to derive the numeric solution for the quantile pairs of most likely event at each aar level from and hazard scenario different from analysis of the designed quantiles under univariate case the bivariate nonstationary behaviors were more complex due to the existence of nonstationarity 1 nonstationarity existed only in marginal distribution 2 nonstationarity existed only in copula 3 both of the above two scenarios salvadori et al 2018 in this study the nonstationary behavior of ps im pair of station 1 5 and 8 only existed in marginal distributions the nonstationary behavior of ps im pair of station 6 and 7 existed both in margins and copula this study focused on what would happen to the quantile estimation if the nonstationarity was ignored so we defined three cases of hazard assessment models 1 nonstationary models with nonstationary margins and nonstationary copula case 1 nsm c1 2 nonstationary models with nonstationary margins and stationary copula case 2 nsm c2 3 stationary models with stationary margins and stationary copula sm c3 since ps im pair of station 1 5 and 8 belongs to nsm c2 the model sm c3 was only analyzed because our study focused on the impact of quantile estimation if we ignored the nonstationarity of the margins parallel to ps im pair of station 1 5 and 8 the quantile pairs ps im of station 6 and 7 was investigated from the nsm c1 nsm c2 and sm c3 firstly the quantile pairs corresponding to each arr level of station 1 5 8 can be derived based on algorithm 1 fig 9 for station 1 and 8 the quantile of ps from proposed nsm c2 model was lower than that from sm c3 model which ignored the nonstationarity of ps furthermore the divergence intensified at higher arr level the same conclusion can be drawn from im of station 5 for im of station 1 and 8 the estimated quantile showed no difference at arr interval 0 1 0 9 for these two models for ps of station 5 the consistent region of quantiles for these two models fell in 0 2 0 8 in general ignoring the nonstationarity of marginal distribution caused by trend would overestimate quantile estimation of the extreme attribute with the nonstationarity and have little impact on the extreme attribute with no stationarity figure s4 showed the quantile pair estimation for station 6 and 7 which have nonstationarity both in margins and copula because of different reasons trend for station 6 and change point for station 7 focus on the ps from nsm c1 green solid line and nsm c2 red solid line model the quantile curves from these two models are almost coincident no matter for station 6 or 7 for the ps from nsm c2 and sm c3 the estimated quantile curve showed an evident difference from the above two comparison the copula nonstationarity has less impact on the designed quantiles compared to the nonstationarity of marginal distribution no matter due to trend or change point for the im of station 6 which did not cover nonstationarity these three quantile curves from three models are almost consistent especially at high arr levels which indicated the same conclusion as that of station 1 5 and 8 however for im of station 7 the quantile at model nsm c1 showed a difference with that of models nsm c2 and sm c1 which recommends the nonstationarity of copula would have an impact on the extreme attribute im of station 7 with no stationarity since the difference of 90 quantile uncertainty interval between the stationary and nonstationary models under univariate and bivariate cases was not evident at each arr level the mean value of the confidence interval mci at several typical arr levels are calculated for different models under univariate condition figure s4 the mci of nonstationary marginal model nsmm at station 1 5 6 7 and 8 is bigger than that of the stationary marginal model smm which means the nonstationarity of margins would recommend more uncertainty to the quantile estimation at univariate case compared with stationary marginal models when it comes to the bivariate case different results can be found fig 10 since the best fitted model see section 3 3 and 3 4 for station 1 5 and 8 is the nonstationary marginal distribution and stationary copulas and we focus on the impact of ignoring the nonstationarity copula did not have nonstationarity for dependence structure of ps im at these stations according to analyzed results in section 3 4 the mci of the nsm c2 and sm c3 at these three stations has been calculated to explore the impact of ignoring the marginal nonstationarity in the same way mci of nsm 1 nsm 2 and sm 3 at station 6 and 7 is calculated because the best fitted model at these two stations has the nonstationarity both in marginal distribution and copula the mci of the quantile ps or im from nsm c2 is smaller than that from sm c3 which is different from the results in univariate case focus on the quantile uncertainty at station 6 and 7 the mci of nsm c1 model was the largest one among all three models compared to the divergence of mci between nsm c2 and sm c3 the nonstationarity of copula would recommend wider confidence interval for the designed quantile estimation than the nonstationary margins and stationary models 4 conclusions the feasibility of hydrological frequency and hazard assessment on the basis of stationary assumptions is being challenged due to the multiple effects of climate change urbanization and heat island effects as a response a nonstationary bivariate hazard assessment through the time varying marginal distribution and copula based model is performed over the extreme rainfall events observed at eight stations in haihe river basin the time dependent copula and marginal distribution models are applied to two extreme rainfall attributes ps and im extracted from daily rainfall data of eight stations in haihe river basin china from the perspective of joint exceedance probabilities jep of extreme rainfall events at and scenario the design values and their confidence intervals of the two indexes based on average annual reliability aar method were computed and shown by parametric bootstrap method the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 from a statistician s point of view it is of great necessity to implement strict testing procedures adopt independent gof tests for copula and margins select stations with sample size make pre analyzing of the dependence in order to control global type i error 2 based on the arr designed quantile estimation at univariate case ignoring the nonstationarity of marginal distribution caused by trend would overestimate quantile estimation of the extreme attribute with the nonstationarity while it would have little impact on the extreme attribute with no stationarity 3 different from the conclusion of the quantile estimation under univariate condition the nonstationarity of copula has less impact on the designed arr based quantiles compared to the nonstationarity of marginal distribution no matter due to trend or change point on the one hand on the other hand the nonstationarity of dependence structure would add more uncertainty to the hazard assessment compared to the nonstationarity of margins this study emphasizes the significance of incorporating nonstationarity into multivariate hazard through the investigation of univariate and multivariate arr based quantile pairs of the extreme attribute series the extended bivariate nonstationary arr based hazard assessment method could be not only applied to implement hydrological design under stationary conditions but also under nonstationary conditions the proposed nonstationary models can be applied to deal with the encounter problem of extreme rainfall events occurred at different locations from more refined temporal and spatial scale which would be an important and interesting topic by the means of time varying
