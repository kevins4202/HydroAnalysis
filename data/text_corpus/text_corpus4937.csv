24685,the amelioration of air quality represents one of the most complex challenges that the european union is facing today although a successful strategy to improve air quality should decisively act on pollution sources nature based solutions nbs may provide a huge contribution to tackle air pollution while delivering a wide range of ecosystem services and enhancing the natural capital in this paper we analyzed in both biophysical and monetary terms the role of the urban green infrastructure ugi in improving air quality in the metropolitan city of naples southern italy by implementing an accounting model of pm10 removal our findings indicate that about 1 148 mg of pm10 were annually removed by the ugi for a monetary value of 36 million euros per year we also assessed the impact of a devastating wildfire that occurred in 2017 in the study area which resulted in a loss of pm10 removal of about 97 mg and led to an estimated monetary loss of 3 million euros per year the results also showed that pm10 removal efficiency largely varies seasonally and across different functional groups of vegetation highlighting the role of functional biodiversity in the provision of ecosystem services under mediterranean climate conditions in conclusion we maintain that the biophysical and economic assessment of ecosystem services can support local managers and policymakers in charge of developing urban planning strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable development and human well being in metropolitan cities keywords pm10 urban green infrastructure ecosystem services air quality 1 introduction most of the challenges that the european union eu is facing today including public health and environmental issues have a strong urban dimension the amelioration of air quality represents one of the most critical ones in 2017 17 of the eu 28 population was exposed to pm10 concentrations exceeding the daily limit value set by the eu the former increases to 44 if the stricter world health organization who guidelines are considered of all the monitoring stations that reported pm10 concentration values above the eu threshold 95 were either urban or suburban european environment agency 2019 this is extremely concerning since it is acknowledged that particulate matter pm increases the occurrence of various health diseases including cardiovascular and respiratory problems and cancer anderson et al 2012 clancy et al 2002 toren et al 2007 even though pm10 pollution has a predominant urban dimension different cities may have to cope with different natural and anthropogenic pollution sources oanh et al 2006 stated that the major contributors to pm2 5 and pm10 pollution are traffic biomass burning and soil dust furthermore coastal cities with major seaports often show high pm10 concentrations due to large commercial and touristic ships docking in city harbors mueller et al 2011 nonetheless cities are also the centers of innovation and technology and own an intrinsic potential to provide solutions to such challenges european commission 2018 in this regard since 2015 the european commission has funded research and innovation investment programs closely focused on the upgrading of cities for sustainability climate mitigation and environmental resilience european commission 2018 the proposed approaches are built on nature based solutions nbs defined as solutions that are inspired and supported by nature which are cost effective simultaneously provide environmental social and economic benefits and help build resilience european commission 2015 nbs enhance the natural capital rather than deplete it and have the potential to foster the transition toward a greener economy european commission 2013 amongst all nbs particularly relevant for urban contexts is the urban green infrastructure ugi that is a strategically planned network of natural and semi natural areas with other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services ess such as water purification air quality improvement space for recreation and climate mitigation and adaptation european commission 2013 ugi which includes street trees urban parks urban and peri urban forests can therefore prove crucial for enhancing the environmental quality of cities and improving human well being european commission 2015 several studies have highlighted the relevant contribution of ugi towards recreation stress reduction and more generally to psychological health and well being coutts and hahn 2015 ugi also offers a variety of regulating ess which include urban heat island marando et al 2019 effect mitigation and air purification fusaro et al 2017 manes et al 2012 as for the air purification ideally pollution abatement strategies should focus on the cause namely the source of emission rather than the effects high pm10 concentrations indeed this is only possible if the source is anthropic albeit very hard to realize in practical terms as an example it has been demonstrated that some measures that are routinely adopted by local governments like travel restriction schedules may prove useless polichetti 2017 for this reason it is also worth to invest in the potential of the ugi to remove particulate matter the abatement of pm10 concentrations provided by trees occurs by means of pm10 interception by the leaf s surface several processes concur to pm removal including interception impaction and sedimentation yi et al 2017 pm removal has been widely observed in both field and laboratory studies beckett et al 2000 lin et al 2019 and has been quantified using different modeling approaches over the last years within the urban contexts biophysical analyses of ess could highlight the potentials and trade offs of different urbanization patterns and act as guiding principles for sustainable urban planning kourdounouli and jönsson 2020 quantitative data on the value of the natural capital is required to provide stakeholders with information to protect and effectively manage natural resources at local scale buonocore et al 2019 2020 the monetary evaluation of the benefits provided by the ugi which should only be conducted once a solid biophysical quantification has been carried out franzese et al 2017 is also a powerful tool which allows to bind together the economic and the ecological perspectives of ess thus enhancing urban planning and management nikodinoska et al 2018 a quantitative analysis of ess is also helpful to monitor how their provision varies over time in response to processes such as land cover change and disturbances like wildfires as for the wildfires a literature review carried out by vukomanovic and steelman 2019 reports that they negatively impact the supply of several regulating ess by altering the vegetation structure and composition however there is a lack of studies that quantitatively assess this impact the aim of this study is to implement an accounting model of pm10 removal by ugi which allows to i estimate the es of pm10 removal provided by urban vegetation in the metropolitan city of naples ii provide a monetary evaluation of this es and iii estimate the es loss caused by a devastating wildfire that took place in the study area in july 2017 pm10 removal was calculated for three different functional groups fg of vegetation on a seasonal basis whereas the monetary evaluation was conducted using the externalities values for air pollution provided by the european environment agency eea 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the metropolitan city of naples the metropolitan city mc of naples 40 50 n 14 15 e lays over 1171 km2 and counts about 3 million dwellers the climate is mediterranean with a total yearly rainfall of 929 mm and a mean monthly temperature ranging from 11 c in january to 26 c in august bonanomi et al 2018 it is an impressive example of urban agglomeration shaped by a complex history like many other mediterranean cities the municipality of naples that is the most important city of the mc of naples is undergoing a transformation from a compact to a more scattered urban form schneider and woodcock 2008 however the past urban development has been driven by planning deregulation for a long time thus lacking a unified planning vision de rosa and salvati 2016 the municipality of naples together with those municipalities situated along the southeast coastline forms an urban continuum with average population density of about 3000 inhabitants per km2 and 68 85 of land consumption dipartimento per gli affari regionali e le autonomie 2017 on the other hand the territory also hosts a total of 38 sites that are part of the natura 2000 network most of which are located inside valuable and biodiverse protected areas such as the campi flegrei regional park and the vesuvius national park ispra 2017 air pollution mostly associated with road traffic and to a lesser extent to marine aerosol fluxes is a serious concern for the mc of naples chianese et al 2019 iodice et al 2016 riccio et al 2017 sirignano et al 2019 furthermore in july 2017 a devastating wildfire took place in the vesuvius national park burning more than 84 of the total surface of the park memoli et al 2019 2 2 land use and land cover classification mapping ecosystems is pivotal to assess the provision of ess we performed a supervised classification using a sentinel 2 image acquired in the summer of 2016 the year before the devasting wildfire that occurred in the vesuvius national park sentinel 2 carries a multispectral instrument payload that samples 13 spectral bands including three bands referred to as red edge tailored to monitor vegetation and have a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m european spatial agency 2015 we used a sentinel 2 level 1c product which includes radiometric and geometric corrections european spatial agency 2015 then we performed a dark object subtraction an image based atmospheric correction widely used to correct the atmospheric scattering chavez 1996 after collecting an adequate number of regions of interest roi we used the maximum likelihood algorithm to classify the image all the bands with 10 m and 20 m resolution were included the elaborations were conducted using the semi automatic classification plug in implemented for the free and open source software qgis congedo 2016 the spatial resolution of the classification is 10 m with overall accuracy exceeding 80 we identified six land use and land cover classes these include three different functional groups fg of vegetation conifers evergreen broadleaves and deciduous broadleaves alongside artificial surfaces agricultural areas areas with herbaceous vegetation and water bodies notably the agricultural areas were directly extracted from the corine land cover project and grouped with areas with herbaceous vegetation and bare soil indeed for our purposes we were mostly interested in mapping the woody vegetation rather than other land use land cover types 2 3 seasonal leaf area index computation the mean seasonal leaf area index lai of the study area for 2016 was retrieved using the lai product delivered by the copernicus global land service cgls freely available on the cgls website this product derives from the proba v daily data at 300 m resolution the lai is calculated globally on a 10 days basis and made available for download values were averaged on a seasonal basis using the gis software grass gis the winter lai for deciduous broadleaves was arbitrarily set equal to 0 since they lose their leaves in that period furthermore only images from the 22nd of september until the 24th of october were considered to compute their autumnal lai marando et al 2016 to our knowledge this is the first time that this promising product has been used to assess the provision of any ess 2 4 pm10 mean annual concentration analyses from the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service cams hosted by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf were used for assessing the pm10 mean seasonal concentration cams delivers reliable and enhanced atmospheric environmental information services to support research namely the ensemble forecasting system for air quality for europe at a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and several vertical levels starting from the surface up to 5000 m the ensemble is based on seven models chimere emep eurad lotos euros match mocage and silam observations are also assimilated into forecasts providing an updated analysis for the previous day most products are disseminated in near real time through a rest api service although cams analyses include observations large and strong seasonal dependent biases are still present chianese et al 2018 with the largest biases during the winter this is an expected result as the information provided by cams models corresponds to background values which are representative of relatively large scale phenomena unable to capture the gradients associated with high variability therefore a bias correction method was implemented in this study based on the probabilistic downscaling method called cdf t michelangeli et al 2009 matching model values with pm10 observations from the regional air quality network of the metropolitan area to assess the pm10 mean annual concentrations for each day and grid cell the median value among available models was calculated and then seasonally averaged we selected the year 2018 as it is the closest year with a representative pm10 concentration of the study area indeed while the modeled pm10 concentration for the year 2016 displayed a clear bias for the average spring concentration which exceeded every other season by at least 12 µg m3 the summer pm10 concentration for the year 2017 was influenced by the wildfire and reached an average greater than 30 µg m3 which is unlikely for the study area under normal conditions 2 5 pm10 deposition the deposition of the pm10 on the vegetation was estimated following the equation proposed by nowak et al 1994 applied in different studies fusaro et al 2017 manes et al 2012 and reported below q f l t where q is the amount of pm10 which is adsorbed f is the flux of pollutant defined as the deposition velocity of pm10 multiplied by the pm10 concentration l is the mean lai for the considered period t is the vegetative period of the considered fg of vegetation according to marando et al 2016 evergreen species are considered to provide the es all year long instead the deciduous species due to their different phenology provide it for 218 days per year which corresponds to the timespan going from early spring to mid autumn as for the deposition velocity v d we adopted a median value of 0 0064 m s which is based on a mean annual lai value of 6 and then adjusted according to the actual lai escobedo and nowak 2009 lovett 1994 previous studies suggested that v d may change according to air temperature humidity and tree species e g needle like leaves of broadleaves however i as stated by mariraj mohan 2016 further studies are needed to properly simulate dry deposition of pm onto the leaves surface and ii this bias is widely accepted in previous studies conducted at regional scale the implications of rainfall upon the investigated process were also disregarded the main steps of the applied methodology are summarized in fig 1 2 6 land cover change detection and estimation of the es loss different methodologies have been developed to map burned areas as well as to estimate the burn severity fernández manso et al 2016 in this study we performed a change detection for the vesuvius national park between the years 2016 that is the year before the wildfire and 2019 specifically we produced two supervised classifications of the vesuvius national park one for each of the considered years using the same set of rois then we detected the pixels that went from a vegetated to a non vegetated class assuming that these changes were attributable to the wildfire that occurred in the study area in 2017 indeed stringent management efforts aimed at the conservation and enhancement of vegetation are applied in this area in line with the legislation devised for national park management for this reason it is possible to safely attribute any loss of vegetation occurred within the park territory to the wildfire including the removal of partially burned vegetation that took place after 2017 for securing purposes this information was then used to assess the loss in the provision of the considered es 2 7 monetary evaluation following fusaro et al 2017 the monetary evaluation of the pm10 removal by the vegetation was conducted using the externality value for pm10 externalities are the social cost of air pollution under multiple aspects i e human health environment that are generally not included in the market for italy this is estimated to be eur 31 356 for each mg of the pollutant removed by the vegetation eea 2014 3 results 3 1 land use and land cover classification the land use and land cover classification of the metropolitan city of naples is reported in fig 2 the class made up by agricultural areas shrubs and herbaceous vegetation is the most abundant in the study area covering more than 60 of the total surface artificial surfaces cover about 20 however it is noteworthy that urbanization is mostly focused within and slightly around the municipality of naples the combination of the three fgs of vegetation covers the remaining 20 of the total area nevertheless the abundance of each group varies largely deciduous broadleaves evergreen broadleaves and conifers represent respectively 63 31 and 6 of the total woody vegetation lastly water bodies cover a negligible portion of the mc of naples 3 2 mean seasonal lai the mean seasonal lai maps are shown in fig 3 whereas the average seasonal lai values for the different groups are summarized in table 1 it is noteworthy that while the average lai for deciduous broadleaves peaks during summer 3 39 both evergreen broadleaves and conifers display the highest average lai values in spring 2 40 and 2 90 respectively the lai of evergreen broadleaves drops drastically throughout autumn and reaches the minimum value in winter 1 27 whereas conifers show small lai variations throughout the seasons as the average value is attested between 2 43 and 2 90 on the contrary deciduous broadleaves start their vegetative period in spring with high lai values 3 00 peak in summer and terminate with a rather low average lai 1 77 in autumn in terms of the spatial distribution of lai values seasonal peaks are concentrated within and between the northeast and southeast quadrants of the mc where biodiverse areas of high ecological value belonging to the partenio regional park the vesuvius national park and the lattari mountains are located 3 3 pm10 mean seasonal concentrations fig 4 shows the seasonally averaged concentrations for the metropolitan city of naples concentrations resulted higher during the winter season with an average value of about 35 μg m3 and lower during the summer season dropping to about 25 μg m3 this behavior is generally due to the fact that during the winter season lower temperatures favor condensation phenomena and biomass combustion and heating processes are active both significantly contributing to the emission of particles into the atmosphere for the cams air quality data the model bias was greatly reduced from about 10 μg m3 to less than 1 0 μg m3 on average similarly the correlation coefficient went from 0 74 to 0 91 more details on the application of this method and results can be found in chianese et al 2018 3 4 land cover change detection of the vesuvius national park fig 5 shows the vegetated area which burned during the 2017 wildfire grouped in the three fgs according to our results 1 315 ha of vegetation were lost due to this event as shown in table 2 the wildfire mostly affected conifers indeed about 77 of the burned vegetation belonged to this functional group burned evergreen broadleaves account for more than 16 of total burned vegetation while deciduous broadleaves represent about 7 3 5 pre wildfire pm10 removal the spatial distribution of the pm10 removal efficiency kg ha is shown in fig 6 removal data including the total amount of pm10 adsorbed by the vegetation on a seasonal and annual basis are summarized in table 3 the highest deposition rates are consistently found in the north and south eastern quadrants of the mc where the highest lai values are also observed deciduous broadleaves display overall highest removal efficiency for the spring and summer months 23 17 and 27 54 kg ha respectively however their removal efficiency drops drastically in winter and autumn the pm10 removal efficiency of evergreen broadleaves follows a seasonal pattern similar to that of deciduous broadleaves with high values in spring 15 95 kg ha and summer 13 78 kg ha gradually decreasing to the lowest winter value 4 67 kg ha on the contrary conifers display a different removal pattern compared to the other functional groups with small differences amongst seasonal removal rates indeed the peak of the deposition rate for conifers occurs during winter 20 53 kg ha followed by spring 20 08 kg ha while summer and autumn are attested around 14 kg ha it is noteworthy that the pm10 removal of conifers is higher during winter and autumn compared to the other functional groups consequently yearly the total pm10 removal efficiency is highest for conifers 68 94 kg ha followed by deciduous broadleaves 53 51 kg ha and evergreen broadleaves 39 73 kg ha the total annual pm10 removal was calculated for each functional group and resulted higher for deciduous broadleaves 780 12 mg and considerably lower for evergreen broadleaves 269 93 mg and for conifers 98 25 mg this finding reflects the greater spatial extent of deciduous broadleaves compared to the other fgs in terms of seasonal trends of pm10 deposition removal in summer was found substantially higher as compared to other seasons with a total of 515 30 mg removed by the three functional groups spring removal was equal to 474 78 mg whereas autumn and winter recorded lower values 97 22 mg and 61 00 mg respectively the total annual pm10 removal for the three functional groups amounted to 1 148 30 mg 3 6 monetary evaluation the monetary evaluation of the pm10 removal in the mc of naples amounted to eur 36 million per year the estimated values for each season and for each functional group of vegetation are reported in table 3 being the monetary evaluation of the ess strictly related to their biophysical quantification the resulting monetary value for each fg is strictly dependent on the total amount of pm10 removed 3 7 loss of ecosystem service due to the wildfire the loss of this es due to the 2017 wildfire is equal to 96 97 mg of pm10 table 4 which amounts to 8 4 of the es provided before the wildfire yearly the loss of pm10 removal for the conifers amounts to 80 73 mg notably this corresponds to 82 of the total removal provided by this fg for the mc of naples the loss of pm10 removal by evergreen broadleaves and deciduous broadleaves amounted to 11 65 mg and 4 59 mg respectively finally the total monetary loss is equal to eur 3 04 million per year 4 discussion the mean seasonal lai follows the vegetative growth pattern for deciduous broadleaves peaking in summer and dropping in autumn and winter whereas it stands at less dispersed values for evergreen species which preserve their foliage for multiple years and renew it gradually by observing the spatial distribution of the pm10 removal in the mc of naples fig 6 it is noteworthy that it is mostly provided in areas of high ecological value such as the partenio regional park the vesuvius national park and the lattari mountains on the contrary pm10 removal within the municipality of naples and the adjacent municipalities which form one of the most impressive urban agglomerations in europe appears limited indeed the mc of naples has 11 8 m2 of urban green space per dweller including historic villas urban parks street trees gardens and botanic gardens and other green areas managed by the public administration and intended for the use of citizens which is the second lowest amongst all the italian metropolitan cities istat 2016 pm10 deposition rates estimated in the mc of naples are considerably higher than those obtained in a previous study for ten metropolitan cities of italy manes et al 2016 indeed the current total pm10 deposition 1 148 30 mg has highlighted a four fold increase compared to the one observed in 2003 there are different determining factors which explain such discrepancy including the use of more recent and finer scale data for the lai estimation and the pm10 concentration our results are consistent with the findings from marando et al 2016 who run this model over the metropolitan city of rome which is about 4 5 times larger than the mc of naples and found that the pm10 removal is equal to about 5 573 mg per year nonetheless we could not find any research assessing the impact that events like a wildfire have on the delivery of this es pm10 removal efficiency showed considerable variations both seasonally and among the different fgs overall deciduous broadleaves proved to be the most efficient fg for pm10 removal in the vegetative period reaching its peak during summer 27 54 kg ha which mirrored the lai values however the contribution of this fg in the pm10 removal during the autumn is almost negligible while it is absent in winter that is the period in which this es is most needed as for the evergreen broadleaves their lai values drastically drop during autumn and winter and so does their pm10 removal efficiency finally seasonal removal efficiency of conifers is consistent throughout the year and comparable to the one found by fusaro et al 2017 this explains why the annual efficiency for conifers was indeed the highest among the three functional groups 68 94 kg ha this is in accordance with chen et al 2017 who observed that the needles of conifers are more efficient than broadleaves in adsorbing pm because of several factors including shape phenology and waxes on their surface our results suggest that summer was the season when most of the total pm10 removal occurred 515 30 mg 45 of total this finding is in accordance with a previous study conducted on pm10 removal efficiency by functional groups in the mc of rome marando et al 2016 the fact that the removal efficiency of conifers is higher in winter could be crucial for the improvement of the ugi network within the mc of naples indeed winter pm10 concentrations as well as other air pollutants such as nox and sox species are notoriously higher than in spring or summer months for a combination of factors ranging from emission sources emission of gaseous precursors to atmospheric conditions which include temperature relative humidity and predominant wind direction augustin et al 2020 coniferous species could therefore guarantee pm10 abatement when its benefits would be most needed by the local populations this study highlights the role of biodiversity since different leaf structural i e leaf area index and functional traits i e stomatal conductance as well as different life spans may contribute to the stability and efficiency of the regulating es delivered by ugi manes et al 2012 2016 however it is noteworthy that urban trees face adverse environmental conditions such as drought soil compaction and the presence of heavy metals mullaney et al 2015 that may affect the provision of ess besides urban vegetation can also provide the so called ecosystem disservices for instance urban trees may damage the street structure specifically the upper part of the asphalt or release a variety of allergenic pollen grains into the atmosphere generating health problems for the population velasco jiménez et al 2020 for these reasons policymakers should carefully select species to be adopted in a greening strategy paying attention to the benefits and challenges that each species provides from a monetary perspective the annual benefits generated by the es of pm10 removal is equal to eur 36 million clearly providing a measure of the actual benefits derived by the ugi furthermore this estimate can be used to actively promote the implementation of ugi and to remark the importance of the natural capital as a further indicator it could be adopted the monetary value per spatial unit which in this case is equal to approximately 31 000 euros per square kilometer per year and may be used to compare the trends of the adopted planning measures over the time it should be borne in mind that a comprehensive ess assessment should somehow be weighted according to the associated demand indeed in recent years an increasing number of studies is facing the challenge of quantifying both the ess supply that is the provision of ess and the ess demand in order to assess the ess mismatch and to define areas where the ugi and their related benefits should be enhanced baró et al 2015 furthermore it should be remarked that we analyzed a single es whereas the ugi exerts a multifunctional role by delivering a variety of ess concerning not only air quality but also the climate regulation and the esthetic value of nature maintaining certain fire regimes is crucial to habitat and ecosystem services however more often fire does not operate as a natural ecosystem process and exerts a negative impact on both the social and ecological systems moritz et al 2014 in this study the impact of the wildfire accounts for about 8 of the total value of this es which turns into a monetary loss of about eur 3 million per year this loss will last for several years as many as the natural vegetation requires to fully recover this event will also compromise other regulating ess such as the long term carbon storage moritz et al 2014 and is likely to lead to higher pm concentration which eventually turns into increased influenza in the following cold season landguth et al 2020 furthermore saracino et al 2019 pointed out that the vesuvius national park is crucial to maintain the socioeconomic system by delivering cultural ess for instance tourism which was inevitably damaged by this event generates significant incomes for the population at last further studies should also take into consideration the costs that will be faced to restore the area and to adopt further measures to prevent future wildfires the approach herein adopted is reliable cost effective and easily replicable and could be systematically included in urban planning strategies and natural capital accounting for this reason the use of freely available data which include remote sensing imagery and existing pollution modeling systems e g cams models alongside free and open source software is highly encouraged furthermore it also allows to biophysically quantify the loss of ess in response to disturbances such as wildfires this study can be intended as a preliminary step toward the inclusion of regulating ess in the urban planning process for the mc of naples indeed further studies are needed both to assess the ess supply and demand and to include other ess to perform a more comprehensive assessment in fact as reported by maragno et al 2018 and verhagen et al 2017 ignoring the ess demand may lead to misleading findings which result in an inefficient allocation of resources in terms of limitations of the present study it is known that the deposition velocity of pm10 varies according to factors such as temperature and wind speed mariraj mohan 2016 5 conclusion in this study we assessed the contribution that the ugi provides to improve the air quality in the mc of naples we conclude that the ugi removes about 1 148 mg of pm10 every year with a monetary benefit equal to eur 36 million the following points should be remarked i different functional groups of vegetation display a high variability in both overall and inter seasonal removal efficiency ii the provision of the es mostly occurs within large natural areas of the mc of naples whereas highly urbanized areas only rely on a limited amount of es iii ugi provides an important monetary benefit to the mc of naples which should serve as a reminder of the value of the natural capital iv the 2017 wildfire considerably affected the provision of the considered es its impact is likely to persist for several years at least until the vegetation s condition is restored the biophysical and economic value of the pm10 removal together with the maps showing its spatial distribution can support local managers and policymakers to develop urban planning strategies future studies could be oriented towards a more comprehensive assessment of the overall set of ess generated by ugi in urban ecosystems author statement alessandro sebastiani

paper we analyzed in both biophysical and monetary terms the role of the urban green infrastructure ugi in improving air quality in the metropolitan city of naples southern italy by implementing an accounting model of pm10 removal our findings indicate that about 1 148 mg of pm10 were annually removed by the ugi for a monetary value of 36 million euros per year we also assessed the impact of a devastating wildfire that occurred in 2017 in the study area which resulted in a loss of pm10 removal of about 97 mg and led to an estimated monetary loss of 3 million euros per year the results also showed that pm10 removal efficiency largely varies seasonally and across different functional groups of vegetation highlighting the role of functional biodiversity in the provision of ecosystem services under mediterranean climate conditions in conclusion we maintain that the biophysical and economic assessment of ecosystem services can support local managers and policymakers in charge of developing urban planning strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable development and human well being in metropolitan cities keywords pm10 urban green infrastructure ecosystem services air quality 1

of different urbanization patterns and act as guiding principles for sustainable urban planning kourdounouli and jönsson 2020 quantitative data on the value of the natural capital is required to provide stakeholders with information to protect and effectively manage natural resources at local scale buonocore et al 2019 2020 the monetary evaluation of the benefits provided by the ugi which should only be conducted once a solid biophysical quantification has been carried out franzese et al 2017 is also a powerful tool which allows to bind together the economic and the ecological perspectives of ess thus enhancing urban planning and management nikodinoska et al 2018 a quantitative analysis of ess is also helpful to monitor how their provision varies over time in response to processes such as land cover change and disturbances like wildfires as for the wildfires a literature review carried out by vukomanovic and steelman 2019 reports that they negatively impact the supply of several regulating ess by altering the vegetation structure and composition however there is a lack of studies that quantitatively assess this impact the aim of this study is to implement an accounting model of pm10 removal by ugi which allows to i estimate the es of pm10 removal provided by urban vegetation in the metropolitan city of naples ii provide a monetary evaluation of this es and iii estimate the es loss caused by a devastating wildfire that took place in the study area in july 2017 pm10 removal was calculated for three different functional groups fg of vegetation on a seasonal basis whereas the monetary evaluation was conducted using the externalities values for air pollution provided by the european environment agency eea 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the metropolitan city of naples the metropolitan city mc of naples 40 50 n 14 15 e lays over 1171 km2 and counts about 3 million dwellers the climate is mediterranean with a total yearly rainfall of 929 mm and a mean monthly temperature ranging from 11 c in january to 26 c in august bonanomi et al 2018 it is an impressive example of urban agglomeration shaped by a complex history like many other mediterranean cities the municipality of naples that is the most important city of the mc of naples is undergoing a transformation from a compact to a more scattered urban form schneider and woodcock 2008 however the past urban development has been driven by planning deregulation for a long time thus lacking a unified planning vision de rosa and salvati 2016 the municipality of naples together with those municipalities situated along the southeast coastline forms an urban continuum with average population density of about 3000 inhabitants per km2 and 68 85 of land consumption dipartimento per gli affari regionali e le autonomie 2017 on the other hand the territory also hosts a total of 38 sites that are part of the natura 2000 network most of which are located inside valuable and biodiverse protected areas such as the campi flegrei regional park and the vesuvius national park ispra 2017 air pollution mostly associated with road traffic and to a lesser extent to marine aerosol fluxes is a serious concern for the mc of naples chianese et al 2019 iodice et al 2016 riccio et al 2017 sirignano et al 2019 furthermore in july 2017 a devastating wildfire took place in the vesuvius national park burning more than 84 of the total surface of the park memoli et al 2019 2 2 land use and land cover classification mapping ecosystems is pivotal to assess the provision of ess we performed a supervised classification using a sentinel 2 image acquired in the summer of 2016 the year before the devasting wildfire that occurred in the vesuvius national park sentinel 2 carries a multispectral instrument payload that samples 13 spectral bands including three bands referred to as red edge tailored to monitor vegetation and have a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m european spatial agency 2015 we used a sentinel 2 level 1c product which includes radiometric and geometric corrections european spatial agency 2015 then we performed a dark object subtraction an image based atmospheric correction widely used to correct the atmospheric scattering chavez 1996 after collecting an adequate number of regions of interest roi we used the maximum likelihood algorithm to classify the image all the bands with 10 m and 20 m resolution were included the elaborations were conducted using the semi automatic classification plug in implemented for the free and open source software qgis congedo 2016 the spatial resolution of the classification is 10 m with overall accuracy exceeding 80 we identified six land use and land cover classes these include three different functional groups fg of vegetation conifers evergreen broadleaves and deciduous broadleaves alongside artificial surfaces agricultural areas areas with herbaceous vegetation and water bodies notably the agricultural areas were directly extracted from the corine land cover project and grouped with areas with herbaceous vegetation and bare soil indeed for our purposes we were mostly interested in mapping the woody vegetation rather than other land use land cover types 2 3 seasonal leaf area index computation the mean seasonal leaf area index lai of the study area for 2016 was retrieved using the lai product delivered by the copernicus global land service cgls freely available on the cgls website this product derives from the proba v daily data at 300 m resolution the lai is calculated globally on a 10 days basis and made available for download values were averaged on a seasonal basis using the gis software grass gis the winter lai for deciduous broadleaves was arbitrarily set equal to 0 since they lose their leaves in that period furthermore only images from the 22nd of september until the 24th of october were considered to compute their autumnal lai marando et al 2016 to our knowledge this is the first time that this promising product has been used to assess the provision of any ess 2 4 pm10 mean annual concentration analyses from the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service cams hosted by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf were used for assessing the pm10 mean seasonal concentration cams delivers reliable and enhanced atmospheric environmental information services to support research namely the ensemble forecasting system for air quality for europe at a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and several vertical levels starting from the surface up to 5000 m the ensemble is based on seven models chimere emep eurad lotos euros match mocage and silam observations are also assimilated into forecasts providing an updated analysis for the previous day most products are disseminated in near real time through a rest api service although cams analyses include observations large and strong seasonal dependent biases are still present chianese et al 2018 with the largest biases during the winter this is an expected result as the information provided by cams models corresponds to background values which are representative of relatively large scale phenomena unable to capture the gradients associated with high variability therefore a bias correction method was implemented in this study based on the probabilistic downscaling method called cdf t michelangeli et al 2009 matching model values with pm10 observations from the regional air quality network of the metropolitan area to assess the pm10 mean annual concentrations for each day and grid cell the median value among available models was calculated and then seasonally averaged we selected the year 2018 as it is the closest year with a representative pm10 concentration of the study area indeed while the modeled pm10 concentration for the year 2016 displayed a clear bias for the average spring concentration which exceeded every other season by at least 12 µg m3 the summer pm10 concentration for the year 2017 was influenced by the wildfire and reached an average greater than 30 µg m3 which is unlikely for the study area under normal conditions 2 5 pm10 deposition the deposition of the pm10 on the vegetation was estimated following the equation proposed by nowak et al 1994 applied in different studies fusaro et al 2017 manes et al 2012 and reported below q f l t where q is the amount of pm10 which is adsorbed f is the flux of pollutant defined as the deposition velocity of pm10 multiplied by the pm10 concentration l is the mean lai for the considered period t is the vegetative period of the considered fg of vegetation according to marando et al 2016 evergreen species are considered to provide the es all year long instead the deciduous species due to their different phenology provide it for 218 days per year which corresponds to the timespan going from early spring to mid autumn as for the deposition velocity v d we adopted a median value of 0 0064 m s which is based on a mean annual lai value of 6 and then adjusted according to the actual lai escobedo and nowak 2009 lovett 1994 previous studies suggested that v d may change according to air temperature humidity and tree species e g needle like leaves of broadleaves however i as stated by mariraj mohan 2016 further studies are needed to properly simulate dry deposition of pm onto the leaves surface and ii this bias is widely accepted in previous studies conducted at regional scale the implications of rainfall upon the investigated process were also disregarded the main steps of the applied methodology are summarized in fig 1 2 6 land cover change detection and estimation of the es loss different methodologies have been developed to map burned areas as well as to estimate the burn severity fernández manso et al 2016 in this study we performed a change detection for the vesuvius national park between the years 2016 that is the year before the wildfire and 2019 specifically we produced two supervised classifications of the vesuvius national park one for each of the considered years using the same set of rois then we detected the pixels that went from a vegetated to a non vegetated class assuming that these changes were attributable to the wildfire that occurred in the study area in 2017 indeed stringent management efforts aimed at the conservation and enhancement of vegetation are applied in this area in line with the legislation devised for national park management for this reason it is possible to safely attribute any loss of vegetation occurred within the park territory to the wildfire including the removal of partially burned vegetation that took place after 2017 for securing purposes this information was then used to assess the loss in the provision of the considered es 2 7 monetary evaluation following fusaro et al 2017 the monetary evaluation of the pm10 removal by the vegetation was conducted using the externality value for pm10 externalities are the social cost of air pollution under multiple aspects i e human health environment that are generally not included in the market for italy this is estimated to be eur 31 356 for each mg of the pollutant removed by the vegetation eea 2014 3 results 3 1 land use and land cover classification the land use and land cover classification of the metropolitan city of naples is reported in fig 2 the class made up by agricultural areas shrubs and herbaceous vegetation is the most abundant in the study area covering more than 60 of the total surface artificial surfaces cover about 20 however it is noteworthy that urbanization is mostly focused within and slightly around the municipality of naples the combination of the three fgs of vegetation covers the remaining 20 of the total area nevertheless the abundance of each group varies largely deciduous broadleaves evergreen broadleaves and conifers represent respectively 63 31 and 6 of the total woody vegetation lastly water bodies cover a negligible portion of the mc of naples 3 2 mean seasonal lai the mean seasonal lai maps are shown in fig 3 whereas the average seasonal lai values for the different groups are summarized in table 1 it is noteworthy that while the average lai for deciduous broadleaves peaks during summer 3 39 both evergreen broadleaves and conifers display the highest average lai values in spring 2 40 and 2 90 respectively the lai of evergreen broadleaves drops drastically throughout autumn and reaches the minimum value in winter 1 27 whereas conifers show small lai variations throughout the seasons as the average value is attested between 2 43 and 2 90 on the contrary deciduous broadleaves start their vegetative period in spring with high lai values 3 00 peak in summer and terminate with a rather low average lai 1 77 in autumn in terms of the spatial distribution of lai values seasonal peaks are concentrated within and between the northeast and southeast quadrants of the mc where biodiverse areas of high ecological value belonging to the partenio regional park the vesuvius national park and the lattari mountains are located 3 3 pm10 mean seasonal concentrations fig 4 shows the seasonally averaged concentrations for the metropolitan city of naples concentrations resulted higher during the winter season with an average value of about 35 μg m3 and lower during the summer season dropping to about 25 μg m3 this behavior is generally due to the fact that during the winter season lower temperatures favor condensation phenomena and biomass combustion and heating processes are active both significantly contributing to the emission of particles into the atmosphere for the cams air quality data the model bias was greatly reduced from about 10 μg m3 to less than 1 0 μg m3 on average similarly the correlation coefficient went from 0 74 to 0 91 more details on the application of this method and results can be found in chianese et al 2018 3 4 land cover change detection of the vesuvius national park fig 5 shows the vegetated area which burned during the 2017 wildfire grouped in the three fgs according to our results 1 315 ha of vegetation were lost due to this event as shown in table 2 the wildfire mostly affected conifers indeed about 77 of the burned vegetation belonged to this functional group burned evergreen broadleaves account for more than 16 of total burned vegetation while deciduous broadleaves represent about 7 3 5 pre wildfire pm10 removal the spatial distribution of the pm10 removal efficiency kg ha is shown in fig 6 removal data including the total amount of pm10 adsorbed by the vegetation on a seasonal and annual basis are summarized in table 3 the highest deposition rates are consistently found in the north and south eastern quadrants of the mc where the highest lai values are also observed deciduous broadleaves display overall highest removal efficiency for the spring and summer months 23 17 and 27 54 kg ha respectively however their removal efficiency drops drastically in winter and autumn the pm10 removal efficiency of evergreen broadleaves follows a seasonal pattern similar to that of deciduous broadleaves with high values in spring 15 95 kg ha and summer 13 78 kg ha gradually decreasing to the lowest winter value 4 67 kg ha on the contrary conifers display a different removal pattern compared to the other functional groups with small differences amongst seasonal removal rates indeed the peak of the deposition rate for conifers occurs during winter 20 53 kg ha followed by spring 20 08 kg ha while summer and autumn are attested around 14 kg ha it is noteworthy that the pm10 removal of conifers is higher during winter and autumn compared to the other functional groups consequently yearly the total pm10 removal efficiency is highest for conifers 68 94 kg ha followed by deciduous broadleaves 53 51 kg ha and evergreen broadleaves 39 73 kg ha the total annual pm10 removal was calculated for each functional group and resulted higher for deciduous broadleaves 780 12 mg and considerably lower for evergreen broadleaves 269 93 mg and for conifers 98 25 mg this finding reflects the greater spatial extent of deciduous broadleaves compared to the other fgs in terms of seasonal trends of pm10 deposition removal in summer was found substantially higher as compared to other seasons with a total of 515 30 mg removed by the three functional groups spring removal was equal to 474 78 mg whereas autumn and winter recorded lower values 97 22 mg and 61 00 mg respectively the total annual pm10 removal for the three functional groups amounted to 1 148 30 mg 3 6 monetary evaluation the monetary evaluation of the pm10 removal in the mc of naples amounted to eur 36 million per year the estimated values for each season and for each functional group of vegetation are reported in table 3 being the monetary evaluation of the ess strictly related to their biophysical quantification the resulting monetary value for each fg is strictly dependent on the total amount of pm10 removed 3 7 loss of ecosystem service due to the wildfire the loss of this es due to the 2017 wildfire is equal to 96 97 mg of pm10 table 4 which amounts to 8 4 of the es provided before the wildfire yearly the loss of pm10 removal for the conifers amounts to 80 73 mg notably this corresponds to 82 of the total removal provided by this fg for the mc of naples the loss of pm10 removal by evergreen broadleaves and deciduous broadleaves amounted to 11 65 mg and 4 59 mg respectively finally the total monetary loss is equal to eur 3 04 million per year 4 discussion the mean seasonal lai follows the vegetative growth pattern for deciduous broadleaves peaking in summer and dropping in autumn and winter whereas it stands at less dispersed values for evergreen species which preserve their foliage for multiple years and renew it gradually by observing the spatial distribution of the pm10 removal in the mc of naples fig 6 it is noteworthy that it is mostly provided in areas of high ecological value such as the partenio regional park the vesuvius national park and the lattari mountains on the contrary pm10 removal within the municipality of naples and the adjacent municipalities which form one of the most impressive urban agglomerations in europe appears limited indeed the mc of naples has 11 8 m2 of urban green space per dweller including historic villas urban parks street trees gardens and botanic gardens and other green areas managed by the public administration and intended for the use of citizens which is the second lowest amongst all the italian metropolitan cities istat 2016 pm10 deposition rates estimated in the mc of naples are considerably higher than those obtained in a previous study for ten metropolitan cities of italy manes et al 2016 indeed the current total pm10 deposition 1 148 30 mg has highlighted a four fold increase compared to the one observed in 2003 there are different determining factors which explain such discrepancy including the use of more recent and finer scale data for the lai estimation and the pm10 concentration our results are consistent with the findings from marando et al 2016 who run this model over the metropolitan city of rome which is about 4 5 times larger than the mc of naples and found that the pm10 removal is equal to about 5 573 mg per year nonetheless we could not find any research assessing the impact that events like a wildfire have on the delivery of this es pm10 removal efficiency showed considerable variations both seasonally and among the different fgs overall deciduous broadleaves proved to be the most efficient fg for pm10 removal in the vegetative period reaching its peak during summer 27 54 kg ha which mirrored the lai values however the contribution of this fg in the pm10 removal during the autumn is almost negligible while it is absent in winter that is the period in which this es is most needed as for the evergreen broadleaves their lai values drastically drop during autumn and winter and so does their pm10 removal efficiency finally seasonal removal efficiency of conifers is consistent throughout the year and comparable to the one found by fusaro et al 2017 this explains why the annual efficiency for conifers was indeed the highest among the three functional groups 68 94 kg ha this is in accordance with chen et al 2017 who observed that the needles of conifers are more efficient than broadleaves in adsorbing pm because of several factors including shape phenology and waxes on their surface our results suggest that summer was the season when most of the total pm10 removal occurred 515 30 mg 45 of total this finding is in accordance with a previous study conducted on pm10 removal efficiency by functional groups in the mc of rome marando et al 2016 the fact that the removal efficiency of conifers is higher in winter could be crucial for the improvement of the ugi network within the mc of naples indeed winter pm10 concentrations as well as other air pollutants such as nox and sox species are notoriously higher than in spring or summer months for a combination of factors ranging from emission sources emission of gaseous precursors to atmospheric conditions which include temperature relative humidity and predominant wind direction augustin et al 2020 coniferous species could therefore guarantee pm10 abatement when its benefits would be most needed by the local populations this study highlights the role of biodiversity since different leaf structural i e leaf area index and functional traits i e stomatal conductance as well as different life spans may contribute to the stability and efficiency of the regulating es delivered by ugi manes et al 2012 2016 however it is noteworthy that urban trees face adverse environmental conditions such as drought soil compaction and the presence of heavy metals mullaney et al 2015 that may affect the provision of ess besides urban vegetation can also provide the so called ecosystem disservices for instance urban trees may damage the street structure specifically the upper part of the asphalt or release a variety of allergenic pollen grains into the atmosphere generating health problems for the population velasco jiménez et al 2020 for these reasons policymakers should carefully select species to be adopted in a greening strategy paying attention to the benefits and challenges that each species provides from a monetary perspective the annual benefits generated by the es of pm10 removal is equal to eur 36 million clearly providing a measure of the actual benefits derived by the ugi furthermore this estimate can be used to actively promote the implementation of ugi and to remark the importance of the natural capital as a further indicator it could be adopted the monetary value per spatial unit which in this case is equal to approximately 31 000 euros per square kilometer per year and may be used to compare the trends of the adopted planning measures over the time it should be borne in mind that a comprehensive ess assessment should somehow be weighted according to the associated demand indeed in recent years an increasing number of studies is facing the challenge of quantifying both the ess supply that is the provision of ess and the ess demand in order to assess the ess mismatch and to define areas where the ugi and their related benefits should be enhanced baró et al 2015 furthermore it should be remarked that we analyzed a single es whereas the ugi exerts a multifunctional role by delivering a variety of ess concerning not only air quality but also the climate regulation and the esthetic value of nature maintaining certain fire regimes is crucial to habitat and ecosystem services however more often fire does not operate as a natural ecosystem process and exerts a negative impact on both the social and ecological systems moritz et al 2014 in this study the impact of the wildfire accounts for about 8 of the total value of this es which turns into a monetary loss of about eur 3 million per year this loss will last for several years as many as the natural vegetation requires to fully recover this event will also compromise other regulating ess such as the long term carbon storage moritz et al 2014 and is likely to lead to higher pm concentration which eventually turns into increased influenza in the following cold season landguth et al 2020 furthermore saracino et al 2019 pointed out that the vesuvius national park is crucial to maintain the socioeconomic system by delivering cultural ess for instance tourism which was inevitably damaged by this event generates significant incomes for the population at last further studies should also take into consideration the costs that will be faced to restore the area and to adopt further measures to prevent future wildfires the approach herein adopted is reliable cost effective and easily replicable and could be systematically included in urban planning strategies and natural capital accounting for this reason the use of freely available data which include remote sensing imagery and existing pollution modeling systems e g cams models alongside free and open source software is highly encouraged furthermore it also allows to biophysically quantify the loss of ess in response to disturbances such as wildfires this study can be intended as a preliminary step toward the inclusion of regulating ess in the urban planning process for the mc of naples indeed further studies are needed both to assess the ess supply and demand and to include other ess to perform a more comprehensive assessment in fact as reported by maragno et al 2018 and verhagen et al 2017 ignoring the ess demand may lead to misleading findings which result in an inefficient allocation of resources in terms of limitations of the present study it is known that the deposition velocity of pm10 varies according to factors such as temperature and wind speed mariraj mohan 2016 5 conclusion in this study we assessed the contribution that the ugi provides to improve the air quality in the mc of naples we conclude that the ugi removes about 1 148 mg of pm10 every year with a monetary benefit equal to eur 36 million the following points should be remarked i different functional groups of vegetation display a high variability in both overall and inter seasonal removal efficiency ii the provision of the es mostly occurs within large natural areas of the mc of naples whereas highly urbanized areas only rely on a limited amount of es iii ugi provides an important monetary benefit to the mc of naples which should serve as a reminder of the value of the natural capital iv the 2017 wildfire considerably affected the provision of the considered es its impact is likely to persist for several years at least until the vegetation s condition is restored the biophysical and economic value of the pm10 removal together with the maps showing its spatial distribution can support local managers and policymakers to develop urban planning strategies future studies could be oriented towards a more comprehensive assessment of the overall set of ess generated by ugi in urban ecosystems author statement alessandro sebastiani

24686,in size based stock assessment models the stochastic growth of individuals is expressed through a transition matrix representing the growth variability as probability of shift from one length class to another during a time period this process is important because it describes the changes in population size structure brought about by the increase in length or weight of organisms over time in this study four stochastic growth matrices were developed within an integrated catch at length assessment model iclam and the changes in the population dynamics and quantities relevant to fishery management of panopea globosa were analyzed the growth increments were estimated through von bertalanffy gompertz logistic and schnute models using a gamma probabilistic density function a corrected akaike information criterion was used to select the best performance among the four iclams the iclam associated with the von bertalanffy matrix was the best for describing the catch at length data providing conservative estimates on the condition of the stock while the iclam for the logistic matrix showed low performance exhibiting the highest estimates for all the components of population dynamics such as an increase of 75 3 in the recruitment and 58 5 in the total abundance with regard to the von bertalanffy matrix these differences emphasize the importance of determining a suitable stochastic growth matrix because it has serious implications in biasing stock assessments resulting in inadequate management strategies keywords stochastic growth matrix stock assessment population dynamics probabilistic density function 1 introduction growth is defined as the increase in the length or weight of an individual with time biologically it is recognized that growth is not constant throughout the life cycle of an individual higgins et al 2015 rather growth rate is variable and a high ontogenic plasticity is usually reported for different taxa pfister and stevens 2002 lorenzen 2016 in this way the growth rate may be an important determinant in the survival of individuals especially when mortality is length dependent several studies have demonstrated that fast growth has benefits in early stages allowing individuals to pass more quickly through the most vulnerable life history stages also a fast physical and physiological development allows improvements in the ability to detect and capture prey as well as predator avoidance thus large individuals may exhibit higher survival rates than small individuals rice et al 1993 zepeda benitez et al 2014 in stock assessment the individual growth is a fundamental process because many life history characteristics of the species tend to be reflected in how it grows e g long lived species tend to be relatively slow growing while short lived species tend to grow more quickly haddon 2011 these differences among species or even the changes in the size structure of a cohort of individuals through time can have important population level consequences due to individual growth being an important component of productivity it influences the recruitment of young individuals to the population thus as individuals grow they will be more quickly recruited to fisheries increasing the stock biomass vulnerable to fishing mathematically the growth pattern has been modeled from two main approaches using deterministic growth functions which are characterized by ignoring intrinsic biological variability and represent an average individual growth of organisms in the population sainsbury 1980 in deterministic models the growth variability is modeled assuming homoscedasticity in the variance represented by an additive or multiplicative error thus a unique estimate of variance is computed representing the growth variability of younger and older individuals jointly luquin covarrubias et al 2016b to provide a more flexible and biologically comprehensive representation of growth the deterministic growth models have been reformulated as stochastic differential equations thus a stochastic growth function can account explicitly for heterogeneity of growth within the population incorporating random variation in the length increments of individual to individual troynikov 1998 tovar avila et al 2009 according to sainsbury 1980 ignoring such heterogeneity can result in biased estimates of growth parameters stochastic growth models contain an allowance for unexplained effects represented by random variables thus they involve implicit assumptions about the response of individuals to fluctuations e g phenotypic variability and how these influence their growth rate a stochastic approach incorporates different probability density functions representing more realism concerning the complexity of the growth lv and pitchford 2007 for the genus panopea in the northeastern pacific ocean deterministic growth models have been used to explain the increments in shell length primarily growth studies of the geoduck were assumed to follow an asymptotic growth pattern characterized by an accelerated growth rate in the early stages of development which decreases gradually to attain the asymptotic length typical of the von bertalanffy growth model hoffman et al 2000 campbell and ming 2003 calderon aguilera et al 2010 by comparison in the northwest mexican pacific ocean the information theory approach was used this statistical procedure allowed the confrontation of different assumptions models and hypotheses concerning the individual growth of panopea spp cruz vásquez et al 2012 aragón noriega and rodríguez domínguez 2015 gonzález peláez et al 2015a hidalgo de la toba et al 2015 recently an alternative approach to the individual growth of panopea globosa was supported by the hypothesis of growth depensation explaining how the length at age variability increases with age luquin covarrubias et al 2016a even an integrated growth model was successfully implemented for p globosa including simultaneously two data sets shell length frequency data from individuals in rearing conditions representing early stages 1 68 days and shell length at age data for adult individuals aged 3 to 47 years by counting band growth in a thin section cut from the hinge plate region luquin covarrubias et al 2016b these studies exhibited different growth trajectories among the geoduck populations indicating a variable growth pattern usually in catch at length stock assessment models the growth is incorporated through a stochastic growth matrix estimating the probability of individuals growing from one length class to other larger length classes quinn and deriso 1999 haddon 2011 a common practice in stock assessment models e g catch at age or length models is to fit the stochastic von bertalanffy model to the data even if it is poorly informative of the growth pattern of the species studied lai and bradbury 1998 punt et al 2010 thus if the von bertalanffy growth parameters are not representative of the growth trajectory of individuals in the population the estimates related to the population dynamics and quantities needed for management might not be suitable this limitation has allowed the development of new alternatives for modeling stochastic growth within a growth matrix mainly for species exhibiting growth patterns different from the von bertalanffy trajectory thus suitable models to describe a variety of shapes and properties of growth such as the inverse logistic and gompertz growth models were individually developed however they were not incorporated into stock assessment models haddon et al 2008 helidoniotis et al 2011 dippold et al 2017 in this study an integrated catch at length assessment model was developed to analyze the changes in the population dynamics of p globosa incorporating four stochastic growth matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological and fishery dependent data biological and fishery dependent data for geoduck clam p globosa were obtained from puerto peñasco sonora in the upper gulf of california mexico during the 2010 fishing season a total of 4682 geoducks were collected the individuals were caught by hookah diving at a depth of 10 30 m and located by their siphon holes on the substrate they were subsequently removed using a low pressure compressor connected to a hose and a water jet was directed around the siphon to loosen the sediment the data sets used to analyze the population dynamics for p globosa were 1 commercial catch records obtained from the comisión nacional de acuacultura y pesca conapesca https www conapesca gob mx wb cona estadisticas de produccion pesquera and 2 biological data from a random sampling of commercial catches of p globosa landed by pangas small boats equipped with outboard motors and from 114 random sampling stations using a sampling unit of 50 m2 25 m 2 m transect the total shell length sl mm and total weight g were recorded the shell length classes between 78 and 200 mm were included in the population dynamics model using a shell length bin of 4 mm 2 2 integrated catch at length assessment model the integrated catch at length assessment model iclam describes the changes in the population dynamics of p globosa according to n l t n l t exp z l t where the relationship between n l t and n l t denotes the probability of geoducks at shell length class growing and surviving from a time period t to the next time period t and z l t is the total mortality of geoducks in shell length class l at time t representing the sum of fishing and natural mortality z l t f l t m l t traditionally continuous assessment models are based on catch time series and a relative abundance index describing the biological and fishery process of the population in term of biomass usually they ignore the size or age structure of the population and the estimates provided are expressed as mean values for the analyzed time series smith and addison 2003 comparatively iclam characterizes the population dynamics in terms of the number of individuals at length over time describing a linear transition of the number of individuals in the shell length class l at time t to the numbers in the shell length class l at time t this mathematical model defines the exploitation and growth of individuals in the population in terms of length and is formulated according to two basic relationships the first relates catch at length to abundance the second defines the changes in numbers at length from one time step to the next sullivan et al 1990 thus the basic equation to describe the population dynamics of geoduck is expressed as follows 1 n l t l n l 0 t l t r l t where n l 0 is a vector of shell length indicating the number at shell length of geoducks at the start of the time period t l t is the transition matrix that involves the product of the probabilities of geoducks surviving and growing from shell length class l at the start of the later time t and r l t represent the proportion of recruits into each shell length class l fig 1 2 3 initial conditions the number at shell length of geoducks at the start of the time period denotes the initial population abundance n 0 this was estimated as n 0 l n l 0 where n l 0 represents the number of geoducks in each shell length class l which was estimated as n l 0 c l 0 z l 0 f l 0 1 e z l 0 where c l 0 represents the number of geoducks caught in each shell length class l at time 0 and similar notation was used for total mortality z and fishing mortality f subsequently the proportion of geoducks in shell length class l p l was calculated as p l c l 0 z l 0 f l 0 1 e z l 0 c l 0 z l 0 f l 0 1 e z l 0 this procedure for estimating proportions allowed a simplification of the parameter space for estimating only one value of n l 0 through n l 0 p l n 0 instead of estimating a vector of n l 0 sullivan et al 1990 2 4 stochastic individual growth and survival individual growth and survival were modeled by using a transition matrix t l t integrated from a growth matrix g l l 1 and a survival matrix s l t mathematically matrix g l l 1 is expressed through a stochastic growth model that defines the probability of each individual growing from one shell length class to another over a time step the matrix s l t e z l t denotes the proportion of individuals surviving in the shell length class l at time t and is represented by the diagonal matrix thus the transition matrix is expressed as follows 2 t l t g 1 1 0 0 g 1 2 g 2 2 0 g 1 n g n 1 n g n n s 1 t 0 0 0 s 2 t 0 0 0 s n t the g l l 1 matrix requires estimation of mean growth increments δ l which assume shell length variability from individual to individual estimated by δ l l t 1 l t where l t 1 is the shell length of the individual at time t 1 and l t is the shell length of the individual at time t in this study the expected mean growth increments were estimated by applying four candidate growth models supporting a stochastic growth approach which are commonly used in the literature for growth modeling in mollusks crustaceans and echinoderms chen et al 2003 punt et al 1997 2009 helidoniotis et al 2011 helidoniotis and haddon 2013 lloyd jones et al 2014 dippold et al 2017 in this way the effects of the growth pattern on the population dynamics and management quantities of geoduck clam were analyzed by the following equations a the von bertalanffy stochastic growth matrix vbs defines an asymptotic curve characterized by an accelerated growth rate in the early stages of development that decreases gradually to attain the asymptotic length sullivan et al 1990 punt et al 2010 cao et al 2017a fisch et al 2019 3 δ l l l 1 e k b the re parameterized gompertz stochastic growth matrix gms exhibits an asymmetrical sigmoidal curve with a low inflection point and assumes that growth is not constant throughout the life cycle thus younger individuals exhibit faster growth than older individuals troynikov et al 1998 helidoniotis and haddon 2013 dippold et al 2017 4 δ l l l l e x p k l c the logistic stochastic growth matrix lgs describes a symmetrical sigmoidal curve the main difference from the gms is the position in the inflection point comparing the models the logistic model describes linear growth for young individuals while the gms and vbs assume rapid and slow growth in the early stages respectively the lgs denotes several growth possibilities which can be spread to maximum lengths allowing the description of both determinate and indeterminate growth haddon et al 2008 helidoniotis et al 2011 5 δ l m a x δ l 1 e x p l n 19 l l 50 l 95 l 50 d the schnute stochastic growth matrix scs was used assuming the parameters δ 0 γ 0 where δ represents a constant relative rate of relative growth rate and γ is the incremental relative rate of relative growth rate schnute 1981 scs is a general growth model with high flexibility describing a variety of growth patterns asymptotic linear and exponential including properties such as growth acceleration asymptotic limits and inflection points depending on the parameter values baker et al 1991 according to schnute 1981 if γ 1 then the model describes an asymptotic growth pattern that corresponds to the von bertalanffy shape 6 δ l l l γ e x p δ l γ 1 e x p δ 1 γ where δ l is the expected mean growth increment for shell length class l l represents the midlength of the shell length class l l is the asymptotic shell length where the mean growth increment is zero vbs gms and scs k represents the growth rate vbs and gms m a x δ l denote the maximum growth increment l 50 is the initial shell length that produces a growth increment of 0 5 times m a x δ l and l 95 is the initial shell length at 0 05 times m a x δ l lgs eq 5 uses l n 19 thus expressing a logistic curve if l n 19 is used then an inverse logistic curve could be modeled baker et al 1991 haddon et al 2008 helidoniotis et al 2011 to describe the variability in the mean growth increments the g l l 1 matrix was based on a gamma probabilistic density function with parameters α l and β g the gamma function defines the probability region where individuals may grow considering the probability that the increment in length does not occur and the individuals remain in their original length class haddon 2011 the probabilities of growth increments were estimated as follows 7 g δ l α l β g 1 β g α l γ α l δ l α l 1 e δ l β g where α l is the scale parameter β g is the shape parameter and γ is the gamma function for the α l parameter the mean change in length is δ l α l β g and the variance is σ γ 2 α l β g 2 the expected proportion of individuals growing from shell length class l to shell length class l 1 can be found by integrating over the shell length range l 1 1 l 1 2 which represent the lower and upper ends of shell length classes respectively quinn and deriso 1999 haddon 2011 8 g l l 1 l 1 1 l 1 2 g x α l β g dx 2 5 recruitment biologically recruitment represents the number of individuals in a particular age or length classes added to the exploitable stock in the fishing area sullivan et al 1990 myers 2002 in this study the recruitment to the fishery r l t was assumed to occur in the range of shell length classes between 80 and 130 mm because individuals larger than 130 mm are completely recruited and vulnerable to the fishery aragón noriega et al 2012 thus recruitment is separated as a time dependent variable r t corresponding to the annual recruitment and estimated as a parameter and a shell length dependent variable φ l representing the proportion of recruits associated with the shell length class l estimated through a gamma probabilistic density function similar to eq 7 with α r and β r parameters the equation for estimating recruitment at shell length was r l t r t φ l haddon 2011 2 6 fishing mortality and selectivity fishing mortality f l was estimated as a separable product of shell length selectivity s l and full recruitment fishing mortality rate f t as follows f l s l f t the separability assumption allows the estimation of a fishing mortality value which is distributed proportionally in the shell length classes improving the performance of the model parameterization fisch et al 2019 the estimation of the selectivity function was based on the following assumptions a it is restricted to an interval between 0 and 1 which defines the proportion of geoducks caught by a diver b given that the selectivity of geoduck is dependent on the ability of the diver to identify the siphon holes on the substrate a gamma probabilistic density function with α s β s parameters was assumed because it provides a high flexibility for modeling different shapes and c this procedure improves the efficiency of fit of the model to catch at length data and parameter estimation the gamma distribution function is based on the principle of geometric similarity which assumes that the selectivity is dependent only on the geoduck size relative to the ability of the diver to harvest them the selectivity function was expressed as follows s l l α s β s α s e x p α s l β s the parameterization was based on the residual sum of squares rsss function carlson and cortés 2003 9 r s s s i 1 n s l s o l 2 where s o l represents the observed relative selectivity at shell length l 2 7 management quantities the total abundance of p globosa expressed by n l t allowed the estimation of management quantities thus total t b l and vulnerable v b l biomass at length were estimated as follows 11 t b l i 1 n n l t ω l 12 v b l i 1 n n l t ω l s l where ω l is the expected total weight of geoduck in the shell length class l estimated through a statistical regression between shell length and total weight by fitting the power function ω l α l β where α is the intercept and β is the coefficient of allometry the goodness of fit was described using the determination coefficient r2 gonzález peláez et al 2015a 2 8 model predictions the iclam assumes that the number of individuals in the population of geoduck is associated with the expected catch at length c l t which was calculated using the baranov catch equation c l t n l t μ l t where the harvest rate μ l t is the proportion of geoducks dying because of fishing mortality relative to the total mortality expressed as f l t z l t 1 e z l t thus the differences between the observed and expected catch at length were fitted by minimizing a negative log likelihood function i n l punt 2003 numerical optimization was performed using the generalized reduced gradient grg algorithm contained in the visual basic applications 13 i n l i 0 5 l n σ γ 2 σ 2 c l t c l t 2 2 σ γ 2 σ 2 2 where σ γ 2 is the variance of the gamma probabilistic density function for each shell length class l estimated as σ γ 2 α l β g 2 and σ 2 was estimated as r s s n where r s s l t c l t c l t 2 and n is the number of shell length classes 2 9 parameter estimation integrated stock assessment models are more computationally intensive than traditional methods because there are usually more data and parameters therefore they require nonlinear parametric optimization rather than algebraic solutions given the complex nature of the integrated analyses it is difficult to determine whether reasonable estimates have been obtained and whether a local rather than the global solution has been found maunder and punt 2013 however several solutions have been proposed to solve these concerns some of the most common provided in the literature are 1 using multiple starting points to provide support for the global solution if all starting point result in the same answer 2 using more complex optimization algorithms or simulations 3 using a reparameterization process optimization phases to help convergence by removing elongation or curvature in the likelihood surface such procedures are widely accepted yielding plausible results moustahfid et al 2009 cao et al 2014 dichmont et al 2016 to avoid the stagnation in the iclam all these steps were carried out during the optimization process thus when the optimization phases was applied the parameters associated with the population dynamics of p globosa were estimated by repeated optimizations of the objective function i n l according to fournier et al 2012 dividing parameter estimation into a number of phases by using constraints is defined as model sculpting this statistical procedure was used to prevent the stagnation of the estimation scheme in a part of the parametric space that is not feasible allowing progressive improvement of the solution of i n l in each phase the objective function was optimized by estimating a subset of parameters thus the subset of parameters in each sequential phase increased until the last phase was completed in which all parameters were estimated simultaneously in this way five phases were gradually included in the numerical optimization process as follows 1 fishing mortality vector f t 2 number at length of geoducks at the beginning of time period n l 0 3 recruitment r t α r and β r 4 stochastic growth β g l k and 5 selectivity α s β s the selectivity parameters were estimated independently and subsequently incorporated in the total optimization as a final group legault and restrepo 1998 luquin covarrubias et al 2016b finally the natural mortality parameter m 0 046 was prespecified according to gonzález peláez et al 2015b the estimation of m was based on the number of gnomonic intervals determined by dividing the life history of the geoduck into a predetermined number of biological units life stages the advantage of this method is that it uses biological information of the lifespan to provide knowledge of the ontogenic changes in natural mortality a gnomonic interval is a systematic strategy for the unequal subdivision of the lifespan of an individual into time intervals which increase in duration and proportion for each time interval therefore in terms of elapsed time two gnomonic intervals in a subdivided life history can be considered equivalent if they each form the same constant proportion of the time elapsed caddy 1996 aranceta garza et al 2016 romero gallardo et al 2018 thus the natural mortality of p globosa was modeled as follows 1 egg to trochophore larvae 24 h 2 early larvae 6 5 days 3 late larvae 11 days 4 early juveniles 35 days 5 juveniles 3 9 months 6 late juveniles 1 2 years and 7 preadults to adults 3 47 years basically the fishery maintains high fishing pressure on biological unit 7 such that m 0 046 is a plausible value as was estimated by gonzález peláez et al 2015b 2 10 model selection model selection was based on the multimodel inference approach mmi the four stochastic growth matrices were associated to iclam iclamvbs iclamgms iclamlgs iclamscs and compared statistically using a small sample bias corrected form of the akaike information criterion aicc the condition bias corrected is defined if n θ i 40 the aicc estimator is described as follows burnham and anderson 2002 14 a i c c 2 i n l 2 θ i 2 θ i θ i 1 n θ i 1 where i n l is the negative log likelihood function θ i is the total number of estimated parameters from iclam and n is the number of observations shell length classes the smaller a i c c value indicated the best iclam akaike difference δ i was calculated as δ i a i c c i a i c c m i n and denotes the differences between the value of a i c c i for each candidate model and the model with the lowest value a i c c m i n according to burnham and anderson 2002 models with δ i 10 do not have statistical support and cannot be considered with 4 δ i 7 they have partial statistical support and with δ i 2 they have high statistical support finally the plausibility of each iclam was estimated using akaike weight w i katsanevakis 2006 15 w i exp 0 5 δ i i 1 4 exp 0 5 δ i 3 results 3 1 statistical fit to catch at length data iclam implemented to the four alternative stochastic growth matrices exhibited high statistical performance for fitting the observed catch at shell length data the objective functions based on negative log likelihood algorithm varied among 42 42 iclamvbs 43 19 iclamscs 55 56 iclamlgs and 58 26 iclamgms the four fits indicated a lower predominance of geoduck in the shell length classes between 80 and 104 mm and 188 200 mm while the shell length classes between 136 and 172 mm represented the highest number of individuals caught reaching the maximum catch at shell length for individuals of 156 mm although the iclam estimated similar parameters for the different stochastic growth matrices the population dynamics and management quantities had different estimates in magnitude and along shell length classes the main changes were observed in the growth recruitment fishing mortality abundance and total and vulnerable biomass table 1 fig 1a appendix a 3 2 stochastic growth for the four stochastic growth matrices used in this study different growth patterns were estimated fig 1b appendix b given that this procedure allowed estimation of the probability regions based on gamma distribution indicating growth from the shell length class l into a range of shell length classes then the representation of increment in shell length for each individual was shown beginning in the shell length class of 80 mm and ending at 200 mm for descriptive purposes the growth from the first shell length class 80 mm was estimated as follows a for the vbs growth matrix the increment showed that geoduck could grow between 92 and 112 mm sl within this range the most probable value 0 425 was for individuals of 104 mm sl b for the gms growth matrix the increment observed was wider than for vbs indicating that an individual would grow between 84 and 116 mm sl with a maximum probability 0 291 of 100 mm sl c for the lgs growth matrix the increment in shell length was wider and faster among all growth models analyzed with values between 104 and 136 mm sl and a shell length of 120 mm was the most probable 0 274 d for the scs growth matrix the narrowest change in shell length occurred between 84 and 104 mm and 96 mm was the most probable value 0 449 these changes in increment from each shell length class to another were also observed together with their respective probabilities for the four stochastic growth matrices implying a similar interpretation of the probability of growth for the shell length classes from 84 to 200 mm for the four stochastic growth matrices the probabilities of growth increment varied among length classes therefore large and small increments were observed along the shell length structure the largest increment was observed for the 80 mm shell length class in all growth matrices with values of 16 mm scs 20 mm gms 24 mm vbs and 40 mm lgs in comparison the smallest length increment l i was observed near the asymptotic shell length 200 mm mainly within the following range of shell length classes a vbs from 176 to 196 mm l i 4 mm b gms between 176 and 196 mm l i 8 mm c lgs from 128 to 196 mm l i 4 mm and d scs between 168 and 196 mm l i 4 mm among the analyzed growth matrices lgs showed a rapid growth in the smaller individuals in the population and a reduction in growth occurred from 132 mm sl where several geoducks had a high probability of remaining in the same shell length class and a low probability of growing to larger sizes this was also observed for the gms scs and vbs matrices however probabilities of remaining in the same shell length class were estimated in larger organisms of 180 mm 184 mm and 188 mm respectively once the stochastic growth matrices reached the asymptotic shell length 200 mm they all showed the greatest probability 1 indicating that the individuals remained in the same shell length class fig 1b appendix b 3 3 recruitment in the iclam recruitment represents the number of individuals at some shell length classes added to the exploitable stock in the fishing area thus the recruits were defined as the organisms within the shell length classes from 80 to 130 mm according to the implementation of each stochastic growth model recruitment was 2 27 106 individuals iclamvbs 2 55 106 individuals iclamgms 2 98 106 individuals iclamscs and 9 23 106 individuals iclamlgs thus the increase in the recruitment exhibited by iclamlgs represented a 75 37 regard to the recruitment estimated for iclamvbs comparatively the estimates of recruitment by shell length class showed that iclamscs estimated the maximum recruitment for the 88 mm shell length class 344 103 individuals iclamgms showed the maximum value 289 103 individuals for individuals of 96 mm while the maximum abundance of recruits for the iclamvbs 253 103 individuals and iclamlgs 981 103 individuals models occurred for the shell length class of 100 mm fig 2 a 3 4 fishing mortality fishing mortality at shell length showed variations due to the influence of the stochastic growth models the main change occurred in the shell length range from 152 to 184 mm sl which exhibited a gradual increase in the estimates of fishing mortality thus the maximum values in ascending order were 0 46 iclamvbs 0 57 iclamgms 0 58 iclamscs and 0 76 iclamlgs for the 168 mm shell length class conversely the lowest fishing mortality f 0 09 was found in two ranges of shell length classes from 80 to 148 mm and 188 200 mm in particular the individuals of 196 mm sl showed a slight increase in fishing mortality fig 2b 3 5 selectivity given that selectivity at shell length was estimated for only one fishing season the s l values were used equally for modeling iclam with all the different stochastic growth matrices thus the s l values were completely dependent on the number of geoducks caught in each shell length class l in general the selectivity showed the lowest values s l 0 06 for geoduck smaller than 128 mm sl subsequently a progressive increase in the selectivity was observed for the shell length classes between 132 and 176 mm within this range of shell length the probability of selection at 50 was determined for individuals of 152 mm sl finally the maximum selectivity was estimated for the individuals from 180 to 200 mm sl exhibiting a value of 1 3 6 management quantities 3 6 1 harvest rate the harvest rate at shell length showed changes due to the influence of the stochastic growth matrices the highest harvest rate occurred for individuals between 148 and 184 mm sl within this shell length range the maximum values were 0 39 iclamvbs 0 46 iclamgms iclamscs and 0 56 iclamlgs for individuals of 168 mm moreover a general trend of increase in the harvest rate was observed for individuals between 80 and 148 mm sl μ 0 08 in contrast a decrease in the harvest rate was observed for shell length classes between 184 and 200 mm exhibiting the lowest values μ 0 1 except the individuals of 196 mm sl which showed a slight increase in harvest rate fig 2c 3 6 2 abundance iclam associated to the stochastic growth hypotheses showed variations in the abundance at shell length estimates comparatively the iclamlgs exhibited highest abundance n 11 57 106 individuals while lower values were estimated for iclamscs n 6 92 106 iclamgms n 4 92 106 and iclamvbs n 4 80 106 these last two models exhibited similar abundances for all the shell length classes in this way the number of individuals estimated from the iclamlgs was 58 51 greater than the abundances computed from iclamvbs moreover there were differences in the most abundant shell length classes 96 120 mm iclamgms iclamscs 108 120 mm iclamvbs and 92 108 iclamlgs within these ranges the maximum values of total abundance were 353 103 iclamgms 325 103 iclamvbs 479 103 individuals iclamscs and 982 103 individuals iclamlgs notable differences in abundance were observed for the 80 mm shell length class in which the estimates were five times higher for iclamscs and iclamlgs than for iclamvbs and iclamgms finally similar trends in abundance were observed for the shell length classes between 148 and 200 mm fig 2d 3 6 3 total and vulnerable biomass the total biomass estimated including all shell length classes was 3463 t iclamgms 3579 t iclamvbs 4548 t iclamscs and 6856 t iclamlgs this last model exhibited a total biomass 49 48 greater than that from iclamgms similar trends in total biomass were observed for iclamgms iclamvbs and iclamscs they showed the highest values iclamgms 215 t iclamscs 281 t for the shell length class of 124 mm and iclamvbs 228 t for individuals of 128 mm in contrast the iclamlgs was noticeably different indicating higher levels of total biomass for the shell length classes of 80 140 mm within this range the individuals of 116 mm exhibited the maximum total biomass at shell length 540 t subsequently the trend in total biomass for iclamlgs decreased for the shell length classes of 144 200 mm to lower levels than those estimated by iclamvbs iclamgms and iclamscs fig 2e the estimates of vulnerable biomass at shell length also changed from 716 t iclamgms to 748 t iclamlgs 804 t iclamscs and 822 t iclamvbs the main difference observed in the vulnerable biomass was 106 t between iclamvbs and iclamgms although the vulnerable biomass among models showed a similar trend along the length structure the maximum estimates varied from 73 t iclamgms to 91 t iclamvbs for individuals of 156 mm 82 t iclamscs for individuals of 160 mm and 68 t iclamlgs for the shell length class of 152 mm the vulnerable biomass exhibited minimum values 18 t for the shell length classes smaller than 124 mm and larger than 184 mm fig 2f 3 7 model selection according to the aicc the population dynamics estimated from iclam using the von bertalanffy stochastic growth matrix was found to be the best showing the lowest value of a i c c 152 74 δ i 0 w i 0 85 the akaike differences revealed that the implementation of the schnute stochastic growth matrix was an alternative hypothesis within iclam with a i c c 157 11 δ i 3 54 w i 0 14 the gompertz and logistic stochastic growth matrices included into iclam had considerably less support with δ i 10 and akaike weights 0 001 therefore they were not good descriptors of the population dynamics table 2 4 discussion an important aspect in stock assessment is that the estimation of growth should be done within the model sullivan et al 1990 punt et al 2009 fisch et al 2019 before 1990 growth parameters were estimated outside the model and then the parameters estimated were introduced as fixed values in the stock assessment model while other population parameters were estimated when model and data were statistically confronted e g ssq likelihood theory this is known as a two step approach francis et al 2016 however the traditional two step procedure to stock assessment using fixed parameters was found to be unsatisfactory due to several limitations 1 information may be lost when data and parameters are obtained from unlinked submodels 2 the analyses used for obtaining the fixed parameters may be logically inconsistent 3 there may be difficulty in determining the appropriate likelihood function 4 there may be difficulty in fully accounting for uncertainty and 5 there may be reduced diagnostic ability maunder and punt 2013 in general when a parameter is pre specified based on auxiliary analyses or expert judgment the model can be mis specified setting the value of a parameter incorrectly often leads to biased assessment outcomes and therefore it can be very difficult to detect which parameters are specified incorrectly maunder and punt 2013 aires da silva et al 2015 iclam differs from the past practice of analyzing each data set separately and comparing the results e g growth this provides several advantages such as 1 ensuring consistency in assumptions among analyses and modeling approaches 2 using information from all data sources to identify the population state more adequately 3 representing the uncertainty associated with data sources to be expressed in the model outputs 4 allowing the error structure to be based on the statistical properties of the sampling process rather than on the assumed statistical properties of the fixed parameters and 5 integrating all of the data into one model makes it easier to investigate the sensitivity to each data set punt et al 2013 maunder and punt 2013 aires da silva et al 2015 stochastic growth matrices used in iclam represent the probabilities of shifting from one size class into another incorporating some measure of variation associated with each size class assuming that the negative growth is disregarded however when the fabens equation is implemented into a stochastic growth matrix the variability in the growth increments is normally distributed punt et al 1997 hillary 2011 siddeek et al 2016 according to lloyd jones et al 2014 this assumption could introduce the probability of negative growth this situation could be observed if any size class or classes were larger than the asymptotic length furthermore when any size class is close to the asymptotic length the symmetry of the normal distribution will allocate probabilities to size classes lower than the size class observed in the data set the effects of a misspecification in the probabilistic density function associated with the stochastic growth matrix have implications for the parameters estimated of the catch at length model in this study a gamma probabilistic density function was used and none of the four stochastic growth matrices estimated probabilities of negative growth when the individuals reached their asymptotic length showing a change in the shapes of the expected distributions as the individuals approached the asymptotic length this effect was very well observed for the lgs and scs growth matrices the lgs growth matrix changed the shape of the expected growth probabilities from 120 mm younger individuals while the scs growth matrix showed a change in the expected growth probabilities from 172 mm older individuals comparatively the vbs and gms growth matrices showed changes in probability shapes when both matrices were near to the asymptotic length approximately 180 mm below this size class the probability shapes for smaller individuals were similar to normal distributions this change in shape with shell length composition is because the flexibility of the gamma probabilistic density function represents the individual to individual growth variability in the population thus different growth patterns can be observed such as between small and large individuals or in situations where individual growth might or might not occur implying that individuals may stay in their original length class or move into larger classes haddon 2011 the effects of the different stochastic growth matrices associated with iclam were also observed on the population dynamics and management quantities in this study the iclamvbs was the best for describing the catch at length data while the iclamlgs showed the lowest performance the comparison among candidates iclam showed that the estimates of abundance and recruitment were different among length classes the iclamvbs estimated high abundance and recruitment for larger individuals 108 120 mm sl while iclamlgs estimated high abundance and recruits for smaller organisms 92 108 mm sl this effect can be explained by changes in the growth pattern reflected in the stochastic growth matrices where the vbs matrix showed changes in the probability of growth of larger individuals 180 mm while the lgs matrix exhibited changes in the growth of smaller individuals because to its low inflection point moreover the results showed that the iclamvbs estimated lower values of recruitment fishing mortality harvest rate and abundance compared to the other candidate models analyzed providing conservative estimates on the condition of the stock however notable differences were observed in the management quantities estimated by iclamvbs where the total biomass estimate was the second lowest after that by iclamgms but the vulnerable biomass was the highest an opposite effect was observed for iclamlgs which had the highest estimates for all the processes of population dynamics although the vulnerable biomass was the second lowest these differences emphasize the importance of determining an appropriate hypothesis on individual growth within size based stock assessment models a common practice in stock assessment models e g catch at age or length models is to choose by default the stochastic von bertalanffy model even if it is not the best model or has little or no support punt et al 2006 2009 cao et al 2017a cao et al 2017b fisch et al 2019 recently length structure stock assessment models were developed for p globosa in the gulf of california and mexican pacific ocean providing a novel method for stock assessment of the species these studies assumed that the growth pattern followed the traditional von bertalanffy growth function amezcua castro et al 2019 luquin covarrubias et al 2020 the current study based on an mmi approach indicated that the iclamvbs was the best for describing the catch at length data reflecting differences in the population dynamics of p globosa compared to the alternative iclam our results differ from those estimated by deterministic functions which have found that the logistic growth model was the most descriptive for p globosa in the study area aragón noriega et al 2015 these discrepancies strengthen the application of the mmi approach to the analysis of growth of p globosa within stock assessment models katsanevakis and maravelias 2008 emphasized that model selection is dependent not only on the species specific growth pattern but also on the quality of data set and the amount of available information an important aspect to consider is the analysis based on fishery dependent data because fishing mortality usually targets older and larger individuals and the younger and smaller are commonly absent this situation can cause a misspecification of the growth model which may not yield the best fit to the data consequently alternative models must be assessed against the data to estimate the growth pattern adequately haddon 2011 aragón noriega et al 2015 according to a i c c the iclamscs was also supported by the catch at length data with a percentage of evidence in favor of 14 in this case iclamvbs was not strongly supported as a clean winner with w i 90 when the data support more than one model there is some degree of uncertainty in model selection katsanevakis and maravelias 2008 indicated that when there is uncertainty in model selection the choice of the second best model may be dependent on the first this condition is supported by our results iclamscs is a general growth model that contains most of the other growth models as special cases including an asymptotic curve such as that shown by iclamvbs in contrast the iclamgms and iclamlgs exhibited considerably less statistical support characterized by sigmoidal curves with inflection points that indicated acceleration and deceleration in the growth rate assuming that growth is not constant throughout the life cycle the methodological proposal applied to the growth matrix incorporating different growth patterns was designed specifically to be used in catch at size stock assessment models this feature was especially relevant in this paper given that several reasonable hypotheses related to stochastic individual growth can be modeled highlighting the role that this may have on population dynamics and management quantities helidoniotis and haddon 2013 analyzed the effects and implications of the choice of growth model for fishery management for example the gompertz model implies slower initial growth which would imply lower productivity while the von bertalanffy model would indicate more rapid initial growth suggesting that the stock is more productive in this paper the estimated stochastic growth patterns are biologically likely showing changes in variance σ γ 2 of the growth increment these were estimated from a gamma probabilistic density function for each shell length class increasing the realism of the growth pattern commonly observed in nature and avoiding assumptions of constant growth increments for all shell length classes which is not real although it is widespread in the literature quinn and deriso 1999 analytically this study showed that the choice of stochastic growth model could have impacts on the magnitudes of recruitment fishing mortality and total and vulnerable biomass and could have potentially serious implications in biasing fishery stock assessment resulting in inadequate management strategies such as overprotecting spawning stock when the stock is healthy or the implementation of policy decisions of high risk when the stock status is inadvertently deteriorating lv and pitchford 2007 punt et al 2009 giacomini et al 2016 the main advantage of the catch at length models is that they do not incorporate equilibrium assumptions and that the growth of individuals is modeled assuming stochasticity providing biological realism to the stock assessment in the last 30 years reports of advances in the implementation of size transition matrices into stock assessment models are limited table 3 and the main contributions have been focused on the incorporation of several probabilistic density functions the literature also shows the application of new statistical proposals to increase the performance of objective functions even recently a bayesian approach was successfully implemented into size transition matrices these approaches improved the biological assumptions depending on the population studied e g molt in crustaceans punt et al 2009 siddeek et al 2016 comparatively this study analyzes the effect of changes in the growth assumptions on a catch at length model in this sense iclam is a flexible stock assessment model that includes four candidate stochastic growth matrices and they can be readily implemented and updated for estimating the parameters in the iclam the objective function based on a negative log likelihood function allows identification of the best model using information theory this procedure is relevant because each candidate stochastic growth matrix influences the population dynamics and can change it dramatically 5 conclusions the iclam used in this study was able to evaluate recruitment selectivity harvest rate abundance and total and vulnerable biomass associated to four stochastic growth matrices which had not been evaluated in previous stock assessment models we demonstrated that integrating alternative stochastic growth matrices in the stock assessment allows the estimation of probability regions indicating the growth variability of p globosa from different growth shapes this provides greater biological realism to describe the population condition such as represents the changes along the length structure or the identification of the possible impacts in the population our modeling approach can be applied to stock assessment of other species exploited commercially and disclose most appropriate sceneries on the population dynamics and management quantities according to growth pattern associated to the

24686,in size based stock assessment models the stochastic growth of individuals is expressed through a transition matrix representing the growth variability as probability of shift from one length class to another during a time period this process is important because it describes the changes in population size structure brought about by the increase in length or weight of organisms over time in this study four stochastic growth matrices were developed within an integrated catch at length assessment model iclam and the changes in the population dynamics and quantities relevant to fishery management of panopea globosa were analyzed the growth increments were estimated through von bertalanffy gompertz logistic and schnute models using a gamma probabilistic density function a corrected akaike information criterion was used to select the best performance among the four iclams the iclam associated with the von bertalanffy matrix was the best for describing the catch at length data providing conservative estimates on the condition of the stock while the iclam for the logistic matrix showed low performance exhibiting the highest estimates for all the components of population dynamics such as an increase of 75 3 in the recruitment and 58 5 in the total abundance with regard to the von bertalanffy matrix these differences emphasize the importance of determining a suitable stochastic growth matrix because it has serious implications in biasing stock assessments resulting in inadequate management strategies keywords stochastic growth matrix stock assessment population dynamics probabilistic density function 1 introduction growth is defined as the increase in the length or weight of an individual with time biologically it is recognized that growth is not constant throughout the life cycle of an individual higgins et al 2015 rather growth rate is variable and a high ontogenic plasticity is usually reported for different taxa pfister and stevens 2002 lorenzen 2016 in this way the growth rate may be an important determinant in the survival of individuals especially when mortality is length dependent several studies have demonstrated that fast growth has benefits in early stages allowing individuals to pass more quickly through the most vulnerable life history stages also a fast physical and physiological development allows improvements in the ability to detect and capture prey as well as predator avoidance thus large individuals may exhibit higher survival rates than small individuals rice et al 1993 zepeda benitez et al 2014 in stock assessment the individual growth is a fundamental process because many life history characteristics of the species tend to be reflected in how it grows e g long lived species tend to be relatively slow growing while short lived species tend to grow more quickly haddon 2011 these differences among species or even the changes in the size structure of a cohort of individuals through time can have important population level consequences due to individual growth being an important component of productivity it influences the recruitment of young individuals to the population thus as individuals grow they will be more quickly recruited to fisheries increasing the stock biomass vulnerable to fishing mathematically the growth pattern has been modeled from two main approaches using deterministic growth functions which are characterized by ignoring intrinsic biological variability and represent an average individual growth of organisms in the population sainsbury 1980 in deterministic models the growth variability is modeled assuming homoscedasticity in the variance represented by an additive or multiplicative error thus a unique estimate of variance is computed representing the growth variability of younger and older individuals jointly luquin covarrubias et al 2016b to provide a more flexible and biologically comprehensive representation of growth the deterministic growth models have been reformulated as stochastic differential equations thus a stochastic growth function can account explicitly for heterogeneity of growth within the population incorporating random variation in the length increments of individual to individual troynikov 1998 tovar avila et al 2009 according to sainsbury 1980 ignoring such heterogeneity can result in biased estimates of growth parameters stochastic growth models contain an allowance for unexplained effects represented by random variables thus they involve implicit assumptions about the response of individuals to fluctuations e g phenotypic variability and how these influence their growth rate a stochastic approach incorporates different probability density functions representing more realism concerning the complexity of the growth lv and pitchford 2007 for the genus panopea in the northeastern pacific ocean deterministic growth models have been used to explain the increments in shell length primarily growth studies of the geoduck were assumed to follow an asymptotic growth pattern characterized by an accelerated growth rate in the early stages of development which decreases gradually to attain the asymptotic length typical of the von bertalanffy growth model hoffman et al 2000 campbell and ming 2003 calderon aguilera et al 2010 by comparison in the northwest mexican pacific ocean the information theory approach was used this statistical procedure allowed the confrontation of different assumptions models and hypotheses concerning the individual growth of panopea spp cruz vásquez et al 2012 aragón noriega and rodríguez domínguez 2015 gonzález peláez et al 2015a hidalgo de la toba et al 2015 recently an alternative approach to the individual growth of panopea globosa was supported by the hypothesis of growth depensation explaining how the length at age variability increases with age luquin covarrubias et al 2016a even an integrated growth model was successfully implemented for p globosa including simultaneously two data sets shell length frequency data from individuals in rearing conditions representing early stages 1 68 days and shell length at age data for adult individuals aged 3 to 47 years by counting band growth in a thin section cut from the hinge plate region luquin covarrubias et al 2016b these studies exhibited different growth trajectories among the geoduck populations indicating a variable growth pattern usually in catch at length stock assessment models the growth is incorporated through a stochastic growth matrix estimating the probability of individuals growing from one length class to other larger length classes quinn and deriso 1999 haddon 2011 a common practice in stock assessment models e g catch at age or length models is to fit the stochastic von bertalanffy model to the data even if it is poorly informative of the growth pattern of the species studied lai and bradbury 1998 punt et al 2010 thus if the von bertalanffy growth parameters are not representative of the growth trajectory of individuals in the population the estimates related to the population dynamics and quantities needed for management might not be suitable this limitation has allowed the development of new alternatives for modeling stochastic growth within a growth matrix mainly for species exhibiting growth patterns different from the von bertalanffy trajectory thus suitable models to describe a variety of shapes and properties of growth such as the inverse logistic and gompertz growth models were individually developed however they were not incorporated into stock assessment models haddon et al 2008 helidoniotis et al 2011 dippold et al 2017 in this study an integrated catch at length assessment model was developed to analyze the changes in the population dynamics of p globosa incorporating four stochastic growth matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological and fishery dependent data biological and fishery dependent data for geoduck clam p globosa were obtained from puerto peñasco sonora in the upper gulf of california mexico during the 2010 fishing season a total of 4682 geoducks were collected the individuals were caught by hookah diving at a depth of 10 30 m and located by their siphon holes on the substrate they were subsequently removed using a low pressure compressor connected to a hose and a water jet was directed around the siphon to loosen the sediment the data sets used to analyze the population dynamics for p globosa were 1 commercial catch records obtained from the comisión nacional de acuacultura y pesca conapesca https www conapesca gob mx wb cona estadisticas de produccion pesquera and 2 biological data from a random sampling of commercial catches of p globosa landed by pangas small boats equipped with outboard motors and from 114 random sampling stations using a sampling unit of 50 m2 25 m 2 m transect the total shell length sl mm and total weight g were recorded the shell length classes between 78 and 200 mm were included in the population dynamics model using a shell length bin of 4 mm 2 2 integrated catch at length assessment model the integrated catch at length assessment model iclam describes the changes in the population dynamics of p globosa according to n l t n l t exp z l t where the relationship between n l t and n l t denotes the probability of geoducks at shell length class growing and surviving from a time period t to the next time period t and z l t is the total mortality of geoducks in shell length class l at time t representing the sum of fishing and natural mortality z l t f l t m l t traditionally continuous assessment models are based on catch time series and a relative abundance index describing the biological and fishery process of the population in term of biomass usually they ignore the size or age structure of the population and the estimates provided are expressed as mean values for the analyzed time series smith and addison 2003 comparatively iclam characterizes the population dynamics in terms of the number of individuals at length over time describing a linear transition of the number of individuals in the shell length class l at time t to the numbers in the shell length class l at time t this mathematical model defines the exploitation and growth of individuals in the population in terms of length and is formulated according to two basic relationships the first relates catch at length to abundance the second defines the changes in numbers at length from one time step to the next sullivan et al 1990 thus the basic equation to describe the population dynamics of geoduck is expressed as follows 1 n l t l n l 0 t l t r l t where n l 0 is a vector of shell length indicating the number at shell length of geoducks at the start of the time period t l t is the transition matrix that involves the product of the probabilities of geoducks surviving and growing from shell length class l at the start of the later time t and r l t represent the proportion of recruits into each shell length class l fig 1 2 3 initial conditions the number at shell length of geoducks at the start of the time period denotes the initial population abundance n 0 this was estimated as n 0 l n l 0 where n l 0 represents the number of geoducks in each shell length class l which was estimated as n l 0 c l 0 z l 0 f l 0 1 e z l 0 where c l 0 represents the number of geoducks caught in each shell length class l at time 0 and similar notation was used for total mortality z and fishing mortality f subsequently the proportion of geoducks in shell length class l p l was calculated as p l c l 0 z l 0 f l 0 1 e z l 0 c l 0 z l 0 f l 0 1 e z l 0 this procedure for estimating proportions allowed a simplification of the parameter space for estimating only one value of n l 0 through n l 0 p l n 0 instead of estimating a vector of n l 0 sullivan et al 1990 2 4 stochastic individual growth and survival individual growth and survival were modeled by using a transition matrix t l t integrated from a growth matrix g l l 1 and a survival matrix s l t mathematically matrix g l l 1 is expressed through a stochastic growth model that defines the probability of each individual growing from one shell length class to another over a time step the matrix s l t e z l t denotes the proportion of individuals surviving in the shell length class l at time t and is represented by the diagonal matrix thus the transition matrix is expressed as follows 2 t l t g 1 1 0 0 g 1 2 g 2 2 0 g 1 n g n 1 n g n n s 1 t 0 0 0 s 2 t 0 0 0 s n t the g l l 1 matrix requires estimation of mean growth increments δ l which assume shell length variability from individual to individual estimated by δ l l t 1 l t where l t 1 is the shell length of the individual at time t 1 and l t is the shell length of the individual at time t in this study the expected mean growth increments were estimated by applying four candidate growth models supporting a stochastic growth approach which are commonly used in the literature for growth modeling in mollusks crustaceans and echinoderms chen et al 2003 punt et al 1997 2009 helidoniotis et al 2011 helidoniotis and haddon 2013 lloyd jones et al 2014 dippold et al 2017 in this way the effects of the growth pattern on the population dynamics and management quantities of geoduck clam were analyzed by the following equations a the von bertalanffy stochastic growth matrix vbs defines an asymptotic curve characterized by an accelerated growth rate in the early stages of development that decreases gradually to attain the asymptotic length sullivan et al 1990 punt et al 2010 cao et al 2017a fisch et al 2019 3 δ l l l 1 e k b the re parameterized gompertz stochastic growth matrix gms exhibits an asymmetrical sigmoidal curve with a low inflection point and assumes that growth is not constant throughout the life cycle thus younger individuals exhibit faster growth than older individuals troynikov et al 1998 helidoniotis and haddon 2013 dippold et al 2017 4 δ l l l l e x p k l c the logistic stochastic growth matrix lgs describes a symmetrical sigmoidal curve the main difference from the gms is the position in the inflection point comparing the models the logistic model describes linear growth for young individuals while the gms and vbs assume rapid and slow growth in the early stages respectively the lgs denotes several growth possibilities which can be spread to maximum lengths allowing the description of both determinate and indeterminate growth haddon et al 2008 helidoniotis et al 2011 5 δ l m a x δ l 1 e x p l n 19 l l 50 l 95 l 50 d the schnute stochastic growth matrix scs was used assuming the parameters δ 0 γ 0 where δ represents a constant relative rate of relative growth rate and γ is the incremental relative rate of relative growth rate schnute 1981 scs is a general growth model with high flexibility describing a variety of growth patterns asymptotic linear and exponential including properties such as growth acceleration asymptotic limits and inflection points depending on the parameter values baker et al 1991 according to schnute 1981 if γ 1 then the model describes an asymptotic growth pattern that corresponds to the von bertalanffy shape 6 δ l l l γ e x p δ l γ 1 e x p δ 1 γ where δ l is the expected mean growth increment for shell length class l l represents the midlength of the shell length class l l is the asymptotic shell length where the mean growth increment is zero vbs gms and scs k represents the growth rate vbs and gms m a x δ l denote the maximum growth increment l 50 is the initial shell length that produces a growth increment of 0 5 times m a x δ l and l 95 is the initial shell length at 0 05 times m a x δ l lgs eq 5 uses l n 19 thus expressing a logistic curve if l n 19 is used then an inverse logistic curve could be modeled baker et al 1991 haddon et al 2008 helidoniotis et al 2011 to describe the variability in the mean growth increments the g l l 1 matrix was based on a gamma probabilistic density function with parameters α l and β g the gamma function defines the probability region where individuals may grow considering the probability that the increment in length does not occur and the individuals remain in their original length class haddon 2011 the probabilities of growth increments were estimated as follows 7 g δ l α l β g 1 β g α l γ α l δ l α l 1 e δ l β g where α l is the scale parameter β g is the shape parameter and γ is the gamma function for the α l parameter the mean change in length is δ l α l β g and the variance is σ γ 2 α l β g 2 the expected proportion of individuals growing from shell length class l to shell length class l 1 can be found by integrating over the shell length range l 1 1 l 1 2 which represent the lower and upper ends of shell length classes respectively quinn and deriso 1999 haddon 2011 8 g l l 1 l 1 1 l 1 2 g x α l β g dx 2 5 recruitment biologically recruitment represents the number of individuals in a particular age or length classes added to the exploitable stock in the fishing area sullivan et al 1990 myers 2002 in this study the recruitment to the fishery r l t was assumed to occur in the range of shell length classes between 80 and 130 mm because individuals larger than 130 mm are completely recruited and vulnerable to the fishery aragón noriega et al 2012 thus recruitment is separated as a time dependent variable r t corresponding to the annual recruitment and estimated as a parameter and a shell length dependent variable φ l representing the proportion of recruits associated with the shell length class l estimated through a gamma probabilistic density function similar to eq 7 with α r and β r parameters the equation for estimating recruitment at shell length was r l t r t φ l haddon 2011 2 6 fishing mortality and selectivity fishing mortality f l was estimated as a separable product of shell length selectivity s l and full recruitment fishing mortality rate f t as follows f l s l f t the separability assumption allows the estimation of a fishing mortality value which is distributed proportionally in the shell length classes improving the performance of the model parameterization fisch et al 2019 the estimation of the selectivity function was based on the following assumptions a it is restricted to an interval between 0 and 1 which defines the proportion of geoducks caught by a diver b given that the selectivity of geoduck is dependent on the ability of the diver to identify the siphon holes on the substrate a gamma probabilistic density function with α s β s parameters was assumed because it provides a high flexibility for modeling different shapes and c this procedure improves the efficiency of fit of the model to catch at length data and parameter estimation the gamma distribution function is based on the principle of geometric similarity which assumes that the selectivity is dependent only on the geoduck size relative to the ability of the diver to harvest them the selectivity function was expressed as follows s l l α s β s α s e x p α s l β s the parameterization was based on the residual sum of squares rsss function carlson and cortés 2003 9 r s s s i 1 n s l s o l 2 where s o l represents the observed relative selectivity at shell length l 2 7 management quantities the total abundance of p globosa expressed by n l t allowed the estimation of management quantities thus total t b l and vulnerable v b l biomass at length were estimated as follows 11 t b l i 1 n n l t ω l 12 v b l i 1 n n l t ω l s l where ω l is the expected total weight of geoduck in the shell length class l estimated through a statistical regression between shell length and total weight by fitting the power function ω l α l β where α is the intercept and β is the coefficient of allometry the goodness of fit was described using the determination coefficient r2 gonzález peláez et al 2015a 2 8 model predictions the iclam assumes that the number of individuals in the population of geoduck is associated with the expected catch at length c l t which was calculated using the baranov catch equation c l t n l t μ l t where the harvest rate μ l t is the proportion of geoducks dying because of fishing mortality relative to the total mortality expressed as f l t z l t 1 e z l t thus the differences between the observed and expected catch at length were fitted by minimizing a negative log likelihood function i n l punt 2003 numerical optimization was performed using the generalized reduced gradient grg algorithm contained in the visual basic applications 13 i n l i 0 5 l n σ γ 2 σ 2 c l t c l t 2 2 σ γ 2 σ 2 2 where σ γ 2 is the variance of the gamma probabilistic density function for each shell length class l estimated as σ γ 2 α l β g 2 and σ 2 was estimated as r s s n where r s s l t c l t c l t 2 and n is the number of shell length classes 2 9 parameter estimation integrated stock assessment models are more computationally intensive than traditional methods because there are usually more data and parameters therefore they require nonlinear parametric optimization rather than algebraic solutions given the complex nature of the integrated analyses it is difficult to determine whether reasonable estimates have been obtained and whether a local rather than the global solution has been found maunder and punt 2013 however several solutions have been proposed to solve these concerns some of the most common provided in the literature are 1 using multiple starting points to provide support for the global solution if all starting point result in the same answer 2 using more complex optimization algorithms or simulations 3 using a reparameterization process optimization phases to help convergence by removing elongation or curvature in the likelihood surface such procedures are widely accepted yielding plausible results moustahfid et al 2009 cao et al 2014 dichmont et al 2016 to avoid the stagnation in the iclam all these steps were carried out during the optimization process thus when the optimization phases was applied the parameters associated with the population dynamics of p globosa were estimated by repeated optimizations of the objective function i n l according to fournier et al 2012 dividing parameter estimation into a number of phases by using constraints is defined as model sculpting this statistical procedure was used to prevent the stagnation of the estimation scheme in a part of the parametric space that is not feasible allowing progressive improvement of the solution of i n l in each phase the objective function was optimized by estimating a subset of parameters thus the subset of parameters in each sequential phase increased until the last phase was completed in which all parameters were estimated simultaneously in this way five phases were gradually included in the numerical optimization process as follows 1 fishing mortality vector f t 2 number at length of geoducks at the beginning of time period n l 0 3 recruitment r t α r and β r 4 stochastic growth β g l k and 5 selectivity α s β s the selectivity parameters were estimated independently and subsequently incorporated in the total optimization as a final group legault and restrepo 1998 luquin covarrubias et al 2016b finally the natural mortality parameter m 0 046 was prespecified according to gonzález peláez et al 2015b the estimation of m was based on the number of gnomonic intervals determined by dividing the life history of the geoduck into a predetermined number of biological units life stages the advantage of this method is that it uses biological information of the lifespan to provide knowledge of the ontogenic changes in natural mortality a gnomonic interval is a systematic strategy for the unequal subdivision of the lifespan of an individual into time intervals which increase in duration and proportion for each time interval therefore in terms of elapsed time two gnomonic intervals in a subdivided life history can be considered equivalent if they each form the same constant proportion of the time elapsed caddy 1996 aranceta garza et al 2016 romero gallardo et al 2018 thus the natural mortality of p globosa was modeled as follows 1 egg to trochophore larvae 24 h 2 early larvae 6 5 days 3 late larvae 11 days 4 early juveniles 35 days 5 juveniles 3 9 months 6 late juveniles 1 2 years and 7 preadults to adults 3 47 years basically the fishery maintains high fishing pressure on biological unit 7 such that m 0 046 is a plausible value as was estimated by gonzález peláez et al 2015b 2 10 model selection model selection was based on the multimodel inference approach mmi the four stochastic growth matrices were associated to iclam iclamvbs iclamgms iclamlgs iclamscs and compared statistically using a small sample bias corrected form of the akaike information criterion aicc the condition bias corrected is defined if n θ i 40 the aicc estimator is described as follows burnham and anderson 2002 14 a i c c 2 i n l 2 θ i 2 θ i θ i 1 n θ i 1 where i n l is the negative log likelihood function θ i is the total number of estimated parameters from iclam and n is the number of observations shell length classes the smaller a i c c value indicated the best iclam akaike difference δ i was calculated as δ i a i c c i a i c c m i n and denotes the differences between the value of a i c c i for each candidate model and the model with the lowest value a i c c m i n according to burnham and anderson 2002 models with δ i 10 do not have statistical support and cannot be considered with 4 δ i 7 they have partial statistical support and with δ i 2 they have high statistical support finally the plausibility of each iclam was estimated using akaike weight w i katsanevakis 2006 15 w i exp 0 5 δ i i 1 4 exp 0 5 δ i 3 results 3 1 statistical fit to catch at length data iclam implemented to the four alternative stochastic growth matrices exhibited high statistical performance for fitting the observed catch at shell length data the objective functions based on negative log likelihood algorithm varied among 42 42 iclamvbs 43 19 iclamscs 55 56 iclamlgs and 58 26 iclamgms the four fits indicated a lower predominance of geoduck in the shell length classes between 80 and 104 mm and 188 200 mm while the shell length classes between 136 and 172 mm represented the highest number of individuals caught reaching the maximum catch at shell length for individuals of 156 mm although the iclam estimated similar parameters for the different stochastic growth matrices the population dynamics and management quantities had different estimates in magnitude and along shell length classes the main changes were observed in the growth recruitment fishing mortality abundance and total and vulnerable biomass table 1 fig 1a appendix a 3 2 stochastic growth for the four stochastic growth matrices used in this study different growth patterns were estimated fig 1b appendix b given that this procedure allowed estimation of the probability regions based on gamma distribution indicating growth from the shell length class l into a range of shell length classes then the representation of increment in shell length for each individual was shown beginning in the shell length class of 80 mm and ending at 200 mm for descriptive purposes the growth from the first shell length class 80 mm was estimated as follows a for the vbs growth matrix the increment showed that geoduck could grow between 92 and 112 mm sl within this range the most probable value 0 425 was for individuals of 104 mm sl b for the gms growth matrix the increment observed was wider than for vbs indicating that an individual would grow between 84 and 116 mm sl with a maximum probability 0 291 of 100 mm sl c for the lgs growth matrix the increment in shell length was wider and faster among all growth models analyzed with values between 104 and 136 mm sl and a shell length of 120 mm was the most probable 0 274 d for the scs growth matrix the narrowest change in shell length occurred between 84 and 104 mm and 96 mm was the most probable value 0 449 these changes in increment from each shell length class to another were also observed together with their respective probabilities for the four stochastic growth matrices implying a similar interpretation of the probability of growth for the shell length classes from 84 to 200 mm for the four stochastic growth matrices the probabilities of growth increment varied among length classes therefore large and small increments were observed along the shell length structure the largest increment was observed for the 80 mm shell length class in all growth matrices with values of 16 mm scs 20 mm gms 24 mm vbs and 40 mm lgs in comparison the smallest length increment l i was observed near the asymptotic shell length 200 mm mainly within the following range of shell length classes a vbs from 176 to 196 mm l i 4 mm b gms between 176 and 196 mm l i 8 mm c lgs from 128 to 196 mm l i 4 mm and d scs between 168 and 196 mm l i 4 mm among the analyzed growth matrices lgs showed a rapid growth in the smaller individuals in the population and a reduction in growth occurred from 132 mm sl where several geoducks had a high probability of remaining in the same shell length class and a low probability of growing to larger sizes this was also observed for the gms scs and vbs matrices however probabilities of remaining in the same shell length class were estimated in larger organisms of 180 mm 184 mm and 188 mm respectively once the stochastic growth matrices reached the asymptotic shell length 200 mm they all showed the greatest probability 1 indicating that the individuals remained in the same shell length class fig 1b appendix b 3 3 recruitment in the iclam recruitment represents the number of individuals at some shell length classes added to the exploitable stock in the fishing area thus the recruits were defined as the organisms within the shell length classes from 80 to 130 mm according to the implementation of each stochastic growth model recruitment was 2 27 106 individuals iclamvbs 2 55 106 individuals iclamgms 2 98 106 individuals iclamscs and 9 23 106 individuals iclamlgs thus the increase in the recruitment exhibited by iclamlgs represented a 75 37 regard to the recruitment estimated for iclamvbs comparatively the estimates of recruitment by shell length class showed that iclamscs estimated the maximum recruitment for the 88 mm shell length class 344 103 individuals iclamgms showed the maximum value 289 103 individuals for individuals of 96 mm while the maximum abundance of recruits for the iclamvbs 253 103 individuals and iclamlgs 981 103 individuals models occurred for the shell length class of 100 mm fig 2 a 3 4 fishing mortality fishing mortality at shell length showed variations due to the influence of the stochastic growth models the main change occurred in the shell length range from 152 to 184 mm sl which exhibited a gradual increase in the estimates of fishing mortality thus the maximum values in ascending order were 0 46 iclamvbs 0 57 iclamgms 0 58 iclamscs and 0 76 iclamlgs for the 168 mm shell length class conversely the lowest fishing mortality f 0 09 was found in two ranges of shell length classes from 80 to 148 mm and 188 200 mm in particular the individuals of 196 mm sl showed a slight increase in fishing mortality fig 2b 3 5 selectivity given that selectivity at shell length was estimated for only one fishing season the s l values were used equally for modeling iclam with all the different stochastic growth matrices thus the s l values were completely dependent on the number of geoducks caught in each shell length class l in general the selectivity showed the lowest values s l 0 06 for geoduck smaller than 128 mm sl subsequently a progressive increase in the selectivity was observed for the shell length classes between 132 and 176 mm within this range of shell length the probability of selection at 50 was determined for individuals of 152 mm sl finally the maximum selectivity was estimated for the individuals from 180 to 200 mm sl exhibiting a value of 1 3 6 management quantities 3 6 1 harvest rate the harvest rate at shell length showed changes due to the influence of the stochastic growth matrices the highest harvest rate occurred for individuals between 148 and 184 mm sl within this shell length range the maximum values were 0 39 iclamvbs 0 46 iclamgms iclamscs and 0 56 iclamlgs for individuals of 168 mm moreover a general trend of increase in the harvest rate was observed for individuals between 80 and 148 mm sl μ 0 08 in contrast a decrease in the harvest rate was observed for shell length classes between 184 and 200 mm exhibiting the lowest values μ 0 1 except the individuals of 196 mm sl which showed a slight increase in harvest rate fig 2c 3 6 2 abundance iclam associated to the stochastic growth hypotheses showed variations in the abundance at shell length estimates comparatively the iclamlgs exhibited highest abundance n 11 57 106 individuals while lower values were estimated for iclamscs n 6 92 106 iclamgms n 4 92 106 and iclamvbs n 4 80 106 these last two models exhibited similar abundances for all the shell length classes in this way the number of individuals estimated from the iclamlgs was 58 51 greater than the abundances computed from iclamvbs moreover there were differences in the most abundant shell length classes 96 120 mm iclamgms iclamscs 108 120 mm iclamvbs and 92 108 iclamlgs within these ranges the maximum values of total abundance were 353 103 iclamgms 325 103 iclamvbs 479 103 individuals iclamscs and 982 103 individuals iclamlgs notable differences in abundance were observed for the 80 mm shell length class in which the estimates were five times higher for iclamscs and iclamlgs than for iclamvbs and iclamgms finally similar trends in abundance were observed for the shell length classes between 148 and 200 mm fig 2d 3 6 3 total and vulnerable biomass the total biomass estimated including all shell length classes was 3463 t iclamgms 3579 t iclamvbs 4548 t iclamscs and 6856 t iclamlgs this last model exhibited a total biomass 49 48 greater than that from iclamgms similar trends in total biomass were observed for iclamgms iclamvbs and iclamscs they showed the highest values iclamgms 215 t iclamscs 281 t for the shell length class of 124 mm and iclamvbs 228 t for individuals of 128 mm in contrast the iclamlgs was noticeably different indicating higher levels of total biomass for the shell length classes of 80 140 mm within this range the individuals of 116 mm exhibited the maximum total biomass at shell length 540 t subsequently the trend in total biomass for iclamlgs decreased for the shell length classes of 144 200 mm to lower levels than those estimated by iclamvbs iclamgms and iclamscs fig 2e the estimates of vulnerable biomass at shell length also changed from 716 t iclamgms to 748 t iclamlgs 804 t iclamscs and 822 t iclamvbs the main difference observed in the vulnerable biomass was 106 t between iclamvbs and iclamgms although the vulnerable biomass among models showed a similar trend along the length structure the maximum estimates varied from 73 t iclamgms to 91 t iclamvbs for individuals of 156 mm 82 t iclamscs for individuals of 160 mm and 68 t iclamlgs for the shell length class of 152 mm the vulnerable biomass exhibited minimum values 18 t for the shell length classes smaller than 124 mm and larger than 184 mm fig 2f 3 7 model selection according to the aicc the population dynamics estimated from iclam using the von bertalanffy stochastic growth matrix was found to be the best showing the lowest value of a i c c 152 74 δ i 0 w i 0 85 the akaike differences revealed that the implementation of the schnute stochastic growth matrix was an alternative hypothesis within iclam with a i c c 157 11 δ i 3 54 w i 0 14 the gompertz and logistic stochastic growth matrices included into iclam had considerably less support with δ i 10 and akaike weights 0 001 therefore they were not good descriptors of the population dynamics table 2 4 discussion an important aspect in stock assessment is that the estimation of growth should be done within the model sullivan et al 1990 punt et al 2009 fisch et al 2019 before 1990 growth parameters were estimated outside the model and then the parameters estimated were introduced as fixed values in the stock assessment model while other population parameters were estimated when model and data were statistically confronted e g ssq likelihood theory this is known as a two step approach francis et al 2016 however the traditional two step procedure to stock assessment using fixed parameters was found to be unsatisfactory due to several limitations 1 information may be lost when data and parameters are obtained from unlinked submodels 2 the analyses used for obtaining the fixed parameters may be logically inconsistent 3 there may be difficulty in determining the appropriate likelihood function 4 there may be difficulty in fully accounting for uncertainty and 5 there may be reduced diagnostic ability maunder and punt 2013 in general when a parameter is pre specified based on auxiliary analyses or expert judgment the model can be mis specified setting the value of a parameter incorrectly often leads to biased assessment outcomes and therefore it can be very difficult to detect which parameters are specified incorrectly maunder and punt 2013 aires da silva et al 2015 iclam differs from the past practice of analyzing each data set separately and comparing the results e g growth this provides several advantages such as 1 ensuring consistency in assumptions among analyses and modeling approaches 2 using information from all data sources to identify the population state more adequately 3 representing the uncertainty associated with data sources to be expressed in the model outputs 4 allowing the error structure to be based on the statistical properties of the sampling process rather than on the assumed statistical properties of the fixed parameters and 5 integrating all of the data into one model makes it easier to investigate the sensitivity to each data set punt et al 2013 maunder and punt 2013 aires da silva et al 2015 stochastic growth matrices used in iclam represent the probabilities of shifting from one size class into another incorporating some measure of variation associated with each size class assuming that the negative growth is disregarded however when the fabens equation is implemented into a stochastic growth matrix the variability in the growth increments is normally distributed punt et al 1997 hillary 2011 siddeek et al 2016 according to lloyd jones et al 2014 this assumption could introduce the probability of negative growth this situation could be observed if any size class or classes were larger than the asymptotic length furthermore when any size class is close to the asymptotic length the symmetry of the normal distribution will allocate probabilities to size classes lower than the size class observed in the data set the effects of a misspecification in the probabilistic density function associated with the stochastic growth matrix have implications for the parameters estimated of the catch at length model in this study a gamma probabilistic density function was used and none of the four stochastic growth matrices estimated probabilities of negative growth when the individuals reached their asymptotic length showing a change in the shapes of the expected distributions as the individuals approached the asymptotic length this effect was very well observed for the lgs and scs growth matrices the lgs growth matrix changed the shape of the expected growth probabilities from 120 mm younger individuals while the scs growth matrix showed a change in the expected growth probabilities from 172 mm older individuals comparatively the vbs and gms growth matrices showed changes in probability shapes when both matrices were near to the asymptotic length approximately 180 mm below this size class the probability shapes for smaller individuals were similar to normal distributions this change in shape with shell length composition is because the flexibility of the gamma probabilistic density function represents the individual to individual growth variability in the population thus different growth patterns can be observed such as between small and large individuals or in situations where individual growth might or might not occur implying that individuals may stay in their original length class or move into larger classes haddon 2011 the effects of the different stochastic growth matrices associated with iclam were also observed on the population dynamics and management quantities in this study the iclamvbs was the best for describing the catch at length data while the iclamlgs showed the lowest performance the comparison among candidates iclam showed that the estimates of abundance and recruitment were different among length classes the iclamvbs estimated high abundance and recruitment for larger individuals 108 120 mm sl while iclamlgs estimated high abundance and recruits for smaller organisms 92 108 mm sl this effect can be explained by changes in the growth pattern reflected in the stochastic growth matrices where the vbs matrix showed changes in the probability of growth of larger individuals 180 mm while the lgs matrix exhibited changes in the growth of smaller individuals because to its low inflection point moreover the results showed that the iclamvbs estimated lower values of recruitment fishing mortality harvest rate and abundance compared to the other candidate models analyzed providing conservative estimates on the condition of the stock however notable differences were observed in the management quantities estimated by iclamvbs where the total biomass estimate was the second lowest after that by iclamgms but the vulnerable biomass was the highest an opposite effect was observed for iclamlgs which had the highest estimates for all the processes of population dynamics although the vulnerable biomass was the second lowest these differences emphasize the importance of determining an appropriate hypothesis on individual growth within size based stock assessment models a common practice in stock assessment models e g catch at age or length models is to choose by default the stochastic von bertalanffy model even if it is not the best model or has little or no support punt et al 2006 2009 cao et al 2017a cao et al 2017b fisch et al 2019 recently length structure stock assessment models were developed for p globosa in the gulf of california and mexican pacific ocean providing a novel method for stock assessment of the species these studies assumed that the growth pattern followed the traditional von bertalanffy growth function amezcua castro et al 2019 luquin covarrubias et al 2020 the current study based on an mmi approach indicated that the iclamvbs was the best for describing the catch at length data reflecting differences in the population dynamics of p globosa compared to the alternative iclam our results differ from those estimated by deterministic functions which have found that the logistic growth model was the most descriptive for p globosa in the study area aragón noriega et al 2015 these discrepancies strengthen the application of the mmi approach to the analysis of growth of p globosa within stock assessment models katsanevakis and maravelias 2008 emphasized that model selection is dependent not only on the species specific growth pattern but also on the quality of data set and the amount of available information an important aspect to consider is the analysis based on fishery dependent data because fishing mortality usually targets older and larger individuals and the younger and smaller are commonly absent this situation can cause a misspecification of the growth model which may not yield the best fit to the data consequently alternative models must be assessed against the data to estimate the growth pattern adequately haddon 2011 aragón noriega et al 2015 according to a i c c the iclamscs was also supported by the catch at length data with a percentage of evidence in favor of 14 in this case iclamvbs was not strongly supported as a clean winner with w i 90 when the data support more than one model there is some degree of uncertainty in model selection katsanevakis and maravelias 2008 indicated that when there is uncertainty in model selection the choice of the second best model may be dependent on the first this condition is supported by our results iclamscs is a general growth model that contains most of the other growth models as special cases including an asymptotic curve such as that shown by iclamvbs in contrast the iclamgms and iclamlgs exhibited considerably less statistical support characterized by sigmoidal curves with inflection points that indicated acceleration and deceleration in the growth rate assuming that growth is not constant throughout the life cycle the methodological proposal applied to the growth matrix incorporating different growth patterns was designed specifically to be used in catch at size stock assessment models this feature was especially relevant in this paper given that several reasonable hypotheses related to stochastic individual growth can be modeled highlighting the role that this may have on population dynamics and management quantities helidoniotis and haddon 2013 analyzed the effects and implications of the choice of growth model for fishery management for example the gompertz model implies slower initial growth which would imply lower productivity while the von bertalanffy model would indicate more rapid initial growth suggesting that the stock is more productive in this paper the estimated stochastic growth patterns are biologically likely showing changes in variance σ γ 2 of the growth increment these were estimated from a gamma probabilistic density function for each shell length class increasing the realism of the growth pattern commonly observed in nature and avoiding assumptions of constant growth increments for all shell length classes which is not real although it is widespread in the literature quinn and deriso 1999 analytically this study showed that the choice of stochastic growth model could have impacts on the magnitudes of recruitment fishing mortality and total and vulnerable biomass and could have potentially serious implications in biasing fishery stock assessment resulting in inadequate management strategies such as overprotecting spawning stock when the stock is healthy or the implementation of policy decisions of high risk when the stock status is inadvertently deteriorating lv and pitchford 2007 punt et al 2009 giacomini et al 2016 the main advantage of the catch at length models is that they do not incorporate equilibrium assumptions and that the growth of individuals is modeled assuming stochasticity providing biological realism to the stock assessment in the last 30 years reports of advances in the implementation of size transition matrices into stock assessment models are limited table 3 and the main contributions have been focused on the incorporation of several probabilistic density functions the literature also shows the application of new statistical proposals to increase the performance of objective functions even recently a bayesian approach was successfully implemented into size transition matrices these approaches improved the biological assumptions depending on the population studied e g molt in crustaceans punt et al 2009 siddeek et al 2016 comparatively this study analyzes the effect of changes in the growth assumptions on a catch at length model in this sense iclam is a flexible stock assessment model that includes four candidate stochastic growth matrices and they can be readily implemented and updated for estimating the parameters in the iclam the objective function based on a negative log likelihood function allows identification of the best model using information theory this procedure is relevant because each candidate stochastic growth matrix influences the population dynamics and can change it dramatically 5 conclusions the iclam used in this study was able to evaluate recruitment selectivity harvest rate abundance and total and vulnerable biomass associated to four stochastic growth matrices which had not been evaluated in previous stock assessment models we demonstrated that integrating alternative stochastic growth matrices in the stock assessment allows the estimation of probability regions indicating the growth variability of p globosa from different growth shapes this provides greater biological realism to describe the population condition such as represents the changes along the length structure or the identification of the possible impacts in the population our modeling approach can be applied to stock assessment of other species exploited commercially and disclose most appropriate sceneries on the population dynamics and management quantities according to growth pattern associated to the

24687,in the uk the now widespread non native grey squirrel produces problems for the forestry industry through damage from bark stripping and threatens the survival of native species most notably the red squirrel which mainly as a result of resource competition and transmission of infection has suffered dramatic declines reducing grey squirrel numbers is essential to decrease this species ecological and environmental impact using an individual based model operating in a fine scaled landscape of well mixed woodlands with reliable seed production we develop novel effort based mechanisms explicitly representing the probabilistic interaction of individual squirrels with either traps or bait hoppers to capture the density dependant efficiency of culling and fertility control respectively we also integrate a habitat based resistance to inter patch movement to describe more realistically the source sink dynamics in regional scale populations we use this new framework to compare the relative effort of population management at a landscape scale using both culling and fertility control alone and combined as part of an integrated sequential approach we also exploit our spatially explicit framework to demonstrate how we might identify neighbourhoods within our study area where management may be easier quicker and cheaper or more difficult sub populations resistant to management to enable the prediction of an optimal spatial and temporal deployment of management effort our results agree with previous studies on the relative efficiency of culling in eradicating squirrels as well as on the substantial costs of this approach despite an assumption of lower deployment costs our findings suggest that at least for the initial squirrel densities assumed fertility control alone is unlikely to achieve rapid enough reduction to prove a viable cost effective alternative to completely replace culling however when applied to the low density populations following short term culling eradication could be achieved within the same timescales as continuous culling alone but with substantially lower costs keywords contraception cost individual based model invasive alien species population management 1 introduction in the uk non native grey squirrels s carolinensis occupy most of mainland england and wales and cause substantial economic and environmental impacts these include widespread damage to forestry through bark stripping mayle and broome 2013 nichols et al 2016 as well as potential predation on birds bonnington et al 2014 at more local scales the species poses an ongoing threat to the native red squirrel sciurus vulgaris mainly through resource competition and transmission of diseases such as the squirrelpox virus leading to substantial population decline rushton et al 2000 gurnell et al 2004 reducing the density of grey squirrels is key to mitigating their national or regional scale impacts bertolino et al 2014 schuchert et al 2014 goldstein et al 2016 concurrently a reduction in local squirrel densities is a pre requisite to managing the re colonisation of red squirrels across parts of their former range although most previous modelling studies e g rushton et al 2002 have focused on grey squirrel management in support of red squirrel conservation other aspects of population control merit attention these include the costs of achieving and maintaining low density populations of grey squirrels at large scales e g regions to minimise the economic or environmental burdens of this species in addition very few studies have explored where within extensive regions subject to integrated grey squirrel management programmes local eradication is quick to achieve and cost effective to maintain and where resistance to the removal of grey squirrels is likely to be greatest justifying the deployment of additional management tools or resource culling traditionally used to reduce grey squirrel numbers using marksmen kill trapping or live trap and despatch is generally recognised as expensive and laborious and ill suited to simultaneous deployment across large geographical scales for instance the cost of culling 6397 grey squirrels for 17 years in anglesey in addition to removing approximately 3200 animals from the adjacent mainland population and implementing habitat restoration and translocation of red squirrels was around 1 million derbridge et al 2016 poisoning grey squirrels using anticoagulants once employed to protect tree crops is now illegal in the uk culling alone has failed in most areas to bring grey squirrels under control and as a result the uk harbours a population of approximately 2 5 million croft et al 2017 mathews et al 2018 which continues to spread in addition public antipathy towards lethal methods of squirrel control has increased demand for alternative options particularly in contexts such as urban areas where lethal control may either be impractical or opposed by local communities barr et al 2002 bremner and park 2007 dunn et al 2018 for example in a recent survey on the uk public s acceptability of several population control methods for grey squirrels dunn et al 2018 found that traditional lethal methods were regarded by the public as least acceptable whilst contraception was the preferred method supported by 63 of the 3758 respondents fertility control has the potential to reduce population size and the rate of population recovery after culling shi et al 2002 massei and cowan 2014 ideally this method should be based on delivering oral contraceptives in baits that are accessible to the target species only fagerstone et al 2010 massei and cowan 2014 although oral contraceptives are not available for grey squirrels work is in progress to develop these drugs in contexts where culling or delivery of injectable contraceptives are not feasible or economically viable the availability of oral contraceptives would add considerably to the options available for wildlife managers this study is part of a larger 5 year project aimed at developing and delivering oral contraceptives for grey squirrels massei 2018 both as a management tool in the absence of red squirrels and also where they are in sympatry with red squirrels this programme includes the development of new oral contraceptives delivered in baits and the refinement of existing species specific bait delivery devices e g feed hoppers pepper and stoker 1993 spatially explicit population modelling offers a tool to test a variety of management options variations in method timing and intensity of deployment and landscape scenarios open closed etc at scales beyond those practical for empirical assessment in this context as long as parameter estimates are well supported by experimental observation such models are invaluable in assessing the potential effects of fertility control on grey squirrel populations alone or in conjunction with culling and the effort and costs associated with regional population control strategies the effect of fertility control and culling on non native squirrel populations has been explored in previous studies rushton et al 2002 krause et al 2014 goldstein et al 2016 though often methods are compared separately or in simple combination rather than sequentially furthermore little attention has be paid to how the distribution of woodlands across extensive landscapes might affect management outcomes the specific aim of the initial study we present here was to apply a spatial population model to assess the relative effort required to manage and eradicate grey squirrels through culling fertility control or their integration using a novel combination of modelling tools supported by parameter estimates from recent fieldwork 2 methods 2 1 model landscape for this study we nominally based our model landscape on a 600 km2 region of north cumbria which through the analysis detailed in appendix a we identified to be relatively isolated with any immigration emigration likely to be slow and therefore could reasonably be considered as being closed within this study area we defined distinct habitat patches as contiguous blocks of woodland using a 25 m resolution land cover map lcm2007 morton et al 2011 each explicitly represented by a fixed measure of its value to squirrels carrying capacity the area of the patch and a list of individual squirrel inhabitants population carrying capacity for each patch was assigned based on the specific composition of deciduous and coniferous woodland computed by applying type specific estimates from the literature mathews et al 2018 and our own field data appendix c in a comprehensive literature review mathews et al 2018 reported mean densities of 1 9 n 21 and 0 31 n 38 squirrels ha for deciduous and coniferous woodlands respectively beatham et al see appendix c recorded densities of 3 9 and 6 6 squirrels ha estimated using capture mark recapture cmr in two 8 ha blocks of mixed deciduous woodland calculating the weighted mean of all estimates yielded a new mean density of 2 2 squirrels ha which we applied for our description of mixed deciduous woodland the density applied to coniferous woodland remained 0 31 squirrels ha the landscape matrix surrounding woodland patches provided no contribution to squirrel numbers this included urban areas where non zero densities have been reported mathews et al 2018 but are strongly correlated to the availability of greenspace i e woodland bonnington et al 2014 which we suggest is accurately encapsulated within our definition of woodland at a 25 m resolution the reader should note that we do not consider inter annual fluctuations in squirrel population as a result of seed production the frequency and impact of masting on squirrel populations can vary greatly across individual tree species slade et al 2019 however within the broad classifications available for much of britain england it is difficult to accurately describe this variation as different compositions of trees will inherently produce different patterns here we consider tree species within a class to be well mixed this is relatively typical of british woodland particularly broadleaf such that the asynchrony in masting maintains relatively stable food resource and therefore populations of squirrels see appendix a for further justification of this modelling choice to model squirrel movements each patch also required information about its local surroundings specifically a list of neighbouring patches and corresponding likelihood of movement between them rushton et al 1997 2002 defined this likelihood based on euclidean distance alone assuming that squirrels can disperse up to a fixed maximum distance recent novel approaches investigating dispersal pathways stevenson holt et al 2014 flaherty 2016a flaherty et al 2016b offer an opportunity to incorporate considerations for how the composition of the landscape matrix between patches may also influence connectivity refining definitions of dispersal following the process outlined by such studies we fitted a species distribution model sdm e g phillips and dudík 2008 and applied the output to inform resistance scores for various non woodland land classes expressed as the equivalent distance that would be travelled in woodland per unit travelled in non woodland see appendix a for full details we used the derived resistance scores table 1 to calculate inter patch cost distances reflecting the porosity of the landscape in relation to woodland to account for the finite dispersal distance of squirrels we delineated surfaces according to a maximum cost distance threshold this defined the local neighbourhood for each patch other patches intersecting this neighbourhood formed the list of neighbours for a patch corresponding likelihoods of travel to these neighbours was computed as the relative proportion of summed cost distance across the neighbourhood that lay within the footprint of a neighbouring patch 2 2 population model 2 2 1 overview to simulate grey squirrel populations we adapted the agent based modelling approach outlined by rushton et al 1997 2002 describing the life histories of individual squirrels represented with an assigned gender sex ratio assumed 50 50 at birth an age and life stage juvenile defined as 1 year or adult the habitat patch where they live and whether they have been subject to successful contraception individuals were updated simultaneously on an annual time step by applying algorithms fig 1 to represent various ecological processes survival reproduction dispersal and population management methods culling and fertility control as described below 2 2 2 ecological processes individual survival was tested at each time step by comparing a value selected from a random uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 against a fixed threshold of success any individuals failing this test random numbers greater than the fixed threshold see parameterisation for threshold value were considered dead and removed as offspring are initially dependant on their mothers we performed this test prior to any relating to reproduction to account for the consequent loss of reproductive effort for maternal fatalities realised throughout most of the year only fertile adult females were considered to reproduce and to do so required at least one fertile adult male to be present in the same patch each candidate female could produce up to two litters per year with fixed parameter values defining the probability of either zero one or two for each litter produced we chose a litter size at random from a truncated poisson distribution limited between one and eight offspring koprowski et al 2016 with defined mean table 2 as argued by rushton et al 1997 2002 dispersal only occurred when a patch was above carrying capacity forcing individuals to either disperse or endure increased levels of mortality as a result of the lack of resources juveniles were considered most likely to disperse and were selected at random according to a sex based bias goldstein et al 2016 if patch populations still exceeded the patch carrying capacity adults were randomly subjected to the same routine until the patch capacity was realised all of the dispersing squirrels from every patch were added to a single list and shuffled to produce a random dispersal order the destination of each squirrel was selected at random from those available i e the list of neighbours for their current patch according to a weighted distribution based on connection strength such that dispersal is most likely to close neighbours rushton et al 2002 if a squirrel s destination patch was at or above its own carrying capacity dispersal was considered unsuccessful and the animal was assumed to die animals accumulated their chronological age with each time step and for grey squirrels in the uk juveniles could be assumed to have reached reproductive maturity in the year following their birth squirrels exceeding a maximum age table 2 were removed from the population 2 2 3 population management methods we considered two management methods removal using single capture live cage traps and oral contraception using bait hoppers unlike other models we did not simulate control as a fixed proportionate reduction in the population rushton et al 2002 goldstein et al 2016 but instead explicitly describe an effort dependant mechanism thereby allowing a more responsive and accurate reflection of interaction rates across changing densities or contrasting patches for both culling and fertility control we defined efficacy based on the probability of an individual squirrel interacting with a particular device trap or hopper on any given day from here on referred to as encounter probability and effort by the density of devices and the duration of their deployment per year based on our empirical data appendix c this probability of interaction remained constant during removal despite less competition for resources suggesting that our necessary simplification regarding seed production is unlikely to impact this aspect of the model to account for the use of single capture traps we simulated interactions with squirrels from the perspective of the trap so as to realistically represent reductions in availability as traps are filled before being reset every day mayle et al 2007 for each specified trap day we performed a stochastic test against the density dependant probability of a successful capture defined as 1 1 et s where et is the encounter probability for a trap and s is the average number of squirrels within a home range of the trap i e the population which are likely to interact with it computed as the product of the average squirrel density within the patch and the average area describing a squirrel home range if capture was successful then we selected a squirrel at random to remove from the population unlike traps hoppers can be used by many squirrels as such we instead simulated interactions with hoppers and by proxy consumption of oral contraceptive from the perspective of a squirrel we performed a stochastic test against a variable probability of success to determine if an individual became infertile the probability of successful contraception was the product of several components firstly the delivery effort i e the number and period of hopper deployment hopper days which affects the likelihood and speed with which individuals fed from hoppers this was reflected in a similar equation to trapping as 1 1 eh h where eh is the encounter probability for a hopper and h is the number of hopper days within an average squirrel home range table 2 once squirrels find hoppers experimental evidence indicates frequent and repeated re use during a deployment appendix c supporting the prospect of the delivery of an effective dose of contraceptive across a single deployment secondly unlike trapping where population structures are perturbed by removal the use of hoppers is not considered to interfere with squirrel social dynamics or competition for resources which might result in some subordinate individuals being denied access to hoppers this type of behaviour was observed by beatham et al appendix c during field trials using a rhodamine bait marker to track hopper use suggesting a clear relationship between the maximum proportion of animals frequently using hoppers and the ratio of squirrels per hopper we represented this by fitting an equation of the form 1 p s h where p is the probability of a squirrel being denied access to all hoppers at a squirrel to hopper ratio of 1 1 and s h is ratio of squirrels to hoppers density of squirrels within a patch divided by the density of hoppers finally we considered scenarios where a putative contraceptive may not be completely effective and included a component representing the probability of successful contraception given sufficient dose combining these components the probability of infertility for each individual was therefore calculated as s 1 p s h 1 1 eh h we make the conservative assumption based on the lack of experimental evidence that squirrels were only infertile for a year after treatment following which individuals if not subsequently re treated were regarded as fertile and allowed to reproduce 2 3 parameterisation parameter values were selected from published literature and from previous modelling studies table 2 for simplicity and to mimic the boundary conditions of the wider gb squirrel population we adopted a maximum dispersal distance table 2 from within the range outlined by lurz et al 2001 such that our chosen study area could be considered closed realistically we recognise it is unlikely that any populations within the current gb distribution are absolutely closed and indeed previous studies have suggested pathways through which the initial invasion of our chosen region may have occurred stevenson holt 2012 we do not dispute the existence of such pathways but note that the cost of movement along them is sufficiently high and therefore frequency of movement sufficiently low that any leakages at the edges of our study area are so small they can be ignored without detriment to the experimental investigation trap encounter probability defined as the probability of an individual squirrel interacting with a trap on any given day was derived from experimental data on the relationship between estimated population size cmr and trapping success average proportion filled per day collected by beatham et al described in appendix c since the probability of all squirrels failing to enter the trap is multiplicative we determined the probability of an individual squirrel failing or avoiding the trap as the probability of failure to the nth root where n is the average squirrel population in the close vicinity of traps home range table 2 this suggested a trapping probability for any given squirrel of 0 05 conservatively we assumed the same probability for equivalent interactions with hoppers although it should be noted that empirical work using pit tags to monitor hopper visits by squirrels suggests this probability may be greater appendix c most likely due to the continuous accessibility of hoppers compared with single capture traps which could only be accessed by one individual per day the relationship between hopper use proportion of squirrels testing positive for a rhodamine bait marker against the ratio of squirrels to hoppers appendix c suggested the proportion denied access to hoppers assuming a fixed ratio of one hopper per squirrel was 0 225 consequently the maximum proportion able to access hoppers at this ratio was 0 775 2 4 simulation experiments simulations consisted of two phases an initial warm up followed by a control phase in which various management strategies were applied in the warm up phase patches were initialised with a number of adult squirrels equal to their capacity with their gender assigned at random the model was then run for 10 years allowing sufficient time for the population demographic structure to stabilise specified management strategies were then applied and the population simulated for a further 50 years for each strategy we performed 100 repetitions aggregating the results to produce comparative statistics reflecting the speed of population decline and by extension relative cost of different options in this context speed of decline was primarily defined as the time years to achieve eradication but it also described the rate of population decline percentage reduction in the first year of control as rushton et al 2002 suggested that the main cost of culling is due to the requirement for staff to inspect each trap daily this is not required during pre baiting and as such we only consider time spent active trapping for relative comparison we assumed the relative cost reflecting an investment of resource either monetary or volunteer time of fertility control to be a fifth of culling as hoppers might only need be checked weekly to replenish the bait we therefore estimate the cost of fertility control measured in cull years to be 20 of respective times to eradication beyond which management would no longer be required initially we explored culling alone to establish the level of effort expressed as density of traps deployed in each woodland required to eradicate grey squirrels from the study area the range of trap densities tested specifically 0 125 0 25 0 5 1 2 and 4 traps ha was based on that recommended by best practice guidelines 4 traps ha mayle et al 2007 gurnell and pepper 2016 and on the lower density of trap deployments used for the eradication on anglesey schuchert et al 2014 which employed an average of between 0 2 and 1 traps ha depending on woodland type across an area similar to north cumbria our calculations also assumed 4 5 days active trapping per month for each of the 9 months between february and october standard guidelines gurnell and pepper 2016 for a total of 45 days year next we explored replacing culling with fertility control for comparison of relative costs as well as control efficacy rate of decline we assumed equal densities of hoppers as traps deployed for the same period 45 days per year choosing to consider densities of 0 5 ha similar to that used at landscape scale in anglesey as no data are available on the effectiveness of oral contraceptives we tested a range of rates of induced infertility i e 50 75 90 and 100 finally we tested a sequential approach culling for one year followed by fertility control using the same fixed density of traps and hoppers as employed for fertility control alone again considering a range of contraceptive efficacy 3 results for culling fig 2 trap densities greater or equal to 0 25 traps ha guaranteed eradication within 50 years 100 percentile across repetitions with the median 50 percentile across repetitions time taken ranging from 12 years for 0 25 traps ha to 8 years for 4 traps ha table 3 initial rates of population reduction were rapid compared with fertility control alone figs 2 and 3 with mean percentage decreases after the first year of control between 50 for a trap density of 0 125 traps ha to more than 98 for trap densities greater than 0 5 trap ha fig 2 and table 3 assuming trapping was carried out for 5 day month and 9 months year i e 45 days per year conversely employing fertility control alone assuming 0 5 hoppers ha fig 3 failed to guarantee eradication within 50 years even when assuming an effective oral contraceptive 100 reduction of fertility this is not to say that eradication using fertility control never occurred but it was unlikely to be within 50 years only occurred in a few simulations approx 5 and required the use of the most effective contraceptive table 3 initial rates of population reduction were substantially slower than for culling with percentage decreases after the first year of control of 10 6 3 and 1 for contraceptive efficacies of 100 90 75 and 50 respectively fig 3 and table 3 applying an initial year of culling prior to fertility control assuming identical trap and hopper densities of 0 5 device ha fig 4 notably increased the probability of eradication within 50 years with contraceptive efficacies greater than 75 guaranteeing this outcome for these efficacies 90 and 100 the median time eradication was 10 years table 3 identical to the equivalent scenario using culling alone but with greater reliability maximum time to eradication for culling in any simulation was 39 years whereas when replaced with fertility control after one year it was 26 and 21 years assuming contraceptive efficacies of 90 and 100 respectively the model identified neighbourhoods within the study area which are more or less susceptible to the effects of management we illustrate this using a simple and plausible fertility control only scenario 75 effective showing well described areas of local eradication often close to similar areas still hosting populations resistant to management eradicated areas feature sparse networks of well separated small patches whilst resistant areas feature well connected networks of larger woodlands fig 5 b our model suggests this proximate co existence is not persistent eradication of even resistant neighbourhoods is likely albeit slow and is produced by the suppression of emigration from neighbourhoods of large and productive patches our illustration was chosen to accentuate the differences between neighbouring patches but does support two key observations similar spatial patterns in response would be observed in the more rapid approaches but for a number of the scenarios e g culling only or mixed approaches this pattern would have only been observed following the initial year of operations with eradication likely to be subsequently imminent across most of the study extent secondly we note that whilst our plausible and moderate fertility control scenario fig 5b produces a distinct heterogeneity in management outcomes multiple benefits accrue after 20 years considerable areas of the extent are free of grey squirrels and the areas where they appear resistant to management are spatially limited and host reduced populations potentially below any broad threshold for economic damage and reducing other harmful effects squirrels may have on the environment 4 discussion for the first time we describe a model for simulating grey squirrel populations incorporating effort based management using probabilistic interaction rates between individual animals and either traps or bait hoppers this study is informed by experimental data to capture realistic spatial and temporal variations in the relative efficacy of each control method specifically density dependence we compare different options based on culling fertility control and uniquely a sequential integration of the two approaches considering short term culling followed by multi year fertility control distinct from previous studies we explore how management activity might permit the maintenance of low densities of grey squirrels to mitigate their economic and environmental impacts across extensive landscapes we also illustrate how co ordinated management programmes can exploit the refined description of grey squirrel movement used here to identify local neighbourhoods within extensive landscapes for which differing combinations of population management methods might be deployed to optimise the speed and cost effectiveness of grey squirrel eradication our results agree with previous work in suggesting that culling can rapidly reduce squirrel numbers and that even a low density of traps 0 125 traps ha reduces the population by 50 in the first year however at least 0 25 traps ha must be maintained for at least 45 days per year to guarantee eradication in 50 years with an average of 0 5 traps ha the simulated median eradication time was 10 years comparable to that reported on anglesey schuchert et al 2014 comparing our results across all trapping densities indicates that at higher trap densities there were only minimal improvements in both the rate of population reduction in the first year and the eventual time to eradication but that the likelihood of a faster eradication is generally higher shorter maximum time to eradication across all simulations 100 percentile offering greater certainty of achieving this outcome as expected the model showed that fertility control alone is slower than culling to reduce populations even with a completely effective contraceptive 100 reduction in fertility only reducing populations by around 10 in the first year eradication across the study area using this method alone is unlikely to be considered more cost effective than culling assuming equivalent numbers of traps as hoppers but would be achieved eventually and would occur much sooner in landscape scale neighbourhoods fig 5 this indicates that fertility control alone would not provide a practical solution to eradicate grey squirrels but may prove invaluable at maintaining low densities sufficient to mitigate most economic and environmental problems grey squirrels produce however we note that dependant on the formulation and mode of delivery oral contraceptives may eventually become much more cost effective than assumed here for instance we have conservatively assumed that induced infertility lasts only one year inhibiting one or possible two reproductive cycles in grey squirrels in other squirrel species treated with single dose injectable contraceptive vaccines infertility may last several years in the closely related fox squirrel s niger such vaccines maintained infertility in 100 of treated animals for at least 17 months with results suggesting that infertility was likely to persist much longer krause et al 2014 in the california ground squirrel spermaphilus beechevi the proportion of lactating females were reduced by 91 the first year and 96 in the second year nash et al 2004 this might encourage deployments of fertility control in alternate years further reducing cost and effort further extending the period between hopper refills with bait from our conservative assumption of 5 days is likely to produce substantial reductions in costs refilling intervals are dependant on the nature of the bait formulation and hopper size current experimental work uses a highly palatable paste bait delivered in hoppers which requires refilling at 5 day intervals alternative formulations e g a liquid or intelligent delivery devices e g regulating access to bait may permit the use of much larger hoppers and extend servicing intervals our modelling demonstrates that rapidly reducing squirrel densities using one year of culling followed by ongoing fertility control could achieve eradication in similar time to culling alone even if the efficacy of the oral contraceptive were only 75 this sequential approach represents the most cost effective option this approach has the added benefit that for much of the period of management before eradication is achieved squirrel densities will be low potentially below any threshold associated with damage to trees in addition whilst a combination of culling and fertility control might still not be popular with stakeholders that oppose culling it might be preferable to culling as the sole method for squirrel control it should be recognised that within the scope of this comparative study we make several simplifying assumptions which may limit the immediate application to inform real world scenarios firstly similar to other modelling studies e g rushton et al 2002 jones et al 2016 we do not consider annual fluctuations in seed production which have been shown to affect squirrel numbers gurnell 1996 we have outlined in appendix a the substantial uncertainties involved in representing local seed production without a patch by patch description of tree species and their abundance i e composition of the patch for the purposes of our relative assessment this experimental choice does not affect our general conclusion that short term culling to reduce squirrel densities followed by fertility control provides a more cost effective strategy than culling alone see appendix a but does limit the model s ability to accurately predict absolute timescales and locations for removal given different management strategies for instance a good mast year may allow previously culled populations to bounce back sufficiently so as to require a more adaptive management approach interspersing long term fertility control with additional periods of culling this would need to be addressed for the model to be used as a practical tool for woodland managers secondly we deliberately model a region in the landscape which may reasonably be considered at least relatively closed i e any reinvasion is likely to be slow containing a stable population of squirrels our conclusions are therefore limited to these conditions and may not translate to situations with more open or unstable invading populations finally here we consider a best case scenario with ubiquitous control across the landscape in reality even where management is co ordinated schuchert et al 2014 landowner participation is more variable as with the other assumptions we make this scenario does not affect the validity of our relative comparison but will clearly be a key factor in the development of a practical management strategy future work will focus on this aspect of the model to better inform decision making even though our description of the value of patches to squirrels is crude producing little heterogeneity in value carrying capacity our refined description of squirrel movement between patches allows our spatially explicit model to identify neighbourhoods across our extent where management is easier i e more rapid and cost effective and eradication more likely within a limited time frame this is driven by the complexity of the inter patch networks within these neighbourhoods in our modelled landscape and the source sink dynamic they produce this observation promotes two possible benefits firstly red squirrels might be reintroduced into woodlands emptied of grey squirrels much sooner than the date of removal of the last grey squirrel anywhere in the study area our measure of eradication success although the cost of checking traps in areas where red squirrels occur will increase as these traps must be checked at least twice per day the model could be used to identify the neighbourhoods of competitor free space suitable for the re colonisation of red squirrels secondly we note that fig 5 also identifies neighbourhoods across the study area where spatially differential management strategies may produce even faster and more effective outcomes for example had one year of culling been deployed only in those neighbourhoods considered resistant to management typically large blocks of woodland able to support high densities of squirrels for which culling would be essential even moderately effective fertility control programmes across the whole landscape may offer cost effective and rapid resolutions to the problems caused by the presence of grey squirrels such programmes tailored to the character of patches or patch neighbourhoods suggest that regional scale grey squirrel management principally to reduce their density and minimise their economic and environmental impact could be extended at a relatively

24687,in the uk the now widespread non native grey squirrel produces problems for the forestry industry through damage from bark stripping and threatens the survival of native species most notably the red squirrel which mainly as a result of resource competition and transmission of infection has suffered dramatic declines reducing grey squirrel numbers is essential to decrease this species ecological and environmental impact using an individual based model operating in a fine scaled landscape of well mixed woodlands with reliable seed production we develop novel effort based mechanisms explicitly representing the probabilistic interaction of individual squirrels with either traps or bait hoppers to capture the density dependant efficiency of culling and fertility control respectively we also integrate a habitat based resistance to inter patch movement to describe more realistically the source sink dynamics in regional scale populations we use this new framework to compare the relative effort of population management at a landscape scale using both culling and fertility control alone and combined as part of an integrated sequential approach we also exploit our spatially explicit framework to demonstrate how we might identify neighbourhoods within our study area where management may be easier quicker and cheaper or more difficult sub populations resistant to management to enable the prediction of an optimal spatial and temporal deployment of management effort our results agree with previous studies on the relative efficiency of culling in eradicating squirrels as well as on the substantial costs of this approach despite an assumption of lower deployment costs our findings suggest that at least for the initial squirrel densities assumed fertility control alone is unlikely to achieve rapid enough reduction to prove a viable cost effective alternative to completely replace culling however when applied to the low density populations following short term culling eradication could be achieved within the same timescales as continuous culling alone but with substantially lower costs keywords contraception cost individual based model invasive alien species population management 1 introduction in the uk non native grey squirrels s carolinensis occupy most of mainland england and wales and cause substantial economic and environmental impacts these include widespread damage to forestry through bark stripping mayle and broome 2013 nichols et al 2016 as well as potential predation on birds bonnington et al 2014 at more local scales the species poses an ongoing threat to the native red squirrel sciurus vulgaris mainly through resource competition and transmission of diseases such as the squirrelpox virus leading to substantial population decline rushton et al 2000 gurnell et al 2004 reducing the density of grey squirrels is key to mitigating their national or regional scale impacts bertolino et al 2014 schuchert et al 2014 goldstein et al 2016 concurrently a reduction in local squirrel densities is a pre requisite to managing the re colonisation of red squirrels across parts of their former range although most previous modelling studies e g rushton et al 2002 have focused on grey squirrel management in support of red squirrel conservation other aspects of population control merit attention these include the costs of achieving and maintaining low density populations of grey squirrels at large scales e g regions to minimise the economic or environmental burdens of this species in addition very few studies have explored where within extensive regions subject to integrated grey squirrel management programmes local eradication is quick to achieve and cost effective to maintain and where resistance to the removal of grey squirrels is likely to be greatest justifying the deployment of additional management tools or resource culling traditionally used to reduce grey squirrel numbers using marksmen kill trapping or live trap and despatch is generally recognised as expensive and laborious and ill suited to simultaneous deployment across large geographical scales for instance the cost of culling 6397 grey squirrels for 17 years in anglesey in addition to removing approximately 3200 animals from the adjacent mainland population and implementing habitat restoration and translocation of red squirrels was around 1 million derbridge et al 2016 poisoning grey squirrels using anticoagulants once employed to protect tree crops is now illegal in the uk culling alone has failed in most areas to bring grey squirrels under control and as a result the uk harbours a population of approximately 2 5 million croft et al 2017 mathews et al 2018 which continues to spread in addition public antipathy towards lethal methods of squirrel control has increased demand for alternative options particularly in contexts such as urban areas where lethal control may either be impractical or opposed by local communities barr et al 2002 bremner and park 2007 dunn et al 2018 for example in a recent survey on the uk public s acceptability of several population control methods for grey squirrels dunn et al 2018 found that traditional lethal methods were regarded by the public as least acceptable whilst contraception was the preferred method supported by 63 of the 3758 respondents fertility control has the potential to reduce population size and the rate of population recovery after culling shi et al 2002 massei and cowan 2014 ideally this method should be based on delivering oral contraceptives in baits that are accessible to the target species only fagerstone et al 2010 massei and cowan 2014 although oral contraceptives are not available for grey squirrels work is in progress to develop these drugs in contexts where culling or delivery of injectable contraceptives are not feasible or economically viable the availability of oral contraceptives would add considerably to the options available for wildlife managers this study is part of a larger 5 year project aimed at developing and delivering oral contraceptives for grey squirrels massei 2018 both as a management tool in the absence of red squirrels and also where they are in sympatry with red squirrels this programme includes the development of new oral contraceptives delivered in baits and the refinement of existing species specific bait delivery devices e g feed hoppers pepper and stoker 1993 spatially explicit population modelling offers a tool to test a variety of management options variations in method timing and intensity of deployment and landscape scenarios open closed etc at scales beyond those practical for empirical assessment in this context as long as parameter estimates are well supported by experimental observation such models are invaluable in assessing the potential effects of fertility control on grey squirrel populations alone or in conjunction with culling and the effort and costs associated with regional population control strategies the effect of fertility control and culling on non native squirrel populations has been explored in previous studies rushton et al 2002 krause et al 2014 goldstein et al 2016 though often methods are compared separately or in simple combination rather than sequentially furthermore little attention has be paid to how the distribution of woodlands across extensive landscapes might affect management outcomes the specific aim of the initial study we present here was to apply a spatial population model to assess the relative effort required to manage and eradicate grey squirrels through culling fertility control or their integration using a novel combination of modelling tools supported by parameter estimates from recent fieldwork 2 methods 2 1 model landscape for this study we nominally based our model landscape on a 600 km2 region of north cumbria which through the analysis detailed in appendix a we identified to be relatively isolated with any immigration emigration likely to be slow and therefore could reasonably be considered as being closed within this study area we defined distinct habitat patches as contiguous blocks of woodland using a 25 m resolution land cover map lcm2007 morton et al 2011 each explicitly represented by a fixed measure of its value to squirrels carrying capacity the area of the patch and a list of individual squirrel inhabitants population carrying capacity for each patch was assigned based on the specific composition of deciduous and coniferous woodland computed by applying type specific estimates from the literature mathews et al 2018 and our own field data appendix c in a comprehensive literature review mathews et al 2018 reported mean densities of 1 9 n 21 and 0 31 n 38 squirrels ha for deciduous and coniferous woodlands respectively beatham et al see appendix c recorded densities of 3 9 and 6 6 squirrels ha estimated using capture mark recapture cmr in two 8 ha blocks of mixed deciduous woodland calculating the weighted mean of all estimates yielded a new mean density of 2 2 squirrels ha which we applied for our description of mixed deciduous woodland the density applied to coniferous woodland remained 0 31 squirrels ha the landscape matrix surrounding woodland patches provided no contribution to squirrel numbers this included urban areas where non zero densities have been reported mathews et al 2018 but are strongly correlated to the availability of greenspace i e woodland bonnington et al 2014 which we suggest is accurately encapsulated within our definition of woodland at a 25 m resolution the reader should note that we do not consider inter annual fluctuations in squirrel population as a result of seed production the frequency and impact of masting on squirrel populations can vary greatly across individual tree species slade et al 2019 however within the broad classifications available for much of britain england it is difficult to accurately describe this variation as different compositions of trees will inherently produce different patterns here we consider tree species within a class to be well mixed this is relatively typical of british woodland particularly broadleaf such that the asynchrony in masting maintains relatively stable food resource and therefore populations of squirrels see appendix a for further justification of this modelling choice to model squirrel movements each patch also required information about its local surroundings specifically a list of neighbouring patches and corresponding likelihood of movement between them rushton et al 1997 2002 defined this likelihood based on euclidean distance alone assuming that squirrels can disperse up to a fixed maximum distance recent novel approaches investigating dispersal pathways stevenson holt et al 2014 flaherty 2016a flaherty et al 2016b offer an opportunity to incorporate considerations for how the composition of the landscape matrix between patches may also influence connectivity refining definitions of dispersal following the process outlined by such studies we fitted a species distribution model sdm e g phillips and dudík 2008 and applied the output to inform resistance scores for various non woodland land classes expressed as the equivalent distance that would be travelled in woodland per unit travelled in non woodland see appendix a for full details we used the derived resistance scores table 1 to calculate inter patch cost distances reflecting the porosity of the landscape in relation to woodland to account for the finite dispersal distance of squirrels we delineated surfaces according to a maximum cost distance threshold this defined the local neighbourhood for each patch other patches intersecting this neighbourhood formed the list of neighbours for a patch corresponding likelihoods of travel to these neighbours was computed as the relative proportion of summed cost distance across the neighbourhood that lay within the footprint of a neighbouring patch 2 2 population model 2 2 1 overview to simulate grey squirrel populations we adapted the agent based modelling approach outlined by rushton et al 1997 2002 describing the life histories of individual squirrels represented with an assigned gender sex ratio assumed 50 50 at birth an age and life stage juvenile defined as 1 year or adult the habitat patch where they live and whether they have been subject to successful contraception individuals were updated simultaneously on an annual time step by applying algorithms fig 1 to represent various ecological processes survival reproduction dispersal and population management methods culling and fertility control as described below 2 2 2 ecological processes individual survival was tested at each time step by comparing a value selected from a random uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 against a fixed threshold of success any individuals failing this test random numbers greater than the fixed threshold see parameterisation for threshold value were considered dead and removed as offspring are initially dependant on their mothers we performed this test prior to any relating to reproduction to account for the consequent loss of reproductive effort for maternal fatalities realised throughout most of the year only fertile adult females were considered to reproduce and to do so required at least one fertile adult male to be present in the same patch each candidate female could produce up to two litters per year with fixed parameter values defining the probability of either zero one or two for each litter produced we chose a litter size at random from a truncated poisson distribution limited between one and eight offspring koprowski et al 2016 with defined mean table 2 as argued by rushton et al 1997 2002 dispersal only occurred when a patch was above carrying capacity forcing individuals to either disperse or endure increased levels of mortality as a result of the lack of resources juveniles were considered most likely to disperse and were selected at random according to a sex based bias goldstein et al 2016 if patch populations still exceeded the patch carrying capacity adults were randomly subjected to the same routine until the patch capacity was realised all of the dispersing squirrels from every patch were added to a single list and shuffled to produce a random dispersal order the destination of each squirrel was selected at random from those available i e the list of neighbours for their current patch according to a weighted distribution based on connection strength such that dispersal is most likely to close neighbours rushton et al 2002 if a squirrel s destination patch was at or above its own carrying capacity dispersal was considered unsuccessful and the animal was assumed to die animals accumulated their chronological age with each time step and for grey squirrels in the uk juveniles could be assumed to have reached reproductive maturity in the year following their birth squirrels exceeding a maximum age table 2 were removed from the population 2 2 3 population management methods we considered two management methods removal using single capture live cage traps and oral contraception using bait hoppers unlike other models we did not simulate control as a fixed proportionate reduction in the population rushton et al 2002 goldstein et al 2016 but instead explicitly describe an effort dependant mechanism thereby allowing a more responsive and accurate reflection of interaction rates across changing densities or contrasting patches for both culling and fertility control we defined efficacy based on the probability of an individual squirrel interacting with a particular device trap or hopper on any given day from here on referred to as encounter probability and effort by the density of devices and the duration of their deployment per year based on our empirical data appendix c this probability of interaction remained constant during removal despite less competition for resources suggesting that our necessary simplification regarding seed production is unlikely to impact this aspect of the model to account for the use of single capture traps we simulated interactions with squirrels from the perspective of the trap so as to realistically represent reductions in availability as traps are filled before being reset every day mayle et al 2007 for each specified trap day we performed a stochastic test against the density dependant probability of a successful capture defined as 1 1 et s where et is the encounter probability for a trap and s is the average number of squirrels within a home range of the trap i e the population which are likely to interact with it computed as the product of the average squirrel density within the patch and the average area describing a squirrel home range if capture was successful then we selected a squirrel at random to remove from the population unlike traps hoppers can be used by many squirrels as such we instead simulated interactions with hoppers and by proxy consumption of oral contraceptive from the perspective of a squirrel we performed a stochastic test against a variable probability of success to determine if an individual became infertile the probability of successful contraception was the product of several components firstly the delivery effort i e the number and period of hopper deployment hopper days which affects the likelihood and speed with which individuals fed from hoppers this was reflected in a similar equation to trapping as 1 1 eh h where eh is the encounter probability for a hopper and h is the number of hopper days within an average squirrel home range table 2 once squirrels find hoppers experimental evidence indicates frequent and repeated re use during a deployment appendix c supporting the prospect of the delivery of an effective dose of contraceptive across a single deployment secondly unlike trapping where population structures are perturbed by removal the use of hoppers is not considered to interfere with squirrel social dynamics or competition for resources which might result in some subordinate individuals being denied access to hoppers this type of behaviour was observed by beatham et al appendix c during field trials using a rhodamine bait marker to track hopper use suggesting a clear relationship between the maximum proportion of animals frequently using hoppers and the ratio of squirrels per hopper we represented this by fitting an equation of the form 1 p s h where p is the probability of a squirrel being denied access to all hoppers at a squirrel to hopper ratio of 1 1 and s h is ratio of squirrels to hoppers density of squirrels within a patch divided by the density of hoppers finally we considered scenarios where a putative contraceptive may not be completely effective and included a component representing the probability of successful contraception given sufficient dose combining these components the probability of infertility for each individual was therefore calculated as s 1 p s h 1 1 eh h we make the conservative assumption based on the lack of experimental evidence that squirrels were only infertile for a year after treatment following which individuals if not subsequently re treated were regarded as fertile and allowed to reproduce 2 3 parameterisation parameter values were selected from published literature and from previous modelling studies table 2 for simplicity and to mimic the boundary conditions of the wider gb squirrel population we adopted a maximum dispersal distance table 2 from within the range outlined by lurz et al 2001 such that our chosen study area could be considered closed realistically we recognise it is unlikely that any populations within the current gb distribution are absolutely closed and indeed previous studies have suggested pathways through which the initial invasion of our chosen region may have occurred stevenson holt 2012 we do not dispute the existence of such pathways but note that the cost of movement along them is sufficiently high and therefore frequency of movement sufficiently low that any leakages at the edges of our study area are so small they can be ignored without detriment to the experimental investigation trap encounter probability defined as the probability of an individual squirrel interacting with a trap on any given day was derived from experimental data on the relationship between estimated population size cmr and trapping success average proportion filled per day collected by beatham et al described in appendix c since the probability of all squirrels failing to enter the trap is multiplicative we determined the probability of an individual squirrel failing or avoiding the trap as the probability of failure to the nth root where n is the average squirrel population in the close vicinity of traps home range table 2 this suggested a trapping probability for any given squirrel of 0 05 conservatively we assumed the same probability for equivalent interactions with hoppers although it should be noted that empirical work using pit tags to monitor hopper visits by squirrels suggests this probability may be greater appendix c most likely due to the continuous accessibility of hoppers compared with single capture traps which could only be accessed by one individual per day the relationship between hopper use proportion of squirrels testing positive for a rhodamine bait marker against the ratio of squirrels to hoppers appendix c suggested the proportion denied access to hoppers assuming a fixed ratio of one hopper per squirrel was 0 225 consequently the maximum proportion able to access hoppers at this ratio was 0 775 2 4 simulation experiments simulations consisted of two phases an initial warm up followed by a control phase in which various management strategies were applied in the warm up phase patches were initialised with a number of adult squirrels equal to their capacity with their gender assigned at random the model was then run for 10 years allowing sufficient time for the population demographic structure to stabilise specified management strategies were then applied and the population simulated for a further 50 years for each strategy we performed 100 repetitions aggregating the results to produce comparative statistics reflecting the speed of population decline and by extension relative cost of different options in this context speed of decline was primarily defined as the time years to achieve eradication but it also described the rate of population decline percentage reduction in the first year of control as rushton et al 2002 suggested that the main cost of culling is due to the requirement for staff to inspect each trap daily this is not required during pre baiting and as such we only consider time spent active trapping for relative comparison we assumed the relative cost reflecting an investment of resource either monetary or volunteer time of fertility control to be a fifth of culling as hoppers might only need be checked weekly to replenish the bait we therefore estimate the cost of fertility control measured in cull years to be 20 of respective times to eradication beyond which management would no longer be required initially we explored culling alone to establish the level of effort expressed as density of traps deployed in each woodland required to eradicate grey squirrels from the study area the range of trap densities tested specifically 0 125 0 25 0 5 1 2 and 4 traps ha was based on that recommended by best practice guidelines 4 traps ha mayle et al 2007 gurnell and pepper 2016 and on the lower density of trap deployments used for the eradication on anglesey schuchert et al 2014 which employed an average of between 0 2 and 1 traps ha depending on woodland type across an area similar to north cumbria our calculations also assumed 4 5 days active trapping per month for each of the 9 months between february and october standard guidelines gurnell and pepper 2016 for a total of 45 days year next we explored replacing culling with fertility control for comparison of relative costs as well as control efficacy rate of decline we assumed equal densities of hoppers as traps deployed for the same period 45 days per year choosing to consider densities of 0 5 ha similar to that used at landscape scale in anglesey as no data are available on the effectiveness of oral contraceptives we tested a range of rates of induced infertility i e 50 75 90 and 100 finally we tested a sequential approach culling for one year followed by fertility control using the same fixed density of traps and hoppers as employed for fertility control alone again considering a range of contraceptive efficacy 3 results for culling fig 2 trap densities greater or equal to 0 25 traps ha guaranteed eradication within 50 years 100 percentile across repetitions with the median 50 percentile across repetitions time taken ranging from 12 years for 0 25 traps ha to 8 years for 4 traps ha table 3 initial rates of population reduction were rapid compared with fertility control alone figs 2 and 3 with mean percentage decreases after the first year of control between 50 for a trap density of 0 125 traps ha to more than 98 for trap densities greater than 0 5 trap ha fig 2 and table 3 assuming trapping was carried out for 5 day month and 9 months year i e 45 days per year conversely employing fertility control alone assuming 0 5 hoppers ha fig 3 failed to guarantee eradication within 50 years even when assuming an effective oral contraceptive 100 reduction of fertility this is not to say that eradication using fertility control never occurred but it was unlikely to be within 50 years only occurred in a few simulations approx 5 and required the use of the most effective contraceptive table 3 initial rates of population reduction were substantially slower than for culling with percentage decreases after the first year of control of 10 6 3 and 1 for contraceptive efficacies of 100 90 75 and 50 respectively fig 3 and table 3 applying an initial year of culling prior to fertility control assuming identical trap and hopper densities of 0 5 device ha fig 4 notably increased the probability of eradication within 50 years with contraceptive efficacies greater than 75 guaranteeing this outcome for these efficacies 90 and 100 the median time eradication was 10 years table 3 identical to the equivalent scenario using culling alone but with greater reliability maximum time to eradication for culling in any simulation was 39 years whereas when replaced with fertility control after one year it was 26 and 21 years assuming contraceptive efficacies of 90 and 100 respectively the model identified neighbourhoods within the study area which are more or less susceptible to the effects of management we illustrate this using a simple and plausible fertility control only scenario 75 effective showing well described areas of local eradication often close to similar areas still hosting populations resistant to management eradicated areas feature sparse networks of well separated small patches whilst resistant areas feature well connected networks of larger woodlands fig 5 b our model suggests this proximate co existence is not persistent eradication of even resistant neighbourhoods is likely albeit slow and is produced by the suppression of emigration from neighbourhoods of large and productive patches our illustration was chosen to accentuate the differences between neighbouring patches but does support two key observations similar spatial patterns in response would be observed in the more rapid approaches but for a number of the scenarios e g culling only or mixed approaches this pattern would have only been observed following the initial year of operations with eradication likely to be subsequently imminent across most of the study extent secondly we note that whilst our plausible and moderate fertility control scenario fig 5b produces a distinct heterogeneity in management outcomes multiple benefits accrue after 20 years considerable areas of the extent are free of grey squirrels and the areas where they appear resistant to management are spatially limited and host reduced populations potentially below any broad threshold for economic damage and reducing other harmful effects squirrels may have on the environment 4 discussion for the first time we describe a model for simulating grey squirrel populations incorporating effort based management using probabilistic interaction rates between individual animals and either traps or bait hoppers this study is informed by experimental data to capture realistic spatial and temporal variations in the relative efficacy of each control method specifically density dependence we compare different options based on culling fertility control and uniquely a sequential integration of the two approaches considering short term culling followed by multi year fertility control distinct from previous studies we explore how management activity might permit the maintenance of low densities of grey squirrels to mitigate their economic and environmental impacts across extensive landscapes we also illustrate how co ordinated management programmes can exploit the refined description of grey squirrel movement used here to identify local neighbourhoods within extensive landscapes for which differing combinations of population management methods might be deployed to optimise the speed and cost effectiveness of grey squirrel eradication our results agree with previous work in suggesting that culling can rapidly reduce squirrel numbers and that even a low density of traps 0 125 traps ha reduces the population by 50 in the first year however at least 0 25 traps ha must be maintained for at least 45 days per year to guarantee eradication in 50 years with an average of 0 5 traps ha the simulated median eradication time was 10 years comparable to that reported on anglesey schuchert et al 2014 comparing our results across all trapping densities indicates that at higher trap densities there were only minimal improvements in both the rate of population reduction in the first year and the eventual time to eradication but that the likelihood of a faster eradication is generally higher shorter maximum time to eradication across all simulations 100 percentile offering greater certainty of achieving this outcome as expected the model showed that fertility control alone is slower than culling to reduce populations even with a completely effective contraceptive 100 reduction in fertility only reducing populations by around 10 in the first year eradication across the study area using this method alone is unlikely to be considered more cost effective than culling assuming equivalent numbers of traps as hoppers but would be achieved eventually and would occur much sooner in landscape scale neighbourhoods fig 5 this indicates that fertility control alone would not provide a practical solution to eradicate grey squirrels but may prove invaluable at maintaining low densities sufficient to mitigate most economic and environmental problems grey squirrels produce however we note that dependant on the formulation and mode of delivery oral contraceptives may eventually become much more cost effective than assumed here for instance we have conservatively assumed that induced infertility lasts only one year inhibiting one or possible two reproductive cycles in grey squirrels in other squirrel species treated with single dose injectable contraceptive vaccines infertility may last several years in the closely related fox squirrel s niger such vaccines maintained infertility in 100 of treated animals for at least 17 months with results suggesting that infertility was likely to persist much longer krause et al 2014 in the california ground squirrel spermaphilus beechevi the proportion of lactating females were reduced by 91 the first year and 96 in the second year nash et al 2004 this might encourage deployments of fertility control in alternate years further reducing cost and effort further extending the period between hopper refills with bait from our conservative assumption of 5 days is likely to produce substantial reductions in costs refilling intervals are dependant on the nature of the bait formulation and hopper size current experimental work uses a highly palatable paste bait delivered in hoppers which requires refilling at 5 day intervals alternative formulations e g a liquid or intelligent delivery devices e g regulating access to bait may permit the use of much larger hoppers and extend servicing intervals our modelling demonstrates that rapidly reducing squirrel densities using one year of culling followed by ongoing fertility control could achieve eradication in similar time to culling alone even if the efficacy of the oral contraceptive were only 75 this sequential approach represents the most cost effective option this approach has the added benefit that for much of the period of management before eradication is achieved squirrel densities will be low potentially below any threshold associated with damage to trees in addition whilst a combination of culling and fertility control might still not be popular with stakeholders that oppose culling it might be preferable to culling as the sole method for squirrel control it should be recognised that within the scope of this comparative study we make several simplifying assumptions which may limit the immediate application to inform real world scenarios firstly similar to other modelling studies e g rushton et al 2002 jones et al 2016 we do not consider annual fluctuations in seed production which have been shown to affect squirrel numbers gurnell 1996 we have outlined in appendix a the substantial uncertainties involved in representing local seed production without a patch by patch description of tree species and their abundance i e composition of the patch for the purposes of our relative assessment this experimental choice does not affect our general conclusion that short term culling to reduce squirrel densities followed by fertility control provides a more cost effective strategy than culling alone see appendix a but does limit the model s ability to accurately predict absolute timescales and locations for removal given different management strategies for instance a good mast year may allow previously culled populations to bounce back sufficiently so as to require a more adaptive management approach interspersing long term fertility control with additional periods of culling this would need to be addressed for the model to be used as a practical tool for woodland managers secondly we deliberately model a region in the landscape which may reasonably be considered at least relatively closed i e any reinvasion is likely to be slow containing a stable population of squirrels our conclusions are therefore limited to these conditions and may not translate to situations with more open or unstable invading populations finally here we consider a best case scenario with ubiquitous control across the landscape in reality even where management is co ordinated schuchert et al 2014 landowner participation is more variable as with the other assumptions we make this scenario does not affect the validity of our relative comparison but will clearly be a key factor in the development of a practical management strategy future work will focus on this aspect of the model to better inform decision making even though our description of the value of patches to squirrels is crude producing little heterogeneity in value carrying capacity our refined description of squirrel movement between patches allows our spatially explicit model to identify neighbourhoods across our extent where management is easier i e more rapid and cost effective and eradication more likely within a limited time frame this is driven by the complexity of the inter patch networks within these neighbourhoods in our modelled landscape and the source sink dynamic they produce this observation promotes two possible benefits firstly red squirrels might be reintroduced into woodlands emptied of grey squirrels much sooner than the date of removal of the last grey squirrel anywhere in the study area our measure of eradication success although the cost of checking traps in areas where red squirrels occur will increase as these traps must be checked at least twice per day the model could be used to identify the neighbourhoods of competitor free space suitable for the re colonisation of red squirrels secondly we note that fig 5 also identifies neighbourhoods across the study area where spatially differential management strategies may produce even faster and more effective outcomes for example had one year of culling been deployed only in those neighbourhoods considered resistant to management typically large blocks of woodland able to support high densities of squirrels for which culling would be essential even moderately effective fertility control programmes across the whole landscape may offer cost effective and rapid resolutions to the problems caused by the presence of grey squirrels such programmes tailored to the character of patches or patch neighbourhoods suggest that regional scale grey squirrel management principally to reduce their density and minimise their economic and environmental impact could be extended at a relatively reasonable cost to support the targeted conservation of the red squirrel credit statement simon croft conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original draft

24688,in aquaculture dissolved oxygen do is vital to crab growth different from do in flowing water area the dynamics of do in a crab pond is deeply affected by complex interactions between organism communities and meteorological factors significant fluctuations of do content occurs within 24 h it is thus important to explore do dynamics related to various environmental factors for real time do content prediction water quality analysis and artificial aeration control in this work a dynamic model based on the diffusion theory was developed to reflect daily variations of do content at different depths in a crab pond the model focuses on evaluating the effects of macrophyte and aerator on the production of do and the effects of extinction coefficient and diffusion coefficient on the vertical distribution of do photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic macrophyte mechanical aeration mineralization and meteorological conditions were considered the model can fit experiment data with mean absolute percentage error about 6 simulation results show that the main process that produces do in the pond is photosynthesis of macrophyte which accounts for 88 2 of the do source mechanical aeration adds 9 2 of do while reaeration adds 2 6 of do the main process that consumes do is mineralization which accounts for 86 9 do sink followed by respiration of macrophyte which utilizes 13 1 do the effect of crabs on do content is small do at different depths was also simulated and it can be found that hypoxia is more likely to occur in the bottom water where diffusion coefficient decreases the established do model serves as a launching point for further research on artificial aeration control to improving aquaculture water environment keywords dissolved oxygen dynamic model photosynthesis respiration crabs pond 1 introduction water quality is critical in aquaculture production systems santos et al 2020 and dissolved oxygen do is considered to be an important water quality parameter in crab culture do content has effect on water pollution and crab metabolic activities hypoxic in aquatic systems are becoming frequent and caused great damage to aquatic fauna gilmore et al 2019 when oxygen supply is insufficient to meet the minimal demands of crabs suffocation occurs kramer 1987 feeding rate and survival rate of crabs will reduce when they are exposed to low oxygen conditions resulting in low output of aquatic products the dynamic change and equilibrium of do in a crab pond result from a combination of biological chemical and physical factors three main processes control the daily change of do content photosynthesis respiration and reaeration correagonzalez et al 2014 as the primary oxygen producer in an aquaculture ecosystem do is produced through the photosynthesis of aquatic macrophyte when the water in a pond is not saturated with do there is a movement of oxygen molecules from atmosphere to water respiration of macrophyte crab and other aquatic organisms also need do both internal and external factors affect the metabolic rates of crab external factors include water temperature ionic concentration and osmotic pressure while internal factors include body mass and size among all the factors temperature and body mass are the major concerns preez 1983 moreover mineralization such as detrital organic matter resulting from macrophyte and zooplankton mortality crab feces and residual feed consumes oxygen by oxidation several environmental factors also affect the dynamic of do such as solar irradiance water temperature ph turbidity rainfall and wind speed according to kayombo et al 2000 solar radiation is a major limiting factor for oxygen change in the daytime different from do in flowing water area the dynamics of do in a pond is deeply affected by complex interactions between organism communities and meteorological factors in order to maintain oxygen within safe limits macrophyte hydrilla varticillata ceratophyllum demersum l elodea canadensis michx and vallisneria natans lour hara is cultivated in a pond in february or march each year the planting area of aquatic macrophyte depends on human experience generally no more than two thirds of the total water area during night time the photosynthesis of macrophyte stops and the respiration of aquatic organisms is still vigorous resulting in acute hypoxia in the pond water in the noon when water temperature is higher less oxygen can be dissolved in water which may also result in hypoxia mechanical aeration is a common way to solve the problems various types of aerators have been applied in aquaculture including pump sprayers paddle wheels and diffused air systems however it is essential to predict and model do in a pond for building and controlling an optional mechanical aeration system it is thus significant to study the oxygen production capacity of macrophyte and the aerator system to provide a basis for planting macrophyte and operation of the aerator up to now several mathematical models have been proposed and different experiments were carried out to study do dynamics in various aquatic systems mechanism based models of do can be divided into zero dimensional model and multi dimensional model a zero dimensional model focuses on the processes of production and consumption of do and a multi dimensional model studies the spatial distribution of do fang and stefan 1995 simulated do distributions in stratified lakes through a one dimensional model and the analytical solution of the do transport equation in a semi infinite medium was developed a water quality model was developed to predict temperature and do stratification at several sites including thailand rwanda and honduras culberson and piedrahita 1996 plus et al 2003 developed a do model coupling physical and biological processes for the whole thau lagoon to explore the relationships among macrophytes oxygen and nitrogen cycles a two dimensional model of do distribution was implemented by benoit et al 2006 for the bottom water of the laurentian channel to verify the hypothesis that the cumulative effect of sediment can cause do depletion mandal et al 2012 proposed a do model in the creeks of sagar island with the help of a single dimension differential equation revealing that low do in the creek water is one of the causes of fish population reduction tang et al 2013 developed a system dynamic model of do for estuarine areas and reflected the effect of turbidity variation on do bocaniov and scavia 2016 used a calibrated and validated three dimensional ecological model of lake erie to extend a statistical relationship between hypoxic extent and bottom water do content a dynamic model was built to simulate the change of do in an aquaculture system of white leg shrimp sacasqui et al 2017 in recent years artificial intelligence has been used in do forecasting long short term memory lstm was applied to build a model structure to predict do in a fish pond zhu et al 2019 li et al 2020 compared the performance of recurrent neural network rnn lstm and gated recurrent unit gru drawing a conclusion that the gru has overall better performance in prediction of do however most of the mechanism models simulate the long term variations of do paying little attention to the daily change there are few models for aquacultural waters dominated by aquatic macrophyte and simulate the spatial variation of do on the basis of hydrodynamics in a crab pond although the neural network technique has good overall prediction accuracy it lacks the capability of analyzing the mechanisms of do production and consumption in this work a dynamic model was built to simulate the daily variation of do in order to assess the macrophyte biomass and mechanical aeration impact on the dynamic behavior of do furthermore do at different depths were simulated for the pond to explore the effects of extinction coefficient and diffusion coefficient on the vertical distribution of do 2 methods 2 1 dynamic model development aquatic macrophyte is usually grown by farmers to maintain do in a crab pond which is the primary photosynthetic oxygen source the influences of phytoplankton and periphyton on do were lumped into the effect of macrophyte in this work a diffused air system aerator was taken as the research object for its excellent oxygen transfer ability the crab pond was assumed to be a closed ecosystem and there is no water exchange with outside environment for the sake of calculation the biomass of macrophyte was expressed in g m 3 of dry weight content of organic matter were expressed in m m o l m 3 considering effects of physical and biochemical processes on oxygen flow the conceptual structure of the do dynamic model is shown in fig 1 the dynamic and balance of do is determined by the source and sink terms the source terms include photosynthesis of aquatic macrophyte p water surface reaeration rear and oxygen transfer rate of mechanical aeration aer the sink terms of do contain respiration by aquatic macrophyte rmac mineralization of organic matter min and respiration by crabs rcrab to describe the dynamic behavior of oxygen all the do sources and sinks were included to build a conservation equation as shown in eq 1 1 d d o d t p r e a r a e r r m a c m i n r c r a b 2 2 processes and mathematical formula 2 2 1 photosynthesis of aquatic macrophyte photosynthesis is the process by which chlorophyll absorbs light energy and transforms carbon dioxide and water into energy rich organic compounds releasing oxygen at the same time therefore photosynthesis production was assumed to be proportional to macrophyte biomass the primary production of aquatic macrophyte depends on three principal external conditions solar radiation temperature and nutrients stefan and fang 1994 in this work photoinhibition was considered and the formula for macrophyte oxygen production by photosynthesis is listed as eq 2 according to mandal et al 2012 2 p p m a c i i o p t e 1 i i o p t b where i is the water surface light intensity iopt is optimum solar radiation for macrophyte and b is macrophyte biomass pma x stands for daily maximum oxygen production rate which is influenced by water temperature t linear and exponential regressions were used to calculate the pma x of ten species of macrophyte plus et al 2003 in this work exponential regressions were used to express the relationship between pma x and t and the calculation is shown as eq 3 3 p m a x a e b t where a is regression coefficient b is temperature coefficient the exact values of them will be obtained by parameter optimization 2 2 2 respiration of aquatic macrophyte respiration is an important metabolic activity organic matter is decomposed into carbon dioxide and water releasing energy for plant growth at the same time respiration of macrophyte is related to temperature and respiration increases with water temperature in this work exponential regression was used to describe the variation of respiration rate in relation to temperature eqs 4 and 5 express the respiration process of macrophyte ondok et al 1984 4 r r e s p b 5 r e s p m e n t where resp represents the limitation function of water temperature m is regression coefficient and n is temperature coefficient 2 2 3 surface reaeration reaeration is a diffusion process between the do in water and the oxygen in air the oxygen exchange at water surface depends on gradient between do content and oxygen saturation in water the formula of water surface reaeration is shown as eq 6 from haider et al 2013 6 r e a r k e d o s a t d o where ke is the reaeration coefficient dosat is saturation content of do and it is calculated with temperature in eq 7 from michael et al 1988 7 d o s a t 14 625 0 41022 t 7 99 10 3 t 2 7 7774 10 5 t 3 reaeration coefficient is determined by wind speed and temperature according to antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 ke can be calculated by eqs 8 and 9 8 k e 20 0 2 w w 3 5 m s 0 057 w 2 w 3 5 m s 9 k e k e 20 θ r t 20 where ke20 is reaeration coefficient at 20 c w is wind speed θr is reaeration temperature coefficient whose value is 1 024 2 2 4 mechanical aeration a diffused air system aerator uses a high volume air blower to provide air to diffusers installed in water there are different diffusers used in crab aquaculture including porous ceramic tubing perforated rubber tubing and perforated plastic pipe boyd 1998 the oxygen transfer rate is influenced by gradient between do content and oxygen saturation in water as well as water temperature the actual oxygen transfer rate for a diffused air system aerator operating in a fish pond can be estimated with eq 10 10 a e r s o t r d o s a t d o 9 09 θ a t 20 24 v o l u m e α s where sotr is the oxygen transfer rate under standard conditions 20 c θa is aeration temperature coefficient α is environmental correction constant to correct the error between a crab pond and the test water volume is the volume of the crab pond and s is the working status on or off of the aerator 2 2 5 mineralization heterotrophic microorganism converts particulate organic matter into inorganic matter which can be used for the growth of aquatic organisms by mineralization this process plays an important role in material circulation of the ecosystems matson and vitousek 1981 in water column mineralization is considered to be a function of temperature the calculation of mineralization is listed as eqs 11 from chapelle et al 2000 11 m i n m i n 0 e k t t o o m c o m where min 0 is the rate of mineralization at 0 c kt is temperature coefficient of the biochemical reactions oom is o2 consumed per mmole of organic matter mineralized com is the content of organic matter 2 2 6 respiration of crab as the major aquaculture species crabs need oxygen and energy to move grow and digest food assimilation in crabs depends on the use of oxygen to metabolize leading to a decrease in do content zou et al 1995 determined the effect of mass and temperature on the respiration rate of eriocheir sinensis different sizes of which were chosen to conduct comparative experiments eq 12 was used in this work to calculate the respiration rate according to zou 12 r c r a b a 1 e 2 351 0 138 t m β where a is the limitation for crab respiration m is crab mass g m 3 β is crab mass coefficient which is a negative constant 2 3 do distribution at different depths the one dimensional vertical transport of do in the crab ponds is described by the diffusion equation in the form of eq 13 salomone et al 2000 13 d o t d 2 d o z s where d is the diffusion coefficient m 2 d a y 1 z is the pond depth and s is the term of all do sources and sinks acting in each layer in lake environment the diffusion coefficient of oxygen d has been formulated with dependence on horizontal area and stability frequency which is related to water density hondzo and stefan 1993 however crab ponds are much shallower than lakes so the vertical stratification structural change of aquaculture waters is not obvious therefore d is taken as constant with respect to depth and time in this work irradiance decreases with depth and water absorbs part of the spectrum fur et al 2018 considered the effect of solar radiation attenuation on the vertical distribution of do the formula for the variation of solar radiation with depth was used which is shown as eq 14 14 i z i e e c z where iz is solar radiation at depth z i is solar radiation at water surface ec is the extinction coefficient of water the ordinary differential eqns 1 was solved by using the fourth order runge kutta method with a time step of 10 min the calculation steps of this method can be found in hussain et al 2016 the partial differential eq 13 was solved by using a half implicit crank nicolson method unlike explicit and implicit finite difference methods which have limitations on diffusion coefficients time step sizes and layer thickness the crank nicolson method allows stable numerical solution of the diffusion equation with no restrictions after discretization by the crank nicolson difference method eq 13 can be written as eq 15 15 r d p i 1 j 1 r d p j 1 j 1 2 2 r d p i j 1 r d p i 1 j 2 2 r d p i j r d p i 1 j 1 2 δ t s i j s i j 1 where pi j represents the content of do in space z z i δ t and time t t j δ t and r δ t δ x 2 finally a system of linear algebraic equations which have tridiagonal matrices was obtained as eq 16 16 2 2 r d r d 0 0 0 0 0 r d 2 2 r d 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 r d r d 0 0 0 0 0 r d 2 2 r d p 1 j 1 p 2 j 1 p n 3 j 1 p n 2 j 1 2 r d p 0 j 2 2 r d p 1 j r d p 2 j 2 r d p 1 j 2 2 r d p 2 j r d p 3 j 2 r d p n 4 j 2 2 r d p n 3 j r d p n 2 j 2 r d p n 3 j 2 2 r d p n 2 j r d p n 1 j 1 2 t s 1 j s 1 j 1 1 2 t s 2 j s 2 j 1 1 2 t s n 3 j s n 3 j 1 1 2 t s n 2 j s n 2 j 1 the system of linear equations above is solved by the thomas algorithm 2 4 model validation and sensitivity analysis in order to make the output of the model consistent with real situation model calibration is essential the photosynthesis and respiration rates of different types of aquatic macrophytes are not identical and the oxygen transfer rates of the aerator in different water environments are not the same the selected parameters in these three processes thus need to be adjusted the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used for parameter optimization the calculation steps of the levenberg marquardt algorithm can be found in ampazis and perantonis 2000 in order to test the fitting performance of the model the experimental data which are different from calibration data were used for model validation in this work mean absolute percentage error mape was used to evaluate model performance and the calculation formulas is listed as eq 17 17 mape 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i where n is the number of samples y i is the measurement y i is the model prediction sensitivity analysis was used to measure the influence of model parameters on the change of do the formula of sensitivity analysis is list as eq 18 18 s e n s i t i v i t y 100 r 1 n i 1 n v i v i v i where r is the variation range of parameters 10 or 10 n is the sample number simulated v i is the new variable value of do and v i is the original value simulated 3 experiments a chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis pond in the west taihu lake was measured the west taihu lake is the one of the most important breeding areas for crabs in china located in the northeast of yixing city jiangsu province china the total area of crab farming in this water area can reach 80 million square meters with an annual output of 10 000 tons the crab pond is a square with a side length of 200 m and depth of about 1 meter elodea canadensis michx was chosen to be cultivated in pond water in february for its great adaptability perforated plastic pipes were arranged in water at equal intervals for mechanical aeration the age of crabs was about 20 months and the crab had been already in its mature stage the water ph was in the range of 7 5 to 9 and the water temperature was in the range of 13 to 25 effect of turbidity on dissolved oxygen was reflected in the extinction coefficient of the one dimensional model the data were collected in november the data of do content water temperature used for the dynamic model were measured directly by a sensor set in the middle of the pond and the measurement interval was 10 min the operating condition of the aerator was recorded and saved through a data platform the data of solar radiation wind speed were gained through the local meteorological administration and the measurement interval was 1 min 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation and simulation data used for the dynamic model were collected in nov 1 2019 to nov 15 2019 linear interpolation was used to fill missing values and due to the inconsistency of data collection frequency exponentially weighted moving average ema was used to eliminate random perturbations of data experimental data were fit by the developed model through the levenberg marquardt algorithm example comparisons of experimental data with model fitting were shown in fig 2 and the estimated model parameters were listed in table 1 the mean absolute percentage error is about 6 the dynamic model can perform well in reflecting daily change of do to reflect the effects of different biochemical and physical processes on the change of do the oxygen contribution rate of these processes were simulated and shown in fig 3 fig 4 shows the mass balance of the simulated do to reflect do production or do consumption per liter of water within one day for each process from fig 3 it can be seen that the photosynthetic rate increases with solar radiation during the daytime and it will reach the maximum at the optimal solar radiation when the solar radiation exceeds the optimum value photosynthesis will recede the effect of water temperature on photosynthesis is positive and the photosynthetic rate increases with temperature under the same solar radiation the trend of respiration rate of macrophyte and mineralization rate are similar positively correlated with water temperature the correlation value between water temperature and respiration rate of macrophyte is 0 98 p 0 001 the correlation value between water temperature and mineralization rate is 0 99 p 0 001 reaeration rate is limited by wind speed at the time mechanical aeration rate is limited by working status and aeration rate is negatively correlated with water temperature when the aerator is turned on fig 3 shows that the main process that produces do in the pond is photosynthesis of macrophyte which accounts for 88 2 of the do source mechanical aeration adds 9 2 of do while reaeration adds 2 6 of do the main process that consumes do is mineralization which accounts for 86 9 do sink followed by respiration of macrophyte which utilizes 13 08 do the effect of crab respiration on do is much less than the formers accounting for 0 02 do sink 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out to show the changes of do within one day when each parameter is 10 or 10 modified the result is shown in table 2 sensitivity analysis reveals that the changes of regression coefficient a temperature coefficient of photosynthesis b mineralization rate min0 and temperature coefficient of mineralization kt have greater effects on do when the value of b is increased by 10 3 64 rise in the content of do is noticed the do content is decreased by 3 27 when the parameter b is decreased by 10 the content of do is enhanced by 3 22 and decreased by the same rate when a is perturbed up and down by 10 a fall of 3 38 in do content is noted when the value of kt is increased by 10 a rise of 3 09 is observed when the value of the same parameter is decreased by 10 the sensitivity of sotr and α is the lowest in all the parameters because the content of do is enhanced by 0 13 and decreased by the same rate when these two parameters are perturbed up and down by 10 in photosynthesis and aeration process temperature coefficient b and θa are the most sensitive parameters respectively so the change of temperature has the greatest impact on these two processes when the average sunshine time is 10 h and the average solar radiation is 300 w m 2 table 3 shows the daily do yield of macrophyte g m 3 d a y 1 in different temperature and biomass levels table 4 shows the actual oxygen transfer rate g m 3 h 1 of the aerator at different temperatures and do levels it is noticed from these two tables that the oxygen production capacity of macrophyte increases with temperature rise and the aeration effect of the aerator is more obvious at low temperatures 4 3 simulation of do content at different depths in order to carry out the numerical calculation of the diffusion equation exponential interpolation was used to expand the do data in the vertical direction when the value of extinction coefficient ec and diffusion coefficient d is set as 1 8 and 0 2 vertical model predictions using the data of water temperature wind speed and solar radiation collected in may 2020 are shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be noticed that the content of do varies at different depths do content is higher in the surface water and lower in the bottom water but the variation trend of do at different depths is consistent the changes of do under different ec are shown in fig 6 fig 6 indicates that different values of ec results in changes of do content at different depths the content of do will decrease with the increase of ec and this trend of change occurs at different water layers the changes of do under different d are shown in fig 7 fig 7 indicates that parameter d has a greater impact on the do of the surface and bottom layers in surface water the increase of d results in further reduction in the do content while the increase of d results in continuous increase in do content in bottom water the value of do in the middle water is less sensitive to the change of ec 4 4 discussion the influence of macrophyte microorganisms and crab on dissolved oxygen in aquatic environment of aquaculture was studied and it was found that macrophyte was the major body of do production and microorganisms consumed most of the do for decomposition of organic matter while crabs themselves did not consume much do therefore in order to maintain the oxygen content required for the survival of crabs it is necessary to focus on the organic treatment and early stage of macrophyte cultivation in literature some mechanism based do models were built for flowing water which cannot be applied to a crab pond because planted macrophyte and mechanical aerators are used to produce do the proposed do model in this work is an attempt to model do in a crab pond which is complimentary to do models in literature components such as photosynthesis and respiration of macrophyte aeration of diffused air system respiration of eriocheir sinensis are included in the model structure which is a supplement to the current model of do in flowing water areas the model focuses on the contribution of macrophyte to do which is different to fang and stefan 1995 and chapelle et al 2000 the simulation results of the one dimensional model show that the do content changes periodically with its maximum value at daytime and minimum value at night which is consistent with the prediction of the aquaculture pond ecosystem model proposed by culberson and piedrahita 1996 do production or consumption rate of different processes are presented in this study which received little attention by other researchers the simulations of these components help farmers understand the impact of various processes on do sensitivity analysis is a measure of the influence of model parameters on the change of do simulation of do yield of macrophyte and actual oxygen transfer rate of the aerator at different scenarios can be a tool when farmers try to know the effects on do levels in crab pond with the changes in macrophyte biomass and aerator management do content at different depths is simulated in this work it is found that the do content shows a decreasing trend from the top to the bottom water layer which is consistent with bocaniov et al 2016 the extinction coefficient d and extinction coefficient ec are important parameters in vertical distribution of do the simulation results show that the do content will decrease as ec increases in each water layer it can be inferred that the higher the attenuation degree of solar radiation the lower the oxygen content in water layers studying the effect of ec on do at different depths is a supplement to the zero dimensional model built by mandal et al 2012 in bottom water the decrease of d results in further reduction in the do content indicating that do content of the bottom layer depends on the supplement of the upper layer water by diffusion this result is consistent with antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 the simulation of do content at different water layers helps farmers evaluate the trend of do in crab pond at any depth the present model only analyzes the relationship between do and finite variables but the limitation of ph ammonia and nitrate on photosynthesis are also worth considering the change of macrophyte biomass in vertical direction has not been discussed besides the effects of crab mass per unit volume and temperature on respiration of crabs were discussed in this study in order to make its metabolic model more accurate the crab s age density developmental or reproduction status are also worthy of consideration in future research the dynamic model of do provide reference for control modeling of aerator the vertical simulation serves as a launching point for further research on a three dimensional do models for crab ponds 5 conclusion in this study a dynamic model was built to reflect the daily change of do in aquaculture the model comprehensively considers the impact of macrophyte air diffusion and mechanical aerators on do production and various factors for do consumption the model could fit experimentally measured do content with small error around 6 simulation results show that the main process that produces do in the pond is photosynthesis of macrophyte which accounts for 88 2 of the do source the main process that consumes do is mineralization which accounts for 86 9 do sink do at different depths was also simulated based on the diffusion equation the simulation results show that the do content of the bottom layer mainly depends on the supplement of the upper layer water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

24688,in aquaculture dissolved oxygen do is vital to crab growth different from do in flowing water area the dynamics of do in a crab pond is deeply affected by complex interactions between organism communities and meteorological factors significant fluctuations of do content occurs within 24 h it is thus important to explore do dynamics related to various environmental factors for real time do content prediction water quality analysis and artificial aeration control in this work a dynamic model based on the diffusion theory was developed to reflect daily variations of do content at different depths in a crab pond the model focuses on evaluating the effects of macrophyte and aerator on the production of do and the effects of extinction coefficient and diffusion coefficient on the vertical distribution of do photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic macrophyte mechanical aeration mineralization and meteorological conditions were considered the model can fit experiment data with mean absolute percentage error about 6 simulation results show that the main process that produces do in the pond is photosynthesis of macrophyte which accounts for 88 2 of the do source mechanical aeration adds 9 2 of do while reaeration adds 2 6 of do the main process that consumes do is mineralization which accounts for 86 9 do sink followed by respiration of macrophyte which utilizes 13 1 do the effect of crabs on do content is small do at different depths was also simulated and it can be found that hypoxia is more likely to occur in the bottom water where diffusion coefficient decreases the established do model serves as a launching point for further research on artificial aeration control to improving aquaculture water environment keywords dissolved oxygen dynamic model photosynthesis respiration crabs pond 1 introduction water quality is critical in aquaculture production systems santos et al 2020 and dissolved oxygen do is considered to be an important water quality parameter in crab culture do content has effect on water pollution and crab metabolic activities hypoxic in aquatic systems are becoming frequent and caused great damage to aquatic fauna gilmore et al 2019 when oxygen supply is insufficient to meet the minimal demands of crabs suffocation occurs kramer 1987 feeding rate and survival rate of crabs will reduce when they are exposed to low oxygen conditions resulting in low output of aquatic products the dynamic change and equilibrium of do in a crab pond result from a combination of biological chemical and physical factors three main processes control the daily change of do content photosynthesis respiration and reaeration correagonzalez et al 2014 as the primary oxygen producer in an aquaculture ecosystem do is produced through the photosynthesis of aquatic macrophyte when the water in a pond is not saturated with do there is a movement of oxygen molecules from atmosphere to water respiration of macrophyte crab and other aquatic organisms also need do both internal and external factors affect the metabolic rates of crab external factors include water temperature ionic concentration and osmotic pressure while internal factors include body mass and size among all the factors temperature and body mass are the major concerns preez 1983 moreover mineralization such as detrital organic matter resulting from macrophyte and zooplankton mortality crab feces and residual feed consumes oxygen by oxidation several environmental factors also affect the dynamic of do such as solar irradiance water temperature ph turbidity rainfall and wind speed according to kayombo et al 2000 solar radiation is a major limiting factor for oxygen change in the daytime different from do in flowing water area the dynamics of do in a pond is deeply affected by complex interactions between organism communities and meteorological factors in order to maintain oxygen within safe limits macrophyte hydrilla varticillata ceratophyllum demersum l elodea canadensis michx and vallisneria natans lour hara is cultivated in a pond in february or march each year the planting area of aquatic macrophyte depends on human experience generally no more than two thirds of the total water area during night time the photosynthesis of macrophyte stops and the respiration of aquatic organisms is still vigorous resulting in acute hypoxia in the pond water in the noon when water temperature is higher less oxygen can be dissolved in water which may also result in hypoxia mechanical aeration is a common way to solve the problems various types of aerators have been applied in aquaculture including pump sprayers paddle wheels and diffused air systems however it is essential to predict and model do in a pond for building and controlling an optional mechanical aeration system it is thus significant to study the oxygen production capacity of macrophyte and the aerator system to provide a basis for planting macrophyte and operation of the aerator up to now several mathematical models have been proposed and different experiments were carried out to study do dynamics in various aquatic systems mechanism based models of do can be divided into zero dimensional model and multi dimensional model a zero dimensional model focuses on the processes of production and consumption of do and a multi dimensional model studies the spatial distribution of do fang and stefan 1995 simulated do distributions in stratified lakes through a one dimensional model and the analytical solution of the do transport equation in a semi infinite medium was developed a water quality model was developed to predict temperature and do stratification at several sites including thailand rwanda and honduras culberson and piedrahita 1996 plus et al 2003 developed a do model coupling physical and biological processes for the whole thau lagoon to explore the relationships among macrophytes oxygen and nitrogen cycles a two dimensional model of do distribution was implemented by benoit et al 2006 for the bottom water of the laurentian channel to verify the hypothesis that the cumulative effect of sediment can cause do depletion mandal et al 2012 proposed a do model in the creeks of sagar island with the help of a single dimension differential equation revealing that low do in the creek water is one of the causes of fish population reduction tang et al 2013 developed a system dynamic model of do for estuarine areas and reflected the effect of turbidity variation on do bocaniov and scavia 2016 used a calibrated and validated three dimensional ecological model of lake erie to extend a statistical relationship between hypoxic extent and bottom water do content a dynamic model was built to simulate the change of do in an aquaculture system of white leg shrimp sacasqui et al 2017 in recent years artificial intelligence has been used in do forecasting long short term memory lstm was applied to build a model structure to predict do in a fish pond zhu et al 2019 li et al 2020 compared the performance of recurrent neural network rnn lstm and gated recurrent unit gru drawing a conclusion that the gru has overall better performance in prediction of do however most of the mechanism models simulate the long term variations of do paying little attention to the daily change there are few models for aquacultural waters dominated by aquatic macrophyte and simulate the spatial variation of do on the basis of hydrodynamics in a crab pond although the neural network technique has good overall prediction accuracy it lacks the capability of analyzing the mechanisms of do production and consumption in this work a dynamic model was built to simulate the daily variation of do in order to assess the macrophyte biomass and mechanical aeration impact on the dynamic behavior of do furthermore do at different depths were simulated for the pond to explore the effects of extinction coefficient and diffusion coefficient on the vertical distribution of do 2 methods 2 1 dynamic model development aquatic macrophyte is usually grown by farmers to maintain do in a crab pond which is the primary photosynthetic oxygen source the influences of phytoplankton and periphyton on do were lumped into the effect of macrophyte in this work a diffused air system aerator was taken as the research object for its excellent oxygen transfer ability the crab pond was assumed to be a closed ecosystem and there is no water exchange with outside environment for the sake of calculation the biomass of macrophyte was expressed in g m 3 of dry weight content of organic matter were expressed in m m o l m 3 considering effects of physical and biochemical processes on oxygen flow the conceptual structure of the do dynamic model is shown in fig 1 the dynamic and balance of do is determined by the source and sink terms the source terms include photosynthesis of aquatic macrophyte p water surface reaeration rear and oxygen transfer rate of mechanical aeration aer the sink terms of do contain respiration by aquatic macrophyte rmac mineralization of organic matter min and respiration by crabs rcrab to describe the dynamic behavior of oxygen all the do sources and sinks were included to build a conservation equation as shown in eq 1 1 d d o d t p r e a r a e r r m a c m i n r c r a b 2 2 processes and mathematical formula 2 2 1 photosynthesis of aquatic macrophyte photosynthesis is the process by which chlorophyll absorbs light energy and transforms carbon dioxide and water into energy rich organic compounds releasing oxygen at the same time therefore photosynthesis production was assumed to be proportional to macrophyte biomass the primary production of aquatic macrophyte depends on three principal external conditions solar radiation temperature and nutrients stefan and fang 1994 in this work photoinhibition was considered and the formula for macrophyte oxygen production by photosynthesis is listed as eq 2 according to mandal et al 2012 2 p p m a c i i o p t e 1 i i o p t b where i is the water surface light intensity iopt is optimum solar radiation for macrophyte and b is macrophyte biomass pma x stands for daily maximum oxygen production rate which is influenced by water temperature t linear and exponential regressions were used to calculate the pma x of ten species of macrophyte plus et al 2003 in this work exponential regressions were used to express the relationship between pma x and t and the calculation is shown as eq 3 3 p m a x a e b t where a is regression coefficient b is temperature coefficient the exact values of them will be obtained by parameter optimization 2 2 2 respiration of aquatic macrophyte respiration is an important metabolic activity organic matter is decomposed into carbon dioxide and water releasing energy for plant growth at the same time respiration of macrophyte is related to temperature and respiration increases with water temperature in this work exponential regression was used to describe the variation of respiration rate in relation to temperature eqs 4 and 5 express the respiration process of macrophyte ondok et al 1984 4 r r e s p b 5 r e s p m e n t where resp represents the limitation function of water temperature m is regression coefficient and n is temperature coefficient 2 2 3 surface reaeration reaeration is a diffusion process between the do in water and the oxygen in air the oxygen exchange at water surface depends on gradient between do content and oxygen saturation in water the formula of water surface reaeration is shown as eq 6 from haider et al 2013 6 r e a r k e d o s a t d o where ke is the reaeration coefficient dosat is saturation content of do and it is calculated with temperature in eq 7 from michael et al 1988 7 d o s a t 14 625 0 41022 t 7 99 10 3 t 2 7 7774 10 5 t 3 reaeration coefficient is determined by wind speed and temperature according to antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 ke can be calculated by eqs 8 and 9 8 k e 20 0 2 w w 3 5 m s 0 057 w 2 w 3 5 m s 9 k e k e 20 θ r t 20 where ke20 is reaeration coefficient at 20 c w is wind speed θr is reaeration temperature coefficient whose value is 1 024 2 2 4 mechanical aeration a diffused air system aerator uses a high volume air blower to provide air to diffusers installed in water there are different diffusers used in crab aquaculture including porous ceramic tubing perforated rubber tubing and perforated plastic pipe boyd 1998 the oxygen transfer rate is influenced by gradient between do content and oxygen saturation in water as well as water temperature the actual oxygen transfer rate for a diffused air system aerator operating in a fish pond can be estimated with eq 10 10 a e r s o t r d o s a t d o 9 09 θ a t 20 24 v o l u m e α s where sotr is the oxygen transfer rate under standard conditions 20 c θa is aeration temperature coefficient α is environmental correction constant to correct the error between a crab pond and the test water volume is the volume of the crab pond and s is the working status on or off of the aerator 2 2 5 mineralization heterotrophic microorganism converts particulate organic matter into inorganic matter which can be used for the growth of aquatic organisms by mineralization this process plays an important role in material circulation of the ecosystems matson and vitousek 1981 in water column mineralization is considered to be a function of temperature the calculation of mineralization is listed as eqs 11 from chapelle et al 2000 11 m i n m i n 0 e k t t o o m c o m where min 0 is the rate of mineralization at 0 c kt is temperature coefficient of the biochemical reactions oom is o2 consumed per mmole of organic matter mineralized com is the content of organic matter 2 2 6 respiration of crab as the major aquaculture species crabs need oxygen and energy to move grow and digest food assimilation in crabs depends on the use of oxygen to metabolize leading to a decrease in do content zou et al 1995 determined the effect of mass and temperature on the respiration rate of eriocheir sinensis different sizes of which were chosen to conduct comparative experiments eq 12 was used in this work to calculate the respiration rate according to zou 12 r c r a b a 1 e 2 351 0 138 t m β where a is the limitation for crab respiration m is crab mass g m 3 β is crab mass coefficient which is a negative constant 2 3 do distribution at different depths the one dimensional vertical transport of do in the crab ponds is described by the diffusion equation in the form of eq 13 salomone et al 2000 13 d o t d 2 d o z s where d is the diffusion coefficient m 2 d a y 1 z is the pond depth and s is the term of all do sources and sinks acting in each layer in lake environment the diffusion coefficient of oxygen d has been formulated with dependence on horizontal area and stability frequency which is related to water density hondzo and stefan 1993 however crab ponds are much shallower than lakes so the vertical stratification structural change of aquaculture waters is not obvious therefore d is taken as constant with respect to depth and time in this work irradiance decreases with depth and water absorbs part of the spectrum fur et al 2018 considered the effect of solar radiation attenuation on the vertical distribution of do the formula for the variation of solar radiation with depth was used which is shown as eq 14 14 i z i e e c z where iz is solar radiation at depth z i is solar radiation at water surface ec is the extinction coefficient of water the ordinary differential eqns 1 was solved by using the fourth order runge kutta method with a time step of 10 min the calculation steps of this method can be found in hussain et al 2016 the partial differential eq 13 was solved by using a half implicit crank nicolson method unlike explicit and implicit finite difference methods which have limitations on diffusion coefficients time step sizes and layer thickness the crank nicolson method allows stable numerical solution of the diffusion equation with no restrictions after discretization by the crank nicolson difference method eq 13 can be written as eq 15 15 r d p i 1 j 1 r d p j 1 j 1 2 2 r d p i j 1 r d p i 1 j 2 2 r d p i j r d p i 1 j 1 2 δ t s i j s i j 1 where pi j represents the content of do in space z z i δ t and time t t j δ t and r δ t δ x 2 finally a system of linear algebraic equations which have tridiagonal matrices was obtained as eq 16 16 2 2 r d r d 0 0 0 0 0 r d 2 2 r d 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 r d r d 0 0 0 0 0 r d 2 2 r d p 1 j 1 p 2 j 1 p n 3 j 1 p n 2 j 1 2 r d p 0 j 2 2 r d p 1 j r d p 2 j 2 r d p 1 j 2 2 r d p 2 j r d p 3 j 2 r d p n 4 j 2 2 r d p n 3 j r d p n 2 j 2 r d p n 3 j 2 2 r d p n 2 j r d p n 1 j 1 2 t s 1 j s 1 j 1 1 2 t s 2 j s 2 j 1 1 2 t s n 3 j s n 3 j 1 1 2 t s n 2 j s n 2 j 1 the system of linear equations above is solved by the thomas algorithm 2 4 model validation and sensitivity analysis in order to make the output of the model consistent with real situation model calibration is essential the photosynthesis and respiration rates of different types of aquatic macrophytes are not identical and the oxygen transfer rates of the aerator in different water environments are not the same the selected parameters in these three processes thus need to be adjusted the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used for parameter optimization the calculation steps of the levenberg marquardt algorithm can be found in ampazis and perantonis 2000 in order to test the fitting performance of the model the experimental data which are different from calibration data were used for model validation in this work mean absolute percentage error mape was used to evaluate model performance and the calculation formulas is listed as eq 17 17 mape 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i where n is the number of samples y i is the measurement y i is the model prediction sensitivity analysis was used to measure the influence of model parameters on the change of do the formula of sensitivity analysis is list as eq 18 18 s e n s i t i v i t y 100 r 1 n i 1 n v i v i v i where r is the variation range of parameters 10 or 10 n is the sample number simulated v i is the new variable value of do and v i is the original value simulated 3 experiments a chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis pond in the west taihu lake was measured the west taihu lake is the one of the most important breeding areas for crabs in china located in the northeast of yixing city jiangsu province china the total area of crab farming in this water area can reach 80 million square meters with an annual output of 10 000 tons the crab pond is a square with a side length of 200 m and depth of about 1 meter elodea canadensis michx was chosen to be cultivated in pond water in february for its great adaptability perforated plastic pipes were arranged in water at equal intervals for mechanical aeration the age of crabs was about 20 months and the crab had been already in its mature stage the water ph was in the range of 7 5 to 9 and the water temperature was in the range of 13 to 25 effect of turbidity on dissolved oxygen was reflected in the extinction coefficient of the one dimensional model the data were collected in november the data of do content water temperature used for the dynamic model were measured directly by a sensor set in the middle of the pond and the measurement interval was 10 min the operating condition of the aerator was recorded and saved through a data platform the data of solar radiation wind speed were gained through the local meteorological administration and the measurement interval was 1 min 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation and simulation data used for the dynamic model were collected in nov 1 2019 to nov 15 2019 linear interpolation was used to fill missing values and due to the inconsistency of data collection frequency exponentially weighted moving average ema was used to eliminate random perturbations of data experimental data were fit by the developed model through the levenberg marquardt algorithm example comparisons of experimental data with model fitting were shown in fig 2 and the estimated model parameters were listed in table 1 the mean absolute percentage error is about 6 the dynamic model can perform well in reflecting daily change of do to reflect the effects of different biochemical and physical processes on the change of do the oxygen contribution rate of these processes were simulated and shown in fig 3 fig 4 shows the mass balance of the simulated do to reflect do production or do consumption per liter of water within one day for each process from fig 3 it can be seen that the photosynthetic rate increases with solar radiation during the daytime and it will reach the maximum at the optimal solar radiation when the solar radiation exceeds the optimum value photosynthesis will recede the effect of water temperature on photosynthesis is positive and the photosynthetic rate increases with temperature under the same solar radiation the trend of respiration rate of macrophyte and mineralization rate are similar positively correlated with water temperature the correlation value between water temperature and respiration rate of macrophyte is 0 98 p 0 001 the correlation value between water temperature and mineralization rate is 0 99 p 0 001 reaeration rate is limited by wind speed at the time mechanical aeration rate is limited by working status and aeration rate is negatively correlated with water temperature when the aerator is turned on fig 3 shows that the main process that produces do in the pond is photosynthesis of macrophyte which accounts for 88 2 of the do source mechanical aeration adds 9 2 of do while reaeration adds 2 6 of do the main process that consumes do is mineralization which accounts for 86 9 do sink followed by respiration of macrophyte which utilizes 13 08 do the effect of crab respiration on do is much less than the formers accounting for 0 02 do sink 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out to show the changes of do within one day when each parameter is 10 or 10 modified the result is shown in table 2 sensitivity analysis reveals that the changes of regression coefficient a temperature coefficient of photosynthesis b mineralization rate min0 and temperature coefficient of mineralization kt have greater effects on do when the value of b is increased by 10 3 64 rise in the content of do is noticed the do content is decreased by 3 27 when the parameter b is decreased by 10 the content of do is enhanced by 3 22 and decreased by the same rate when a is perturbed up and down by 10 a fall of 3 38 in do content is noted when the value of kt is increased by 10 a rise of 3 09 is observed when the value of the same parameter is decreased by 10 the sensitivity of sotr and α is the lowest in all the parameters because the content of do is enhanced by 0 13 and decreased by the same rate when these two parameters are perturbed up and down by 10 in photosynthesis and aeration process temperature coefficient b and θa are the most sensitive parameters respectively so the change of temperature has the greatest impact on these two processes when the average sunshine time is 10 h and the average solar radiation is 300 w m 2 table 3 shows the daily do yield of macrophyte g m 3 d a y 1 in different temperature and biomass levels table 4 shows the actual oxygen transfer rate g m 3 h 1 of the aerator at different temperatures and do levels it is noticed from these two tables that the oxygen production capacity of macrophyte increases with temperature rise and the aeration effect of the aerator is more obvious at low temperatures 4 3 simulation of do content at different depths in order to carry out the numerical calculation of the diffusion equation exponential interpolation was used to expand the do data in the vertical direction when the value of extinction coefficient ec and diffusion coefficient d is set as 1 8 and 0 2 vertical model predictions using the data of water temperature wind speed and solar radiation collected in may 2020 are shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be noticed that the content of do varies at different depths do content is higher in the surface water and lower in the bottom water but the variation trend of do at different depths is consistent the changes of do under different ec are shown in fig 6 fig 6 indicates that different values of ec results in changes of do content at different depths the content of do will decrease with the increase of ec and this trend of change occurs at different water layers the changes of do under different d are shown in fig 7 fig 7 indicates that parameter d has a greater impact on the do of the surface and bottom layers in surface water the increase of d results in further reduction in the do content while the increase of d results in continuous increase in do content in bottom water the value of do in the middle water is less sensitive to the change of ec 4 4 discussion the influence of macrophyte microorganisms and crab on dissolved oxygen in aquatic environment of aquaculture was studied and it was found that macrophyte was the major body of do production and microorganisms consumed most of the do for decomposition of organic matter while crabs themselves did not consume much do therefore in order to maintain the oxygen content required for the survival of crabs it is necessary to focus on the organic treatment and early stage of macrophyte cultivation in literature some mechanism based do models were built for flowing water which cannot be applied to a crab pond because planted macrophyte and mechanical aerators are used to produce do the proposed do model in this work is an attempt to model do in a crab pond which is complimentary to do models in literature components such as photosynthesis and respiration of macrophyte aeration of diffused air system respiration of eriocheir sinensis are included in the model structure which is a supplement to the current model of do in flowing water areas the model focuses on the contribution of macrophyte to do which is different to fang and stefan 1995 and chapelle et al 2000 the simulation results of the one dimensional model show that the do content changes periodically with its maximum value at daytime and minimum value at night which is consistent with the prediction of the aquaculture pond ecosystem model proposed by culberson and piedrahita 1996 do production or consumption rate of different processes are presented in this study which received little attention by other researchers the simulations of these components help farmers understand the impact of various processes on do sensitivity analysis is a measure of the influence of model parameters on the change of do simulation of do yield of macrophyte and actual oxygen transfer rate of the aerator at different scenarios can be a tool when farmers try to know the effects on do levels in crab pond with the changes in macrophyte biomass and aerator management do content at different depths is simulated in this work it is found that the do content shows a decreasing trend from the top to the bottom water layer which is consistent with bocaniov et al 2016 the extinction coefficient d and extinction coefficient ec are important parameters in vertical distribution of do the simulation results show that the do content will decrease as ec increases in each water layer it can be inferred that the higher the attenuation degree of solar radiation the lower the oxygen content in water layers studying the effect of ec on do at different depths is a supplement to the zero dimensional model built by mandal et al 2012 in bottom water the decrease of d results in further reduction in the do content indicating that do content of the bottom layer depends on the supplement of the upper layer water by diffusion this result is consistent with antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 the simulation of do content at different water layers helps farmers evaluate the trend of do in crab pond at any depth the present model only analyzes the relationship between do and finite variables but the limitation of ph ammonia and nitrate on photosynthesis are also worth considering the change of macrophyte biomass in vertical direction has not been discussed besides the effects of crab mass per unit volume and temperature on respiration of crabs were discussed in this study in order to make its metabolic model more accurate the crab s age density developmental or reproduction status are also worthy of consideration in future research the dynamic model of do provide reference for control modeling of aerator the vertical simulation serves as a launching point for further research on a three dimensional do models for crab ponds 5 conclusion in this study a dynamic model was built to reflect the daily change of do in aquaculture the model comprehensively considers the impact of macrophyte air diffusion and mechanical aerators on do production and various factors for do consumption the model could fit experimentally measured do content with small error around 6 simulation results show that the main process that produces do in the pond is photosynthesis of macrophyte which accounts for 88 2 of the do source the main process that consumes do is mineralization which accounts for 86 9 do sink do at different depths was also simulated based on the diffusion equation the simulation results show that the do content of the bottom layer mainly depends on the supplement of the upper layer water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

24689,the modeling of continuous transfers of carbon c and nitrogen n previously published in the literature has paid little attention to the functional role of micro organisms in general only monoculture systems have been modeled furthermore there have been few experiments under field conditions at farm scale where clear evidence for the benefits of intercropping is lacking this work focus on mechanistic modeling approaches based on the ecological functioning of the microbial biomass to quantify the daily exchange of c and n between plant organs micro organisms rhizobial symbionts soil compartments and the atmosphere in an arable intercropping system the momos model was validated on c and n data collected from a common bean phaseolus vulgaris l cv el djadida and maize zea mays l cv filou intercropping system the experiment was performed at two field sites that were chosen with farmers to represent both high and low soil p availability the results show that all c and n exchanges were successfully predicted at 5 significance and that they depend on the phenological stage especially the flowering stage increased c allocation from photosynthesis to roots contributed to increasing both grain yield and n grain for intercropped maize c and n stocks in the common bean nodules were lower in intercropping than in monocultures and this is associated with the decrease of total atmospheric nitrogen n2 fixation by intercropped common beans in particular with a high soil p however the rate of n2 fixation was higher in the intercrops than in the monoculture when the soil is p deficient micro organisms were responsible for most of the c losses from the soil to the atmosphere but intercropping significantly reduced the c losses by improving micro organism c use efficiency these results uncover the strong link between n and c stocks confirming the robustness of the newly formulated momos equations that are validated in this paper this agroecological modeling experiment demonstrated the functional role of microbial biomass in both the growth of the intercrops crop and their symbiosis improving the prediction of the daily c and n flows between plant organs soil compartments and the atmosphere keywords intercropping micro organisms plant symbionts mechanistic models continuous exchange 1 introduction the legume cereal monocropping system is the most

atmosphere the soil organic matter som content is one of the key biogeochemical indicators that need to be assessed in a soil fertility analysis xu et al 2013 the availability of c and n soil resources depends largely on the composition and structure of the microbial community as it is dependent on the growth stage of micro organisms and the environmental conditions cotner et al 2006 sikorski 2015 latati et al 2017 microorganisms as well as many other biological activities are considered as a substantial short and long term source of bio available c and n for crops tang et al 2014 however crop systems can be sustainably managed over time by rotation and using fallow periods and space intercropping and cover crops to increase the c and n microbial biomass c mb and n mb stocks cong et al 2014 blesh et al 2018 this underlines the complexity of c and n exchanges and the need for models to analyze the c and n transfers between the micro organisms the soil compartments and the atmosphere especially for intercropping systems in the past decades more than 250 models have been developed to describe biogeochemical processes in agroecosystems manzoni and porporato 2009 however

the last ten years momos modelling organic transformations by micro organisms of soils model has been one of the most mechanistic short term models available for simulating daily continuous c and n exchanges between plant organs and symbionts decomposer micro organisms the atmosphere and soil compartments momos versions 2 to 6 are the most recent and were developed from the original momos c sallih and pansu 1993 and momos n pansu et al 1998 models these models were developed based on studies using isotopic tracers 14c and 15n in controlled laboratory conditions and in soil bags in the field momos uses the same conceptual approach centered on the functional role of the soil microbial biomass pansu et al 2009 however momos has evolved through various formulations in terms of model

collection plant and soil data were collected from our previous field experiment that was described in detail by latati et al 2017 the field experiment was performed during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons at two farm plots in the cereals agroecosystem of the setif region 300 km east of algiers these two sites are very different in terms of soil p availability with site 1 s1 35 58 11 n 5 14 90 e being p deficient and site 2 s2 35 53 37 n 5 37 01 e being p sufficient both sites had alkaline ph about 8 calcareous caco3 content 22 at s1 and 25 at s2 clay loamy soils the total c content was 19 g kg 1 at s1 and 27 g kg 1 at s2 and the total n content was 1 g kg 1 at s1 and 2 3 g kg 1 at s2 at both sites common bean and maize were cultivated in three crop systems four field replicates using the organic farming practices without fertilizers or weedkillers that have been used commonly for many years the crop systems were i maize zea mays cv filou monoculture at a density of 15 3 plants m 2 ii common bean phaseolus vulgaris cv el djadida monoculture at a density of 24 3 plants m 2 and iii maize and common bean intercropped at a density of 12 3 plants m 2 for each species theses planting densities were recommended by local farmers following their normal practices each crop system was repeated in four sub plot replicates in a randomized complete block design rcbd soil and plant samples were collected for five phenological periods sowing 0 days after sowing das growth 21 and 51 das flowering 81 das and harvest stage 120 das for each subplot ten randomly chosen plants in the middle of each sub plot were harvested for each sampling stage the shoots were separated from the roots at the cotyledonary node nodules were separated from the roots counted and weighed separately soil adhering to the roots of the common bean and maize plants selected was sampled by brushing off the 4 mm aggregates then they were thoroughly mixed and pooled to make 5 composite rhizosphere samples for each subplot the rhizosphere samples were then stored at 4 c for 72 h until analysis the soil respiration co2 c was estimated by co2 absorption during one day in 20 ml of naoh solution inside polyvinyl chlorid cylinders precipitating the carbonates and titrating the remaining naoh with a standard 0 25 mol l 1 aqueous solution of hcl latati et al 2014 the c and n measurement for mb plant

simplified version using data from daily maximum and minimum temperature for this study we have used an updated version taking into account the wind speed the water vapor pressure the rainfall and the solar radiation these data were collected from a weather station in the setif region in addition we used physical soil parameters including soil moisture content measured at each growth stage from the 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm soil layers as c and n are closely associated in living organisms pansu et al 2014 modeled the momos n nitrogen cycle in the same way as the momos c carbon cycle pansu et al 2010

production the module assumes that plant growth is also controlled by t and θ the climate correction factor used for microbial functioning eq 1 and by the aerial biomass c which is based on the leaf

plant growth until the production of their first leaves organs responsible for photosynthesis and the roots the organs responsible for nutrient uptake from the soil these resources were allocated to the aerial biomass and the roots using the constant fsa all c and n production was partly allocated to the roots r using allocation rates τ a r j for c allocation and τ n r s j for n allocation another part was transferred to grain production using the time dependant function f 1 j with the same allocation rates τ a g j for both c and n stocks this new formulation was different from the equation system used in the previous version of momos in which the allocation rate τ n a g j regulated the transfer of n to the grains this assumed that c n ratio for the new grains was the same as for the initial seeds for each plant j for natural mortality and during harvest c and n produced were also transferred to the litter by the daily mortality rate τ a m j and cutting rate τ h j with the time functions f 1 j and f 2 j respectively it is considered that the soil macro fauna incorporated the litter into the 0 30 cm at a constant daily rate of incorporation τincorp for the legume the c transfers to the nodules were considered as coming from photosynthesis only to model this a part of dcp was transferred to the nodules with allocation rate τ n o d j and time function f 3 j the aerial

values of the model parameters that give the best fit between the model predictions and the measured data in this study all momos predictions were optimized simultaneously in vensim using powell s conjugate gradient descent method to minimize a payoff defined as the sum of the squared residues between the model predictions and the measured data the calibration was performed without kalman filtering for calibration the weights assigned to the residues were proportional to the standard deviations predicted error of the corresponding data according to the optimization function in vensim all transfer parameters were optimized to determinate the optimum constant values better after defining the payoff we selected the parameters to be varied minimize the payoff the parameter values found during optimization have some uncertainty and the sensitivity of the payoff was tested around the optimum to determine this uncertainty the 95 confidence bounds were obtained using a payoff mcmc sensitivity value of 4 in this paper within the updated momos model the last version developed by pansu et al 2018 all parameters have been optimized together with the proposed equations system see 2

windows version 5 10d http www vensim com was used to explore the behavior of the model and analyze the model throughout the building process looking at the causes and uses of variables even at the loops involving the variables vensim was also used for daily moisture content simulation with the sahel model penning de vries et al 1989 3 results 3 1 daily soil water content measured values of water content from the upper soil layer 5 10 cm wcl2 and lower soil layer 15 30 cm wcl3 in each plot were used to estimate fig 1 the daily soil water content f θ these estimated values and the daily temperature f t were then linked to the model parameters i e plant growth and microbial transformations most of the estimated water contents agreed with the with the values predicted by sahel at both s1 figs 1a for wcl2 and 1b for wcl3 and s1 figs 1c for wcl2 and 1d for wcl3 over the whole cropping cycle the wcl2 layer was estimated to hold 0 11 0 29 mm water mm 1 at s1 and 0 11 0 37 mm water mm 1 at s2 the wcl3 layer was estimated to hold 0 078 to 0 27 mm water mm 1 at s1 and 0 01 0 35 mm water mm 1 at s2 3 2 c and n transfers between plants and microbial symbionts for plant organs the model predicts the daily c and n stocks accurately in both shoot and nodule compartments at p 0 05 though the cropping cycle see p and r2 values in table 5 except for c at s1 and n at s2 in the nodules of sole cropped common beans table 5 this confirms that c and n stocks can be simulated in plant organs for short crop cycles maize and common beans the transfer of c and n to the shoots figs 2 and 3 depended strongly on the cropping system the experimental site and the period after sowing the c and n stocks start to increase gradually over the whole vegetative stage of the cropping cycle at the flowering stage the c and n allocations from the roots to the shoots were clearly at their maximum values the higher c and n stocks were particularly noticeable for monocultures of both species at both s1 and s2 for intercropped maize there was an increase of c stock figs 2e and 2 g at s2 p sufficient soil the growth rate was affected by the cropping system and soil p level it was higher for intercropped maize 0 2 g 1 day 1 than for maize monoculture at s1 p deficient table 1 however the growth rate was markedly lower for intercropped maize 0 4 g 1 day 1 than for maize monoculture at s2 p sufficient table 2 the growth rate of common bean was much higher as a monoculture at s1 p deficient and also slightly higher at s2 p sufficient table 2 the c allocation rate to the roots was also higher 15 g 1 day 1 for intercropped maize at s1 in the first growing season table 1 furthermore the rates of c transfers to maize grains were higher 0 6 g 1 day 1 for intercropping than for monoculture mainly at s1 table 2 however the opposite effect was found for common bean crops in both years the rates of inorganic n absorption by roots was higher for intercropped maize 0 060 and 0 037 g 1 root c day 1 respectively at 1 and 2 while it was lower 0 069 and 0 027 g 1 root c day 1 respectively at 1 and 2 for intercropped common beans table 3 and 4 the same effect was found for n allocation to the aerial plant compartments for which the n transfer rate to shoots was higher for intercropping only for maize at s1 2012 and 2013 and s2 2013 fig 4 a c b and d shows the daily c and n stocks in the common bean root nodules all predicted c and n stocks fitted measurements closely table 5 in both crop systems and both years except for c stocks at s1 in 2012 the predicted values were generally lower in for intercrops than for monocultures while they were equal at the start of the flowering stage 81 das the cumulated n fixation was also predicted for intercropped and sole cropped common beans figs 4e and 4f the highest predicted values were found in the nodules of monocultured common beans 0 19 and 0 28 g n m 2 respectively at s1 and s2 the n flow parameters table 3 and 4 showed that the fixation rate of atmospheric n2 was varied from 0 4 to 11 mg n g 1 nod c per day across cropping systems and sites in p deficient soil conditions s1 the n2 fixation rate for common bean was higher for intercropping than for monoculture by more than 0 4 mg n g 1 nod c per table 3 3 3 microbial c and n exchanges fig 5 and 6 shows the measured and predicted values of the microbial c and n stocks for both crop systems and both sites over the two year experiment there was a significant fit p 0 05 between predicted and measured values see the r2 values in table 5 for both crop systems and both sites most predicted values of cn mb show a slight decrease just a few days after sowing this could be related to soil tillage which disturbs microbial communities at about 51 das the predicted cn mb increased flattening out to average 15 45 g c m 2 and 1 3 g n m 2 51 to 112 das for c bm and n mb respectively for both growing seasons the maximum values of c mb and n mb were much higher for both intercropped species at s1 p deficient figs 5e h this increase appears more pronounced for common bean 51 and 34 respectively for c bm and n mb than maize figs 5c d g and h furthermore the calibration gave a good fit for mineralization and immobilization of inorganic n table 3 and 4 the predicted c n threshold ratio mineralization immobilization for living micro organisms was higher in monocultures than intercropping at s1 except for common bean monoculture in 2012 table 3 at s1 the highest values for humus labile n nhl was for monocultures of both species in 2012 and in intercropping in 2013 table 3 the opposite was found for common beans in 2012 however the predicted nhl values were markedly higher 28 1 and 4 9 g n m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively for intercropped common bean at s2 table 4 the predicted humus stable n nhs was much higher for intercropping from 4 to 21 and 45 to 286 g c m 2 for maize and common beans respectively at s1 in 2012 however it was lower for intercropping for both species from 1 75 to 1 42 and 165 to 96 for maize and common beans respectively in 2013 table 3 3 4 c respiration from soil and plants to the atmosphere carbon dioxide co2 emission from the soil surface to the atmosphere is considered as a key indicator for assessing the biological activity of soil micro organisms and plant symbionts fig 7 shows the measured co2 flux from the soil and the predicted respiration from plant organs nodule and root and micro organisms the measured data over both periods matched the model simulation significantly at p 0 001 r2 0 90 for both cropping systems and both sites table 5 for both species the predicted microbial respiration gradually increased from sowing to the beginning of the flowering stage from flowering to grain formation stage 51 to 100 das the predicted microbial respiration decreased except at s1 in 2012 figs 7a 7c and 7e while the predicted root and nodule respiration greatly increased during the flowering period 51 to 81 das and it was much higher from the monocultures than from the intercrops fig 7 the predicted root respiration was much lower less than 0 064 g cco2 m 2 day 1 for both intercropped maize at s2 and common bean at s1 especially in 2012 table 1 and 2 4 discussion 4 1 robustness of parameterized and validated model model parameterization is considered as the most important step in the modeling approach most of the agroecological models developed over past decades are not based on plausible mechanistic processes that describe microbial c and n transfers between agroecosystem compartments philippot et al 2013 wu et al 2012 pansu et al 2018 the recent research papers have proposed modeling methods as a new way of simulating the c and n flows with models validated on data collected from various crop species however little is known about the extrapolation of these models in the field especially for cereal legume intercropping systems corre hellou et al 2009 ibrahim et al 2013 pansu et al 2018 as the first model that was based on the agroecological functioning of the plant microorganism system the robustness of momos model was confirmed in acid tropical pansu et al 2014 and recently in alkaline mediterranean conditions ibrahim et al 2016 pansu et al 2018 this paper gives the first parameterization and validation of the momos model at farm plot scale in the south mediterranean basin the predicted of global exchanges of c and n for each compartment plant soil and micro organisms fitted the measured values at p 0 05 this was confirmed at both sites and both cropping systems in two successive growing seasons the improvements in the model predictions were probably the result of the new formulation eq 16 and 20 and optimization eq 15 17 18 23 24 and 26 of some equations in the model which was proposed by ibrahim et al 2016 and pansu et al 2018 the model with best fit ecophysiological parameters table 1 to 4 successfully predicted all the state variables c and n flows measured at different growth stages in intercropped maize and common bean in the future this will provide a strong basis for estimating ecophysiological parameters that are generally difficult to measure in field experiments 4 2 c and n exchanges and plant production the predicted growth rate for intercropped maize and common bean were higher than those predicted for durum wheat and faba bean by ibrahim et al 2016 which is probably due to i their low soil fertility in which faba bean and wheat were intercropped in plots that had not been fertilized for 13 years ii faba bean and wheat having lower rates of c photosynthesis than maize or common bean respectively in p deficient soil the rate of inorganic n absorption τ n r r j in table 3 and 4 by intercropped maize was higher 0 037 g 1 root c day 1 than monocultured maize and the c allocation to the roots τ a r j in table 1 and 3 was also higher indicating that intercropped maize mobilized c for root growth to search for nutrients for maize the rate of inorganic n absorption was higher for intercropping at both s1 and s2 also indicating an increase of c allocation to the roots especially in p deficient soil this confirms that the c from photosynthesis was preferentially used to promote root growth to improve n nutrition of the intercropped cereal the best fit allocation rates of photosynthetic c were in agreement with those reported for lucerne el metwally and abdelhamid 2008 faba bean and durum wheat ibrahim et al 2016 the c allocation to grain grains τ a g j was also greater for intercropped maize probably due to the higher n absorption by the roots which was transferred more quickly from roots to shoots in the intercropped cereal than in the intercropped legume then from shoots to grain this shows the higher demand for n by the intercropped cereal which was not satisfied by n2 biological fixation low n2 fixation for intercropping figs 4e and 4f the increase of grain yield of intercropped cereals was recently reported when intercropping cowpea and maize latati et al 2014 faba bean and durum wheat messaoudi et al 2020 and alfalfa and maize sun et al 2019 4 3 c and n transfer to symbiotic nodules the predicted c and n stocks in the symbiotic nodules were higher for common bean monoculture at both sites fig 4 for both cropping systems and sites the symbiotic n2 fixation by common beans was predicted as being at its peak from 51 to 81 das however c and n stocks in the nodules start to equalize in both cropping systems at the end of the full flowering stage 81 das the best fit rate of n2 fixation τ n n f j was much higher for common bean monocultures 0 012 g 1 n day 1 grown in p sufficient soil however the highest values of τ n n f j were found for intercropping 0 0008 g 1 n day 1 in p deficient soil table 3 and 4 the best fit values of τ n n f j are consistent with measurements for intercropped chickpea and durum wheat betencourt et al 2012 and soybean and durum wheat bargaz et al 2017 the calculation method for nodule n stocks the factor τ n n f j applied to the c nodule stocks eq 26 could explain the low n stock in the nodules of the intercropped common beans at s1 p deficient soil the daily n fixation values figs 4e and 4f show a threshold value during the period of maximum fixation 51 to 81 das the total n2 fixation was predicted as 26 31 g n m 2 for common bean monoculture at s2 p sufficient this corresponds to 263 1 kg n ha 1 in this study the n transfer from the symbiotic nodules was a good fit using the new formulation eq 24 and 26 of the momos model this could explain the overestimate of n fixation τnnf in the previous version by pansu et al 2018 overall in this experiment the best fit values of τnnr parameter n transfer from the nodule to root were close to 0 74 2012 and 0 75 2013 for intercropped common bean at s1 p defficient this indicates that the n remaining in the nodules not transferred to the roots was about 24 25 however this was only 7 8 for common bean monoculture at the same site table 3 at s2 the τnnr values were close to 1 0 remaining for common bean monoculture in both 2012 and 2013 and it was close to 0 93 7 remaining for intercropping in both years table 4 this implies that a considerable part 25 of the n fixed by the nodules was probably transferred to the other compartments e g micro organisms when the nodules died this transfer was only confirmed for intercropped common bean in p deficient soil s1 this is in disagreement the findings of pansu et al 2018 who suggested removing τnnr from the model as their values were close to 1 where the faba beans were grow as an intercrop or a monoculture recent field experiments suggest that n2 symbiotic fixation could be considered as a beneficial source of n for microorganisms in legumes rhizospheres especially in p deficient soils cong et al 2014 glaze corcoran et al 2020 4 4 microbial control and balance of soil plant atmosphere exchanges c allocations from photosynthesis and uptake from organic compartments are considered to be the main transfers that control n production by plant and microorganisms respectively pansu et al 2018 latati et al 2020 in this study the c and n stocks were much higher in mb in the rhizosphere of the intercropped plants figs 5 and 6 the organic n reserves in stable humus hs were higher for intercropping in 2012 table 3 and they were significantly lower in 2013 this could be the largest reserve of organic c and n of microbial origin to sustain the life processes of living microorganisms these results for intercropping at s1 p deficient soil were associated with i an increase of the nhl of microbial origin especially 2013 ii a higher rate of n2 fixation τnnf with 24 of fixed n stocks remaining in the nodule of intercropped common bean with a τnnr of 76 iii a decrease of mb c n threshold ratio for both intercropped maize mb c n 11 66 vs 18 20 and common beans mb c n 11 18 vs 15 37 indicating net mineralization in 2013 iv higher allocation rates of photosynthetic c to roots shoots and grains of intercropped maize and v lower c losses from the roots nodules and mb respiration in intercropped plots recent studies have reported an increase of both n fixation and inorganic n from the mb in the rhizosphere of intercropped legumes and cereals in p deficient soils bargaz et al 2017 latati et al 2017 furthermore the continuous decrease of n bm from the end of full flowering to harvest 81 to 120 das 2012 confirms the short term net mineralization of nhs reserve by decomposer microorganisms for intercropped species the threshold value of nhs was significantly lower in the second year which indicates increased potentially available n over the relatively long term 300 days in parallel most predicted values of maize root mortality 0 012 to 0 1 g 1 day 1 were lower than for the corresponding common bean roots 0 2 to 0 7 g 1 day 1 p deficiency s1 doubles root mortality and quadruples nodule mortality especially for intercropped common beans this could give root and nodule mortality a key role by providing an energy source for microorganism growth amthor 2000 ibrahim et al 2016 however the lower c losses from soil respiration root nodule and microorganisms in intercropped plots may probably due to a high c use efficiency by microorganisms linked to low mb c n threshold ratio especially in p deficient soil s1 these results are in agreement with those reported for laboratory studies by manzoni 2017 and field studies by ibrahim et al 2016 the present study illustrates the robustness of the momos model which could be considered as a new tool to link the n and c cycles to regulation mechanisms controlling the agroecological functioning of microorganisms in the agroecosystem the investigations and methodological approaches in this field study will complement our existing knowledge on c and n cycles modeling at cellular scale gras et al 2011 todd brown et al 2012 overall the present model formulation appears to be complementary to those developed previously for c ibrahim et al 2016 and n cycles pansu et al 2018 for faba bean durum wheat intercropping in the north mediterranean basin the new equations and the improvement of some equations from the previous version of momos gave a better fit for some ecophysiological parameters in particular τnnr and τnnf 5 conclusions the overall objectives listed in the introduction were mostly attained momos parameterization was greatly improved by measurements of the state variables plant inputs soil and weather regulating the c and n transfers in two farm sites with very different pedoclimatic conditions the extension of the decomposition part of the momos model at the regional scale setif agroecosystem was successfully validated in alkaline mediterranean conditions just after those performed at the experimental station in mauguio agroecosystem the new equations that were formulated in this study for both n daily production and n grain stocks eq 16 and 20 are complementary to those used in the most recent published versions of the model ibrahim et al 2016 pansu et al 2018 other equations relative to c and n exchange between plant organs eq 15 17 18 23 24 and 26 were carefully revised to improve the parameters governing c and n transfer rates for plant production these improvements were performed with a limited number of parameters e g n transfer rate from nodule c allocation and c loss by root respiration to make sure that equation system was not over parameterized in the field conditions of our experiment this study gives the first estimation of c and n exchange rates between plants soil microbial biomass and symbionts tables s1 to s4 which are difficult to estimate by other experimental methods this provided the opportunity to validate the current calibrated models momos c and momos n at the plot farm and regional scales particularly for intercropped species with a short crop cycle 3 to 4 months the results show that all c and n daily exchanges between the plant organs and micro organisms varied strongly between the phenological stages the highest variation was in the flowering stage 50 to 81 das when the highest nodule and shoot c and n stocks occurred simultaneously in both monocultures particularly in p deficient soil s1 the nodule c and n transfers began to increase again at the end of the flowering stage for both intercropped species particularly in p deficient soil s1 after that the n stocks in decomposer microorganisms increased markedly before the n was released by mineralization of dead common bean nodules stimulated mainly by the high c availability from nodule mortality for microbial activities this confirms that in the intercropping system a considerable part of the fixed n2 is preferably stored in the nodules of the intercropped legume promoting microbial functioning and not benefiting the growth of either intercropped species the modeling carried out in this study successfully demonstrates the robustness of this momos parameterized version for assesses and analyzing the mechanisms regulating the global c and n exchanges between the plant symbionts the soil the microbial biomass and the atmosphere we therefore propose that this parameterized momos version be used for

24689,the modeling of continuous transfers of carbon c and nitrogen n previously published in the literature has paid little attention to the functional role of micro organisms in general only monoculture systems have been modeled furthermore there have been few experiments under field conditions at farm scale where clear evidence for the benefits of intercropping is lacking this work focus on mechanistic modeling approaches based on the ecological functioning of the microbial biomass to quantify the daily exchange of c and n between plant organs micro organisms rhizobial symbionts soil compartments and the atmosphere in an arable intercropping system the momos model was validated on c and n data collected from a common bean phaseolus vulgaris l cv el djadida and maize zea mays l cv filou intercropping system the experiment was performed at two field sites that were chosen with farmers to represent both high and low soil p availability the results show that all c and n exchanges were successfully predicted at 5 significance and that they depend on the phenological stage especially the flowering stage increased c allocation from photosynthesis to roots contributed to increasing both grain yield and n grain for intercropped maize c and n stocks in the common bean nodules were lower in intercropping than in monocultures and this is associated with the decrease of total atmospheric nitrogen n2 fixation by intercropped common beans in particular with a high soil p however the rate of n2 fixation was higher in the intercrops than in the monoculture when the soil is p deficient micro organisms were responsible for most of the c losses from the soil to the atmosphere but intercropping significantly reduced the c losses by improving micro organism c use efficiency these results uncover the strong link between n and c stocks confirming the robustness of the newly formulated momos equations that are validated in this paper this agroecological modeling experiment demonstrated the functional role of microbial biomass in both the growth of the intercrops crop and their symbiosis improving the prediction of the daily c and n flows between plant organs soil compartments and the atmosphere keywords intercropping micro organisms plant symbionts mechanistic models continuous exchange 1 introduction the legume cereal monocropping system is the most commonly used cropping system for legume and cereal production in the most of world agricultural ecosystems peoples et al 2019 replacing the current legume cereal monocropping by intercropping will increase species diversity over time in rotation with cereals and during fallow periods and space in intercropping and improve resource use efficiency latati et al 2016 messaoudi et al 2020 the agroecological intensification of the farming system based on high species diversification can improve ecosystem services justes et al 2017 glaze corcoran et al 2020 cereal legume intercropping systems are more efficient in the use of nutrient resources i e c n and p phosphorus than the simple systems currently used duru et al 2015 latati et al 2019 furthermore intercropping improves functional complementarily beneficial biological interactions and synergies between plant species and micro organisms within the agroecosystem both temporally and spacially within fields latati et al 2017 peoples et al 2019 to assess and estimate the performance of intercropping in terms of resource use and storage in particular c and n nutrients an integrated approach incorporating the analysis of empirical data and quantitative modeling of agroecological indicators was applied to link the c and n cycles gärdenäs et al 2011 todd brown et al 2012 latati et al 2020 this modeling approach gives a detailed view of the continuous exchanges of c e g van der heijden et al 2008 ibrahim et al 2016 and n e g corre hellou et al 2009 pansu et al 2018 between living organisms the soil and the

resources depends largely on the composition and structure of the microbial community as it is dependent on the growth stage of micro organisms and the environmental conditions cotner et al 2006 sikorski 2015 latati et al 2017 microorganisms as well as many other biological activities are considered as a substantial short and long term source of bio available c and n for crops tang et al 2014 however crop systems can be sustainably managed over time by rotation and using fallow periods and space intercropping and cover crops to increase the c and n microbial biomass c mb and n mb stocks cong et al 2014 blesh et al 2018 this underlines the complexity of c and n exchanges and the need for models to analyze the c and n transfers between the micro organisms the soil compartments and the atmosphere especially for intercropping systems in the past decades more than 250 models have been developed to describe biogeochemical processes in agroecosystems manzoni and porporato 2009 however few of these link the n and c cycles to the functional ecology of the plant microorganism systems e g pansu et al 2009 2010 2014 2018 jensen et al 2010 ibrahim et al 2013 2016 latati et al 2019 the

the last ten years momos modelling organic transformations by micro organisms of soils model has been one of the most mechanistic short term models available for simulating daily continuous c and n exchanges between plant organs and symbionts decomposer micro organisms the atmosphere and soil compartments momos versions 2 to 6 are the most recent and were developed from the original momos c sallih and pansu 1993 and momos n pansu et al 1998 models these models were developed based on studies using isotopic tracers 14c and 15n in controlled laboratory conditions and in soil bags in the field momos uses the same conceptual approach centered on the functional role of the soil microbial biomass pansu et al 2009 however momos has evolved through various formulations in terms of model complexity compartmental definition biogeochemical processes and levels of parameterization the momos c microbial core was calibrated in dry bolivian puna and moister venezuelan paramo pansu et al 2004 then validated in six tropical sites over a wide range of altitudes and climates pansu et al 2010 it was then extended to include the n cycle pansu et al 2014 more recently the momos model was extended to link microbial transformations to plant growth and validated on data collected from field experiments in a cereal legume intercropping system faba bean durum wheat in french mediterranean

2020 this paper aims to extend these studies to simulate the continuous c and n exchanges between the compartments in the latest version of momos pansu et al 2018 our objectives are to 1 improve the equation system for plant growth with some new mathematical formulations as a new tool to simulate the daily c and n exchanges between the plant symbionts the microbial biomass the soil and the atmosphere using data that had been collected from two farm plots with calcareous low p soils 2 parameterize and validate the momos model for two very different pedoclimatic conditions focusing on the

collection plant and soil data were collected from our previous field experiment that was described in detail by latati et al 2017 the field experiment was performed during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons at two farm plots in the cereals agroecosystem of the setif region 300 km east of algiers these two sites are very different in terms of soil p availability with site 1 s1 35 58 11 n 5 14 90 e being p deficient and site 2 s2 35 53 37 n 5 37 01 e being p sufficient both sites had alkaline ph about 8 calcareous caco3 content 22 at s1 and 25 at s2 clay loamy soils the total c content was 19 g kg 1 at s1 and 27 g kg 1 at s2 and the total n content was 1 g kg 1 at s1 and 2 3 g kg 1 at s2 at both sites common bean and maize were cultivated in three crop systems four field replicates using the organic farming practices without fertilizers or weedkillers that have been used commonly for many years the crop systems were i maize zea mays cv filou monoculture at a density of 15 3 plants m 2 ii common bean phaseolus vulgaris cv el djadida monoculture at a density of 24 3 plants m 2 and iii maize and common bean intercropped at a density of 12 3 plants m 2 for each species theses planting densities were recommended by local farmers following their normal practices each crop system was repeated in four sub plot replicates in a randomized complete block design rcbd soil and plant samples were collected for five phenological periods sowing 0 days after sowing das growth 21 and 51 das flowering 81 das and harvest stage 120 das for each subplot ten randomly chosen plants in the middle of each sub plot were harvested for each sampling stage the shoots were separated from the roots at the cotyledonary node nodules were separated from the roots counted and weighed separately soil adhering to the roots of the common bean and maize plants selected was sampled by brushing off the 4 mm aggregates then they were thoroughly mixed and pooled to make 5 composite rhizosphere samples for each subplot the rhizosphere samples were then stored at 4 c for 72 h until analysis the soil respiration co2 c was estimated by co2 absorption during one day in 20 ml of naoh solution inside polyvinyl chlorid cylinders precipitating the carbonates and titrating the remaining naoh with a standard 0 25 mol l 1 aqueous solution of hcl latati et al 2014 the c and n measurement for mb plant

simplified version using data from daily maximum and minimum temperature for this study we have used an updated version taking into account the wind speed the water vapor pressure the rainfall and the solar radiation these data were collected from a weather station in the setif region in addition we used physical soil parameters including soil moisture content measured at each growth stage from the 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm soil layers as c and n are closely associated in living organisms pansu et al 2014 modeled the momos n nitrogen cycle in the same way as the momos c carbon cycle pansu et al 2010

production the module assumes that plant growth is also controlled by t and θ the climate correction factor used for microbial functioning eq 1 and by the aerial biomass c which is based on the leaf area of each plant species to take account of the link between c and n in the photosynthesis process we have related the aerial n stocks to the daily c production dcp ddc p j d t so the updated

plant growth until the production of their first leaves organs responsible for photosynthesis and the roots the organs responsible for nutrient uptake from the soil these resources were allocated to the aerial biomass and the roots using the constant fsa all c and n production was partly allocated to the roots r using allocation rates τ a r j for c allocation and τ n r s j for n allocation another part was transferred to grain production using the time dependant function f 1 j with the same allocation rates τ a g j for both c and n stocks this new formulation was different from the equation system used in the previous version of momos in which the allocation rate τ n a g j regulated the transfer of n to the grains this assumed that c n ratio for the new grains was the same as for the initial seeds for each plant j for natural mortality and during harvest c and n produced were also transferred to the litter by the daily mortality rate τ a m j and cutting rate τ h j with the time functions f 1 j and f 2 j respectively it is considered that the soil macro fauna incorporated the litter into the 0 30 cm at a constant daily rate of incorporation τincorp for the legume the c transfers to the nodules were considered as coming from photosynthesis only to model this a part of dcp was transferred to the nodules with allocation rate τ n o d j and time function f 3 j the aerial

values of the model parameters that give the best fit between the model predictions and the measured data in this study all momos predictions were optimized simultaneously in vensim using powell s conjugate gradient descent method to minimize a payoff defined as the sum of the squared residues between the model predictions and the measured data the calibration was performed without kalman filtering for calibration the weights assigned to the residues were proportional to the standard deviations predicted error of the corresponding data according to the optimization function in vensim all transfer parameters were optimized to determinate the optimum constant values better after defining the payoff we selected the parameters to be varied minimize the payoff the parameter values found during optimization have some uncertainty and the sensitivity of the payoff was tested around the optimum to determine this uncertainty the 95 confidence bounds were obtained using a payoff mcmc sensitivity value of 4 in this paper within the updated momos model the last version developed by pansu et al 2018 all parameters have been optimized together with the proposed equations system see 2

predicts the daily c and n stocks accurately in both shoot and nodule compartments at p 0 05 though the cropping cycle see p and r2 values in table 5 except for c at s1 and n at s2 in the nodules of sole cropped common beans table 5 this confirms that c and n stocks can be simulated in plant organs for short crop cycles maize and common beans the transfer of c and n to the shoots figs 2 and 3 depended strongly on the cropping system the experimental site and the period after sowing the c and n stocks start to increase gradually over the whole vegetative stage of the cropping cycle at the flowering stage the c and n allocations from the roots to the shoots were clearly at their maximum values the higher c and n stocks were particularly noticeable for monocultures of both species at both s1 and s2 for intercropped maize there was an increase of c stock figs 2e and 2 g at s2 p sufficient soil the growth rate was affected by the cropping system and soil p level it was higher for intercropped maize 0 2 g 1 day 1 than for maize monoculture at s1 p deficient table 1 however the growth rate was markedly lower for intercropped maize 0 4 g 1 day 1 than for maize monoculture at s2 p sufficient table 2 the growth rate of common bean was much higher as a monoculture at s1 p deficient and also slightly higher at s2 p sufficient table 2 the c allocation rate to the roots was also higher 15 g 1 day 1 for intercropped maize at s1 in the first growing season table 1 furthermore the rates of c transfers to maize grains were higher 0 6 g 1 day 1 for intercropping than for monoculture mainly at s1 table 2 however the opposite effect was found for common bean crops in both years the rates of inorganic n absorption by roots was higher for intercropped maize 0 060 and 0 037 g 1 root c day 1 respectively at 1 and 2 while it was lower 0 069 and 0 027 g 1 root c day 1 respectively at 1 and 2 for intercropped common beans table 3 and 4 the same effect was found for n allocation to the aerial plant compartments for which the n transfer rate to shoots was higher for intercropping only for maize at s1 2012 and 2013 and s2 2013 fig 4 a c b and d shows the daily c and n stocks in the common bean root nodules all predicted c and n stocks fitted measurements closely table 5 in both crop systems and both years except for c stocks at s1 in 2012 the predicted values were generally lower in for intercrops than for monocultures while they were equal at the start of the flowering stage 81 das the cumulated n fixation was also predicted for intercropped and sole cropped common beans figs 4e and 4f the highest predicted values were found in the nodules of monocultured common beans 0 19 and 0 28 g n m 2 respectively at s1 and s2 the n flow parameters table 3 and 4 showed that the fixation rate of atmospheric n2 was varied from 0 4 to 11 mg n g 1 nod c per day across cropping systems and sites in p deficient soil conditions s1 the n2 fixation rate for common bean was higher for intercropping than for monoculture by more than 0 4 mg n g 1 nod c per table 3 3 3 microbial c and n exchanges fig 5 and 6 shows the measured and predicted values of the microbial c and n stocks for both crop systems and both sites over the two year experiment there was a significant fit p 0 05 between predicted and measured values see the r2 values in table 5 for both crop systems and both sites most predicted values of cn mb show a slight decrease just a few days after sowing this could be related to soil tillage which disturbs microbial communities at about 51 das the predicted cn mb increased flattening out to average 15 45 g c m 2 and 1 3 g n m 2 51 to 112 das for c bm and n mb respectively for both growing seasons the maximum values of c mb and n mb were much higher for both intercropped species at s1 p deficient figs 5e h this increase appears more pronounced for common bean 51 and 34 respectively for c bm and n mb than maize figs 5c d g and h furthermore the calibration gave a good fit for mineralization and immobilization of inorganic n table 3 and 4 the predicted c n threshold ratio mineralization immobilization for living micro organisms was higher in monocultures than intercropping at s1 except for common bean monoculture in 2012 table 3 at s1 the highest values for humus labile n nhl was for monocultures of both species in 2012 and in intercropping in 2013 table 3 the opposite was found for common beans in 2012 however the predicted nhl values were markedly higher 28 1 and 4 9 g n m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively for intercropped common bean at s2 table 4 the predicted humus stable n nhs was much higher for intercropping from 4 to 21 and 45 to 286 g c m 2 for maize and common beans respectively at s1 in 2012 however it was lower for intercropping for both species from 1 75 to 1 42 and 165 to 96 for maize and common beans respectively in 2013 table 3 3 4 c respiration from soil and plants to the atmosphere carbon dioxide co2 emission from the soil surface to the atmosphere is considered as a key indicator for assessing the biological activity of soil micro organisms and plant symbionts fig 7 shows the measured co2 flux from the soil and the predicted respiration from plant organs nodule and root and micro organisms the measured data over both periods matched the model simulation significantly at p 0 001 r2 0 90 for both cropping systems and both sites table 5 for both species the predicted microbial respiration gradually increased from sowing to the beginning of the flowering stage from flowering to grain formation stage 51 to 100 das the predicted microbial respiration decreased except at s1 in 2012 figs 7a 7c and 7e while the predicted root and nodule respiration greatly increased during the flowering period 51 to 81 das and it was much higher from the monocultures than from the intercrops fig 7 the predicted root respiration was much lower less than 0 064 g cco2 m 2 day 1 for both intercropped maize at s2 and common bean at s1 especially in 2012 table 1 and 2 4 discussion 4 1 robustness of parameterized and validated model model parameterization is considered as the most important step in the modeling approach most of the agroecological models developed over past decades are not based on plausible mechanistic processes that describe microbial c and n transfers between agroecosystem compartments philippot et al 2013 wu et al 2012 pansu et al 2018 the recent research papers have proposed modeling methods as a new way of simulating the c and n flows with models validated on data collected from various crop species however little is known about the extrapolation of these models in the field especially for cereal legume intercropping systems corre hellou et al 2009 ibrahim et al 2013 pansu et al 2018 as the first model that was based on the agroecological functioning of the plant microorganism system the robustness of momos model was confirmed in acid tropical pansu et al 2014 and recently in alkaline mediterranean conditions ibrahim et al 2016 pansu et al 2018 this paper gives the first parameterization and validation of the momos model at farm plot scale in the south mediterranean basin the predicted of global exchanges of c and n for each compartment plant soil and micro organisms fitted the measured values at p 0 05 this was confirmed at both sites and both cropping systems in two successive growing seasons the improvements in the model predictions were probably the result of the new formulation eq 16 and 20 and optimization eq 15 17 18 23 24 and 26 of some equations in the model which was proposed by ibrahim et al 2016 and pansu et al 2018 the model with best fit ecophysiological parameters table 1 to 4 successfully predicted all the state variables c and n flows measured at different growth stages in intercropped maize and common bean in the future this will provide a strong basis for estimating ecophysiological parameters that are generally difficult to measure in field experiments 4 2 c and n exchanges and plant production the predicted growth rate for intercropped maize and common bean were higher than those predicted for durum wheat and faba bean by ibrahim et al 2016 which is probably due to i their low soil fertility in which faba bean and wheat were intercropped in plots that had not been fertilized for 13 years ii faba bean and wheat having lower rates of c photosynthesis than maize or common bean respectively in p deficient soil the rate of inorganic n absorption τ n r r j in table 3 and 4 by intercropped maize was higher 0 037 g 1 root c day 1 than monocultured maize and the c allocation to the roots τ a r j in table 1 and 3 was also higher indicating that intercropped maize mobilized c for root growth to search for nutrients for maize the rate of inorganic n absorption was higher for intercropping at both s1 and s2 also indicating an increase of c allocation to the roots especially in p deficient soil this confirms that the c from photosynthesis was preferentially used to promote root growth to improve n nutrition of the intercropped cereal the best fit allocation rates of photosynthetic c were in agreement with those reported for lucerne el metwally and abdelhamid 2008 faba bean and durum wheat ibrahim et al 2016 the c allocation to grain grains τ a g j was also greater for intercropped maize probably due to the higher n absorption by the roots which was transferred more quickly from roots to shoots in the intercropped cereal than in the intercropped legume then from shoots to grain this shows the higher demand for n by the intercropped cereal which was not satisfied by n2 biological fixation low n2 fixation for intercropping figs 4e and 4f the increase of grain yield of intercropped cereals was recently reported when intercropping cowpea and maize latati et al 2014 faba bean and durum wheat messaoudi et al 2020 and alfalfa and maize sun et al 2019 4 3 c and n transfer to symbiotic nodules the predicted c and n stocks in the symbiotic nodules were higher for common bean monoculture at both sites fig 4 for both cropping systems and sites the symbiotic n2 fixation by common beans was predicted as being at its peak from 51 to 81 das however c and n stocks in the nodules start to equalize in both cropping systems at the end of the full flowering stage 81 das the best fit rate of n2 fixation τ n n f j was much higher for common bean monocultures 0 012 g 1 n day 1 grown in p sufficient soil however the highest values of τ n n f j were found for intercropping 0 0008 g 1 n day 1 in p deficient soil table 3 and 4 the best fit values of τ n n f j are consistent with measurements for intercropped chickpea and durum wheat betencourt et al 2012 and soybean and durum wheat bargaz et al 2017 the calculation method for nodule n stocks the factor τ n n f j applied to the c nodule stocks eq 26 could explain the low n stock in the nodules of the intercropped common beans at s1 p deficient soil the daily n fixation values figs 4e and 4f show a threshold value during the period of maximum fixation 51 to 81 das the total n2 fixation was predicted as 26 31 g n m 2 for common bean monoculture at s2 p sufficient this corresponds to 263 1 kg n ha 1 in this study the n transfer from the symbiotic nodules was a good fit using the new formulation eq 24 and 26 of the momos model this could explain the overestimate of n fixation τnnf in the previous version by pansu et al 2018 overall in this experiment the best fit values of τnnr parameter n transfer from the nodule to root were close to 0 74 2012 and 0 75 2013 for intercropped common bean at s1 p defficient this indicates that the n remaining in the nodules not transferred to the roots was about 24 25 however this was only 7 8 for common bean monoculture at the same site table 3 at s2 the τnnr values were close to 1 0 remaining for common bean monoculture in both 2012 and 2013 and it was close to 0 93 7 remaining for intercropping in both years table 4 this implies that a considerable part 25 of the n fixed by the nodules was probably transferred to the other compartments e g micro organisms when the nodules died this transfer was only confirmed for intercropped common bean in p deficient soil s1 this is in disagreement the findings of pansu et al 2018 who suggested removing τnnr from the model as their values were close to 1 where the faba beans were grow as an intercrop or a monoculture recent field experiments suggest that n2 symbiotic fixation could be considered as a beneficial source of n for microorganisms in legumes rhizospheres especially in p deficient soils cong et al 2014 glaze corcoran et al 2020 4 4 microbial control and balance of soil plant atmosphere exchanges c allocations from photosynthesis and uptake from organic compartments are considered to be the main transfers that control n production by plant and microorganisms respectively pansu et al 2018 latati et al 2020 in this study the c and n stocks were much higher in mb in the rhizosphere of the intercropped plants figs 5 and 6 the organic n reserves in stable humus hs were higher for intercropping in 2012 table 3 and they were significantly lower in 2013 this could be the largest reserve of organic c and n of microbial origin to sustain the life processes of living microorganisms these results for intercropping at s1 p deficient soil were associated with i an increase of the nhl of microbial origin especially 2013 ii a higher rate of n2 fixation τnnf with 24 of fixed n stocks remaining in the nodule of intercropped common bean with a τnnr of 76 iii a decrease of mb c n threshold ratio for both intercropped maize mb c n 11 66 vs 18 20 and common beans mb c n 11 18 vs 15 37 indicating net mineralization in 2013 iv higher allocation rates of photosynthetic c to roots shoots and grains of intercropped maize and v lower c losses from the roots nodules and mb respiration in intercropped plots recent studies have reported an increase of both n fixation and inorganic n from the mb in the rhizosphere of intercropped legumes and cereals in p deficient soils bargaz et al 2017 latati et al 2017 furthermore the continuous decrease of n bm from the end of full flowering to harvest 81 to 120 das 2012 confirms the short term net mineralization of nhs reserve by decomposer microorganisms for intercropped species the threshold value of nhs was significantly lower in the second year which indicates increased potentially available n over the relatively long term 300 days in parallel most predicted values of maize root mortality 0 012 to 0 1 g 1 day 1 were lower than for the corresponding common bean roots 0 2 to 0 7 g 1 day 1 p deficiency s1 doubles root mortality and quadruples nodule mortality especially for intercropped common beans this could give root and nodule mortality a key role by providing an energy source for microorganism growth amthor 2000 ibrahim et al 2016 however the lower c losses from soil respiration root nodule and microorganisms in intercropped plots may probably due to a high c use efficiency by microorganisms linked to low mb c n threshold ratio especially in p deficient soil s1 these results are in agreement with those reported for laboratory studies by manzoni 2017 and field studies by ibrahim et al 2016 the present study illustrates the robustness of the momos model which could be considered as a new tool to link the n and c cycles to regulation mechanisms controlling the agroecological functioning of microorganisms in the agroecosystem the investigations and methodological approaches in this field study will complement our existing knowledge on c and n cycles modeling at cellular scale gras et al 2011 todd brown et al 2012 overall the present model formulation appears to be complementary to those developed previously for c ibrahim et al 2016 and n cycles pansu et al 2018 for faba bean durum wheat intercropping in the north mediterranean basin the new equations and the improvement of some equations from the previous version of momos gave a better fit for some ecophysiological parameters in particular τnnr and τnnf 5 conclusions the overall objectives listed in the introduction were mostly attained momos parameterization was greatly improved by measurements of the state variables plant inputs soil and weather regulating the c and n transfers in two farm sites with very different pedoclimatic conditions the extension of the decomposition part of the momos model at the regional scale setif agroecosystem was successfully validated in alkaline mediterranean conditions just after those performed at the experimental station in mauguio agroecosystem the new equations that were formulated in this study for both n daily production and n grain stocks eq 16 and 20 are complementary to those used in the most recent published versions of the model ibrahim et al 2016 pansu et al 2018 other equations relative to c and n exchange between plant organs eq 15 17 18 23 24 and 26 were carefully revised to improve the parameters governing c and n transfer rates for plant production these improvements were performed with a limited number of parameters e g n transfer rate from nodule c allocation and c loss by root respiration to make sure that equation system was not over parameterized in the field conditions of our experiment this study gives the first estimation of c and n exchange rates between plants soil microbial biomass and symbionts tables s1 to s4 which are difficult to estimate by other experimental methods this provided the opportunity to validate the current calibrated models momos c and momos n at the plot farm and regional scales particularly for intercropped species with a short crop cycle 3 to 4 months the results show that all c and n daily exchanges between the plant organs and micro organisms varied strongly between the phenological stages the highest variation was in the flowering stage 50 to 81 das when the highest nodule and shoot c and n stocks occurred simultaneously in both monocultures particularly in p deficient soil s1 the nodule c and n transfers began to increase again at the end of the flowering stage for both intercropped species particularly in p deficient soil s1 after that the n stocks in decomposer microorganisms increased markedly before the n was released by mineralization of dead common bean nodules stimulated mainly by the high c availability from nodule mortality for microbial activities this confirms that in the intercropping system a considerable part of the fixed n2 is preferably stored in the nodules of the intercropped legume promoting microbial functioning and not benefiting the growth of either intercropped species the modeling carried out in this study successfully demonstrates the robustness of this momos parameterized version for assesses and analyzing the mechanisms regulating the global c and n exchanges between the plant symbionts the soil the microbial biomass and the atmosphere we therefore propose that this parameterized momos version be used for the future studies assessing c and n transfers in agroecosystems particularly for intercropped species with short crop cycles at regional scale funding information this work was part of the
