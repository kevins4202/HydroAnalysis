19600,membrane photobioreactor mpbr technology is an emerging algae based wastewater treatment system given the limitations due to the general use of conventional analytical approaches in previous research this study aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of mpbr performance through advanced characterisation techniques new performance parameters are also proposed encompassing five important aspects of mpbr system efficiency i e biomass concentration composition production nutrient uptake and harvesting potential under initial standard operating conditions performance parameters such as cell count mlss ratio cell viability proportion of bacteria and biomass yield coefficient were found to offer new insights into the operation of mpbr these parameters were then used for the first time to systematically investigate mpbrs operated under different hydraulic retention times hrts and solids retention times srts applying shorter hrt and srt was observed to increase cell viability and productivity up to 0 25 107 cells ml d as anticipated due to the higher nutrient loading it was noted that the faster growing algal cells featured lower requirement for nutrients on the other hand extending hrt and srt resulted in a more heterogeneous culture lower cell count mlss ratio and higher proportion of bacteria achieving a higher degree of autoflocculation and greater no3 n and po4 p removals of up to 79 and 78 respectively the results demonstrate the trade off between applying different hrts and srts and the importance of fully characterising system performance to critically assess the advantages and limitations of chosen operating conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae wastewater treatment biomass composition productivity harvesting potential 1 introduction cultivation of microalgae at high concentration integrated with wastewater treatment has received increased attention over the past decade for its industrial potential microalgae in either suspended or attached growth mode have demonstrated the ability to effectively remove nutrient and some other contaminants from wastewater arbib et al 2014 boelee et al 2011 the biomass generated from wastewater remediation is increasingly recognised as a potentially sustainable source of various products such as cosmetics pigments and biofuels hemaiswarya et al 2011 odjadjare et al 2017 microalgae based wastewater treatment can be achieved in two types of engineered systems including open ponds and photobioreactors pbr the on going development of these systems has seen the recent implementation of the membrane photobioreactor mpbr concept integrating pbrs with membrane filtration processes luo et al 2017 it has been reported that mpbrs can not only produce highly concentrated biomass but achieve considerable reduction of nutrient level mainly due to the ability of mpbrs to enable independent control of hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt honda et al 2012 marbelia et al 2014 praveen et al 2016 despite their advantage over conventional algal systems the relative complexity of mpbr systems has been noted as a key challenge to implementation which derives from the operation and maintenance of the additional membrane separation process bilad et al 2014 praveen et al 2016 to better characterise and optimise these complex systems it is important to ensure that both suitable operating conditions are applied and performance parameters are appropriately measured microalgal biomass concentration a key system performance parameter of mpbrs can be linked to biomass productivity and nutrient removal efficiency microalgal biomass concentration can be quantified in two ways cell counting and gravimetric methods the latter can include measurement of biomass dry weight termed mixed liquor suspended solids mlss or ash free dry weight termed mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss the determination of biomass concentration in previous mpbr investigations relied largely on mlss or mlvss measurement bilad et al 2014 marbelia et al 2014 which is typical for the membrane bioreactor mbr applied for wastewater treatment from which the mpbr concept originates by contrast cell counting has not been considered in earlier mpbr research even though it is usually recommended that algal cells are counted in order to precisely quantify microalgal biomass particularly in non axenic or mixed cultures wood et al 2005 thus it is essential to examine the relationship between the two measures to verify the suitability of applying gravimetric methods in mpbr studies during mpbr wastewater treatment excess microalgal biomass is regularly withdrawn from a system and then subject to a harvesting step to separate them from the wastewater for further processing evaluating biomass harvesting potential ease of harvesting represents another important aspect of mpbr performance assessment the harvesting potential of mpbr biomass is influenced by several factors one of which being the degree of autofloculation autoflocculation also termed bio flocculation involves the aggregation of microalgae cells by positively charged calcium phosphate precipitate formed due to high ph and or extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by either microalgae or bacteria christenson and sims 2011 the degree of autoflocculation can be studied through the analysis of parameters such as size characteristics and fractal dimension of microalgal flocs a higher degree of autoflocculation tend to reduce the operating cost of subsequent biomass processing processes christenson and sims 2011 another simple method to assess biomass filterability or dewaterability is based on the determination of capillary suction time cst although the cst method has been applied in many biomass characterisation studies due to its practical advantage jin et al 2004 yin et al 2004 it has not been examined in the context of mpbrs hence cst is proposed as a potentially useful harvesting potential indicator for mpbr biomass numerous operating conditions are likely to impact the system performance of mpbrs in particular the hrt is a vital operating parameter of mpbr systems as it directly determines the nutrient loading and treatment capacity of a bioreactor luo et al 2017 unlike conventional pbrs that need to apply extended hrts 5 d to avoid biomass washout mpbrs have the potential to operate at considerably lower hrt 2 d marbelia et al 2014 this ability not only benefits biomass productivity because of the higher nutrient loading but also helps reduce capital costs honda et al 2012 marbelia et al 2014 nevertheless decreasing hrt is known to be detrimental to wastewater treatment efficiency judd et al 2015 apart from biomass production and wastewater treatment various other characteristics of mpbr biomass are also associated with hrt as suggested by the research undertaken for algal ponds and pbrs park et al 2011 wang et al 2014 a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of hrt on mpbr system performance is therefore needed another important operating condition is the srt under steady conditions the biomass productivity is expected to approximate the biomass wasting rate which is inversely related to the srt of a biological system unlike membrane bioreactors mbrs that are usually implemented at long srts 15 d a reasonably low srt around 10 d was found to be beneficial for mpbrs in order to achieve higher biomass yield luo et al 2017 moreover srt also influences the microbial community and the physicochemical properties that are associated with autoflocculation and settling ability of the biomass liao et al 2001 hence effective control of srt may lead to a more active and harvestable mpbr culture based on the above considerations this study defines two distinct but complementary objectives the first aim is to better characterise the operation and performance of mpbr by assessing the usefulness of new parameters and indicators in contrast to conventionally used performance parameters advanced analytical techniques including flow cytometry and laser diffraction analysis will be applied for the first time to lend insight into the biomass composition proportions of microalgae and bacteria cell viability and floc characteristics size fractal dimension and filterability in mpbrs secondly both conventional and newly established parameters are to be used to examine mpbrs operated under different operating conditions with a focus on hrt and srt to evaluate the advantages and limitations of applying each condition and define favourable conditions for obtaining desirable biomass characteristics and effective nutrient abatement overall this study aims to provide a systematic assessment of mpbr performance while advancing the understanding of system efficiency and optimisation 2 material and methods 2 1 microalgal strain and synthetic wastewater the axenic freshwater microalgae culture chlorella vulgaris was obtained from the csiro australian national algae culture collection anacc hobart australia and cultured in jaworski s medium the algae were grown in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks in a temperature cycling chamber incubator labec australia subjected to a 16 8 h light dark cycle with associated temperature control of 21 c 15 c hand mixing was applied to these cultures twice a day cell counting was performed daily with a light microscope leica dm750 microscope germany and a haemocytometer specifically a culture was well mixed before a 10 μl sample was transferred from the culture to the haemocytometer counting chamber counting of a minimum of 100 cells was repeated three times for each sample to obtain an estimated standard error upon the onset of the late exponential growth phase 12 days as determined by cell counting a portion of the cultures were used as inoculants for the mpbrs the others written as pure culture in the text were grown for 30 days and subjected to the same analyses as mpbr samples in order to compare the results between axenic batch culturing and mpbr cultivation under unsterile conditions a synthetic wastewater simulating secondary effluent from an activated sludge process with nitrification was used as mpbr feed table 1 the synthetic wastewater contained 9 0 0 7 mg l total organic carbon doc 14 1 0 5 mg l total nitrogen tn in the form of no3 n and 2 5 0 2 mg l total phosphorus tp in the form of po4 p which are consistent with the values reported previously for real secondary effluent luo et al 2017 2 2 mpbr operation 2 2 1 mpbr set up two mpbrs fig 1 were set up by adding a membrane module containing polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fibre membranes evoqua water technologies australia with a pore size of 0 04 μm into a flat panel photobioreactor pbr measuring 25 5 40 cm l w h the membrane permeate was controlled at a flux of 4 l m2 h to easily maintain hydraulic conditions in the mpbr systems it should be noted that this flux is not an optimised one and to increase the flux and thus economic viability of the process further fouling assessment is required to identify long term sustainable flux and effective fouling control strategies according to the literature well controlled mpbrs can potentially operate at flux of up to 15 l m2 h luo et al 2017 an air diffuser was mounted at the bottom of the bioreactor to provide aeration at an air flow rate of 2 l min for mixing of algal culture and scouring of membrane the resulting dissolved oxygen do concentration was stable 6 4 7 0 mg l throughout all experiments lower than the value 225 mm or 7 2 mg l do reported to induce algal growth inhibition lee and yeh 2015 each mpbr system was illuminated by two fluorescence lamps 2 9 w tech light usa and average light intensity on mpbr surface was approximately 85 μmol m2s 2 2 2 mpbr operation protocols prior to addition of membranes the bioreactors were subjected to an acclimatisation phase of 3 weeks to adjust the microalgae to the new growth medium table 1 and environment during the acclimatisation phase 0 5 l culture containing c vulgaris of a population density of approximately 107 cells ml was first added into each bioreactor pre filled with 4 5 l of synthetic wastewater no growth medium was fed to the reactor in the first week subsequently 36 ml of stock solution 1250 times synthetic wastewater concentration corresponding to the nutrient loading of hrt of 1 d was added every day for 2 weeks the srt was maintained at 30 d throughout the acclimatisation stage after the acclimatisation stage a membrane module was added into each pbr to commence operation in mpbr mode different combinations of hrts 1 and 4 d and srts 9 18 and 30 d were applied to the mpbrs for 50 d denoted by hrt1srt9 hrt1srt18 hrt1srt30 and hrt4srt30 the hrt1srt30 condition was used as the initial standard condition for assessment of performance parameters section 3 1 the synthetic wastewater was fed to the mpbrs at flow rates of 4 5 l d for 1 d hrt and 1 1 l d for 4 d hrt respectively the systems were operated in continuous mode and no membrane backwash or cleaning was undertaken in the course of the study samples were withdrawn from mpbrs twice a week for analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 determination of biomass concentration and productivity the biomass concentration was examined with three methods including cell counting measurement of mlss and mlvss cell counting was performed following the procedure mentioned in section 2 1 since microalgal cells aggregated due to autoflocculation during mpbr operation sonication for 5 min at 20 khz was used to break the clumps prior to counting a cell viability test by flow cytometry had been undertaken to confirm that no cell lysis was induced by the sonication process see fig s1 in supplementary material and refer to 2 3 2 for the description of flow cytometry analysis the measurement of mlss and mlvss were conducted based on well established apha methods apha 2005 the average cell productivity over the investigation period can be estimated using the following equation eq 1 1 r x xq waste v mpbr x srt where rx is the productivity of the microalgal cells cells ml d x is the average cell count of mpbr culture cells ml over the experimental period qwaste is the biomass wasting rate l d vmpbr is the working volume of mpbr l 2 3 2 determination of biomass composition flow cytometry analysis was undertaken to assess the biomass composition prior to the analysis samples were disaggregated with sonication for 5 min at 20 khz to avoid clogging of the flow system of the flow cytometer the pre treated samples were then diluted using jaworski s medium to attain a final cell concentration of 106 cells ml the analysis was undertaken using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd biosciences australia cell size was estimated by analysing the intensity of forward scatter fsc signals the autofluorescence was analysed using the 670 nm filter of the flow cytometer autofluorescence is a unique biomarker for photosynthetic organisms and assists in distinguishing microalgae from other particles hyka et al 2013 to determine cell viability a cell staining step with fluorescein diacetate fda was carried out the fda stock solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg fda sigma aldrich australia in 1 ml acetone 10 mg ml and stored in the dark at 20 c a working solution of 50 mg l fda was prepared before the cell staining process by adding 5 μl of fda stock solution into 1 ml of acetone to perform cell staining 20 μl fda working solution was pipetted into 1 ml sonicated sample followed by15 min incubation in dark fda fluorescence intensity was analysed using the 533 30 nm filter of the flow cytometer the data obtained from the flow cytometer were processed according to the method shown in fig 2 for illustration purpose the total events were first grouped into algal and non algal events based on cell size and autofluorescence the population featuring larger cell size and higher autofluorescence was considered to be microalgal community for each population fda fluorescence intensity in relation to enzymatic activity was used to differentiate viable cells stained and non viable cells unstained 2 3 3 nutrient analysis all samples for nutrient analysis were pre filtered with syringe filters whatman gd x pvdf pore size 0 45 μm the dissolved organic carbon doc of the filtered samples were measured using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer japan the no3 n and po4 p levels were determined using a dionex ics 1000 ion chromatography system thermo fisher scientific australia all nutrient analyses were performed in triplicate 2 3 4 determination of microalgal cell synthesis yield the ratio of the increase in cell counts to the amount of nutrient removed is defined as microalgal cell synthesis yield y which can be determined through applying the following equation 2 r x y s 0 s hrt where s0 is the nutrient concentration in the mpbr feed mg l s is the nutrient concentration in the mpbr permeate 2 3 5 characterisation of biomass harvesting potential particle size distribution was analysed using a mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern australia the samples were diluted in mpbr permeate to obtain a light obscuration level of between 10 and 20 to avoid multiple scattering a particle refractive index of 1 46 and a dispersant refractive index of 1 36 were applied gonzalez torres et al 2014 particle size distribution was measured on the basis of volume density and was divided into three groups including bacteria 2 μm individual microalgal cells 2 10 μm and flocs 10 μm the average size of the flocs was estimated using the size corresponding to the maxima of the floc size distribution which was not equivalent to the d50 value typically used in floc size measurements the structure of the microalgal biomass was evaluated using fractal dimension df determined according to gonzalez torres et al 2014 fractal dimension reflects the compaction of a floc where a df approaching 3 suggests tight packing of cells whereas values close to 1 indicate a relatively open floc structure the measurement of cst was undertaken using a triton type 319 multi purpose cst triton electronics limited uk according to a method described by jin et al 2004 2 3 6 statistical analysis pearson correlation coefficient r was applied to examine the correlation between different system parameters variables the correlation was deemed significant when r exceeded the critical value at 0 05 level 2 tailed the t test was used to assess the significance of the difference between the system performances under different hrts and srts significance was assumed if p value is less than 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 exploration of potentially useful parameters for mpbr performance assessment the aim of this section was to explore and identify potentially useful parameters for mpbr system characterisation targeting five key aspects including microalgal biomass concentration composition production wastewater treatment efficiency and harvesting potential all the associated experiments were performed at hrt1srt30 3 1 1 analysis of cell accumulation in the mpbr during the acclimatisation phase during the acclimatisation period the accumulation of algal cells was observed with the biomass concentrations in terms of cell counts mlss and mlvss increasing to 3 3 107 cells ml 0 72 g l and 0 70 g l respectively table 2 according to the flow cytometry results bacteria were not present in the inoculants but a small quantity of bacteria 0 2 were observed in the bioreactor during the acclimatisation period prior to mpbr operation the particle size distribution data indicated that most particles were expected to be individual microalgal cells 3 6 μm in diameter with only 9 3 volume fraction being flocs the size of the flocs was 20 3 0 4 μm which accords with earlier observations lee et al 2013 stable floc size and slightly increased volume fraction of flocs were observed during the acclimatisation phase the cst of the culture displayed a small increase from 6 3 to 7 6 s overall the acclimatisation phase enabled the growth of microalgae in the new growth medium no significant change was found for most biomass characteristics 3 1 2 analysis of biomass concentration during operation of the mpbr system the cell count increased from 3 3 107 to 4 5 107 cells ml over the duration of operation fig 3 a some variability was observed for example the number of cells increased to 5 6 107 cells ml after 23 days before decreasing to 3 4 107 cells ml by 32 days a possible explanation is that the high cell concentration limited the light penetration within the mpbr culture therefore hindering the photosynthetic growth of algae cells it can also be attributed to the accumulation of certain growth inhibitory algal organic matter aom that can be retained by the membranes discart et al 2014 overall the results are considerably lower than those reported for another mpbr study where cell concentration of an algae mixture comprising mainly botryococcus braunii ranged between 1 and 4 109 cells ml honda et al 2012 such difference highlights the importance of species selection for mpbr implementation in comparison to mpbrs cell counting has been more frequently applied for other types of algal bioreactors open ponds and pbrs the cell concentrations in those reactors are normally in the region of 107 cells ml after reaching steady conditions lim et al 2010 powell et al 2009 with a small number of studies showing cell counts higher than 108 cells ml when nutrient enriched medium was used keffer and kleinheinz 2002 stephenson et al 2010 in comparison to cell count mlss and mlvss appeared to be less fluctuant the values exhibited gradual increase for the first 17 days before stabilising at an average concentration of 1 17 mlss and 1 01 mlvss g l respectively fig 3a these values are higher than those generally 1 g l reported for other continuous microalgal bioreactors operated under similar conditions lv et al 2017 demonstrating the benefit of using membrane for biomass retention it should be noted that mpbr biomass is usually a complex mixture of microalgal cells cell debris bacteria and inorganic precipitate using mlss or mlvss is likely to overestimate the amount of microalgal cells accordingly the use of gravimetric methods may need to be supplemented with the assessment of biomass composition to minimising the interference from non algal particulate material 3 1 3 analysis of biomass composition during operation of the mpbr system a new parameter the cell count mlss ratio was examined to quantify the abundance of algal cells within a given amount of biomass the cell count mlss ratio of pure culture samples remained relatively constant 5 4 107 cells mg on average over time as opposed to a decreasing trend from 4 5 to 3 5 107 cells mg according to linear regression analysis r 0 79 observed for the mpbr samples fig 3b this indicates the proportion of microalgal cells within the mpbr biomass reduced gradually attributed to the build up of non algal particles to verify the findings indicated by the cell count mlss ratio the direct assessment of biomass composition in the mpbr was undertaken using flow cytometry which enables distinction between different groups of particles including viable algae non viable algae bacteria and cell debris according to fig 4 the proportion of algae viable and non viable was higher in the pure culture 97 0 compared to that of mpbr samples decreasing from 94 4 on day 0 to an average of 80 4 after 30 days this agreed well with the trend suggested by the cell count mlss ratio where a strong correlation r 0 90 was found between the two sets of results this confirms that cell count mlss ratio is an appropriate parameter for mpbr biomass characterisation biomass viability indicated by the proportion of viable algae fig 4 in biomass is a potentially useful parameter for mpbr biomass characterisation as it is closely linked to photosynthetic efficiency and nutrient uptake of microalgal biomass the abundance of viable algal cells was found to decline over time in the mpbr probably as a consequence of increasing biomass concentration in the mpbr culture leading to self shading effects long et al 2012 previous research also indicated that shear stress and high concentrations of metals or other inhibitory chemicals could reduce the viability of microalgal cells therefore measuring the proportion of viable algae in biomass is important for mpbrs particularly when high aeration used for membrane fouling mitigation is applied or in the case of treating toxic industrial effluents the proportion of bacteria is another parameter of interest under conditions hrt1srt30 the proportion of bacteria was found to gradually increase from 0 2 to 3 5 fig 4 such accumulation was attributable to the organic matter in the wastewater encouraging the growth of bacteria since bacteria are known to impact microalgae growth nutrient removal and biomass autoflocculation lee et al 2013 ma et al 2014 analysing the proportion of bacteria may assist in interpreting changes in mpbr biomass characteristics 3 1 4 analysis of biomass production during operation of the mpbr system the biomass production can be characterised using cell productivity calculated using eq 1 it was found that the mpbr hrt1srt30 achieved a cell productivity of 0 14 107 cells ml d comparable with those achieved in a pbr system adamczyk et al 2016 however higher productivities have also been observed under modified conditions for example a previous pbr study reported that the addition of fena edta 0 08 g l to the feed was able to boost the productivity of c vulgaris to 1 9 107 cells ml d dragone et al 2011 it is noteworthy that using cell count to assess biomass production should be conducted in steady state systems where significant change in microalgal cell volume is not expected chioccioli et al 2014 wood et al 2005 3 1 5 analysis of wastewater treatment efficiency during operation of the mpbr system the average no3 n removal efficiency in the mpbr hrt1srt30 ranged between 18 and 45 fig 5 a gradual increase was observed for the removal efficiency which reached a relatively stable level around 35 after 30 d comparable to literature values luo et al 2017 higher nitrogen removals 68 were reported in another mpbr operated at similar hrt and srt which used algae consortium containing mainly botryococcus braunii honda et al 2012 the removal of po4 p fluctuated between 15 and 34 fig 5 differing from most earlier findings compiled in a recent review in which higher po4 p removal 50 was reported luo et al 2017 the resulting average concentrations of no3 n and po4 p in the mpbr permeate were 10 7 and 1 9 mg l respectively these values are generally above the wastewater discharge permit limits implemented around the world e g european union tn 10 mg l and tp 1 mg l north america tn 1 5 3 mg l and tp 0 07 mg l oleszkiewicz and barnard 2006 overall further system optimisation would be needed to enable the mpbr to achieve the required degree of treatment before discharge particularly for p removal in contrast to no3 n and po4 p toc was more effectively removed by 54 6 73 9 fig 5 which could result from mixotrophic growth of c vulgaris bacteria uptake and membrane rejection given that the organic concentrations 1 g l glucose or 250 mg l toc that were applied in previous research abreu et al 2012 bhatnagar et al 2011 to induce mixotrophic growth of algae was much higher than the organic content 9 0 mg l toc of the synthetic wastewater used in this study it is speculated that the mixotrophic growth of the mpbr biomass was limited by contrast considering the increase in bacteria population as indicated by flow cytometer fig 4 bacterial consumption is deemed a possible pathway for organic removal in addition membrane could act as a barrier to prevent large organic compounds from entering the permeate most of the previous mpbr studies did not include the measurement of organic matter in the cultures however monitoring the level of organic matter can be of great importance as organic matter can affect mpbr systems in numerous ways for example organic compounds can not only support bacterial growth but also act as flocculants for algal cells or membrane foulants discart et al 2013 lee et al 2013 such influences highlight the need for further studies focusing on organic characterisation in mpbrs to be conducted during microalgal wastewater treatment biomass production occurs concurrently with the consumption of n and p from wastewater the average yield coefficients as determined using eq 2 for no3 n and po4 p were calculated to be 18 107 cells mg yn and 260 107 cells mg yp respectively these values can be further converted to the average amount of no3 n and po4 p consumed for the production of one microalgal cell which were calculated to be 5 6 pg cell for no3 n and 0 4 pg cell for po4 p it has been found that the nutrient uptake for individual cells may vary under different feed characteristics e g n p ratios microalgal species and internal compositions whitton et al 2016 determining yield coefficients therefore contributes to our understanding of the link between microalgal biomass production and wastewater treatment in mpbr systems 3 1 6 analysis of biomass harvesting potential during operation of the mpbr system three performance parameters were introduced to characterise biomass harvesting potential including floc size fractal dimension and cst from the size distribution graph fig 6 a three distinct peaks representing bacteria algae and flocs can be identified for the mpbr sample in pure cultures c vulgaris cells were mainly present individually whereas the mpbr culture comprised mostly flocs a two fold increase in floc size from 22 9 to 44 6 μm was observed in the mpbr culture during the study fig 6b attributed to autoflocculation given the absence of coagulants vandamme et al 2013 the floc size found in the mpbr was larger than that 8 20 μm reported previously for a pbr tuantet et al 2014 but considerably smaller than those of microalgal alum flocs 492 661 μm and ferric flocs 871 946 μm gonzalez torres et al 2014 compared to the mpbr biomass activated sludge tend to form larger flocs 55 311 μm possibly due to the stronger flocculating ability of activated sludge microorganisms mainly bacteria featuring higher production rates of eps jin et al 2004 lee et al 2013 therefore it has been suggested that bacteria bearing algal cultures generally exhibit enhanced flocculation of the biomass lee et al 2013 this view is corroborated by the results of this study that indicated a strong correlation r 0 88 between the floc size of the culture and the proportion of bacteria fig 4 in the mpbr hence algal bacterial interactions can be harnessed to improve the harvesting potential of mpbr biomass the initial df of microalgal flocs was 1 87 indicating a relatively open floc structure an increase was observed during the first 15 days followed by fluctuation around 2 11 fig 6b the increasingly compact floc structure could be explained by the incorporation of more cells in the microbial aggregates and the exposure to continuous hydrodynamic shear originating from upflow aeration tay et al 2001 the results df 2 01 2 18 after 15 days were found to be lower than the those of the activated sludge flocs up to 2 44 jin et al 2004 two likely explanations for the formation of denser flocs in activated sludge reactors are the stronger turbulence in the activated sludge tanks li and leung 2005 and the presence of pseudomonas zoogloea and flavobacterium that can produce gluey extracellular polymers li et al 2008 co culturing microalgae with these species therefore represents an opportunity to promote the production of more compact and potentially harvestable biomass the cst of microalgal culture in the mpbr hrt1srt30 increased from 7 5 s on day 0 to an average of 13 4 s after 30 days of cultivation see fig s2 in supplementary material considerably lower than those reported for highly concentrated raw activated sludge 50 310 s and digested activated sludge 270 380 s yin et al 2004 it has been suggested that the change in floc morphological characteristics size and df affects the dewaterability of the biomass jin et al 2004 in this study the statistical results demonstrate that these characteristics had weaker impact r 0 46 between cst and floc size r 0 53 between cst and df on the dewaterability compared to cell count which show significant correlation r 0 77 with cst thus the biomass concentration appears to be the major factor that influences the dewaterability of the mpbr biomass 3 2 impact of hrt and srt on mpbr system performance the evaluation of the impact of hrt and srt on mpbr performance was undertaken using the parameters deemed appropriate in the previous section including 1 cell count biomass concentration 2 cell count mlss proportion of viable algae and proportion of bacteria biomass composition 3 cell productivity biomass production 4 nutrient removal and yield coefficient wastewater treatment efficiency and 5 floc size df and cst harvesting potential 3 2 1 impact of hrt and srt on biomass concentration in mpbrs when extending the hrt from 1 d to 4 d significantly lower cell count 2 3 107 cells ml was observed in the mpbr fig 7 a these findings concur with prior work which reported the negative effect of prolonged hrts 3 5 d on biomass concentrations in mpbrs marbelia et al 2014 another mpbr study demonstrated no considerable change in cell concentrations of between hrts of 1 and 2 d honda et al 2012 consequently hrts of less than 2 d are generally preferred if a high density of microalgal cells are to be maintained in an mpbr treating secondary effluent as illustrated in fig 7a a decrease in srt 30 18 d did not lead to a considerable difference in cell counts 4 1 and 3 7 107 cells ml for srts of 30 and 18 d respectively whilst further reducing srt to 9 d resulted in a dilute culture whose concentration 2 2 107 cells ml was even lower than the initial concentration suggesting a certain degree of biomass washout therefore to sustain a high algae density in secondary effluent srt longer than 18 d is generally recommended regarding mlss the mpbrs tend to show higher values than pbrs table 3 it can be attributed to the fact that mpbrs are able to operate at high nutrient loading short hrt while applying a long srt to accumulate biomass in the reactor by contrast the pbr applying short hrt e g 2 days generally achieved considerably low mlss 0 12 g l due to culture washout anbalagan et al 2016 takabe et al 2016 it is worth noting that high biomass concentration may not be beneficial for algal bioreactors as concentrated cultures may limit light penetration a previous study found that a pbr culture mlss of 0 10 0 24 g l reduced light intensity from 150 μmol m2 s at the pbr surface to 43 μmol m2 s at 2 cm depth and to 7 μmol m2 s at 10 cm depth anbalagan et al 2016 since mpbrs generally feature denser biomass than pbrs more severe light shading can be expected in mpbrs it has been observed that a mpbr culture at mlss of 1 g l significantly decline light penetration in the reactor leading to less effective algae growth and nutrient removal sheng et al 2017 therefore it is recommended that thin layer reactors are employed for mpbrs growing highly concentrated biomass 3 2 2 impact of hrt and srt on biomass composition in mpbrs biomass composition parameters including cell count mlss ratio proportion of viable algae and proportion of bacteria were examined under different hrt and srt conditions fig 7b at the higher hrt of 4 d lower cell count mlss ratio of 3 2 107 cells mg was observed indicating higher system heterogeneity these findings can be probably attributed to the lower nutrient loading imparted at the 4 d hrt causing more endogenous decay of algal cells the conjecture is corroborated by the lower proportion of viable algae 62 8 at hrt4srt30 compared to that observed at hrt1srt30 74 8 an opposite trend was noted for the proportion of bacteria where the longer hrt allowed the growth of a higher proportion of bacteria 5 9 this result may be associated with the more severe cell decay under conditions hrt4srt30 leading to the release of more organic carbon into the culture and providing extra carbon source for bacterial proliferation the change in srt had relatively weak impact on the three parameters with an increasing trend observed for cell count mlss ratio and proportion of viable algae and a declining trend for proportion of bacteria when shortening the srt fig 7b it seems likely that the higher biomass wasting rates at the reduced srts were conducive to the washout of non algal particles reducing srt also increased the viability of the biomass ascribable to the lower biomass concentration fig 7a allowing better light penetration to support microalgae growth overall these findings have demonstrated for the first time that operating mpbrs at low hrts and srts can lead to a less heterogenous and more viable biomass according to the flow cytometry data cell size and granularity for bacteria similar bacterial communities were identified under all hrt and srt conditions it can be noted that the presence of the bacteria was not detrimental to algal growth since algae remained dominant throughout the experiments further investigation such as species identification via analysis of 16s rrna fulbright et al 2018 is required to better characterise understand and control the composition of bacterial communities it is worth mentioning that unlike axenic algae biomass bacteria bearing algal culture generally has limited application in production of food or high value chemicals muñoz and guieysse 2006 nonetheless microalgal bacterial culture has been recognised as a good source for aquaculture feed and energy production through anaerobic digestion muñoz and guieysse 2006 ramanan et al 2016 3 2 3 impact of hrt and srt on biomass production in mpbrs a lower productivity of microalgal cells 0 09 107 cells ml d was found at the higher hrt hrt4srt30 in comparison to that 0 14 107 cells ml d yielded under conditions hrt1srt30 the difference could be linked to the different nutrient loadings at the two hrts with the shorter hrt imparting a higher nutrient loading as discussed in 3 2 1 for this reason reducing hrt is a potential strategy to increase cell productivity in mpbr systems a trend of decreasing algae productivity was noted with increasing srt with the highest cell yield rate achieved under the conditions hrt1srt9 0 25 107 cells ml d followed by hrt1srt18 0 21 107 cells ml d in contrast to the present findings the results from a previous mpbr study growing a mixture of microalgae showed that an srt of 18 d was preferable to 9 d in terms of algae production honda et al 2012 this inconsistency may result from the use of different microalgae species that showed different growth rates therefore the selection of srt for mpbr operation is expected to be species dependent regarding mlss productivity the results of this study are comparable to those of other mpbr reports table 3 in most cases higher biomass yield 50 100 g m3 d was achieved at short hrt 1 2 d and moderate srt 9 18 d in mpbrs sequencing batch membrane photobioreactor sb mpbr operated at short hrt was found to create high level of stress to algae cultures due to abrupt change in growth medium during feeding phase sheng et al 2017 the pbrs and algal ponds reported in table 3 generally operated at long hrt to allow sufficient time for biomass accumulation the mlss productivity 50 g m3 d obtained in these systems tend to be lower than those observed for mpbrs implemented at much shorter hrt it is noteworthy that comparison of biomass growth between different systems should be carefully conducted taking into account multiple factors e g light penetration and co2 supply and the interrelationship between them adamczyk et al 2016 luo et al 2017 3 2 4 impact of hrt and srt on wastewater treatment efficiency in mpbrs in the present study applying hrt of 4 d achieved elimination of no3 n and po4 p by 79 and 78 respectively table 3 producing a permeate containing 3 2 2 0 mg l no3 n and 0 5 0 2 po4 p which potentially fulfilled the treatment requirements tn 10 mg l and tp 1 mg l stipulated by eu according to table 3 increasing hrt generally improves nutrient removal in mpbrs however prolonged hrt 8 d was observed to cause less nutrient uptake by algae due to growth inhibition when treating primary or secondary effluent most mpbrs exhibited effective n removal 75 and variable p elimination at hrts of more than 2 d similar to mpbrs other types of algal reactors showed enhanced nutrient removal at extended hrts nevertheless it is noted that high hrts 6 d is usually required for those systems to achieve similar level of nutrient removal as compared to mpbrs this indicates the relative benefit of high algae density and small footprint of mpbrs once compared to conventional algal reactors in comparison to hrt srt had a much weaker impact on the removal of no3 n and po4 p notwithstanding the distinct biomass characteristics e g cell concentration at different srts the findings are in good agreement with those reported in another mpbr study that found comparable nutrient removal at srts between 12 and 56 d noguchi et al 2017 by contrast srt has a more profound impact on pbrs and open ponds table 3 as srt is dependent on hrt in those systems for instance previous pbr displayed notably higher removal of n 79 and p 84 at 6 d srt in comparison to those found at 2 d srt 39 n removal and 56 p removal anbalagan et al 2016 interestingly using the longer hrt caused an appreciable drop in the removal of organic carbon from 68 to 31 table 3 the poorer organic removal at the prolonged hrt may be due to the higher amount of aom released in the reactor under the nutrient stress condition discart et al 2014 this can be verified by the higher doc concentrations 16 7 4 1 mg l in the mpbr hrt4srt30 compared to the that 7 9 2 4 mg l observed under conditions hrt1srt30 the higher proportion of bacteria in hrt4srt30 fig 7b was also likely to contribute to the higher concentration of organic matter inside the reactor lee et al 2013 another possible reason could be that the aom produced at hrt4srt30 were less retainable by the membrane due to their smaller size to verify this organic characterisation using size exclusion chromatography may be of great importance the cell yield coefficients for no3 n and po4 p uptake varied under different operating conditions table 4 in general reducing hrt and srt and thus increasing productivity resulted in increasing yield coefficients for both n from 188 to 347 107 cells mg no3 n and p 14 5 29 4 107 cells mg po4 p this can be translated into a lower nutrient uptake for production of a new cell at higher nutrient loadings in other words the cells generated at hrt1srt9 were likely to have the lowest n and p composition this was also evidenced in previous work that has shown a strong negative correlation between microalgal growth rate and percent composition of n in biomass with 1 5 fold higher growth rate leading to a reduction of n level in cells by 50 whitton et al 2016 hence microalgae biomass productivity is not necessarily indicative of nutrient uptake rate and strain selection for mpbr wastewater treatment should therefore not be based solely on choosing faster growing species 3 2 5 impact of hrt and srt on biomass harvesting potential in mpbrs the larger flocs with higher degree of compaction df was observed at the longer hrt of 4 d table 4 the nutrient stress associated with the extended hrt has previously been shown to lead to decreased surface charge as well as promoted aom production henderson et al 2008 luo et al 2017 it is considered likely that these changes could enhance biomass flocculation the higher proportion of bacteria in the biomass at the prolonged hrt fig 7b could also be a contributor to the formation of larger and firmer aggregates lee et al 2013 the csts did not show much difference between the two hrts despite different biomass characteristics table 4 increasing srt was found to enhance the flocculating property of the biomass no notable difference was observed between the df values at different srts these results differ from those reported for activated sludge which exhibited increasing df values of 2 07 2 21 and 2 36 at extending srts of 5 10 and 20 d li and leung 2005 operating mpbrs at longer srts tended to decrease the cst of the microalgal biomass presumably due to the higher biomass concentrations 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the importance of using appropriate parameters for mpbr system characterisation it proposed a set of carefully considered parameters for comprehensively evaluating biomass characteristics and wastewater treatment efficiency of mpbr systems using these parameters allowed the identification of advantages and limitations for mpbrs operated at different hrts and srts the findings should prove to be useful for future system optimisation of mpbrs and other microalgal bioreactors specific contributions made to the literature are shown as follows conventional gravimetric methods were found to be insufficiently accurate for quantifying microalgal biomass in mpbrs attributed to the build up of non algal particulate material detected by the flow cytometer cell count mlss ratio was proposed as a more insightful parameter to characterise microalgal population in heterogenous mpbr cultures important interrelationships between parameters were explored for instance the association between microalgal biomass generation and nutrient removal was examined through the determination of yield coefficient assessing yield coefficient can be useful in selecting microalgal strains with higher nutrient uptake storage ability the abundance of bacteria in the systems were observed to correlate well with the degree of biomass autoflocculation underlining the potential of applying bacterial microalgal consortia in mpbr systems for generation of more harvestable biomass shorter hrt and srt were associated with faster growing more viable and less heterogenous cultures while extending hrt and srt promoted nutrient removal and harvesting potential the findings highlight the significance of selecting suitable operating conditions for mpbr operation based on an overall consideration of biomass production requirements biomass concentration composition productivity and harvesting potential and wastewater

19600,membrane photobioreactor mpbr technology is an emerging algae based wastewater treatment system given the limitations due to the general use of conventional analytical approaches in previous research this study aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of mpbr performance through advanced characterisation techniques new performance parameters are also proposed encompassing five important aspects of mpbr system efficiency i e biomass concentration composition production nutrient uptake and harvesting potential under initial standard operating conditions performance parameters such as cell count mlss ratio cell viability proportion of bacteria and biomass yield coefficient were found to offer new insights into the operation of mpbr these parameters were then used for the first time to systematically investigate mpbrs operated under different hydraulic retention times hrts and solids retention times srts applying shorter hrt and srt was observed to increase cell viability and productivity up to 0 25 107 cells ml d as anticipated due to the higher nutrient loading it was noted that the faster growing algal cells featured lower requirement for nutrients on the other hand extending hrt and srt resulted in a more heterogeneous culture lower cell count mlss ratio and higher proportion of bacteria achieving a higher degree of autoflocculation and greater no3 n and po4 p removals of up to 79 and 78 respectively the results demonstrate the trade off between applying different hrts and srts and the importance of fully characterising system performance to critically assess the advantages and limitations of chosen operating conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae wastewater treatment biomass composition productivity harvesting potential 1 introduction cultivation of microalgae at high concentration integrated with wastewater treatment has received increased attention over the past decade for its industrial potential microalgae in either suspended or attached growth mode have demonstrated the ability to effectively remove nutrient and some other contaminants from wastewater arbib et al 2014 boelee et al 2011 the biomass generated from wastewater remediation is increasingly recognised as a potentially sustainable source of various products such as cosmetics pigments and biofuels hemaiswarya et al 2011 odjadjare et al 2017 microalgae based wastewater treatment can be achieved in two types of engineered systems including open ponds and photobioreactors pbr the on going development of these systems has seen the recent implementation of the membrane photobioreactor mpbr concept integrating pbrs with membrane filtration processes luo et al 2017 it has been reported that mpbrs can not only produce highly concentrated biomass but achieve considerable reduction of nutrient level mainly due to the ability of mpbrs to enable independent control of hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt honda et al 2012 marbelia et al 2014 praveen et al 2016 despite their advantage over conventional algal systems the relative complexity of mpbr systems has been noted as a key challenge to implementation which derives from the operation and maintenance of the additional membrane separation process bilad et al 2014 praveen et al 2016 to better characterise and optimise these complex systems it is important to ensure that both suitable operating conditions are applied and performance parameters are appropriately measured microalgal biomass concentration a key system performance parameter of mpbrs can be linked to biomass productivity and nutrient removal efficiency microalgal biomass concentration can be quantified in two ways cell counting and gravimetric methods the latter can include measurement of biomass dry weight termed mixed liquor suspended solids mlss or ash free dry weight termed mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss the determination of biomass concentration in previous mpbr investigations relied largely on mlss or mlvss measurement bilad et al 2014 marbelia et al 2014 which is typical for the membrane bioreactor mbr applied for wastewater treatment from which the mpbr concept originates by contrast cell counting has not been considered in earlier mpbr research even though it is usually recommended that algal cells are counted in order to precisely quantify microalgal biomass particularly in non axenic or mixed cultures wood et al 2005 thus it is essential to examine the relationship between the two measures to verify the suitability of applying gravimetric methods in mpbr studies during mpbr wastewater treatment excess microalgal biomass is regularly withdrawn from a system and then subject to a harvesting step to separate them from the wastewater for further processing evaluating biomass harvesting potential ease of harvesting represents another important aspect of mpbr performance assessment the harvesting potential of mpbr biomass is influenced by several factors one of which being the degree of autofloculation autoflocculation also termed bio flocculation involves the aggregation of microalgae cells by positively charged calcium phosphate precipitate formed due to high ph and or extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by either microalgae or bacteria christenson and sims 2011 the degree of autoflocculation can be studied through the analysis of parameters such as size characteristics and fractal dimension of microalgal flocs a higher degree of autoflocculation tend to reduce the operating cost of subsequent biomass processing processes christenson and sims 2011 another simple method to assess biomass filterability or dewaterability is based on the determination of capillary suction time cst although the cst method has been applied in many biomass characterisation studies due to its practical advantage jin et al 2004 yin et al 2004 it has not been examined in the context of mpbrs hence cst is proposed as a potentially useful harvesting potential indicator for mpbr biomass numerous operating conditions are likely to impact the system performance of mpbrs in particular the hrt is a vital operating parameter of mpbr systems as it directly determines the nutrient loading and treatment capacity of a bioreactor luo et al 2017 unlike conventional pbrs that need to apply extended hrts 5 d to avoid biomass washout mpbrs have the potential to operate at considerably lower hrt 2 d marbelia et al 2014 this ability not only benefits biomass productivity because of the higher nutrient loading but also helps reduce capital costs honda et al 2012 marbelia et al 2014 nevertheless decreasing hrt is known to be detrimental to wastewater treatment efficiency judd et al 2015 apart from biomass production and wastewater treatment various other characteristics of mpbr biomass are also associated with hrt as suggested by the research undertaken for algal ponds and pbrs park et al 2011 wang et al 2014 a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of hrt on mpbr system performance is therefore needed another important operating condition is the srt under steady conditions the biomass productivity is expected to approximate the biomass wasting rate which is inversely related to the srt of a biological system unlike membrane bioreactors mbrs that are usually implemented at long srts 15 d a reasonably low srt around 10 d was found to be beneficial for mpbrs in order to achieve higher biomass yield luo et al 2017 moreover srt also influences the microbial community and the physicochemical properties that are associated with autoflocculation and settling ability of the biomass liao et al 2001 hence effective control of srt may lead to a more active and harvestable mpbr culture based on the above considerations this study defines two distinct but complementary objectives the first aim is to better characterise the operation and performance of mpbr by assessing the usefulness of new parameters and indicators in contrast to conventionally used performance parameters advanced analytical techniques including flow cytometry and laser diffraction analysis will be applied for the first time to lend insight into the biomass composition proportions of microalgae and bacteria cell viability and floc characteristics size fractal dimension and filterability in mpbrs secondly both conventional and newly established parameters are to be used to examine mpbrs operated under different operating conditions with a focus on hrt and srt to evaluate the advantages and limitations of applying each condition and define favourable conditions for obtaining desirable biomass characteristics and effective nutrient abatement overall this study aims to provide a systematic assessment of mpbr performance while advancing the understanding of system efficiency and optimisation 2 material and methods 2 1 microalgal strain and synthetic wastewater the axenic freshwater microalgae culture chlorella vulgaris was obtained from the csiro australian national algae culture collection anacc hobart australia and cultured in jaworski s medium the algae were grown in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks in a temperature cycling chamber incubator labec australia subjected to a 16 8 h light dark cycle with associated temperature control of 21 c 15 c hand mixing was applied to these cultures twice a day cell counting was performed daily with a light microscope leica dm750 microscope germany and a haemocytometer specifically a culture was well mixed before a 10 μl sample was transferred from the culture to the haemocytometer counting chamber counting of a minimum of 100 cells was repeated three times for each sample to obtain an estimated standard error upon the onset of the late exponential growth phase 12 days as determined by cell counting a portion of the cultures were used as inoculants for the mpbrs the others written as pure culture in the text were grown for 30 days and subjected to the same analyses as mpbr samples in order to compare the results between axenic batch culturing and mpbr cultivation under unsterile conditions a synthetic wastewater simulating secondary effluent from an activated sludge process with nitrification was used as mpbr feed table 1 the synthetic wastewater contained 9 0 0 7 mg l total organic carbon doc 14 1 0 5 mg l total nitrogen tn in the form of no3 n and 2 5 0 2 mg l total phosphorus tp in the form of po4 p which are consistent with the values reported previously for real secondary effluent luo et al 2017 2 2 mpbr operation 2 2 1 mpbr set up two mpbrs fig 1 were set up by adding a membrane module containing polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fibre membranes evoqua water technologies australia with a pore size of 0 04 μm into a flat panel photobioreactor pbr measuring 25 5 40 cm l w h the membrane permeate was controlled at a flux of 4 l m2 h to easily maintain hydraulic conditions in the mpbr systems it should be noted that this flux is not an optimised one and to increase the flux and thus economic viability of the process further fouling assessment is required to identify long term sustainable flux and effective fouling control strategies according to the literature well controlled mpbrs can potentially operate at flux of up to 15 l m2 h luo et al 2017 an air diffuser was mounted at the bottom of the bioreactor to provide aeration at an air flow rate of 2 l min for mixing of algal culture and scouring of membrane the resulting dissolved oxygen do concentration was stable 6 4 7 0 mg l throughout all experiments lower than the value 225 mm or 7 2 mg l do reported to induce algal growth inhibition lee and yeh 2015 each mpbr system was illuminated by two fluorescence lamps 2 9 w tech light usa and average light intensity on mpbr surface was approximately 85 μmol m2s 2 2 2 mpbr operation protocols prior to addition of membranes the bioreactors were subjected to an acclimatisation phase of 3 weeks to adjust the microalgae to the new growth medium table 1 and environment during the acclimatisation phase 0 5 l culture containing c vulgaris of a population density of approximately 107 cells ml was first added into each bioreactor pre filled with 4 5 l of synthetic wastewater no growth medium was fed to the reactor in the first week subsequently 36 ml of stock solution 1250 times synthetic wastewater concentration corresponding to the nutrient loading of hrt of 1 d was added every day for 2 weeks the srt was maintained at 30 d throughout the acclimatisation stage after the acclimatisation stage a membrane module was added into each pbr to commence operation in mpbr mode different combinations of hrts 1 and 4 d and srts 9 18 and 30 d were applied to the mpbrs for 50 d denoted by hrt1srt9 hrt1srt18 hrt1srt30 and hrt4srt30 the hrt1srt30 condition was used as the initial standard condition for assessment of performance parameters section 3 1 the synthetic wastewater was fed to the mpbrs at flow rates of 4 5 l d for 1 d hrt and 1 1 l d for 4 d hrt respectively the systems were operated in continuous mode and no membrane backwash or cleaning was undertaken in the course of the study samples were withdrawn from mpbrs twice a week for analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 determination of biomass concentration and productivity the biomass concentration was examined with three methods including cell counting measurement of mlss and mlvss cell counting was performed following the procedure mentioned in section 2 1 since microalgal cells aggregated due to autoflocculation during mpbr operation sonication for 5 min at 20 khz was used to break the clumps prior to counting a cell viability test by flow cytometry had been undertaken to confirm that no cell lysis was induced by the sonication process see fig s1 in supplementary material and refer to 2 3 2 for the description of flow cytometry analysis the measurement of mlss and mlvss were conducted based on well established apha methods apha 2005 the average cell productivity over the investigation period can be estimated using the following equation eq 1 1 r x xq waste v mpbr x srt where rx is the productivity of the microalgal cells cells ml d x is the average cell count of mpbr culture cells ml over the experimental period qwaste is the biomass wasting rate l d vmpbr is the working volume of mpbr l 2 3 2 determination of biomass composition flow cytometry analysis was undertaken to assess the biomass composition prior to the analysis samples were disaggregated with sonication for 5 min at 20 khz to avoid clogging of the flow system of the flow cytometer the pre treated samples were then diluted using jaworski s medium to attain a final cell concentration of 106 cells ml the analysis was undertaken using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd biosciences australia cell size was estimated by analysing the intensity of forward scatter fsc signals the autofluorescence was analysed using the 670 nm filter of the flow cytometer autofluorescence is a unique biomarker for photosynthetic organisms and assists in distinguishing microalgae from other particles hyka et al 2013 to determine cell viability a cell staining step with fluorescein diacetate fda was carried out the fda stock solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg fda sigma aldrich australia in 1 ml acetone 10 mg ml and stored in the dark at 20 c a working solution of 50 mg l fda was prepared before the cell staining process by adding 5 μl of fda stock solution into 1 ml of acetone to perform cell staining 20 μl fda working solution was pipetted into 1 ml sonicated sample followed by15 min incubation in dark fda fluorescence intensity was analysed using the 533 30 nm filter of the flow cytometer the data obtained from the flow cytometer were processed according to the method shown in fig 2 for illustration purpose the total events were first grouped into algal and non algal events based on cell size and autofluorescence the population featuring larger cell size and higher autofluorescence was considered to be microalgal community for each population fda fluorescence intensity in relation to enzymatic activity was used to differentiate viable cells stained and non viable cells unstained 2 3 3 nutrient analysis all samples for nutrient analysis were pre filtered with syringe filters whatman gd x pvdf pore size 0 45 μm the dissolved organic carbon doc of the filtered samples were measured using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer japan the no3 n and po4 p levels were determined using a dionex ics 1000 ion chromatography system thermo fisher scientific australia all nutrient analyses were performed in triplicate 2 3 4 determination of microalgal cell synthesis yield the ratio of the increase in cell counts to the amount of nutrient removed is defined as microalgal cell synthesis yield y which can be determined through applying the following equation 2 r x y s 0 s hrt where s0 is the nutrient concentration in the mpbr feed mg l s is the nutrient concentration in the mpbr permeate 2 3 5 characterisation of biomass harvesting potential particle size distribution was analysed using a mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern australia the samples were diluted in mpbr permeate to obtain a light obscuration level of between 10 and 20 to avoid multiple scattering a particle refractive index of 1 46 and a dispersant refractive index of 1 36 were applied gonzalez torres et al 2014 particle size distribution was measured on the basis of volume density and was divided into three groups including bacteria 2 μm individual microalgal cells 2 10 μm and flocs 10 μm the average size of the flocs was estimated using the size corresponding to the maxima of the floc size distribution which was not equivalent to the d50 value typically used in floc size measurements the structure of the microalgal biomass was evaluated using fractal dimension df determined according to gonzalez torres et al 2014 fractal dimension reflects the compaction of a floc where a df approaching 3 suggests tight packing of cells whereas values close to 1 indicate a relatively open floc structure the measurement of cst was undertaken using a triton type 319 multi purpose cst triton electronics limited uk according to a method described by jin et al 2004 2 3 6 statistical analysis pearson correlation coefficient r was applied to examine the correlation between different system parameters variables the correlation was deemed significant when r exceeded the critical value at 0 05 level 2 tailed the t test was used to assess the significance of the difference between the system performances under different hrts and srts significance was assumed if p value is less than 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 exploration of potentially useful parameters for mpbr performance assessment the aim of this section was to explore and identify potentially useful parameters for mpbr system characterisation targeting five key aspects including microalgal biomass concentration composition production wastewater treatment efficiency and harvesting potential all the associated experiments were performed at hrt1srt30 3 1 1 analysis of cell accumulation in the mpbr during the acclimatisation phase during the acclimatisation period the accumulation of algal cells was observed with the biomass concentrations in terms of cell counts mlss and mlvss increasing to 3 3 107 cells ml 0 72 g l and 0 70 g l respectively table 2 according to the flow cytometry results bacteria were not present in the inoculants but a small quantity of bacteria 0 2 were observed in the bioreactor during the acclimatisation period prior to mpbr operation the particle size distribution data indicated that most particles were expected to be individual microalgal cells 3 6 μm in diameter with only 9 3 volume fraction being flocs the size of the flocs was 20 3 0 4 μm which accords with earlier observations lee et al 2013 stable floc size and slightly increased volume fraction of flocs were observed during the acclimatisation phase the cst of the culture displayed a small increase from 6 3 to 7 6 s overall the acclimatisation phase enabled the growth of microalgae in the new growth medium no significant change was found for most biomass characteristics 3 1 2 analysis of biomass concentration during operation of the mpbr system the cell count increased from 3 3 107 to 4 5 107 cells ml over the duration of operation fig 3 a some variability was observed for example the number of cells increased to 5 6 107 cells ml after 23 days before decreasing to 3 4 107 cells ml by 32 days a possible explanation is that the high cell concentration limited the light penetration within the mpbr culture therefore hindering the photosynthetic growth of algae cells it can also be attributed to the accumulation of certain growth inhibitory algal organic matter aom that can be retained by the membranes discart et al 2014 overall the results are considerably lower than those reported for another mpbr study where cell concentration of an algae mixture comprising mainly botryococcus braunii ranged between 1 and 4 109 cells ml honda et al 2012 such difference highlights the importance of species selection for mpbr implementation in comparison to mpbrs cell counting has been more frequently applied for other types of algal bioreactors open ponds and pbrs the cell concentrations in those reactors are normally in the region of 107 cells ml after reaching steady conditions lim et al 2010 powell et al 2009 with a small number of studies showing cell counts higher than 108 cells ml when nutrient enriched medium was used keffer and kleinheinz 2002 stephenson et al 2010 in comparison to cell count mlss and mlvss appeared to be less fluctuant the values exhibited gradual increase for the first 17 days before stabilising at an average concentration of 1 17 mlss and 1 01 mlvss g l respectively fig 3a these values are higher than those generally 1 g l reported for other continuous microalgal bioreactors operated under similar conditions lv et al 2017 demonstrating the benefit of using membrane for biomass retention it should be noted that mpbr biomass is usually a complex mixture of microalgal cells cell debris bacteria and inorganic precipitate using mlss or mlvss is likely to overestimate the amount of microalgal cells accordingly the use of gravimetric methods may need to be supplemented with the assessment of biomass composition to minimising the interference from non algal particulate material 3 1 3 analysis of biomass composition during operation of the mpbr system a new parameter the cell count mlss ratio was examined to quantify the abundance of algal cells within a given amount of biomass the cell count mlss ratio of pure culture samples remained relatively constant 5 4 107 cells mg on average over time as opposed to a decreasing trend from 4 5 to 3 5 107 cells mg according to linear regression analysis r 0 79 observed for the mpbr samples fig 3b this indicates the proportion of microalgal cells within the mpbr biomass reduced gradually attributed to the build up of non algal particles to verify the findings indicated by the cell count mlss ratio the direct assessment of biomass composition in the mpbr was undertaken using flow cytometry which enables distinction between different groups of particles including viable algae non viable algae bacteria and cell debris according to fig 4 the proportion of algae viable and non viable was higher in the pure culture 97 0 compared to that of mpbr samples decreasing from 94 4 on day 0 to an average of 80 4 after 30 days this agreed well with the trend suggested by the cell count mlss ratio where a strong correlation r 0 90 was found between the two sets of results this confirms that cell count mlss ratio is an appropriate parameter for mpbr biomass characterisation biomass viability indicated by the proportion of viable algae fig 4 in biomass is a potentially useful parameter for mpbr biomass characterisation as it is closely linked to photosynthetic efficiency and nutrient uptake of microalgal biomass the abundance of viable algal cells was found to decline over time in the mpbr probably as a consequence of increasing biomass concentration in the mpbr culture leading to self shading effects long et al 2012 previous research also indicated that shear stress and high concentrations of metals or other inhibitory chemicals could reduce the viability of microalgal cells therefore measuring the proportion of viable algae in biomass is important for mpbrs particularly when high aeration used for membrane fouling mitigation is applied or in the case of treating toxic industrial effluents the proportion of bacteria is another parameter of interest under conditions hrt1srt30 the proportion of bacteria was found to gradually increase from 0 2 to 3 5 fig 4 such accumulation was attributable to the organic matter in the wastewater encouraging the growth of bacteria since bacteria are known to impact microalgae growth nutrient removal and biomass autoflocculation lee et al 2013 ma et al 2014 analysing the proportion of bacteria may assist in interpreting changes in mpbr biomass characteristics 3 1 4 analysis of biomass production during operation of the mpbr system the biomass production can be characterised using cell productivity calculated using eq 1 it was found that the mpbr hrt1srt30 achieved a cell productivity of 0 14 107 cells ml d comparable with those achieved in a pbr system adamczyk et al 2016 however higher productivities have also been observed under modified conditions for example a previous pbr study reported that the addition of fena edta 0 08 g l to the feed was able to boost the productivity of c vulgaris to 1 9 107 cells ml d dragone et al 2011 it is noteworthy that using cell count to assess biomass production should be conducted in steady state systems where significant change in microalgal cell volume is not expected chioccioli et al 2014 wood et al 2005 3 1 5 analysis of wastewater treatment efficiency during operation of the mpbr system the average no3 n removal efficiency in the mpbr hrt1srt30 ranged between 18 and 45 fig 5 a gradual increase was observed for the removal efficiency which reached a relatively stable level around 35 after 30 d comparable to literature values luo et al 2017 higher nitrogen removals 68 were reported in another mpbr operated at similar hrt and srt which used algae consortium containing mainly botryococcus braunii honda et al 2012 the removal of po4 p fluctuated between 15 and 34 fig 5 differing from most earlier findings compiled in a recent review in which higher po4 p removal 50 was reported luo et al 2017 the resulting average concentrations of no3 n and po4 p in the mpbr permeate were 10 7 and 1 9 mg l respectively these values are generally above the wastewater discharge permit limits implemented around the world e g european union tn 10 mg l and tp 1 mg l north america tn 1 5 3 mg l and tp 0 07 mg l oleszkiewicz and barnard 2006 overall further system optimisation would be needed to enable the mpbr to achieve the required degree of treatment before discharge particularly for p removal in contrast to no3 n and po4 p toc was more effectively removed by 54 6 73 9 fig 5 which could result from mixotrophic growth of c vulgaris bacteria uptake and membrane rejection given that the organic concentrations 1 g l glucose or 250 mg l toc that were applied in previous research abreu et al 2012 bhatnagar et al 2011 to induce mixotrophic growth of algae was much higher than the organic content 9 0 mg l toc of the synthetic wastewater used in this study it is speculated that the mixotrophic growth of the mpbr biomass was limited by contrast considering the increase in bacteria population as indicated by flow cytometer fig 4 bacterial consumption is deemed a possible pathway for organic removal in addition membrane could act as a barrier to prevent large organic compounds from entering the permeate most of the previous mpbr studies did not include the measurement of organic matter in the cultures however monitoring the level of organic matter can be of great importance as organic matter can affect mpbr systems in numerous ways for example organic compounds can not only support bacterial growth but also act as flocculants for algal cells or membrane foulants discart et al 2013 lee et al 2013 such influences highlight the need for further studies focusing on organic characterisation in mpbrs to be conducted during microalgal wastewater treatment biomass production occurs concurrently with the consumption of n and p from wastewater the average yield coefficients as determined using eq 2 for no3 n and po4 p were calculated to be 18 107 cells mg yn and 260 107 cells mg yp respectively these values can be further converted to the average amount of no3 n and po4 p consumed for the production of one microalgal cell which were calculated to be 5 6 pg cell for no3 n and 0 4 pg cell for po4 p it has been found that the nutrient uptake for individual cells may vary under different feed characteristics e g n p ratios microalgal species and internal compositions whitton et al 2016 determining yield coefficients therefore contributes to our understanding of the link between microalgal biomass production and wastewater treatment in mpbr systems 3 1 6 analysis of biomass harvesting potential during operation of the mpbr system three performance parameters were introduced to characterise biomass harvesting potential including floc size fractal dimension and cst from the size distribution graph fig 6 a three distinct peaks representing bacteria algae and flocs can be identified for the mpbr sample in pure cultures c vulgaris cells were mainly present individually whereas the mpbr culture comprised mostly flocs a two fold increase in floc size from 22 9 to 44 6 μm was observed in the mpbr culture during the study fig 6b attributed to autoflocculation given the absence of coagulants vandamme et al 2013 the floc size found in the mpbr was larger than that 8 20 μm reported previously for a pbr tuantet et al 2014 but considerably smaller than those of microalgal alum flocs 492 661 μm and ferric flocs 871 946 μm gonzalez torres et al 2014 compared to the mpbr biomass activated sludge tend to form larger flocs 55 311 μm possibly due to the stronger flocculating ability of activated sludge microorganisms mainly bacteria featuring higher production rates of eps jin et al 2004 lee et al 2013 therefore it has been suggested that bacteria bearing algal cultures generally exhibit enhanced flocculation of the biomass lee et al 2013 this view is corroborated by the results of this study that indicated a strong correlation r 0 88 between the floc size of the culture and the proportion of bacteria fig 4 in the mpbr hence algal bacterial interactions can be harnessed to improve the harvesting potential of mpbr biomass the initial df of microalgal flocs was 1 87 indicating a relatively open floc structure an increase was observed during the first 15 days followed by fluctuation around 2 11 fig 6b the increasingly compact floc structure could be explained by the incorporation of more cells in the microbial aggregates and the exposure to continuous hydrodynamic shear originating from upflow aeration tay et al 2001 the results df 2 01 2 18 after 15 days were found to be lower than the those of the activated sludge flocs up to 2 44 jin et al 2004 two likely explanations for the formation of denser flocs in activated sludge reactors are the stronger turbulence in the activated sludge tanks li and leung 2005 and the presence of pseudomonas zoogloea and flavobacterium that can produce gluey extracellular polymers li et al 2008 co culturing microalgae with these species therefore represents an opportunity to promote the production of more compact and potentially harvestable biomass the cst of microalgal culture in the mpbr hrt1srt30 increased from 7 5 s on day 0 to an average of 13 4 s after 30 days of cultivation see fig s2 in supplementary material considerably lower than those reported for highly concentrated raw activated sludge 50 310 s and digested activated sludge 270 380 s yin et al 2004 it has been suggested that the change in floc morphological characteristics size and df affects the dewaterability of the biomass jin et al 2004 in this study the statistical results demonstrate that these characteristics had weaker impact r 0 46 between cst and floc size r 0 53 between cst and df on the dewaterability compared to cell count which show significant correlation r 0 77 with cst thus the biomass concentration appears to be the major factor that influences the dewaterability of the mpbr biomass 3 2 impact of hrt and srt on mpbr system performance the evaluation of the impact of hrt and srt on mpbr performance was undertaken using the parameters deemed appropriate in the previous section including 1 cell count biomass concentration 2 cell count mlss proportion of viable algae and proportion of bacteria biomass composition 3 cell productivity biomass production 4 nutrient removal and yield coefficient wastewater treatment efficiency and 5 floc size df and cst harvesting potential 3 2 1 impact of hrt and srt on biomass concentration in mpbrs when extending the hrt from 1 d to 4 d significantly lower cell count 2 3 107 cells ml was observed in the mpbr fig 7 a these findings concur with prior work which reported the negative effect of prolonged hrts 3 5 d on biomass concentrations in mpbrs marbelia et al 2014 another mpbr study demonstrated no considerable change in cell concentrations of between hrts of 1 and 2 d honda et al 2012 consequently hrts of less than 2 d are generally preferred if a high density of microalgal cells are to be maintained in an mpbr treating secondary effluent as illustrated in fig 7a a decrease in srt 30 18 d did not lead to a considerable difference in cell counts 4 1 and 3 7 107 cells ml for srts of 30 and 18 d respectively whilst further reducing srt to 9 d resulted in a dilute culture whose concentration 2 2 107 cells ml was even lower than the initial concentration suggesting a certain degree of biomass washout therefore to sustain a high algae density in secondary effluent srt longer than 18 d is generally recommended regarding mlss the mpbrs tend to show higher values than pbrs table 3 it can be attributed to the fact that mpbrs are able to operate at high nutrient loading short hrt while applying a long srt to accumulate biomass in the reactor by contrast the pbr applying short hrt e g 2 days generally achieved considerably low mlss 0 12 g l due to culture washout anbalagan et al 2016 takabe et al 2016 it is worth noting that high biomass concentration may not be beneficial for algal bioreactors as concentrated cultures may limit light penetration a previous study found that a pbr culture mlss of 0 10 0 24 g l reduced light intensity from 150 μmol m2 s at the pbr surface to 43 μmol m2 s at 2 cm depth and to 7 μmol m2 s at 10 cm depth anbalagan et al 2016 since mpbrs generally feature denser biomass than pbrs more severe light shading can be expected in mpbrs it has been observed that a mpbr culture at mlss of 1 g l significantly decline light penetration in the reactor leading to less effective algae growth and nutrient removal sheng et al 2017 therefore it is recommended that thin layer reactors are employed for mpbrs growing highly concentrated biomass 3 2 2 impact of hrt and srt on biomass composition in mpbrs biomass composition parameters including cell count mlss ratio proportion of viable algae and proportion of bacteria were examined under different hrt and srt conditions fig 7b at the higher hrt of 4 d lower cell count mlss ratio of 3 2 107 cells mg was observed indicating higher system heterogeneity these findings can be probably attributed to the lower nutrient loading imparted at the 4 d hrt causing more endogenous decay of algal cells the conjecture is corroborated by the lower proportion of viable algae 62 8 at hrt4srt30 compared to that observed at hrt1srt30 74 8 an opposite trend was noted for the proportion of bacteria where the longer hrt allowed the growth of a higher proportion of bacteria 5 9 this result may be associated with the more severe cell decay under conditions hrt4srt30 leading to the release of more organic carbon into the culture and providing extra carbon source for bacterial proliferation the change in srt had relatively weak impact on the three parameters with an increasing trend observed for cell count mlss ratio and proportion of viable algae and a declining trend for proportion of bacteria when shortening the srt fig 7b it seems likely that the higher biomass wasting rates at the reduced srts were conducive to the washout of non algal particles reducing srt also increased the viability of the biomass ascribable to the lower biomass concentration fig 7a allowing better light penetration to support microalgae growth overall these findings have demonstrated for the first time that operating mpbrs at low hrts and srts can lead to a less heterogenous and more viable biomass according to the flow cytometry data cell size and granularity for bacteria similar bacterial communities were identified under all hrt and srt conditions it can be noted that the presence of the bacteria was not detrimental to algal growth since algae remained dominant throughout the experiments further investigation such as species identification via analysis of 16s rrna fulbright et al 2018 is required to better characterise understand and control the composition of bacterial communities it is worth mentioning that unlike axenic algae biomass bacteria bearing algal culture generally has limited application in production of food or high value chemicals muñoz and guieysse 2006 nonetheless microalgal bacterial culture has been recognised as a good source for aquaculture feed and energy production through anaerobic digestion muñoz and guieysse 2006 ramanan et al 2016 3 2 3 impact of hrt and srt on biomass production in mpbrs a lower productivity of microalgal cells 0 09 107 cells ml d was found at the higher hrt hrt4srt30 in comparison to that 0 14 107 cells ml d yielded under conditions hrt1srt30 the difference could be linked to the different nutrient loadings at the two hrts with the shorter hrt imparting a higher nutrient loading as discussed in 3 2 1 for this reason reducing hrt is a potential strategy to increase cell productivity in mpbr systems a trend of decreasing algae productivity was noted with increasing srt with the highest cell yield rate achieved under the conditions hrt1srt9 0 25 107 cells ml d followed by hrt1srt18 0 21 107 cells ml d in contrast to the present findings the results from a previous mpbr study growing a mixture of microalgae showed that an srt of 18 d was preferable to 9 d in terms of algae production honda et al 2012 this inconsistency may result from the use of different microalgae species that showed different growth rates therefore the selection of srt for mpbr operation is expected to be species dependent regarding mlss productivity the results of this study are comparable to those of other mpbr reports table 3 in most cases higher biomass yield 50 100 g m3 d was achieved at short hrt 1 2 d and moderate srt 9 18 d in mpbrs sequencing batch membrane photobioreactor sb mpbr operated at short hrt was found to create high level of stress to algae cultures due to abrupt change in growth medium during feeding phase sheng et al 2017 the pbrs and algal ponds reported in table 3 generally operated at long hrt to allow sufficient time for biomass accumulation the mlss productivity 50 g m3 d obtained in these systems tend to be lower than those observed for mpbrs implemented at much shorter hrt it is noteworthy that comparison of biomass growth between different systems should be carefully conducted taking into account multiple factors e g light penetration and co2 supply and the interrelationship between them adamczyk et al 2016 luo et al 2017 3 2 4 impact of hrt and srt on wastewater treatment efficiency in mpbrs in the present study applying hrt of 4 d achieved elimination of no3 n and po4 p by 79 and 78 respectively table 3 producing a permeate containing 3 2 2 0 mg l no3 n and 0 5 0 2 po4 p which potentially fulfilled the treatment requirements tn 10 mg l and tp 1 mg l stipulated by eu according to table 3 increasing hrt generally improves nutrient removal in mpbrs however prolonged hrt 8 d was observed to cause less nutrient uptake by algae due to growth inhibition when treating primary or secondary effluent most mpbrs exhibited effective n removal 75 and variable p elimination at hrts of more than 2 d similar to mpbrs other types of algal reactors showed enhanced nutrient removal at extended hrts nevertheless it is noted that high hrts 6 d is usually required for those systems to achieve similar level of nutrient removal as compared to mpbrs this indicates the relative benefit of high algae density and small footprint of mpbrs once compared to conventional algal reactors in comparison to hrt srt had a much weaker impact on the removal of no3 n and po4 p notwithstanding the distinct biomass characteristics e g cell concentration at different srts the findings are in good agreement with those reported in another mpbr study that found comparable nutrient removal at srts between 12 and 56 d noguchi et al 2017 by contrast srt has a more profound impact on pbrs and open ponds table 3 as srt is dependent on hrt in those systems for instance previous pbr displayed notably higher removal of n 79 and p 84 at 6 d srt in comparison to those found at 2 d srt 39 n removal and 56 p removal anbalagan et al 2016 interestingly using the longer hrt caused an appreciable drop in the removal of organic carbon from 68 to 31 table 3 the poorer organic removal at the prolonged hrt may be due to the higher amount of aom released in the reactor under the nutrient stress condition discart et al 2014 this can be verified by the higher doc concentrations 16 7 4 1 mg l in the mpbr hrt4srt30 compared to the that 7 9 2 4 mg l observed under conditions hrt1srt30 the higher proportion of bacteria in hrt4srt30 fig 7b was also likely to contribute to the higher concentration of organic matter inside the reactor lee et al 2013 another possible reason could be that the aom produced at hrt4srt30 were less retainable by the membrane due to their smaller size to verify this organic characterisation using size exclusion chromatography may be of great importance the cell yield coefficients for no3 n and po4 p uptake varied under different operating conditions table 4 in general reducing hrt and srt and thus increasing productivity resulted in increasing yield coefficients for both n from 188 to 347 107 cells mg no3 n and p 14 5 29 4 107 cells mg po4 p this can be translated into a lower nutrient uptake for production of a new cell at higher nutrient loadings in other words the cells generated at hrt1srt9 were likely to have the lowest n and p composition this was also evidenced in previous work that has shown a strong negative correlation between microalgal growth rate and percent composition of n in biomass with 1 5 fold higher growth rate leading to a reduction of n level in cells by 50 whitton et al 2016 hence microalgae biomass productivity is not necessarily indicative of nutrient uptake rate and strain selection for mpbr wastewater treatment should therefore not be based solely on choosing faster growing species 3 2 5 impact of hrt and srt on biomass harvesting potential in mpbrs the larger flocs with higher degree of compaction df was observed at the longer hrt of 4 d table 4 the nutrient stress associated with the extended hrt has previously been shown to lead to decreased surface charge as well as promoted aom production henderson et al 2008 luo et al 2017 it is considered likely that these changes could enhance biomass flocculation the higher proportion of bacteria in the biomass at the prolonged hrt fig 7b could also be a contributor to the formation of larger and firmer aggregates lee et al 2013 the csts did not show much difference between the two hrts despite different biomass characteristics table 4 increasing srt was found to enhance the flocculating property of the biomass no notable difference was observed between the df values at different srts these results differ from those reported for activated sludge which exhibited increasing df values of 2 07 2 21 and 2 36 at extending srts of 5 10 and 20 d li and leung 2005 operating mpbrs at longer srts tended to decrease the cst of the microalgal biomass presumably due to the higher biomass concentrations 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the importance of using appropriate parameters for mpbr system characterisation it proposed a set of carefully considered parameters for comprehensively evaluating biomass characteristics and wastewater treatment efficiency of mpbr systems using these parameters allowed the identification of advantages and limitations for mpbrs operated at different hrts and srts the findings should prove to be useful for future system optimisation of mpbrs and other microalgal bioreactors specific contributions made to the literature are shown as follows conventional gravimetric methods were found to be insufficiently accurate for quantifying microalgal biomass in mpbrs attributed to the build up of non algal particulate material detected by the flow cytometer cell count mlss ratio was proposed as a more insightful parameter to characterise microalgal population in heterogenous mpbr cultures important interrelationships between parameters were explored for instance the association between microalgal biomass generation and nutrient removal was examined through the determination of yield coefficient assessing yield coefficient can be useful in selecting microalgal strains with higher nutrient uptake storage ability the abundance of bacteria in the systems were observed to correlate well with the degree of biomass autoflocculation underlining the potential of applying bacterial microalgal consortia in mpbr systems for generation of more harvestable biomass shorter hrt and srt were associated with faster growing more viable and less heterogenous cultures while extending hrt and srt promoted nutrient removal and harvesting potential the findings highlight the significance of selecting suitable operating conditions for mpbr operation based on an overall consideration of biomass production requirements biomass concentration composition productivity and harvesting potential and wastewater

19601,proteins are the dominant organic component of extracellular polymeric substances eps in waste activated sludge was and play an important role during sludge dewatering processes methanol is a polar hydrophilic reagent and can denature proteins which suggested to us that the modification of protein configurations with methanol could improve sludge dewatering performance in this study methanol was used to precondition was prior to adding inorganic coagulants for dewatering enhancement the morphology and eps properties especially of proteins were investigated to analyze and explain the effects of methanol in the sludge conditioning process the results show that methanol performed much better than traditional inorganic coagulants in improving sludge dewaterability in term of specific resistance to filtration srf and cake solid content csc extractable proteins in eps increased to a maximum when the concentration of methanol reached 40 w w because cell membranes were destroyed and intracellular substances and water were released floc protein content was reduced with the further increase in methanol concentration due to protein precipitation confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis indicated that proteins precipitated and formed larger aggregates because methanol destroyed both the hydration shell and the hydrophobic clusters of proteins and expanded the protein tertiary structure to release interstitial water and bound water the combination treatment of methanol and inorganic coagulants pac or fecl3 showed significant synergetic effects on enhancing sludge dewatering and cake drying in practical applications methanol from the dewatering sludge can be returned to the biochemical pool and used as the carbon source for nitrogen removal in the denitrification process this integrated process is appropriate for sludge final disposal technologies that have high energy demands such as incineration and pyrolysis this paper describes a novel

extracellular polymeric substances tn total nitrogen tss total suspended solids was waste activated sludge wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction municipal sludge production has increased substantially in recent decades due to the considerable development of municipal wastewater treatment kim et al 2002 sludge the most important by product of the biological treatment of wastewater is characterized by high moisture content and complex composition waste activated sludge was is a colloid consisting of microorganisms mainly bacteria embedded in a biopolymeric network christensen et al 2015 it is generally difficult to dewater was because particles are very fine colloidal in nature and possess a gel like structure due to polymeric flocculation mahmoud et al 2013 extracellular polymeric substances eps affect the colloidal stability of microbial aggregations and bind a large volume of water bound water within the sludge flocs zhang et al 2016a b the development of effective sludge dewatering processes has become an important topic in the field of environmental engineering yu et al 2016 eps are complex polymers accounting for 60 80 w w of sludge biomass sheng et al 2010 eps is derived from microbial secretion cell lysis and the hydrolysis of macromolecules they mainly consist of proteins polysaccharides humic substances nucleic acid lipids and similar substances wingender et al 1999 wang et al 2018 researchers found that organic matter in extracellular matrix structures could come from wastewater liu and fang 2003 eps can critically affect sludge structure sludge settling surface charge flocculation and dewatering mikkelsen and keiding 2002 the composition of eps can influence sludge dewaterability and eps mass can determine the optimal dewaterability of sludge houghton et al 2000 moreover some of eps properties with the initial condition parameters of each filtration run can be used as inputs into a model of filtration to quantify the dewatering characteristics skinner et al 2015 yu et al 2008 analyzed the structure and distribution of eps and found that they were composed of supernatants slime loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and pellets and that lb eps proteins had an adverse effect on sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 suggested that settleability and dewaterability of sludge flocs were determined by lb eps because they affect the strength of inter cellular bonds zhang et al 2015 found that the chemical composition of soluble eps s eps varied over time and that sludge dewaterability was negatively correlated with protein content in s eps murthy and novak 1999 showed that a high ratio of polysaccharide to protein was conducive to sludge dewatering some researchers have suggested that proteins rather than polysaccharides and humic substances are essential to sludge dewatering performance frølund et al 1996 urbain et al 1993 wu et al 2017 showed that the occurrence state and molecular structure of extracellular proteins were the factors that determined the water holding capacities of was in most cases low pressure devices such as belt filters and centrifuges were used for sludge dewatering in wastewater treatment plants wwtps but csc remained very low 20 w w after dewatering high pressure dewatering techniques frame filter press membrane filter press have been used to further reduce the sludge volume in order to alleviate the rapid increase in sludge production over recent years nevertheless mechanical dewatering is limited in effectiveness since sludge flocs are difficult to compress because of electrostatic repulsion among flocs qi et al 2011 thus effective sludge preconditioning before dewatering becomes more important for instance the addition of traditional chemical conditioners such as inorganic salt coagulants and organic polymers can agglomerate fine sludge colloids to form large flocs through charge neutralization and bridging and promote the separation of microbial biomass and water in sludge flocs niu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 however traditional flocculation conditioning processes are limited in their ability to remove the bound water trapped in eps and the addition of high doses of inorganic coagulants may also adversely affect subsequent sludge treatment and disposal therefore various advanced sludge treatment processes astps have been developed to enhance sludge dewaterability by destroying the key constituents of activated sludge eps thereby releasing more of bound water in eps fractions such astps include enzymatic treatment ayol 2005 thermal treatment neyens and baeyens 2003b acid or alkaline treatment neyens et al 2004 photo fenton or fenton oxidation neyens and baeyens 2003a thermal hydrolysis pretreatment zhang et al 2018 ultrasonic treatment murugesan et al 2014 microwave pretreatment yu et al 2010 uv photocatalysis anjum et al 2017 pulsed electric field pretreatment ki et al 2015 and sulfate radical oxidation zhou et al 2015 some combined treatment approaches have been applied recently such as alkaline thermal treatment xiao et al 2018 thermal h2o2 pretreatment abelleira et al 2012 microwave h2o2 treatment liu et al 2016 fenton ultrasonic process ning et al 2014 electrolysis electrocoagulation sulfate radical oxidation li et al 2016 fe0 s2o8 2 conditioning horizontal electro dewatering process li et al 2018 and permanganate bisulfite conditioning horizontal electro dewatering guo et al 2017 however most of the abovementioned astps have high energy or chemical dosage demands anjum et al 2016 some astps are complex and thus difficult to operate at full plant scale anjum et al 2016 chemical agents can be seriously caustic to the equipment during some of astps thus it is desirable to develop a more economical and convenient method for enhancing sludge dewatering performance through regulation of eps protein like substances are the major component of eps and they play a critical role in sludge dewatering this consideration led to our attempt to improve sludge dewaterability by altering proteins properties methanol is a polar hydrophilic reagent with a lower dielectric constant than water methanol molecules can be bound to many water molecules this can lead to the destruction of the hydration shell of the protein surface and so weaken protein stability methanol molecules tend to accumulate on the protein surface strongly interact with protein side chains through van der waals forces and decline hydrophobic interactions consequently the tertiary structure of the protein is altered and the hydrophobic clusters of the protein are broken shao 2014 if this were to occur in a wwtp after such treatment the methanol can be returned to the biochemical pool as a carbon source for the denitrification process in this study sludge was preconditioned after initial centrifugal dewatering with methanol and introduced inorganic flocculants in order to enhance further dewatering performance the conditioning process was optimized the eps distribution and composition were observed and the data thus collected were subsequently analyzed to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge and reagents the sludge was sampled from longwangzui wwtp in wuhan the wwtp treats approximately 260 000 000 kg d wastewater using an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process the cake was obtained from the centrifuge step the properties of the sludge which were measured according to standard methods apha 1998 are given in table 1 all the reagents are

pac and fecl3 solutions both of which we prepared were 100 g l 2 2 batch test 2 2 1 sludge conditioning each aliquot of 70 g sludge was placed into a separate beaker with 330 g of various concentrations 0 20 40 60 80 100 w w of methanol solution to obtain a cake solid content csc of 4 w w the mixture was stirred at 200 rpm for 60 min at ambient temperature the samples were measured for

assessment 2 3 1 1 specific resistance to filtration srf is an essential indicator of sludge dewatering performance whose unit process is similar to the physical process to the pressure filtration dewatering srf can be obtained by 1 s r f 2 p a 2 b μ ω μ μ where p kg m2 represents the pressure a m2 is the filter area μ kg s m2 is the viscosity ω kg m3 is the dry solid weight per unit volume of sludge on the filtrate media b is the slope of the curve of which the abscissa represents the filtrate volume v and the ordinate denotes the ratio of time of filtration to the volume of filtrate t v chen et al 2015 the experimental procedure was as follows an aliquot of 100 ml of sludge suspension was poured into a buchner funnel with a quantitative filter paper and under a pressure of 60 kpa the volume of filtrate was recorded every 2 s by a mettler toledo balance connected to a computer until 15 min had elapsed 2 3 1 2 capillary suction time cst is a key indicator of sludge filterability it was measured with a triton type 319 multi purpose cst instrument triton electronics uk using an 18 mm diameter funnel and whatman no 17 chromatography grade filtration paper the normalized cst value was obtained by dividing the initial cst value by the total suspended solids tss concentration 2 3 2 floc morphology and microstructure the floc size distribution of the sludge was measured with a mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern instruments uk having a laser source 4 mw he ne with the wavelength of 632 8 nm the particle size measurement range is 0 002 μm 2000 μm the fractal dimension can indicate the density of sludge flocs the sludge sample was dewatered by a freeze drying process and scanning electron microscope sem images were collected on a hitachi su8010 sem at 10 0 kv to observe the changes in sludge floc microstructure sheng et al 2010 2 3 3 eps characterization 2 3 3 1 eps extraction eps were classified as s eps lb eps and tb eps according to the binding strength between eps and sludge micelles niu et al 2013 lb eps and tb eps were extracted ultrasonically from the sludge suspension as follows first the sludge sample was centrifuged in a 50 ml tube at 2000 g for 15 min the supernatant was collected and considered to be s eps next the residual sediment in the tube was resuspended to the initial volume with a 0 05 w w sodium chloride nacl solution which was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 15 min the supernatant was collected and determined to be lb eps finally the sludge pellet was resuspended as before sonicated at 20 khz for 10 min and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min to collect tb eps sheng et al 2010 2 3 3 2 eps composition analysis 2 3 3 2 1 protein polysaccharide and humic acid measurement the protein humic acid and carbohydrate contents of the extracted eps were determined according to the procedure set out by frølund et al 1996 polysaccharides were measured using the anthrone method with standard glucose sinopharm protein and humic acid content were determined by the lowry procedure using bovine serum albumin bsa sigma and humic acid sigma as described by stauffer 1975 respectively 2 3 3 2 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra were measured by a hitachi f 4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a deuterium lamp as the excitation source the emission wavelength ranged from 280 nm to 550 nm at 10 nm sampling intervals the excitation wavelength ranged from 200 nm to 400 nm at 10 nm sampling intervals the spectra were

were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of methanol treatment on sludge properties 3 1 1 sludge dewatering performance previous studies of srf determination have found that cake solid content csc was low 15 25 w w after vacuum filtration results indicate that the traditional inorganic coagulants used for high pressure sludge dewatering are ineffective in removing the bound and intercellular water in sludge flocs niu et al 2013 cao et al 2016 fig 1 a shows that srf decreased significantly with the increase of methanol concentration srf reached a minimum of 1 75e 10 m kg when the methanol concentration increased to 100 w w csc increased from 6 w w to 38 w w after vacuum filtration at a pressure of 60 kpa when methanol content increased from 0 w w to 60 w w however when the sludge was conditioned only by inorganic coagulants under the same conditions csc was 25 w w after filtration dewatering see table s1 of supporting information si fig 1 b shows that the trend of cst is similar to that of srf these results confirm our hypothesis that methanol treatment improves sludge filtration dewatering and that it performs much better than inorganic coagulants in removing partially bound water from was in the following the evolution of floc morphology and the properties of eps particularly proteins is examined 3 1 2 floc properties fig 2 a shows that average sludge floc size d0 5 initially decreased and reached a minimum of 77 2 μm when methanol concentration was 40 w w and that particles aggregated with further increases in methanol concentration methanol may dissolve sludge floc particles at low concentrations however the weaker electronegativity of sludge floc in higher concentrations of methanol resulted in weaker electrostatic interactions among floc particles see fig 2 b which became destabilized and were agglomerated into larger aggregates by van der waals forces fig 2 b shows that zeta potential increased gradually as methanol concentration increased the ionization of anionic groups such as carboxyl groups amino groups and phosphoric acid groups accounts for the negative charge of sludge floc surfaces methanol destabilized some of these anionic groups which caused the combination of ionic groups it is likely that the addition of methanol led to a reduction in the degree of ionization of protein like substances which weakened the ionization effects of the anionic functional groups thus the electronegativity of the floc surface decreased and consequently zeta potential was reduced it has been shown that there is a good correlation between zeta potential and sludge dewaterability cao et al 2016 which is consistent with the dewatering improvement 3 1 3 effect of methanol treatment on eps distribution and composition 3 1 3 1 protein polysaccharide and humic acid measurement fig 3 a shows that as methanol concentration increased the contents of proteins polysaccharides and humic acids in total extractable eps increased to respective maximum values of 25 81 mg g 3 77 mg g and 23 86 mg g tss at a methanol concentration of 40 the contents decreased as the methanol concentration further increased some studies have shown that eps extractability is related to floc strength and low eps content is associated with high floc strength liu and fang 2002 sheng et al 2005 methanol disrupted cell membranes or similar encapsulating structures and thereby caused intracellular substances to be released wu et al 2017 this explains why eps content increased when methanol concentration increased from 0 w w to 40 w w as the methanol concentration increased methanol bound with large numbers of water molecules which led to the destruction of the protein hydration shell causing protein aggregation and precipitation at the same time the electronegativity of the floc surface was weakened and sludge flocs tended to agglomerate because of the van der waals forces thus eps content decreased inversely with methanol concentration when the concentration exceeded 40 protein and polysaccharide contents in eps showed a similar change more specifically all of them increased initially and reached a maximum and then decreased by raising the methanol concentration since a portion of protein molecules and polysaccharides were presented in form of glycoprotein complexes which were bridged by ca2 and mg2 through electrostatic interaction park and novak 2007 fig 3 b shows that protein content in s eps decreased from 9 99 mg g tss to 5 44 mg g tss as methanol concentration increased while protein content in lb eps and tb eps reached a maximum and then decreased this occurred because methanol disrupted the hydration shell on the surface of the protein and destroyed the stability of the protein protein particles were aggregated by van der waals forces and might be solidified and formed bound eps fractions lb eps or tb eps when the methanol concentration exceeded 40 w w proteins began to precipitate this reduced the protein content of s eps lb eps and tb eps and made them less available for extraction from eps sludge dewaterability srf and cst is correlated with protein content in the s eps fraction yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 extracellular proteins are the main hydrophilic component in sludge wu et al 2017 so solidification of proteins from slime and supernatant reduced the viscosity of sludge consequently improving the performance of filtration fig 3 c shows that the polysaccharide content in s eps decreased from 0 88 mg g tss to 0 64 mg g tss with the addition of methanol while the polysaccharide content in lb eps increased from 0 40 mg g tss to 1 45 mg g tss fig 3 d shows that the humic acid content in s eps decreased from 7 22 mg g tss to 7 18 mg g tss and then increased to 12 68 mg g tss while that in lb eps increased from 1 82 mg g tss to 5 51 mg g tss and then decreased to 3 81 mg g tss a comparison of fig 3 b c and d shows that the protein polysaccharide and humic acid contents in tb eps show a similar change during methanol conditioning processes specifically all of them in tb eps reached a maximum and then decrease by increasing methanol concentration table 2 shows the pearson correlation coefficients for linear regression between proteins polysaccharides and humic acids and srf and cst the pearson correlation coefficients between srf and cst and protein content in s eps are high with values 0 945 p 0 01 and 0 872 p 0 05 respectively this supports the claim that enhancement of sludge dewatering is associated with the solidification of proteins from s eps this result agrees with previous research wu et al 2017 yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 that shows that sludge dewatering is improved by removing sticky biopolymers in s eps fraction the pearson correlation coefficients between srf and cst and polysaccharide content in lb eps are 0 823 p 0 01 and 0 945 p 0 01 respectively which shows that polysaccharide content in lb eps is positively correlated with the increase of dewatering hydrophilic groups on polysaccharides molecules were plentiful and the conversion of s eps to lb eps reduced hydrophilia in slime and supernatant no significant correlation was found between humic acid content and sludge dewaterability these results show that methanol improved sludge dewatering performance mainly by altering proteins and to a lesser extent polysaccharides 3 1 3 2 3d eem analysis the 3d eem technique is highly selective and highly sensitive it has been widely used to determine the nature of organic matter in natural water bodies henderson et al 2009 hudson et al 2008 found that fluorescent intensity could be utilized to measure eps content when the dissolved organic carbon doc content was 10 mg the 3deem spectra can be classified into five regions chen et al 2003 2016 tryptophan like protein always related to soluble microbial by products λex em 250 400 280 380 nm aromatic protein i λex em 200 250 280 380 nm aromatic protein ii λex em 200 250 280 380 nm humic acid λex em 250 400 380 nm and fulvic acid λex em 200 250 380 nm supplemental fig s1 shows that there are four fluorescence peaks in s eps peak a λex em 220 300 aromatic protein peak b λex em 220 360 aromatic protein peak c λex em 275 305 tryptophan like protein and peak d λex em 275 355 tryptophan like protein in addition there were two peaks in lb eps and tb eps fractions peak e λex em 220 340 aromatic protein and peak f λex em 275 345 tryptophan like protein clearly protein is the major component which agrees with the results of mikkelsen and keiding 2002 fig 4 shows that the addition of methanol did not change fluorescence peak positions but the fluorescence intensities changed significantly the fluorescence intensities of aromatic and tryptophan like proteins in s eps were weaker while peak intensities related to proteins in lb eps and tb eps reached the maximum at a methanol concentration of 40 w w when the methanol concentration exceeded 40 w w the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly these results are consistent with the results that obtained for protein polysaccharide and humic acid content which are described in the preceding section 3 1 3 1 the aromatic protein concentration was lower than that of tryptophan in slime or supernatant but the aromatic protein concentration was higher than that of tryptophan in the bound eps 3 1 3 3 fourier transform infrared analysis samples of extracted s eps residues were analyzed using ft ir to examine the composition and functional groups of bound eps components ft ir examination of eps constituents identifies four regions shown in table 3 hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids yin et al 2015 table 3 shows that eps components are complex and many characteristic peaks are found on the ir spectrum of solid sludge samples with supernatant removed the peaks from 3200 cm 1 3650 cm 1 represent the stretching vibrations of the o h groups the transmission spectra from 2920 cm 1 2930 cm 1 and at 2850 cm 1 show c h stretching vibrations from ch2 these two groups are associated with the hydrocarbon aliphatic chain the wavelengths at 1656 cm 1 indicate the existence of c n from amide i group of proteins and the stretching vibration of c o the peak at 1543 cm 1 is indicative of the n h c n stretching in co nh of the amide ii group the characteristic peak at 1405 cm 1 is due to the symmetric stretching vibration of c o in the protonated carboxyl groups of amino acids of amide ii the spectral band observed at 1032 cm 1 is associated with the stretching vibration of the c oh and c o c ring vibrations and indicates the presence of polysaccharides the transmission spectra at 904 cm 1 are related to o p o stretching from nucleic acids fig 5 shows that as the methanol concentration the positions of the characteristic peaks are unchanged while the transmission intensities gradually weaken the result shows that the protein content of the extracted eps residues increases as the methanol concentration increases after the addition of inorganic coagulants the transmission intensities further decrease which indicates an increase in the protein content of the solid sludge this result suggests that the sludge floc structure becomes more compact and fewer eps can be extracted due to charge neutralization and the adsorption of inorganic flocculants as stated above in activated sludge flocs biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and proteins exist as complexes so the change in polysaccharide content is similar to that of proteins the nucleic acids are probably released because of cell damage caused by the methanol treatment these results are the reverse of the changes in protein and polysaccharide content during the liquid phase which shows that the constituents of the liquid solidified under the methanol treatment further confirming protein precipitation 3 1 3 4 confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to analyze eps and the spatial distribution of biopolymers in sludge floc zhang and fang 2001 measured the total cell volume of the biofilm from a 3 d clsm image in order to quantify eps clsm is also used to observe the structure of flocs basuvaraj et al 2015 in fig 6 green indicates the locations of protein like substances and red represents polysaccharides proteins are the main organic constituent of sludge flocs as the methanol concentration increased the solid protein content as well as proteins in s eps increased gradually which matches the results t obtained for protein polysaccharide and humic acid content described in the preceding section 3 1 3 1 extracellular proteins consist mainly of hydrophilic substances which are known to be a determining factor of sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 the sludge flocs tend to expand under methanol treatment brandts and hunt 1967 hypothesized that proteins in aqueous solutions could be accommodated by highly ordered water clathrates with considerable cost to the entropy of the solutions when methanol was added clathrate structure tended to melt and hydrophobic side chains of proteins were preferentially solvated kovrigin and potekhin 1997 methanol molecules that substituted for water molecules accumulated on the protein surface and thus disrupted the hydration shell of the protein resulting in the release of bound water as discussed above structurally unstable proteins in s eps may be transformed to bound eps when the methanol concentration exceeded 40 w w proteins were precipitated and so reduced the hydrophilic components of the was in addition methanol can disrupt the membrane of microbial cells and cause the release of intracellular substances and water the accumulation of methanol on the protein surface reduced intra protein hydrophobic reactions which led to the break up of hydrophobic clusters of proteins methanol molecules strongly interacted with protein side chains because of van der waals forces and so weakened non polar intra protein reactions which resulted in expansion of the protein tertiary structure shao 2014 this expansion increased sludge dewaterability through the release of interstitial water and bound water 3 2 effects of combined methanol and coagulants treatment on sludge properties 3 2 1 change in sludge dewaterability using methanol combined with inorganic coagulants when the methanol concentration of sludge was low sludge floc particle size was small and filtration performance was poor after increasing sludge methanol content to 20 w w further flocculation was induced by adding inorganic coagulants aluminum and ferric salts to increase floc size and improve filtration performance metal salt coagulants can neutralize negatively charged colloids and so tend to aggregate flocs and thus reduce the moisture content of sludge cao et al 2016 the hydrolysis products of aluminum and ferric salts can also act as skeleton builders to increase floc strength and so reduce sludge compressibility chen et al 2016 fig 7 a and table s1 show that 20 w w methanol content combined with 0 005 g pac g tss srf was reduced from 7 99 e12 to 8 27 e11 m kg and csc reached 38 09 w w fig 7 b and table s1 show that 20 w w methanol content combined with 0 005 g g tss fecl3 srf was reduced from 7 99 e12 to 8 64 e11 m kg and csc reached 34 33 w w in comparison the optimal dosage of inorganic coagulants pac or fecl3 was 0 015 g g tss when sludge was treated with either pac or fecl3 alone and csc was always 25 w w these results indicate that the combination of either coagulant pac or fecl3 with methanol performs much better than the inorganic coagulant alone in terms of improving sludge dewaterability and increasing the solid content of sludge cake the advantages of this mixed conditioning approach are more efficient sludge dewatering and fewer adverse impacts from subsequent sludge disposal 3 2 2 change in sludge morphology under combined methanol and coagulant treatment fig 8 shows the morphology of sludge flocs under an sem initially the surface of raw sludge flocs was smooth as the methanol concentration increased to 40 w w the floc surface displayed an abundant honeycomb structure as can be seen in fig 8 b this is due to mechanical shearing and methanol solubilization with a further increase in methanol concentration 40 w w the flocs agglomerated and the surface became smooth again as shown in fig 8 c and fig 8 d then the sludge flocs re aggregated and the structural strength of the flocs increased because of a reduction in floc surface electronegativity this coincides with the changes in floc size and eps properties when the flocs re aggregated after the addition of the coagulant they were denser which facilitated high pressure sludge dewatering because of charge neutralization described in the preceding paragraph and adsorption bridging see fig 8 e and f 4 environmental implication in practical applications the sludge dewatering system can be coupled with a methanol recovery system based on multistage utilization of methanol fig 9 shows using an example of a wwtp with a daily sewage volume of 200 000 tons how the operating procedure can integrate sludge conditioning and denitrification total nitrogen tn of the wwtp is 50 60 mg l a carbon source of 16 9 tons methanol is needed to remove 30 mg l nitrate nitrogen through denitrification daily sludge production is 180 tons 80 w w moisture content the frame filter can be operated six times per day once every 4 h treating 30 tons of sludge each time this schedule requires 45 tons methanol solution of 20 w w it consumes 21 6 tons filtrate containing 2 82 tons of methanol as the carbon source for the denitrification process 41 4 tons of filtrate containing 5 4 tons of methanol returns to the filtrate storage tank an additional 3 6 tons of methanol must be added to the fluid reservoir to create 45 tons of 20 w w methanol solution which flows into the conditioning tank to treat the sludge for increased dewaterability this cycle can be maintained daily by adding 21 6 tons of methanol to the fluid reservoir methanol recovery efficiency reaches 91 3 this example shows a promising sludge treatment process that offers a high dewatering performance and low increase in dry solid production it is an appropriate technique for sludge handling treatments that have high energy consumption such as incineration and pyrolysis 5 conclusions this paper describes a new sludge dewatering process that can be incorporated with sewage nitrogen removal the process is based on methanol multistage utilization in the conditioning stage sludge dewaterability was enhanced significantly csc increased from 4 w w to 38 w w as methanol concentration increased from 0 w w to 60 w w this result shows that the methanol treatment was much more effective than traditional flocculation conditioning in sludge dewatering enhancement methanol molecules replaced water molecules on the protein surface and disrupted the hydration shell of the protein to release bound water and reduced their hydrophilia the unstable proteins were precipitated in the was the aggregation of methanol on the protein surface also weakened intra protein hydrophobic interactions which led to breakage of the hydrophobic clusters of the protein methanol molecules strongly interacted with protein side chains strongly through van der waals forces and weakened intra protein nonpolar interactions which resulted in expansion of the protein tertiary structure however a high dosage of methanol was required for achieving high conditioning efficiency the chemical conditioning using methanol in combination with inorganic coagulants flocculation could effectively improve sludge filtration performance and decrease the moisture content of sludge cake which had advantages over low solid increase and less chemicals demand this study proposes a highly effective sludge dewatering process which uses methanol to change the properties of protein like biopolymers with methanol and which offers benefits in reducing energy consumption in energy intensive waste activated sludge disposal processes acknowledgements this study was financially supported

19601,proteins are the dominant organic component of extracellular polymeric substances eps in waste activated sludge was and play an important role during sludge dewatering processes methanol is a polar hydrophilic reagent and can denature proteins which suggested to us that the modification of protein configurations with methanol could improve sludge dewatering performance in this study methanol was used to precondition was prior to adding inorganic coagulants for dewatering enhancement the morphology and eps properties especially of proteins were investigated to analyze and explain the effects of methanol in the sludge conditioning process the results show that methanol performed much better than traditional inorganic coagulants in improving sludge dewaterability in term of specific resistance to filtration srf and cake solid content csc extractable proteins in eps increased to a maximum when the concentration of methanol reached 40 w w because cell membranes were destroyed and intracellular substances and water were released floc protein content was reduced with the further increase in methanol concentration due to protein precipitation confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis indicated that proteins precipitated and formed larger aggregates because methanol destroyed both the hydration shell and the hydrophobic clusters of proteins and expanded the protein tertiary structure to release interstitial water and bound water the combination treatment of methanol and inorganic coagulants pac or fecl3 showed significant synergetic effects on enhancing sludge dewatering and cake drying in practical applications methanol from the dewatering sludge can be returned to the biochemical pool and used as the carbon source for nitrogen removal in the denitrification process this integrated process is appropriate for sludge final disposal technologies that have high energy demands such as incineration and pyrolysis this paper describes a novel

substantially in recent decades due to the considerable development of municipal wastewater treatment kim et al 2002 sludge the most important by product of the biological treatment of wastewater is characterized by high moisture content and complex composition waste activated sludge was is a colloid consisting of microorganisms mainly bacteria embedded in a biopolymeric network christensen et al 2015 it is generally difficult to dewater was because particles are very fine colloidal in nature and possess a gel like structure due to polymeric flocculation mahmoud et al 2013 extracellular polymeric substances eps affect the colloidal stability of microbial aggregations and bind a large volume of water bound water within the sludge flocs zhang et al 2016a b the development of effective sludge dewatering processes has become an important topic in the field of environmental engineering yu et al 2016 eps are complex polymers accounting for 60 80 w w of sludge biomass sheng et al 2010 eps is derived from microbial secretion cell lysis and the hydrolysis of macromolecules they mainly consist of proteins polysaccharides humic substances nucleic acid lipids and similar substances wingender et al 1999 wang et al 2018 researchers found that organic matter in extracellular matrix structures could come from wastewater liu and fang 2003 eps can critically affect sludge structure sludge settling surface charge flocculation and dewatering mikkelsen and keiding 2002 the composition of eps can influence sludge dewaterability and eps mass can determine the optimal dewaterability of sludge houghton et al 2000 moreover some of eps properties with the initial condition parameters of each filtration run can be used as inputs into a model of filtration to quantify the dewatering characteristics skinner et al 2015 yu et al 2008 analyzed the structure and distribution of eps and found that they were composed of supernatants slime loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and pellets and that lb eps proteins had an adverse effect on sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 suggested that settleability and dewaterability of sludge flocs were determined by lb eps because they affect the strength of inter cellular bonds zhang et al 2015 found that the chemical composition of soluble eps s eps varied over time and that sludge dewaterability was negatively correlated with protein content in s eps murthy and novak 1999 showed that a high ratio of polysaccharide to protein was conducive to sludge dewatering some researchers have suggested that proteins rather than polysaccharides and humic substances are essential to sludge dewatering performance frølund et al 1996 urbain et al 1993 wu et al 2017 showed that the occurrence state and molecular structure of extracellular proteins were the factors that determined the water holding capacities of was in most cases low pressure devices such as belt filters and centrifuges were used for sludge dewatering in wastewater treatment plants wwtps but csc remained very low 20 w w after dewatering high pressure dewatering techniques frame filter press membrane filter press have been used to further reduce the sludge volume in order to alleviate the rapid increase in sludge production over recent years nevertheless mechanical dewatering is limited in effectiveness since sludge flocs are difficult to compress because of electrostatic repulsion among flocs qi et al 2011 thus effective sludge preconditioning before dewatering becomes more important for instance the addition of traditional chemical conditioners such as inorganic salt coagulants and organic polymers can agglomerate fine sludge colloids to form large flocs through charge neutralization and bridging and promote the separation of microbial biomass and water in sludge flocs niu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 however traditional flocculation conditioning processes are limited in their ability to remove the bound water trapped in eps and the addition of high doses of inorganic coagulants may also adversely affect subsequent sludge treatment and disposal therefore various advanced sludge treatment processes astps have been developed to enhance sludge dewaterability by destroying the key constituents of activated sludge eps thereby releasing more of bound water in eps fractions such astps include enzymatic treatment ayol 2005 thermal treatment neyens and baeyens 2003b acid or alkaline treatment neyens et al 2004 photo fenton or fenton oxidation neyens and baeyens 2003a thermal hydrolysis pretreatment zhang et al 2018 ultrasonic treatment murugesan et al 2014 microwave pretreatment yu et al 2010 uv photocatalysis anjum et al 2017 pulsed electric field pretreatment ki et al 2015 and sulfate radical oxidation zhou et al 2015 some combined treatment approaches have been applied recently such as alkaline thermal treatment xiao et al 2018 thermal h2o2 pretreatment abelleira et al 2012 microwave h2o2 treatment liu et al 2016 fenton ultrasonic process ning et al 2014 electrolysis electrocoagulation sulfate radical oxidation li et al 2016 fe0 s2o8 2 conditioning horizontal electro dewatering process li et al 2018 and permanganate bisulfite conditioning horizontal electro dewatering guo et al 2017 however most of the abovementioned astps have high energy or chemical dosage demands anjum et al 2016 some astps are complex and thus difficult to operate at full plant scale anjum et al 2016 chemical agents can be seriously caustic to the equipment during some of astps thus it is desirable to develop a more economical and convenient method for enhancing sludge dewatering performance through regulation of eps protein like substances are the major component of eps and they play a critical role in sludge dewatering this consideration led to our attempt to improve sludge dewaterability by altering proteins properties methanol is a polar hydrophilic reagent with a lower dielectric constant than water methanol molecules can be bound to many water molecules this can lead to the destruction of the hydration shell of the protein surface and so weaken protein stability methanol molecules tend to accumulate on the protein surface strongly interact with protein side chains through van der waals forces and decline hydrophobic interactions consequently the tertiary structure of the protein is altered and the hydrophobic clusters of the protein are broken shao 2014 if this were to occur in a wwtp after such treatment the methanol can be returned to the biochemical pool as a carbon source for the denitrification process in this study sludge was preconditioned after initial centrifugal dewatering with methanol and introduced inorganic flocculants in order to enhance further dewatering performance the conditioning process was optimized the eps distribution and composition were observed and the data thus collected were subsequently analyzed to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge and reagents the sludge was sampled from longwangzui wwtp in wuhan the wwtp treats approximately 260 000 000 kg d wastewater using an anaerobic anoxic

sludge on the filtrate media b is the slope of the curve of which the abscissa represents the filtrate volume v and the ordinate denotes the ratio of time of filtration to the volume of filtrate t v chen et al 2015 the experimental procedure was as follows an aliquot of 100 ml of sludge suspension was poured into a buchner funnel with a quantitative filter paper and under a pressure of 60 kpa the volume of filtrate was recorded every 2 s by a mettler toledo balance connected to a computer until 15 min had elapsed 2 3 1 2 capillary suction time cst is a key indicator of sludge filterability it was measured with a triton type 319 multi purpose cst instrument triton electronics uk using an 18 mm diameter funnel and whatman no 17 chromatography grade filtration paper the normalized cst value was obtained by dividing the initial cst value by the total suspended solids tss concentration 2 3 2 floc morphology and microstructure the floc size distribution of the sludge was measured with a mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern instruments uk having a laser source 4 mw he ne with the wavelength of 632 8 nm the particle size measurement range is 0 002 μm 2000 μm the fractal dimension can indicate the density of sludge flocs the sludge sample was dewatered by a freeze drying process and scanning electron microscope sem images were collected on a hitachi su8010 sem at 10 0 kv to observe the changes in sludge floc microstructure sheng et al 2010 2 3 3 eps characterization 2 3 3 1 eps extraction eps were classified as s eps lb eps and tb eps according to the binding strength between eps and sludge micelles niu et al 2013 lb eps and tb eps were extracted ultrasonically from the sludge suspension as follows first the sludge sample was centrifuged in a 50 ml tube at 2000 g for 15 min the supernatant was collected and considered to be s eps next the residual sediment in the tube was resuspended to the initial volume with a 0 05 w w sodium chloride nacl solution which was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 15 min the supernatant was collected and determined to be lb eps finally the sludge pellet was resuspended as before sonicated at 20 khz for 10 min and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min to collect tb eps sheng et al 2010 2 3 3 2 eps composition analysis 2 3 3 2 1 protein polysaccharide and humic acid measurement the protein humic acid and carbohydrate contents of the extracted eps were determined according to the procedure set out by frølund et al 1996 polysaccharides were measured using the anthrone method with standard glucose

were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of methanol treatment on sludge properties 3 1 1 sludge dewatering performance previous studies of srf determination have found that cake solid content csc was low 15 25 w w after vacuum filtration results indicate that the traditional inorganic coagulants used for high pressure sludge dewatering are ineffective in removing the bound and intercellular water in sludge flocs niu et al 2013 cao et al 2016 fig 1 a shows that srf decreased significantly with the increase of methanol concentration srf reached a minimum of 1 75e 10 m kg when the methanol concentration increased to 100 w w csc increased from 6 w w to 38 w w after vacuum filtration at a pressure of 60 kpa when methanol content increased from 0 w w to 60 w w however when the sludge was conditioned only by inorganic coagulants under the same conditions csc was 25 w w after filtration dewatering see table s1 of supporting information si fig 1 b shows that the trend of cst is similar to that of srf these results confirm our hypothesis that methanol treatment improves sludge filtration dewatering and that it performs much better than inorganic coagulants in removing partially bound water from was in the following the evolution of floc morphology and the properties of eps particularly proteins is examined 3 1 2 floc properties fig 2 a shows that average sludge floc size d0 5 initially decreased and reached a minimum of 77 2 μm when methanol concentration was 40 w w and that particles aggregated with further increases in methanol concentration methanol may dissolve sludge floc particles at low concentrations however the weaker electronegativity of sludge floc in higher concentrations of methanol resulted in weaker electrostatic interactions among floc particles see fig 2 b which became destabilized and were agglomerated into larger aggregates by van der waals forces fig 2 b shows that zeta potential increased gradually as methanol concentration increased the ionization of anionic groups such as carboxyl groups amino groups and phosphoric acid groups accounts for the negative charge of sludge floc surfaces methanol destabilized some of these anionic groups which caused the combination of ionic groups it is likely that the addition of methanol led to a reduction in the degree of ionization of protein like substances which weakened the ionization effects of the anionic functional groups thus the electronegativity of the floc surface decreased and consequently zeta potential was reduced it has been shown that there is a good correlation between zeta potential and sludge dewaterability cao et al 2016 which is consistent with the dewatering improvement 3 1 3 effect of methanol treatment on eps distribution and composition 3 1 3 1 protein polysaccharide and humic acid measurement fig 3 a shows that as methanol concentration increased the contents of proteins polysaccharides and humic acids in total extractable eps increased to respective maximum values of 25 81 mg g 3 77 mg g and 23 86 mg g tss at a methanol concentration of 40 the contents decreased as the methanol concentration further increased some studies have shown that eps extractability is related to floc strength and low eps content is associated with high floc strength liu and fang 2002 sheng et al 2005 methanol disrupted cell membranes or similar encapsulating structures and thereby caused intracellular substances to be released wu et al 2017 this explains why eps content increased when methanol concentration increased from 0 w w to 40 w w as the methanol concentration increased methanol bound with large numbers of water molecules which led to the destruction of the protein hydration shell causing protein aggregation and precipitation at the same time the electronegativity of the floc surface was weakened and sludge flocs tended to agglomerate because of the van der waals forces thus eps content decreased inversely with methanol concentration when the concentration exceeded 40 protein and polysaccharide contents in eps showed a similar change more specifically all of them increased initially and reached a maximum and then decreased by raising the methanol concentration since a portion of protein molecules and polysaccharides were presented in form of glycoprotein complexes which were bridged by ca2 and mg2 through electrostatic interaction park and novak 2007 fig 3 b shows that protein content in s eps decreased from 9 99 mg g tss to 5 44 mg g tss as methanol concentration increased while protein content in lb eps and tb eps reached a maximum and then decreased this occurred because methanol disrupted the hydration shell on the surface of the protein and destroyed the stability of the protein protein particles were aggregated by van der waals forces and might be solidified and formed bound eps fractions lb eps or tb eps when the methanol concentration exceeded 40 w w proteins began to precipitate this reduced the protein content of s eps lb eps and tb eps and made them less available for extraction from eps sludge dewaterability srf and cst is correlated with protein content in the s eps fraction yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 extracellular proteins are the main hydrophilic component in sludge wu et al 2017 so solidification of proteins from slime and supernatant reduced the viscosity of sludge consequently improving the performance of filtration fig 3 c shows that the polysaccharide content in s eps decreased from 0 88 mg g tss to 0 64 mg g tss with the addition of methanol while the polysaccharide content in lb eps increased from 0 40 mg g tss to 1 45 mg g tss fig 3 d shows that the humic acid content in s eps decreased from 7 22 mg g tss to 7 18 mg g tss and then increased to 12 68 mg g tss while that in lb eps increased from 1 82 mg g tss to 5 51 mg g tss and then decreased to 3 81 mg g tss a comparison of fig 3 b c and d shows that the protein polysaccharide and humic acid contents in tb eps show a similar change during methanol conditioning processes specifically all of them in tb eps reached a maximum and then decrease by increasing methanol concentration table 2 shows the pearson correlation coefficients for linear regression between proteins polysaccharides and humic acids and srf and cst the pearson correlation coefficients between srf and cst and protein content in s eps are high with values 0 945 p 0 01 and 0 872 p 0 05 respectively this supports the claim that enhancement of sludge dewatering is associated with the solidification of proteins from s eps this result agrees with previous research wu et al 2017 yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 that shows that sludge dewatering is improved by removing sticky biopolymers in s eps fraction the pearson correlation coefficients between srf and cst and polysaccharide content in lb eps are 0 823 p 0 01 and 0 945 p 0 01 respectively which shows that polysaccharide content in lb eps is positively correlated with the increase of dewatering hydrophilic groups on polysaccharides molecules were plentiful and the conversion of s eps to lb eps reduced hydrophilia in slime and supernatant no significant correlation was found between humic acid content and sludge dewaterability these results show that methanol improved sludge dewatering performance mainly by altering proteins and to a lesser extent polysaccharides 3 1 3 2 3d eem analysis the 3d eem technique is highly selective and highly sensitive it has been widely used to determine the nature of organic matter in natural water bodies henderson et al 2009 hudson et al 2008 found that fluorescent intensity could be utilized to measure eps content when the dissolved organic carbon doc content was 10 mg the 3deem spectra can be classified into five regions chen et al 2003 2016 tryptophan like protein always related to soluble microbial by products λex em 250 400 280 380 nm aromatic protein i λex em 200 250 280 380 nm aromatic protein ii λex em 200 250 280 380 nm humic acid λex em 250 400 380 nm and fulvic acid λex em 200 250 380 nm supplemental fig s1 shows that there are four fluorescence peaks in s eps peak a λex em 220 300 aromatic protein peak b λex em 220 360 aromatic protein peak c λex em 275 305 tryptophan like protein and peak d λex em 275 355 tryptophan like protein in addition there were two peaks in lb eps and tb eps fractions peak e λex em 220 340 aromatic protein and peak f λex em 275 345 tryptophan like protein clearly protein is the major component which agrees with the results of mikkelsen and keiding 2002 fig 4 shows that the addition of methanol did not change fluorescence peak positions but the fluorescence intensities changed significantly the fluorescence intensities of aromatic and tryptophan like proteins in s eps were weaker while peak intensities related to proteins in lb eps and tb eps reached the maximum at a methanol concentration of 40 w w when the methanol concentration exceeded 40 w w the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly these results are consistent with the results that obtained for protein polysaccharide and humic acid content which are described in the preceding section 3 1 3 1 the aromatic protein concentration was lower than that of tryptophan in slime or supernatant but the aromatic protein concentration was higher than that of tryptophan in the bound eps 3 1 3 3 fourier transform infrared analysis samples of extracted s eps residues were analyzed using ft ir to examine the composition and functional groups of bound eps components ft ir examination of eps constituents identifies four regions shown in table 3 hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids yin et al 2015 table 3 shows that eps components are complex and many characteristic peaks are found on the ir spectrum of solid sludge samples with supernatant removed the peaks from 3200 cm 1 3650 cm 1 represent the stretching vibrations of the o h groups the transmission spectra from 2920 cm 1 2930 cm 1 and at 2850 cm 1 show c h stretching vibrations from ch2 these two groups are associated with the hydrocarbon aliphatic chain the wavelengths at 1656 cm 1 indicate the existence of c n from amide i group of proteins and the stretching vibration of c o the peak at 1543 cm 1 is indicative of the n h c n stretching in co nh of the amide ii group the characteristic peak at 1405 cm 1 is due to the symmetric stretching vibration of c o in the protonated carboxyl groups of amino acids of amide ii the spectral band observed at 1032 cm 1 is associated with the stretching vibration of the c oh and c o c ring vibrations and indicates the presence of polysaccharides the transmission spectra at 904 cm 1 are related to o p o stretching from nucleic acids fig 5 shows that as the methanol concentration the positions of the characteristic peaks are unchanged while the transmission intensities gradually weaken the result shows that the protein content of the extracted eps residues increases as the methanol concentration increases after the addition of inorganic coagulants the transmission intensities further decrease which indicates an increase in the protein content of the solid sludge this result suggests that the sludge floc structure becomes more compact and fewer eps can be extracted due to charge neutralization and the adsorption of inorganic flocculants as stated above in activated sludge flocs biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and proteins exist as complexes so the change in polysaccharide content is similar to that of proteins the nucleic acids are probably released because of cell damage caused by the methanol treatment these results are the reverse of the changes in protein and polysaccharide content during the liquid phase which shows that the constituents of the liquid solidified under the methanol treatment further confirming protein precipitation 3 1 3 4 confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to analyze eps and the spatial distribution of biopolymers in sludge floc zhang and fang 2001 measured the total cell volume of the biofilm from a 3 d clsm image in order to quantify eps clsm is also used to observe the structure of flocs basuvaraj et al 2015 in fig 6 green indicates the locations of protein like substances and red represents polysaccharides proteins are the main organic constituent of sludge flocs as the methanol concentration increased the solid protein content as well as proteins in s eps increased gradually which matches the results t obtained for protein polysaccharide and humic acid content described in the preceding section 3 1 3 1 extracellular proteins consist mainly of hydrophilic substances which are known to be a determining factor of sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 the sludge flocs tend to expand under methanol treatment brandts and hunt 1967 hypothesized that proteins in aqueous solutions could be accommodated by highly ordered water clathrates with considerable cost to the entropy of the solutions when methanol was added clathrate structure tended to melt and hydrophobic side chains of proteins were preferentially solvated kovrigin and potekhin 1997 methanol molecules that substituted for water molecules accumulated on the protein surface and thus disrupted the hydration shell of the protein resulting in the release of bound water as discussed above structurally unstable proteins in s eps may be transformed to bound eps when the methanol concentration exceeded 40 w w proteins were precipitated and so reduced the hydrophilic components of the was in addition methanol can disrupt the membrane of microbial cells and cause the release of intracellular substances and water the accumulation of methanol on the protein surface reduced intra protein hydrophobic reactions which led to the break up of hydrophobic clusters of proteins methanol molecules strongly interacted with protein side chains because of van der waals forces and so weakened non polar intra protein reactions which resulted in expansion of the protein tertiary structure shao 2014 this expansion increased sludge dewaterability through the release of interstitial water and bound water 3 2 effects of combined methanol and coagulants treatment on sludge properties 3 2 1 change in sludge dewaterability using methanol combined with inorganic coagulants when the methanol concentration of sludge was low sludge floc particle size was small and filtration performance was poor after increasing sludge methanol content to 20 w w further flocculation was induced by adding inorganic coagulants aluminum and ferric salts to increase floc size and improve filtration performance metal salt coagulants can neutralize negatively charged colloids and so tend to aggregate flocs and thus reduce the moisture content of sludge cao et al 2016 the hydrolysis products of aluminum and ferric salts can also act as skeleton builders to increase floc strength and so reduce sludge compressibility chen et al 2016 fig 7 a and table s1 show that 20 w w methanol content combined with 0 005 g pac g tss srf was reduced from 7 99 e12 to 8 27 e11 m kg and csc reached 38 09 w w fig 7 b and table s1 show that 20 w w methanol content combined with 0 005 g g tss fecl3 srf was reduced from 7 99 e12 to 8 64 e11 m kg and csc reached 34 33 w w in comparison the optimal dosage of inorganic coagulants pac or fecl3 was 0 015 g g tss when sludge was treated with either pac or fecl3 alone and csc was always 25 w w these results indicate that the combination of either coagulant pac or fecl3 with methanol performs much better than the inorganic coagulant alone in terms of improving sludge dewaterability and increasing the solid content of sludge cake the advantages of this mixed conditioning approach are more efficient sludge dewatering and fewer adverse impacts from subsequent sludge disposal 3 2 2 change in sludge morphology under combined methanol and coagulant treatment fig 8 shows the morphology of sludge flocs under an sem initially the surface of raw sludge flocs was smooth as the methanol concentration increased to 40 w w the floc surface displayed an abundant honeycomb structure as can be seen in fig 8 b this is due to mechanical shearing and methanol solubilization with a further increase in methanol concentration 40 w w the flocs agglomerated and the surface became smooth again as shown in fig 8 c and fig 8 d then the sludge flocs re aggregated and the structural strength of the flocs increased because of a reduction in floc surface electronegativity this coincides with the changes in floc size and eps properties when the flocs re aggregated after the addition of the coagulant they were denser which facilitated high pressure sludge dewatering because of charge neutralization described in the preceding paragraph and adsorption bridging see fig 8 e and f 4 environmental implication in practical applications the sludge dewatering system can be coupled with a methanol recovery system based on multistage utilization of methanol fig 9 shows using an example of a wwtp with a daily sewage volume of 200 000 tons how the operating procedure can integrate sludge conditioning and denitrification total nitrogen tn of the wwtp is 50 60 mg l a carbon source of 16 9 tons methanol is needed to remove 30 mg l nitrate nitrogen through denitrification daily sludge production is 180 tons 80 w w moisture content the frame filter can be operated six times per day once every 4 h treating 30 tons of sludge each time this schedule requires 45 tons methanol solution of 20 w w it consumes 21 6 tons filtrate containing 2 82 tons of methanol as the carbon source for the denitrification process 41 4 tons of filtrate containing 5 4 tons of methanol returns to the filtrate storage tank an additional 3 6 tons of methanol must be added to the fluid reservoir to create 45 tons of 20 w w methanol solution which flows into the conditioning tank to treat the sludge for increased dewaterability this cycle can be maintained daily by adding 21 6 tons of methanol to the fluid reservoir methanol recovery efficiency reaches 91 3 this example shows a promising sludge treatment process that offers a high dewatering performance and low increase in dry solid production it is an appropriate technique for sludge handling treatments that have high energy consumption such as incineration and pyrolysis 5 conclusions this paper describes a new sludge dewatering process that can be incorporated with sewage nitrogen removal the process is based on methanol multistage utilization in the conditioning stage sludge dewaterability was enhanced significantly csc increased from 4 w w to 38 w w as methanol concentration increased from 0 w w to 60 w w this result shows that the methanol treatment was much more effective than traditional flocculation conditioning in sludge dewatering enhancement methanol molecules replaced water molecules on the protein surface and disrupted the hydration shell of the protein to release bound water and reduced their hydrophilia the unstable proteins were precipitated in the was the aggregation of methanol on the protein surface also weakened intra protein hydrophobic interactions which led to breakage of the hydrophobic clusters of the protein methanol molecules strongly interacted with protein side chains strongly through van der waals forces and weakened intra protein nonpolar interactions which resulted in expansion of the protein tertiary structure however a high dosage of methanol was required for achieving high conditioning efficiency the chemical conditioning using methanol in combination with inorganic coagulants flocculation could effectively improve sludge filtration performance and decrease the moisture content of sludge cake which had advantages over low solid increase and less chemicals demand this study proposes a highly effective sludge dewatering process which uses methanol to change the properties of protein like biopolymers with methanol and which offers benefits in reducing energy consumption in energy intensive waste activated sludge disposal processes acknowledgements this study was financially supported

19602,1 a major challenge when assessing the impacts of human activities on the globe s natural resources is to account for the impacts of land use versus natural spatiotemporal variation in system dynamics current freshwater assessments are unable to resolve spatiotemporal confounding through study designs or statistical analyses observational studies typically fail to consider the period by location interaction in the absence of an impact 2 here i address the problem of spatiotemporal confounding using causal modelling based on spatiotemporal data to infer causal effects of wastewater on biotic ecosystems a combination of statistical analysis and causation theory was used to address confounding bias benthic macroinvertebrate and environmental variable data were collected from locations upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant discharge point in south eastern australia over 1 5 years the composite hypotheses based on the theoretical relationships among these variables were summarised in a causal diagram model building and testing was conducted using structural equation modelling sem distance based redundancy analysis dbrda was used for model building and hypothesis testing 3 the results indicated that the causal effects of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities could be inferred using causal modelling the macroinvertebrate communities responded to water quality degradation with a clear shift in community composition after the discharge point and this change varied seasonally chlorophyll a total organic carbon zinc conductivity temperature and its interaction with conductivity were important determinants of the macroinvertebrate community composition causal models also explained the spatiotemporal variations in environmental variables the consistency of data with the structure of the causal diagram was confirmed with global fisher s c test 4 causal modelling has been shown to be a useful tool in environmental impact studies in this study the usefulness of causal modelling was attributed to its proficiency in combining all of the elements necessary for an efficient risk assessment through dealing with spatial and temporal confounding facilitating communication between scientists and resource managers and supporting management decision making graphical abstract image 1 keywords confounding environment modelling causality freshwater 1 introduction the assessment of anthropogenic environmental impacts on freshwater ecosystems is an important global issue anderson and thompson 2004 due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and other consequences of human activities a proper environmental assessment of anthropogenic impacts on ecological processes of rivers is difficult because of the challenge of detecting human impacts while avoiding attributing other sources of changes e g natural variation to human related activities downes et al 2002 typically environmental impact studies involve sampling from several sites at different time intervals in order to evaluate the variation of a set of environmental and ecological variables through time anderson and thompson 2004 however using this design the impact of human activities might be confounded by temporal and spatial natural variation therefore it is vital that environmental impact studies can separate natural variability while detecting the effect of the variable of interest wiens 2013 much research tries to minimise or control confounding bias to elucidate causal relationships through study design or statistical approaches freedman 1999 a well designed randomised experiment is the typical way of controlling the effect of confounding variables holland 1986 experiments are preferred to observational studies because confounding variables can be controlled through randomisation however experiments might be impractical unethical or expensive for this reason and because of the limited generality of experiments cook et al 2008 there is a need for alternative approaches environmental science has long endeavoured to find a solution for spatial and temporal confounding using study designs and statistical methods with much debate about how to do this green 1979 stewart oaten et al 1986 underwood 1991 baci before after control impact designs have been widely used downes et al 2002 but have received criticism for not being able to control for confounding bias since they cannot discriminate the impact of human made disturbance from natural variation completely for this reason baci designs have been modified to mbaci multiple before after control impact designs by including multiple control and impact locations keough 1995 the latest modification of baci designs was beyond baci which was also believed to be flawed in that random selection of multiple control sites without a population of locations is impossible in observational studies stewart oaten and bence 2001 therefore researchers have employed other strategies to investigate the potential effect of stressors on aquatic biota e g restricting stressors to a single class of contaminants such as heavy metals clements et al 2000 employing laboratory toxicity tests hickey and vickers 1994 or utilising mesocosms so as to simulate natural conditions and overcome difficulties related to field biomonitoring hickey and golding 2002 these studies have the criticism that responses of organisms in the laboratory might not be representative of natural populations in order to account for the influence of other variables some studies have used variance partitioning statistical methods such as stepwise multiple regression or partial canonical correspondence analysis pcca clements et al 1989 it is clear that there is a gap which needs to be filled to provide researchers with a method to establish causal relationships between environmental factors and changes in biotic community structure kefford et al 2013 in this study the principles of bayesian networks bns as a probabilistic graphical modelling technique is integrated with graphical structural equation modelling sem to form a causal modelling approach for evaluating environmental impact while controlling for confounding bias linking sem and bns was proposed by gupta and kim 2008 to overcome the limitations of each technique here these two families of causal modelling are combined to complement each other for inferring causal relationships from data by translating direct observations to cause and effect relationships causal modelling is one approach that provides an opportunity to summarise the knowledge about a system under study in the qualitative format of a causal diagram that can be translated to statistical models pearl 2000 paul et al 2016 sem models as functional models have advantages over stochastic models derived from bns e g functional models are more general than stochastic models in that stochastic models can be emulated by functional models but functional relationships can only be approximated by stochastic models pearl 2000 another advantage of functional representation is that standard statistical methods and software can now be used for the building and testing of statistical models paul and anderson 2013 on the other hand bayesian networks can use the mathematical relationship between graphs and probabilistic dependencies to describe the dependence and independence of relationships among variables pearl 2000 gupta and kim 2008 using the causal modelling framework developed by pearl 2000 paul 2011 suggested that spatial and temporal confounding in environmental impact studies may be controlled by simply adjusting for the actual spatial or temporal positions of sample units for achieving this purpose spatiotemporal sampling should be considered while designing the study so that characteristics that vary over time and distance are included in impact assessment models to infer causality it is vital that study design and statistical analysis based on scientific knowledge work conjointly in causal modelling analyses a combination of statistical analysis and causation theory is used while correcting for confounding bias by including the potential confounding variables pearl 2009 causal modelling of multivariate species data is not new previous studies used mantel and partial mantel statistics legendre and troussellier 1988 and mantel statistics in conjunction with standardised partial regression coefficients leduc et al 1992 in the context of causal modelling to describe the spatial pattern of ecological data associated with environmental variables paul and anderson 2013 proposed the direct modelling of ordination axes within the structural equation approach of a causal modelling framework which provides a plausible causal model for ecologists graph theoretical sem is the new generation of structural equation modelling that with greater flexibility and capability provides researchers with an opportunity to use causal modelling for decision making and management purposes pearl 2000 these features of graph theoretical sem enable this modelling method to be beneficial in risk assessment studies which usually deal with multivariate data and complex relationships among community data and environmental variables in recent years sem application by researchers in different fields of natural science has begun to expand grace et al 2012 but it is scarcely used in the area of ecological risk assessment a few applications of graph theoretical sem in environmental impact studies have been reported paul and anderson 2013 paul et al 2016 this study extends previous work by including both spatial and temporal variations in the models and accounts for greater ecological complexity in the causal models the challenge now is to use causal modelling to develop protocols that are evidence based practical general and useable by practitioners the purpose of this study was to expand the cause effect framework to develop a protocol for the design and analysis of environmental impact studies there is a need for a protocol that can deal with the problem of spatiotemporal confounding additionally current protocols need to be improved so that they can facilitate communication between scientists and resource managers the development of a conceptual model is recommended in guidelines for risk assessment studies in order to facilitate communication between scientific experts and resource managers a conceptual model visually describes the relationships between the ecosystem characteristics the potential stressors threats and other variables determining the occurrence of the threat epa victoria 2009 the assessment of the impact of wastewater discharges should also be conducted to support management decision making causal modelling is an approach capable of tackling these tasks as it provides the researchers with an opportunity to summarise their knowledge about the system under study in a qualitative format of a causal diagram paul et al 2016 moreover causal modelling can be used to estimate causal effect and to predict the effects of interventions using causal modelling it is also possible to predict the outcome of the absence of an intervention which is the realm of counterfactual analysis ferraro 2009 using counterfactual analysis in environmental impact studies managers can find answers to the question of what had been the biotic community structure in the absence of effluent hatami 2017 in this study i extend the application of causal modelling in the area of environmental studies by building and testing a spatiotemporal causal model for the risk assessment associated with wastewater treatment in wangaratta southern australia the main objective of this study was to infer causal relationships between environmental variables and the macroinvertebrate community after removing the effects of natural variation that lead to spatiotemporal confounding bias 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection this study was conducted on the three mile creek located in northern victoria australia fig 1 the flow patterns of three mile creek are seasonal in nature with the lowest flows occurring from austral summer december to april and the highest flows occurring in early austral spring the region is cleared for irrigated pasture and broad acre cropping epa victoria 2003a three mile creek receives the discharge from a trade waste treatment plant twtp which treats wastewater from several textile dyeing and related industries cleanaway 2003 eight sampling sites were established along the creek fig 1 including four sites upstream and four sites downstream of the discharge point in addition the discharge point was sampled in an attempt to document natural variation in samples along the river the study sites were distributed along 7 08 km water samples were collected seasonally in 2013 december 2014 april august and november and 2015 may as the creek was not flowing during a period of the year it was not possible to sample at regular intervals in addition the samples were collected on the same day that the treatment plant was discharging effluent to the creek salinity water temperature dissolved oxygen ph and turbidity were measured in situ using a quanta water quality multiprobe hydrolab corporation usa at all sampling times water velocity was measured with a miniair 2 flow meter schiltknecht messtechnic ag switzerland all sediments and water samples were stored cool 1 4 c and transferred to the laboratory within 24 h and stored in the dark before analysis all sampling techniques and sample preservation and handling protocols were in accordance with the australian new zealand standard and the epa guide as nzs 1998 standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater were used to measure physico chemical parameters such as conductivity ph total alkalinity as caco3 chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon ammonia total nitrogen nitrate nitrite total nitrogen total phosphorus tp orthophosphate total antimony in the water samples and heavy metals including cadmium chromium copper and zinc in the sediment samples water environment federation and american public health association 2005 data related to rainfall flow rate temperature and solar exposure were obtained from the bureau of meteorology bureau of meteorology bom 2015 benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled using a kick net mesh size 250 μm opening approximately 30 by 30 cm net length 1 m on the same occasions that water samples were collected for all macroinvertebrate sampling the epa guide for rivers and streams was followed epa victoria 2003b all samples were stored in 70 ethanol transferred to the laboratory and identified to family level with the exception for acarina mites odonata and oligochaeta that were not separated to family level the chironmidae family was split to subfamily level 2 2 data analysis the statistical analysis for causal modelling in this study follows the approach used by pearl 2000 and paul and anderson 2013 all of the analysis was done using r version 3 2 2 r core team 2015 a causal diagram was first built using yed 3 17 2 graph editor encompassing those environmental variables collected from the field fig 2 the description of all the variables in the causal diagram in fig 2 are given in appendix a table 1 and the relationships among these variables based on literature are described in appendix a table 2 in this causal diagram the main hypothesis was that the observed systematic patterns in the macroinvertebrate community assemblage calculated as pco axes were due to their spatial and temporal natural variation and not because of the impact of effluent from treatment plant on environmental variables the main response variable in the given causal diagram was macroinvertebrate community assemblage mac and its spatiotemporal variation was of key interest in this study it received arrows from all environmental variables that according to the literature might potentially affect this variable according to pearl 2000 the data generating process can be described adequately by including all variables latent or observed that might be a cause of two or more variables in the causal diagram from the causal diagram it can be seen that climate is an unobserved confounding variable as it can influence discharge characteristics as well as environmental variables in the stream the temporal variation in these variables due to climate has been depicted in the causal diagram with arrows receiving from air temperature solar radiation and rainfall principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used to convert the samples by species data matrix into a smaller matrix of pco scores so that the pco scores represented a measure of the state of the macroinvertebrate community at a point in time and space paul et al 2013 main pco axes were derived from the macroinvertebrate matrix using principle coordinate analysis four diagnostic methods were employed to identify potentially nontrivial pco axes that contain systematic patterns in community composition broken stick method legendre and legendre 2012 bootstrapping jackson 1993 percentage of the variation explained by each ranked pco was computed holistically as a fraction of the total variation holistic approach and the percentage of the variation explained by each ranked pco have been accounted for by the remaining ranked pcos conditional approach a full description of all these methods can be found in paul 2011 as a part of the exploratory analysis spatiotemporal patterns in the nontrivial pco axes were explored by plotting all of the nontrivial pco axes against time and spatial positions the model building and testing process started with performing a dbrda distance based redundancy analysis on a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of square root transformed abundance as a function of effluent distance and time legendre and anderson 1999 the process of model building started with translating possible causal relationships entailed in the causal diagram fig 2 into a set of structural equations appendix a table 3 each structural equation was written by representing every variable in the causal diagram as a function of its direct causes and an error the first structural equation was used as a guide to model the macroinvertebrate community as a function of its direct parents to control for spatiotemporal variation in the macroinvertebrate data it was important to model the macroinvertebrate community as a function of space and time the assumptions underpinning the tests used for building the model and performing hypothesis tests were checked the structural equations derived from the causal diagram were used to test the hypothesis underlying each arrow in this diagram in addition in order to find the set of variables attributable to the spatiotemporal variation of macroinvertebrate community composition a series of analyses e g multiple regression correlation were done for every nontrivial pco after testing the existence of the direct relations included in the sem the conditional independencies missing arrows in the causal diagram were checked all the variables without a statistical association were removed and the revised causal diagram was used as a guide in the process of checking conditional independencies a set of conditional independencies was generated using the ggm package based on the remaining relations in the causal diagram the set of conditional independencies was expressed in the form of an equivalent set of d separation statements in order to test testable d separation statements a series of local statistical tests were conducted the global test fisher s c test was also computed to test all independency relationships simultaneously the c statistics and p value of the test were used to check the consistency of data with the set of conditional independence assumptions and causal structure shipley 2016 overall a combination of causal consideration based on literature and statistical tests was used for model selection and to decide which variables should be included in or excluded from the models nested regression models were compared to test the hypothesis if a term should be removed cross validation test was conducted by computing root mean squared error rmse statistic using caret package the r codes used for developing this protocol are included in the supplementary online material 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis a total of 8177 macroinvertebrates belonging to 34 taxa were identified appendix a table 4 the majority of macroinvertebrates belonged to oligochaeta 4395 individuals other dominant taxa depending on the season included the families chironomidae simulidae baetidae caenidae leptophlebiidae and micronectidae there were six pcos with eigenvalues that exceeded the values obtained from a broken stick model fig 3 a the other three methods revealed that there was only one pco with non overlapping confidence intervals fig 3b d pco1 explained 17 4 of the total variation in the macroinvertebrate data the rest of the nontrivial axes pco2 pco6 accounted for 10 2 9 6 8 6 5 and 5 5 percent of the total variation respectively using basic exploratory techniques such as graphical techniques and correlation a preliminary analysis was conducted in order to reveal possible relationships between pco axes and other variables in the causal diagram for this purpose the six nontrivial pcos were plotted against distance and time figs 1 and 2 in appendix a to reveal spatiotemporal patterns in the macroinvertebrate data since there were six nontrivial pco axes based on the results of bootstrap method the relationships between environmental variables and all these six pco axes were examined although systematic patterns were observed in the plots of all nontrivial pco axes versus time and distance only pco1 and pco2 showed significant correlations with the environmental variables pco1 was significantly related to most of these variables and it was the only axis with interpretable systematic pattern based on the variations in environmental variables the spatiotemporal variation in pco1 is depicted in fig 4 a 3 2 the models built using structural equation modelling in accordance with the patterns seen in fig 4a the dbrda model was built and shown in equation 1 as follows 1 e p c o 1

model accounted for 76 of the variation in pco1 table 1 thus the dbrda model fitted the data well and explained most of the total variation in macroinvertebrate data the effect of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities varied depending on the time of sampling and distance the effect of effluent was marginally significant p 0 06 but the term eff was left in the model because the results of anova test indicated a significant difference p 0 03 between models with and without this term as shown in table 2 the time effect on pco1 variation was significant for the terms t3 august and t5 may p 0 01 the terms t4 eff and t4 eff d were also statistically significant p 0 05 fitted values of first six pcos from dbrda spatiotemporal model are given fig 3 in appendix a fig 4b illustrates the patterns in predicted pco1 values using the spatiotemporal model which were similar to the pattern of observed values of pco1 in general there were seasonal differences in predicted pco1 values with different trends at upstream and downstream sites predicted pco1 scores were higher in colder months august and may and lower in warmer months november and december at upstream sites the trend in predicted pcos changed downstream of the discharge point the effect of effluent on the macroinvertebrate community varied over time and was more obvious in november t4 table 2 when the creek flow rate was the lowest with the greatest increase in the value of pco1 occurring downstream of the discharge point another important feature of the predicted values of pco1 was the declines in the value of pco1 in may and august fig 4 the process of fitting structural equations to the data continued with modelling the macroinvertebrate community data as a function of environmental variables equation 2 a dbrda model of macroinvertebrate community composition as a response variable was built with zinc chlorophyll a toc conductivity temperature temperature conductivity interaction and temperature toc interaction the fitted values of poc1 with the environmental variables fig 4c closely agreed with the observed fig 4a and fitted spatiotemporal values fig 4b the terms in the model explained 65 of the variation in the macroinvertebrate data and the terms temperature conductivity log zinc and temperature conductivity accounted for most of the variation the results of the dbrda model implied that zinc temperature toc and conductivity had significant negative effects on the macroinvertebrate communities whereas chlorophyll a had a positive effect therefore the model provided estimates of the potential effect of environmental variables in the effluent discharged to the creek the results of model testing for equation 2 are given in table 3 and table 4 the anova and summary tables showing the significant terms for the rest of the models are given in appendix a table 5 to table 22 2 e p c o 1 2 34 0 14 w t e m p 0 004 c d 0 0002 w t e m p c d 0 27 l o g z n 0 09 t o c 0 009 w t e m p t

variables in the model could account for the spatiotemporal variation in macroinvertebrate communities the changes in macroinvertebrate community composition taxa and abundance across pco1 in response to environmental variables have been plotted as a heat map in fig 5 the observed pattern in fig 5 confirmed that macroinvertebrate community composition responded differently to increases in conductivity downstream of the discharge point in warmer months than in colder months on the left hand side of fig 5 where the pco1 scores were lower several taxa had higher abundance including oligochaeta chironominae tipulidae simulidae baetidae caenidae leptophlebiidae empididae micronectidae anostraca and mites these taxa can be attributed to upstream sites in warmer months with the low pco1 score green box in heatmap an increase in pco1 score downstream of the discharge point at downstream1 accompanied a decline in the abundance of these taxa red box in heatmap pco1 scores decreased downstream of the discharge point during the colder months leading to a rise in the abundance of several taxa including oligochaeta chironominae ceratopogonidae caenidae and leptophlebiidae in

curculionidae culicidae podonominae empididae coloburiscidae hydrobiosidae and mites in accordance with the pattern in observed values of chlorophyll a fig 6 a a spatiotemporal model was built equation 3 which fitted the data quite well fig 6b a quadratic term for distance eff t d2 was also included to account for the quadratic shape of the graph in november all the terms in the multiple regression model were important in explaining the spatiotemporal variation in values of macroinvertebrate data and the model accounted for 97 of this variation there was evidence that the effect of

arrows in the causal diagram the equations related to the rest of models are summarised in appendix a table 23 3 3 testing conditional independencies by removing all the variables without any statistical association in the causal diagram the revised causal diagram fig 10 provided a guide in making a list of all conditional independencies related to missing arrows the process of revising the causal diagram has been described in more details and can be found in appendix b section 1 the multiple regression models built for fitting structural equations were used for testing conditional independencies in an iterative process the process of model testing was repeated based on the results of local and global hypothesis tests partial regression test and cross validation test however decisions about what variables to include in the model were driven by causal considerations based on the literature for the sake of brevity more details about the process of revising the models and all three iterations of testing conditional independencies can be found in tables 1 3 appendix b section 2 p values for most of the conditional independence constraints were non significant indicating that these conditional independence relationships held for example the chlorophyll a conditional independence constraint was tested by adding time to the chlorophyll a causal model the p value for the anova test was 0 31 indicating that the model could explain the temporal variation in chlorophyll a concentration without adding the term time to the model there were a few conditional independence constraints that did not pass the test those conditional independencies that did not pass the test suggested possible dependencies of nitrate on toc and toc on nitrate or on other variables such as turbidity the global test of all constraints listed in the basis was non significant c 168 64 df 160 p 0 30 confirming that the assumption of the set of conditional independence was true 4 discussion the results clearly supported the hypothesis that after adjusting for time and space in the causal models there would still be relationships between macroinvertebrate communities and environmental variables indicating that there was evidence for the effect of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities in three mile creek hence causal modelling was shown to be useful for dealing with spatial and temporal confounding and facilitating communication between scientists and resource managers by developing a causal model that acts as a conceptual model causal inference in this study was achieved by combining statistical relationships and causal assumptions in structural equation modelling as advised by pearl 2012 and grace et al 2012 environmental variables that explained spatiotemporal variations in macroinvertebrate community composition were chlorophyll a conductivity toc temperature zinc and chromium water temperature not only affected the macroinvertebrate community but also influenced the effect of conductivity and toc on macroinvertebrate assemblages it has been reported that salinity and temperature act together to determine the seasonal fluctuations in macroinvertebrate communities chainho et al 2006 pco1 values decreased in may and august cold months whereas they increased in november and december warm months the reduction in pco1 after the discharge point in the colder months might be a response of macroinvertebrates to stress from an increase in salinity on the other hand the increase in pco1 after the discharge point in the warmer months might be related to those taxa that could adapt to the conditions of warm water with high salinity and outcompete the other taxa chainho et al 2006 kefford et al 2007 increased salinity can result in the loss of macroinvertebrate families with low salinity tolerances and their replacement by more tolerant taxa horrigan et al 2005 a combination of these consequences may have acted together in response to an increase in salinity and its interaction with temperature leading to a community more adapted to unstable conditions after the discharge point despite the key role of temperature in forming macroinvertebrate composition the negative effect of water temperature on macroinvertebrates was not attributed to the wwtp discharge the increases in water temperature values after the discharge point were negligible in comparison to the changes along the creek there was a significant positive relationship between pco1 and chlorophyll a concentration macroinvertebrates feeding on algae might respond positively to increases in algal biomass and chlorophyll a concentration fuller et al 2008 the spatiotemporal variation in chlorophyll a concentration was due to tp nitrate turbidity effluent chlorophyll a discharge load and flow rate as well as natural factors such as solar radiation temperature and the interaction between them as expected there was also a positive relationship between chlorophyll a concentration and temperature and solar radiation nutrients such as phosphate and nitrate busse et al 2006 temperature steinman and mcintire 1987 and irradiance hill 1996 play an important role in controlling the chlorophyll a concentration in rivers and streams in this study chlorophyll a was at minimum level in cold months for example it was very low in august even with higher levels of solar radiation this explains the significant negative relationship between chlorophyll a and sr wtemp in the chlorophyll a model the utilisation of light by algae can be dependent on temperature because of the role that temperature has in influencing the enzymatic process of photosynthesis falkowski and raven 2013 tp and nitrate had the highest impact on chlorophyll a the spatiotemporal variations of nitrate could be explained by temperature rainfall and effluent temperature had a significant negative relationship with nitrate the highest values of nitrate concentrations were observed in august nitrate levels might be higher in winter due to slow growth of plants wet soil higher rate of rainfall hanson and abraham 2010 jones and olson rutz 2011 and low nitrogen uptake by stream compartments such as algae as a result of low temperature or light availability simon et al 2005 wick et al 2012 higher concentrations of nitrate in winter might also be attributed to the higher usage of nitrogen fertilisers to boost pasture growth or higher stocking rates on farms in early or late winter ruiz et al 2002 nitrate was also positively related to rainfall in this study heavy rains might increase the rate of nitrate leaching with the source of land management practices such as fertiliser application liang et al 2011 since agricultural and urban runoff are major sources of nutrient enrichment rader and richardson 1994 smith et al 2007 tp spatiotemporal variation was related to alkalinity ph rainfall along with the effect of effluent in addition to the effluent effect spatiotemporal variation of alkalinity could be explained by rainfall and creek flow rate alkalinity was significantly positively related to long term rainfall and significantly negatively related to creek flow rate which is in agreement with koetsier et al 1996 temporal variation of ph observed in the results was related to short term rainfall as has been reported by rupert 2001 the significant positive relationship between short term rainfall and tp might be attributed to runoff containing high concentrations of tp longmore et al 1999 on the other hand the decline in tp concentration with an increase in long term rainfall might be a result of dilution miguntanna et al 2013 effluent from the treatment plant affected tp concentration by adding tp discharge load to the creek and this effect varied over time the effect of treatment plant effluent on increases in phosphate concentrations was dependent on the season and was more noticeable in summer house and denison 1997 results from the dbrda analysis revealed that variations in macroinvertebrate communities were also related negatively to toc and positively to its interaction with temperature the effect of toc on macroinvertebrates depends on where it originates from terrestrial within stream or from the wastewater treatment plant organic carbon with an anthropogenic origin such as effluent associated with a wastewater treatment plant can alter biodiversity and aquatic community structure spänhoff et al 2007 the marked increase after the discharge point could have been attributed to the effluent from the treatment plant while there was a correlation between toc and its corresponding concentration in discharge discharge toc flow rate this does not completely explain the marked increase in toc concentrations at downstream1 this may have been due to inaccuracies in measuring discharge volumes or creek flow rate because daily discharge volumes could have been discharged over a few days rather than steadily over the entire day moreover a few very high values at downstream1 ended up being influential points outliers in the models this was solved by including a dummy variable as distance 4 08 to the models based on the toc model seasonal variation in organic carbon was determined by rainfall and flow rate similar to tp toc was positively related to short term rainfall and negatively to long term rainfall rainfall regulates water quality through dilution and flushing kay et al 2001 conductivity discharge load did not seem to explain variation in conductivity concentration instead most of the spatiotemporal variation in conductivity could be explained by tp and alkalinity total phosphorus can be related to conductivity aguado et al 2006 alkalinity consists mainly of carbonate and bicarbonate ions and these ions contribute to conductivity kney and brandes 2007 time and distance were added to the model to account for unexplained spatiotemporal variation which might have been due to other ions that were not measured the fact that ions such as phosphate were more influential for conductivity than conductivity discharge load might have been because of incomplete mixing at downstream1 or the inaccuracy of the recorded discharge loads zinc and water temperature were the last two variables in the dbrda model that influenced macroinvertebrate communities wastewater effluent can be a source of increasing heavy metal in freshwater systems dalu et al 2017 in the current study effluent did not influence the water temperature and a combination of natural and anthropogenic variables including air temperature long term rainfall flow rate and residential land use at a 300 m scale explained spatiotemporal variations in water temperature interestingly rainfall was more important than air temperature in influencing water temperature air temperature might less directly affect water temperature depending on the prevailing hydrological and meteorological conditions such as rainfall and flow rate smith 1972 visualisation of macroinvertebrate community composition along pco1 scores using heatmaps helped reveal the taxa responsible for the macroinvertebrate community in response to environmental variables in the dbrda model increases in pco1 after the discharge point in warm months were accompanied by a reduction in the abundance of a mix of sensitive taxa such as leptophlebiidae moderately tolerant taxa such as baetidae caenidae tipulidae and mites and tolerant taxa including oligochaeta chironominae simulidae empididae micronectidae and anostraca heatmaps also revealed that abundances of several taxa including oligochaeta chironominae ceratopogonidae caenidae and leptophlebiidae increased after the discharge point in the cold months corresponding with decreasing pco1 scores the decrease in pco1 scores downstream of the discharge point was also associated with the disappearance of sensitive taxa e g gripopterygidae leptoceridae and tolerant taxa e g psychodidae hydroptilidae this was coupled with the appearance of several other sensitive taxa such as coloburiscidae and hydrobiosidae and tolerant taxa such as curculionidae and culicidae from these results it seems that the macroinvertebrate responses to effluent were not just an increase or a decrease in the number or abundance of tolerant taxa or sensitive taxa the impact of effluent on macroinvertebrates resulted in a community with higher evenness and made up of those taxa that could adapt to higher salinity and organic carbon concentrations in cold and warm months the macroinvertebrate communities in the upstream sites were very different in different seasons especially in the colder months compared to in the warmer months the effect of the discharged effluent resulted in similar downstream communities after the discharge point in all seasons indeed effluent discharged from the treatment plant caused a shift in macroinvertebrate community after the discharge point giving rise to an almost similar composition of macroinvertebrate at downstream1 in cold and warm months conditional independencies were tested with the purpose of deciding which covariates should be included in the model and to examine if the data were consistent with the structure of the causal diagram the results showed that adding variables to several of the structural equation models added more information to the model this led to revision of these models during the iterative process of model testing for example tp was added to the conductivity model in the case of macroinvertebrates it was tested whether there were any remaining spatiotemporal patterns in the pcos after conditioning on environmental variables that could be explained by adding another variable e g time distance while it was not the case in this study if there was any remaining spatiotemporal variation in the pcos it would have been essential to add arrows from time and distance to pcos in the final causal diagram to indicate that the causal inference was not strong that is by adding an arrow from time to pco1 macroinvertebrate community and the variables that influenced it would have a common cause where two variables have a latent common cause neither of them is qualified as a genuine cause of the other one pearl 2000 this means that environmental variables in the dbrda model could only be potential causes of variation in macroinvertebrate communities rather than genuine causes a few of the conditional independencies failed the local hypothesis tests of independency for example toc was suggested to be required in the nitrate model there might be a relationship between organic carbon and nitrate concentration probably because of biogeochemical processes that control both dissolved organic carbon and nitrate konohira and yoshioka 2005 however there was insufficient evidence to indicate that toc could explain the variations in nitrate or vice versa in this study these conditional independencies failed the test probably because the models in general and toc conductivity and nitrate models in particular need to be improved this was probably due to several factors such as incomplete lateral mixing of the effluent leading to high values that hindered the model from fitting the data well despite a few conditional independencies that did not pass the local test the p value for fisher s c test for the overall test of the model was non significant this supported the hypothesis that the overall conditional independencies entailed in the causal diagram were true and that the data were consistent with the structure of the causal diagram in this study the ways in which environmental variables may affect each other and the macroinvertebrate communities were described in a complex set of pathways using sem models in this study if the set of causal relationships in the causal diagram was not consistent with the observed data the hypothesis could be rejected austin 2007 the results of this study verified consistency of data with the set of conditional independencies their assumptions and the causal structure of the causal diagram therefore causal effects of the effluent on macroinvertebrate communities could be inferred in this study while controlling for spatiotemporal confounding this study had several advantages in inferring causation over similar studies that used sem to test causal hypotheses of the effects of environmental variables on macroinvertebrates in nonpoint source studies first as advised by shipley 2000 causal modelling based on local tests of conditional independence and a global test was used in order to examine the hypothesis underlying the missing arrows second as seen in previous sections the models were built by modelling ordination axes derived from multivariate species as a function of environmental variables in contrast to most studies that employ biotic indices six nontrivial pco axes were identified in this study but the first one entailed most of the variation in macroinvertebrate communities as supported by a similar study conducted by paul and anderson 2013 the six nontrivial axes revealed by the first method in this figure indicates that in reality in addition to the larger component explained by pco1 there might be many unmeasured non random variables explaining the smaller component of the spatiotemporal variation in the system it is worth mentioning that dbrda analysis and the analysis related to testing of the causal model were conducted using all pco axes the third advantage of this study was that the models were tested using dbrda which performs a multivariate regression on the pco axes legendre and anderson 1999 in multivariate ecological research recommended by paul and anderson 2013 and paul et al 2016 by doing so the limitations of sem such as conforming to linear functional forms and multivariate normal distribution could be overcome linearity was not the problem in this study but model building and testing using methods such as dbrda that are commonly used in multivariate ecological research can be beneficial for studies involving data that do not conform to linear functional forms paul et al 2013 in order to select an appropriate model for modelling the pco axis as a function of time and distance the functional forms and exploratory analysis should be considered in studies that have been conducted over long periods of time e g for several years data might show a periodic pattern along time axes i e a nonlinear sine curve in those cases the model might be as below 12 pco j β 1 distance β 2 distance day β 3 sin 2 π day 365 β 4 s i n 2 π d a y 365 d i s t a n c e β 5 d a y paul and anderson 2013 gave an example of modelling the pco axes with a periodic function of time to account for the seasonal component which was sum of sine and cosine terms with a seasonal period of four quarters the model in equation 12 seems to have more complexity for data used in this study therefore following the principles of parsimony the model in equation 1 was preferred for this research conceptually complexity of a model makes it flexible and easily able to fit diverse patterns of data however additional complexity more than the certain point needed for the model will cause the model to overfit the data and capture random error conversely a lack of necessary complexity will cause the model to underfit the data and fail to capture the signal pitt and myung 2002 in situations where there is another form of relationship between community data pco1 and distance or time e g quadratic this can also be accounted for in the model model building and testing using causal modelling is not restricted to linear models generally causal modelling techniques are believed to have a drawback of being costly as they require a big data set for developing the models if studies are conducted over longer periods of time more conditional independencies can be tested and this will improve the validity of the hypothesis testing in this study several of the conditional independencies could not be checked due to a lack of sufficient data on time another limitation of this study was a lack of information on some variables e g ions that might contribute to conductivity 5 conclusions based on the results after adjusting for time and distance in the model there was still evidence of an effect of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities and the causal effect of effluent discharge on macroinvertebrate score pcos was inferred thus the protocol developed and recommended in this study was shown to be able to deal with spatial and temporal confounding it also had the advantage of using a causal diagram that acts as a conceptual model and facilitates communication between scientists and resource managers moreover this protocol based on the conceptual modelling approach can be used to support management decision making by tackling all of the tasks the protocol developed in this study demonstrated the benefits of the causal modelling approach as a useful tool for treatment

19602,1 a major challenge when assessing the impacts of human activities on the globe s natural resources is to account for the impacts of land use versus natural spatiotemporal variation in system dynamics current freshwater assessments are unable to resolve spatiotemporal confounding through study designs or statistical analyses observational studies typically fail to consider the period by location interaction in the absence of an impact 2 here i address the problem of spatiotemporal confounding using causal modelling based on spatiotemporal data to infer causal effects of wastewater on biotic ecosystems a combination of statistical analysis and causation theory was used to address confounding bias benthic macroinvertebrate and environmental variable data were collected from locations upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant discharge point in south eastern australia over 1 5 years the composite hypotheses based on the theoretical relationships among these variables were summarised in a causal diagram model building and testing was conducted using structural equation modelling sem distance based redundancy analysis dbrda was used for model building and hypothesis testing 3 the results indicated that the causal effects of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities could be inferred using causal modelling the macroinvertebrate communities responded to water quality degradation with a clear shift in community composition after the discharge point and this change varied seasonally chlorophyll a total organic carbon zinc conductivity temperature and its interaction with conductivity were important determinants of the macroinvertebrate community composition causal models also explained the spatiotemporal variations in environmental variables the consistency of data with the structure of the causal diagram was confirmed with global fisher s c test 4 causal modelling has been shown to be a useful tool in environmental impact studies in this study the usefulness of causal modelling was attributed to its proficiency in combining all of the elements necessary for an efficient risk assessment through dealing with spatial and temporal confounding facilitating communication between scientists and resource managers and supporting management decision making graphical abstract image 1 keywords confounding environment modelling causality freshwater 1 introduction the assessment of anthropogenic environmental impacts on freshwater ecosystems is an important global issue anderson and thompson 2004 due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and other consequences of human activities a proper environmental assessment of anthropogenic impacts on ecological processes of rivers is difficult because of the challenge of detecting human impacts while avoiding attributing other sources of changes e g natural variation to human related activities downes et al 2002 typically environmental impact studies involve sampling from several sites at different time intervals in order to evaluate the variation of a set of environmental and ecological variables through time anderson and thompson 2004 however using this design the impact of human activities might be confounded by temporal and spatial natural variation therefore it is vital that environmental impact studies can separate natural variability while detecting the effect of the variable of interest wiens 2013 much research tries to minimise or control confounding bias to elucidate causal relationships through study design or statistical approaches freedman 1999 a well designed randomised experiment is the typical way of controlling the effect of confounding variables holland 1986 experiments are preferred to observational studies because confounding variables can be controlled through randomisation however experiments might be impractical unethical or expensive for this reason and because of the limited generality of experiments cook et al 2008 there is a need for alternative approaches environmental science has long endeavoured to find a solution for spatial and temporal confounding using study designs and statistical methods with much debate about how to do this green 1979 stewart oaten et al 1986 underwood 1991 baci before after control impact designs have been widely used downes et al 2002 but have received criticism for not being able to control for confounding bias since they cannot discriminate the impact of human made disturbance from natural variation completely for this reason baci designs have been modified to mbaci multiple before after control impact designs by including multiple control and impact locations keough 1995 the latest modification of baci designs was beyond baci which was also believed to be flawed in that random selection of multiple control sites without a population of locations is impossible in observational studies stewart oaten and bence 2001 therefore researchers have employed other strategies to investigate the potential effect of stressors on aquatic biota e g restricting stressors to a single class of contaminants such as heavy metals clements et al 2000 employing laboratory toxicity tests hickey and vickers 1994 or utilising mesocosms so as to simulate natural conditions and overcome difficulties related to field biomonitoring hickey and golding 2002 these studies have the criticism that responses of organisms in the laboratory might not be representative of natural populations in order to account for the influence of other variables some studies have used variance partitioning statistical methods such as stepwise multiple regression or partial canonical correspondence analysis pcca clements et al 1989 it is clear that there is a gap which needs to be filled to provide researchers with a method to establish causal relationships between environmental factors and changes in biotic community structure kefford et al 2013 in this study the principles of bayesian networks bns as a probabilistic graphical modelling technique is integrated with graphical structural equation modelling sem to form a causal modelling approach for evaluating environmental impact while controlling for confounding bias linking sem and bns was proposed by gupta and kim 2008 to overcome the limitations of each technique here these two families of causal modelling are combined to complement each other for inferring causal relationships from data by translating direct observations to cause and effect relationships causal modelling is one approach that provides an opportunity to summarise the knowledge about a system under study in the qualitative format of a causal diagram that can be translated to statistical models pearl 2000 paul et al 2016 sem models as functional models have advantages over stochastic models derived from bns e g functional models are more general than stochastic models in that stochastic models can be emulated by functional models but functional relationships can only be approximated by stochastic models pearl 2000 another advantage of functional representation is that standard statistical methods and software can now be used for the building and testing of statistical models paul and anderson 2013 on the other hand bayesian networks can use the mathematical relationship between graphs and probabilistic dependencies to describe the dependence and independence of relationships among variables pearl 2000 gupta and kim 2008 using the causal modelling framework developed by pearl 2000 paul 2011 suggested that spatial and temporal confounding in environmental impact studies may be controlled by simply adjusting for the actual spatial or temporal positions of sample units for achieving this purpose spatiotemporal sampling should be considered while designing the study so that characteristics that vary over time and distance are included in impact assessment models to infer causality it is vital that study design and statistical analysis based on scientific knowledge work conjointly in causal modelling analyses a combination of statistical analysis and causation theory is used while correcting for confounding bias by including the potential confounding variables pearl 2009 causal modelling of multivariate species data is not new previous studies used mantel and partial mantel statistics legendre and troussellier 1988 and mantel statistics in conjunction with standardised partial regression coefficients leduc et al 1992 in the context of causal modelling to describe the spatial pattern of ecological data associated with environmental variables paul and anderson 2013 proposed the direct modelling of ordination axes within the structural equation approach of a causal modelling framework which provides a plausible causal model for ecologists graph theoretical sem is the new generation of structural equation modelling that with greater flexibility and capability provides researchers with an opportunity to use causal modelling for decision making and management purposes pearl 2000 these features of graph theoretical sem enable this modelling method to be beneficial in risk assessment studies which usually deal with multivariate data and complex relationships among community data and environmental variables in recent years sem application by researchers in different fields of natural science has begun to expand grace et al 2012 but it is scarcely used in the area of ecological risk assessment a few applications of graph theoretical sem in environmental impact studies have been reported paul and anderson 2013 paul et al 2016 this study extends previous work by including both spatial and temporal variations in the models and accounts for greater ecological complexity in the causal models the challenge now is to use causal modelling to develop protocols that are evidence based practical general and useable by practitioners the purpose of this study was to expand the cause effect framework to develop a protocol for the design and analysis of environmental impact studies there is a need for a protocol that can deal with the problem of spatiotemporal confounding additionally current protocols need to be improved so that they can facilitate communication between scientists and resource managers the development of a conceptual model is recommended in guidelines for risk assessment studies in order to facilitate communication between scientific experts and resource managers a conceptual model visually describes the relationships between the ecosystem characteristics the potential stressors threats and other variables determining the occurrence of the threat epa victoria 2009 the assessment of the impact of wastewater discharges should also be conducted to support management decision making causal modelling is an approach capable of tackling these tasks as it provides the researchers with an opportunity to summarise their knowledge about the system under study in a qualitative format of a causal diagram paul et al 2016 moreover causal modelling can be used to estimate causal effect and to predict the effects of interventions using causal modelling it is also possible to predict the outcome of the absence of an intervention which is the realm of counterfactual analysis ferraro 2009 using counterfactual analysis in environmental impact studies managers can find answers to the question of what had been the biotic community structure in the absence of effluent hatami 2017 in this study i extend the application of causal modelling in the area of environmental studies by building and testing a spatiotemporal causal model for the risk assessment associated with wastewater treatment in wangaratta southern australia the main objective of this study was to infer causal relationships between environmental variables and the macroinvertebrate community after removing the effects of natural variation that lead to spatiotemporal confounding bias 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection this study was conducted on the three mile creek located in northern victoria australia fig 1 the flow patterns of three mile creek are seasonal in nature with the lowest flows occurring from austral summer december to april and the highest flows occurring in early austral spring the region is cleared for irrigated pasture and broad acre cropping epa victoria 2003a three mile creek receives the discharge from a trade waste treatment plant twtp which treats wastewater from several textile dyeing and related industries cleanaway 2003 eight sampling sites were established along the creek fig 1 including four sites upstream and four sites downstream of the discharge point in addition the discharge point was sampled in an attempt to document natural variation in samples along the river the study sites were distributed along 7 08 km water samples were collected seasonally in 2013 december 2014 april august and november and 2015 may as the creek was not flowing during a period of the year it was not possible to sample at regular intervals in addition the samples were collected on the same day that the treatment plant was discharging effluent to the creek salinity water temperature dissolved oxygen ph and turbidity were measured in situ using a quanta water quality multiprobe hydrolab corporation usa at all sampling times water velocity was measured with a miniair 2 flow meter schiltknecht messtechnic ag switzerland all sediments and water samples were stored cool 1 4 c and transferred to the laboratory within 24 h and stored in the dark before analysis all sampling techniques and sample preservation and handling protocols were in accordance with the australian new zealand standard and the epa guide as nzs 1998 standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater were used to measure physico chemical parameters such as conductivity ph total alkalinity as caco3 chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon ammonia total nitrogen nitrate nitrite total nitrogen total phosphorus tp orthophosphate total antimony in the water samples and heavy metals including cadmium chromium copper and zinc in the sediment samples water environment federation and american public health association 2005 data related to rainfall flow rate temperature and solar exposure were obtained from the bureau of meteorology bureau of meteorology bom 2015 benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled using a kick net mesh size 250 μm opening approximately 30 by 30 cm net length 1 m on the same occasions that water samples were collected for all macroinvertebrate sampling the epa guide for rivers and streams was followed epa victoria 2003b all samples were stored in 70 ethanol transferred to the laboratory and identified to family level with the exception for acarina mites odonata and oligochaeta that were not separated to family level the chironmidae family was split to subfamily level 2 2 data analysis the statistical analysis for causal modelling in this study follows the approach used by pearl 2000 and paul and anderson 2013 all of the analysis was done using r version 3 2 2 r core team 2015 a causal diagram was first built using yed 3 17 2 graph editor encompassing those environmental variables collected from the field fig 2 the description of all the variables in the causal diagram in fig 2 are given in appendix a table 1 and the relationships among these variables based on literature are described in appendix a table 2 in this causal diagram the main hypothesis was that the observed systematic patterns in the macroinvertebrate community assemblage calculated as pco axes were due to their spatial and temporal natural variation and not because of the impact of effluent from treatment plant on environmental variables the main response variable in the given causal diagram was macroinvertebrate community assemblage mac and its spatiotemporal variation was of key interest in this study it received arrows from all environmental variables that according to the literature might potentially affect this variable according to pearl 2000 the data generating process can be described adequately by including all variables latent or observed that might be a cause of two or more variables in the causal diagram from the causal diagram it can be seen that climate is an unobserved confounding variable as it can influence discharge characteristics as well as environmental variables in the stream the temporal variation in these variables due to climate has been depicted in the causal diagram with arrows receiving from air temperature solar radiation and rainfall principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used to convert the samples by species data matrix into a smaller matrix of pco scores so that the pco scores represented a measure of the state of the macroinvertebrate community at a point in time and space paul et al 2013 main pco axes were derived from the macroinvertebrate matrix using principle coordinate analysis four diagnostic methods were employed to identify potentially nontrivial pco axes that contain systematic patterns in community composition broken stick method legendre and legendre 2012 bootstrapping jackson 1993 percentage of the variation explained by each ranked pco was computed holistically as a fraction of the total variation holistic approach and the percentage of the variation explained by each ranked pco have been accounted for by the remaining ranked pcos conditional approach a full description of all these methods can be found in paul 2011 as a part of the exploratory analysis spatiotemporal patterns in the nontrivial pco axes were explored by plotting all of the nontrivial pco axes against time and spatial positions the model building and testing process started with performing a dbrda distance based redundancy analysis on a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of square root transformed abundance as a function of effluent distance and time legendre and anderson 1999 the process of model building started with translating possible causal relationships entailed in the causal diagram fig 2 into a set of structural equations appendix a table 3 each structural equation was written by representing every variable in the causal diagram as a function of its direct causes and an error the first structural equation was used as a guide to model the macroinvertebrate community as a function of its direct parents to control for spatiotemporal variation in the macroinvertebrate data it was important to model the macroinvertebrate community as a function of space and time the assumptions underpinning the tests used for building the model and performing hypothesis tests were checked the structural equations derived from the causal diagram were used to test the hypothesis underlying each arrow in this diagram in addition in order to find the set of variables attributable to the spatiotemporal variation of macroinvertebrate community composition a series of analyses e g multiple regression correlation were done for every nontrivial pco after testing the existence of the direct relations included in the sem the conditional independencies missing arrows in the causal diagram were checked all the variables without a statistical association were removed and the revised causal diagram was used as a guide in the process of checking conditional independencies a set of conditional independencies was generated using the ggm package based on the remaining relations in the causal diagram the set of conditional independencies was expressed in the form of an equivalent set of d separation statements in order to test testable d separation statements a series of local statistical tests were conducted the global test fisher s c test was also computed to test all independency relationships simultaneously the c statistics and p value of the test were used to check the consistency of data with the set of conditional independence assumptions and causal structure shipley 2016 overall a combination of causal consideration based on literature and statistical tests was used for model selection and to decide which variables should be included in or excluded from the models nested regression models were compared to test the hypothesis if a term should be removed cross validation test was conducted by computing root mean squared error rmse statistic using caret package the r codes used for developing this protocol are included in the supplementary online material 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis a total of 8177 macroinvertebrates belonging to 34 taxa were identified appendix a table 4 the majority of macroinvertebrates belonged to oligochaeta 4395 individuals other dominant taxa depending on the season included the families chironomidae simulidae baetidae caenidae leptophlebiidae and micronectidae there were six pcos with eigenvalues that exceeded the values obtained from a broken stick model fig 3 a the other three methods revealed that there was only one pco with non overlapping confidence intervals fig 3b d pco1 explained 17 4 of the total variation in the macroinvertebrate data the rest of the nontrivial axes pco2 pco6 accounted for 10 2 9 6 8 6 5 and 5 5 percent of the total variation respectively using basic exploratory techniques such as graphical techniques and correlation a preliminary analysis was conducted in order to reveal possible relationships between pco axes and other variables in the causal diagram for this purpose the six nontrivial pcos were plotted against distance and time figs 1 and 2 in appendix a to reveal spatiotemporal patterns in the macroinvertebrate data since there were six nontrivial pco axes based on the results of bootstrap method the relationships between environmental variables and all these six pco axes were examined although systematic patterns were observed in the plots of all nontrivial pco axes versus time and distance only pco1 and pco2 showed significant correlations with the environmental variables pco1 was significantly related to most of these variables and it was the only axis with interpretable systematic pattern based on the variations in environmental variables the spatiotemporal variation in pco1 is depicted in fig 4 a 3 2 the models built using structural equation modelling in accordance with the patterns seen in fig 4a the dbrda model was built and shown in equation 1 as follows 1 e p c o 1

model accounted for 76 of the variation in pco1 table 1 thus the dbrda model fitted the data well and explained most of the total variation in macroinvertebrate data the effect of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities varied depending on the time of sampling and distance the effect of effluent was marginally significant p 0 06 but the term eff was left in the model because the results of anova test indicated a significant difference p 0 03 between models with and without this term as shown in table 2 the time effect on pco1 variation was significant for the terms t3 august and t5 may p 0 01 the terms t4 eff and t4 eff d were also statistically significant p 0 05 fitted values of first six pcos from dbrda spatiotemporal model are given fig 3 in appendix a fig 4b illustrates the patterns in predicted pco1 values using the spatiotemporal model which were similar to the pattern of observed values of pco1 in general there were seasonal differences in predicted pco1 values with different trends at upstream and downstream sites predicted pco1 scores were higher in colder months august and may and lower in warmer months november and december at upstream sites the trend in predicted pcos changed downstream of the discharge point the effect of effluent on the macroinvertebrate community varied over time and was more obvious in november t4 table 2 when the creek flow rate was the lowest with the greatest increase in the value of pco1 occurring downstream of the discharge point another important feature of the predicted values of pco1 was the declines in the value of pco1 in may and august fig 4 the process of fitting structural equations to the data continued with modelling the macroinvertebrate community data as a function of environmental variables equation 2 a dbrda model of macroinvertebrate community composition as a response variable was built with zinc chlorophyll a toc conductivity temperature temperature conductivity interaction and temperature toc interaction the fitted values of poc1 with the environmental variables fig 4c closely agreed with the observed fig 4a and fitted spatiotemporal values fig 4b the terms in the model explained 65 of the variation in the macroinvertebrate data and the terms temperature conductivity log zinc and temperature conductivity accounted for most of the variation the results of the dbrda model implied that zinc temperature toc and conductivity had significant negative effects on the macroinvertebrate communities whereas chlorophyll a had a positive effect therefore the model provided estimates of the potential effect of environmental variables in the effluent discharged to the creek the results of model testing for equation 2 are given in table 3 and table 4 the anova and summary tables showing the significant terms for the rest of the models are given in appendix a table 5 to table 22 2 e p c o 1 2 34 0 14 w t e m p 0 004 c d 0 0002 w t e m p c d 0 27 l o g z n 0 09 t o c 0 009 w t e m p t

variables in the model could account for the spatiotemporal variation in macroinvertebrate communities the changes in macroinvertebrate community composition taxa and abundance across pco1 in response to environmental variables have been plotted as a heat map in fig 5 the observed pattern in fig 5 confirmed that macroinvertebrate community composition responded differently to increases in conductivity downstream of the discharge point in warmer months than in colder months on the left hand side of fig 5 where the pco1 scores were lower several taxa had higher abundance including oligochaeta chironominae tipulidae simulidae baetidae caenidae leptophlebiidae empididae micronectidae anostraca and mites these taxa can be attributed to upstream sites in warmer months with the low pco1 score green box in heatmap an increase in pco1 score downstream of the discharge point at downstream1 accompanied a decline in the abundance of these taxa red box in heatmap pco1 scores decreased downstream of the discharge point during the colder months leading to a rise in the abundance of several taxa including oligochaeta chironominae ceratopogonidae caenidae and leptophlebiidae in addition a few taxa disappeared downstream of the discharge point e g gripopterygidae psychodidae hydroptilidae leptoceridae and odonata this coincided with the emergence of other taxa e g curculionidae culicidae podonominae empididae coloburiscidae hydrobiosidae and mites in accordance with the pattern in observed values of chlorophyll a fig 6 a a spatiotemporal model was built equation 3 which fitted the data quite well fig 6b a quadratic term for distance eff t d2 was also included to account for the quadratic shape of the graph in november all the terms in the multiple regression model were important in explaining the spatiotemporal variation in values of macroinvertebrate data and the model accounted for 97 of this variation there was evidence that the effect of effluent on chlorophyll a concentration was variable depending upon the time of sampling and that it was only significant b 11 5 p 0 05 in november tables 5 and 6 in appendix a 3 e l o g c h l a 0 930

arrows in the causal diagram the equations related to the rest of models are summarised in appendix a table 23 3 3 testing conditional independencies by removing all the variables without any statistical association in the causal diagram the revised causal diagram fig 10 provided a guide in making a list of all conditional independencies related to missing arrows the process of revising the causal diagram has been described in more details and can be found in appendix b section 1 the multiple regression models built for fitting structural equations were used for testing conditional independencies in an iterative process the process of model testing was repeated based on the results of local and global hypothesis tests partial regression test and cross validation test however decisions about what variables to include in the model were driven by causal considerations based on the literature for the sake of brevity more details about the process of revising the models and all three iterations of testing conditional independencies can be found in tables 1 3 appendix b section 2 p values for most of the conditional independence constraints were non significant indicating that these conditional independence relationships held for example the chlorophyll a conditional independence constraint was tested by adding time to the chlorophyll a causal model the p value for the anova test was 0 31 indicating that the model could explain the temporal variation in chlorophyll a concentration without adding the term time to the model there were a few conditional independence constraints that did not pass the test those conditional independencies that did not pass the test suggested possible dependencies of nitrate on toc and toc on nitrate or on other variables such as turbidity the global test of all constraints listed in the basis was non significant c 168 64 df 160 p 0 30 confirming that the assumption of the set of conditional independence was true 4 discussion the results clearly supported the hypothesis that after adjusting for time and space in the causal models there would still be relationships between macroinvertebrate communities and environmental variables indicating that there was evidence for the effect of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities in three mile creek hence causal modelling was shown to be useful for dealing with spatial and temporal confounding and facilitating communication between scientists and resource managers by developing a causal model that acts as a conceptual model causal inference in this study was achieved by combining statistical relationships and causal assumptions in structural equation modelling as advised by pearl 2012 and grace et al 2012 environmental variables that explained spatiotemporal variations in macroinvertebrate community composition were chlorophyll a conductivity toc temperature zinc and chromium water temperature not only affected the macroinvertebrate community but also influenced the effect of conductivity and toc on macroinvertebrate assemblages it has been reported that salinity and temperature act together to determine the seasonal fluctuations in macroinvertebrate communities chainho et al 2006 pco1 values decreased in may and august cold months whereas they increased in november and december warm months the reduction in pco1 after the discharge point in the colder months might be a response of macroinvertebrates to stress from an increase in salinity on the other hand the increase in pco1 after the discharge point in the warmer months might be related to those taxa that could adapt to the conditions of warm water with high salinity and outcompete the other taxa chainho et al 2006 kefford et al 2007 increased salinity can result in the loss of macroinvertebrate families with low salinity tolerances and their replacement by more tolerant taxa horrigan et al 2005 a combination of these consequences may have acted together in response to an increase in salinity and its interaction with temperature leading to a community more adapted to unstable conditions after the discharge point despite the key role of temperature in forming macroinvertebrate composition the negative effect of water temperature on macroinvertebrates was not attributed to the wwtp discharge the increases in water temperature values after the discharge point were negligible in comparison to the changes along the creek there was a significant positive relationship between pco1 and chlorophyll a concentration macroinvertebrates feeding on algae might respond positively to increases in algal biomass and chlorophyll a concentration fuller et al 2008 the spatiotemporal variation in chlorophyll a concentration was due to tp nitrate turbidity effluent chlorophyll a discharge load and flow rate as well as natural factors such as solar radiation temperature and the interaction between them as expected there was also a positive relationship between chlorophyll a concentration and temperature and solar radiation nutrients such as phosphate and nitrate busse et al 2006 temperature steinman and mcintire 1987 and irradiance hill 1996 play an important role in controlling the chlorophyll a concentration in rivers and streams in this study chlorophyll a was at minimum level in cold months for example it was very low in august even with higher levels of solar radiation this explains the significant negative relationship between chlorophyll a and sr wtemp in the chlorophyll a model the utilisation of light by algae can be dependent on temperature because of the role that temperature has in influencing the enzymatic process of photosynthesis falkowski and raven 2013 tp and nitrate had the highest impact on chlorophyll a the spatiotemporal variations of nitrate could be explained by temperature rainfall and effluent temperature had a significant negative relationship with nitrate the highest values of nitrate concentrations were observed in august nitrate levels might be higher in winter due to slow growth of plants wet soil higher rate of rainfall hanson and abraham 2010 jones and olson rutz 2011 and low nitrogen uptake by stream compartments such as algae as a result of low temperature or light availability simon et al 2005 wick et al 2012 higher concentrations of nitrate in winter might also be attributed to the higher usage of nitrogen fertilisers to boost pasture growth or higher stocking rates on farms in early or late winter ruiz et al 2002 nitrate was also positively related to rainfall in this study heavy rains might increase the rate of nitrate leaching with the source of land management practices such as fertiliser application liang et al 2011 since agricultural and urban runoff are major sources of nutrient enrichment rader and richardson 1994 smith et al 2007 tp spatiotemporal variation was related to alkalinity ph rainfall along with the effect of effluent in addition to the effluent effect spatiotemporal variation of alkalinity could be explained by rainfall and creek flow rate alkalinity was significantly positively related to long term rainfall and significantly negatively related to creek flow rate which is in agreement with koetsier et al 1996 temporal variation of ph observed in the results was related to short term rainfall as has been reported by rupert 2001 the significant positive relationship between short term rainfall and tp might be attributed to runoff containing high concentrations of tp longmore et al 1999 on the other hand the decline in tp concentration with an increase in long term rainfall might be a result of dilution miguntanna et al 2013 effluent from the treatment plant affected tp concentration by adding tp discharge load to the creek and this effect varied over time the effect of treatment plant effluent on increases in phosphate concentrations was dependent on the season and was more noticeable in summer house and denison 1997 results from the dbrda analysis revealed that variations in macroinvertebrate communities were also related negatively to toc and positively to its interaction with temperature the effect of toc on macroinvertebrates depends on where it originates from terrestrial within stream or from the wastewater treatment plant organic carbon with an anthropogenic origin such as effluent associated with a wastewater treatment plant can alter biodiversity and aquatic community structure spänhoff et al 2007 the marked increase after the discharge point could have been attributed to the effluent from the treatment plant while there was a correlation between toc and its corresponding concentration in discharge discharge toc flow rate this does not completely explain the marked increase in toc concentrations at downstream1 this may have been due to inaccuracies in measuring discharge volumes or creek flow rate because daily discharge volumes could have been discharged over a few days rather than steadily over the entire day moreover a few very high values at downstream1 ended up being influential points outliers in the models this was solved by including a dummy variable as distance 4 08 to the models based on the toc model seasonal variation in organic carbon was determined by rainfall and flow rate similar to tp toc was positively related to short term rainfall and negatively to long term rainfall rainfall regulates water quality through dilution and flushing kay et al 2001 conductivity discharge load did not seem to explain variation in conductivity concentration instead most of the spatiotemporal variation in conductivity could be explained by tp and alkalinity total phosphorus can be related to conductivity aguado et al 2006 alkalinity consists mainly of carbonate and bicarbonate ions and these ions contribute to conductivity kney and brandes 2007 time and distance were added to the model to account for unexplained spatiotemporal variation which might have been due to other ions that were not measured the fact that ions such as phosphate were more influential for conductivity than conductivity discharge load might have been because of incomplete mixing at downstream1 or the inaccuracy of the recorded discharge loads zinc and water temperature were the last two variables in the dbrda model that influenced macroinvertebrate communities wastewater effluent can be a source of increasing heavy metal in freshwater systems dalu et al 2017 in the current study effluent did not influence the water temperature and a combination of natural and anthropogenic variables including air temperature long term rainfall flow rate and residential land use at a 300 m scale explained spatiotemporal variations in water temperature interestingly rainfall was more important than air temperature in influencing water temperature air temperature might less directly affect water temperature depending on the prevailing hydrological and meteorological conditions such as rainfall and flow rate smith 1972 visualisation of macroinvertebrate community composition along pco1 scores using heatmaps helped reveal the taxa responsible for the macroinvertebrate community in response to environmental variables in the dbrda model increases in pco1 after the discharge point in warm months were accompanied by a reduction in the abundance of a mix of sensitive taxa such as leptophlebiidae moderately tolerant taxa such as baetidae caenidae tipulidae and mites and tolerant taxa including oligochaeta chironominae simulidae empididae micronectidae and anostraca heatmaps also revealed that abundances of several taxa including oligochaeta chironominae ceratopogonidae caenidae and leptophlebiidae increased after the discharge point in the cold months corresponding with decreasing pco1 scores the decrease in pco1 scores downstream of the discharge point was also associated with the disappearance of sensitive taxa e g gripopterygidae leptoceridae and tolerant taxa e g psychodidae hydroptilidae this was coupled with the appearance of several other sensitive taxa such as coloburiscidae and hydrobiosidae and tolerant taxa such as curculionidae and culicidae from these results it seems that the macroinvertebrate responses to effluent were not just an increase or a decrease in the number or abundance of tolerant taxa or sensitive taxa the impact of effluent on macroinvertebrates resulted in a community with higher evenness and made up of those taxa that could adapt to higher salinity and organic carbon concentrations in cold and warm months the macroinvertebrate communities in the upstream sites were very different in different seasons especially in the colder months compared to in the warmer months the effect of the discharged effluent resulted in similar downstream communities after the discharge point in all seasons indeed effluent discharged from the treatment plant caused a shift in macroinvertebrate community after the discharge point giving rise to an almost similar composition of macroinvertebrate at downstream1 in cold and warm months conditional independencies were tested with the purpose of deciding which covariates should be included in the model and to examine if the data were consistent with the structure of the causal diagram the results showed that adding variables to several of the structural equation models added more information to the model this led to revision of these models during the iterative process of model testing for example tp was added to the conductivity model in the case of macroinvertebrates it was tested whether there were any remaining spatiotemporal patterns in the pcos after conditioning on environmental variables that could be explained by adding another variable e g time distance while it was not the case in this study if there was any remaining spatiotemporal variation in the pcos it would have been essential to add arrows from time and distance to pcos in the final causal diagram to indicate that the causal inference was not strong that is by adding an arrow from time to pco1 macroinvertebrate community and the variables that influenced it would have a common cause where two variables have a latent common cause neither of them is qualified as a genuine cause of the other one pearl 2000 this means that environmental variables in the dbrda model could only be potential causes of variation in macroinvertebrate communities rather than genuine causes a few of the conditional independencies failed the local hypothesis tests of independency for example toc was suggested to be required in the nitrate model there might be a relationship between organic carbon and nitrate concentration probably because of biogeochemical processes that control both dissolved organic carbon and nitrate konohira and yoshioka 2005 however there was insufficient evidence to indicate that toc could explain the variations in nitrate or vice versa in this study these conditional independencies failed the test probably because the models in general and toc conductivity and nitrate models in particular need to be improved this was probably due to several factors such as incomplete lateral mixing of the effluent leading to high values that hindered the model from fitting the data well despite a few conditional independencies that did not pass the local test the p value for fisher s c test for the overall test of the model was non significant this supported the hypothesis that the overall conditional independencies entailed in the causal diagram were true and that the data were consistent with the structure of the causal diagram in this study the ways in which environmental variables may affect each other and the macroinvertebrate communities were described in a complex set of pathways using sem models in this study if the set of causal relationships in the causal diagram was not consistent with the observed data the hypothesis could be rejected austin 2007 the results of this study verified consistency of data with the set of conditional independencies their assumptions and the causal structure of the causal diagram therefore causal effects of the effluent on macroinvertebrate communities could be inferred in this study while controlling for spatiotemporal confounding this study had several advantages in inferring causation over similar studies that used sem to test causal hypotheses of the effects of environmental variables on macroinvertebrates in nonpoint source studies first as advised by shipley 2000 causal modelling based on local tests of conditional independence and a global test was used in order to examine the hypothesis underlying the missing arrows second as seen in previous sections the models were built by modelling ordination axes derived from multivariate species as a function of environmental variables in contrast to most studies that employ biotic indices six nontrivial pco axes were identified in this study but the first one entailed most of the variation in macroinvertebrate communities as supported by a similar study conducted by paul and anderson 2013 the six nontrivial axes revealed by the first method in this figure indicates that in reality in addition to the larger component explained by pco1 there might be many unmeasured non random variables explaining the smaller component of the spatiotemporal variation in the system it is worth mentioning that dbrda analysis and the analysis related to testing of the causal model were conducted using all pco axes the third advantage of this study was that the models were tested using dbrda which performs a multivariate regression on the pco axes legendre and anderson 1999 in multivariate ecological research recommended by paul and anderson 2013 and paul et al 2016 by doing so the limitations of sem such as conforming to linear functional forms and multivariate normal distribution could be overcome linearity was not the problem in this study but model building and testing using methods such as dbrda that are commonly used in multivariate ecological research can be beneficial for studies involving data that do not conform to linear functional forms paul et al 2013 in order to select an appropriate model for modelling the pco axis as a function of time and distance the functional forms and exploratory analysis should be considered in studies that have been conducted over long periods of time e g for several years data might show a periodic pattern along time axes i e a nonlinear sine curve in those cases the model might be as below 12 pco j β 1 distance β 2 distance day β 3 sin 2 π day 365 β 4 s i n 2 π d a y 365 d i s t a n c e β 5 d a y paul and anderson 2013 gave an example of modelling the pco axes with a periodic function of time to account for the seasonal component which was sum of sine and cosine terms with a seasonal period of four quarters the model in equation 12 seems to have more complexity for data used in this study therefore following the principles of parsimony the model in equation 1 was preferred for this research conceptually complexity of a model makes it flexible and easily able to fit diverse patterns of data however additional complexity more than the certain point needed for the model will cause the model to overfit the data and capture random error conversely a lack of necessary complexity will cause the model to underfit the data and fail to capture the signal pitt and myung 2002 in situations where there is another form of relationship between community data pco1 and distance or time e g quadratic this can also be accounted for in the model model building and testing using causal modelling is not restricted to linear models generally causal modelling techniques are believed to have a drawback of being costly as they require a big data set for developing the models if studies are conducted over longer periods of time more conditional independencies can be tested and this will improve the validity of the hypothesis testing in this study several of the conditional independencies could not be checked due to a lack of sufficient data on time another limitation of this study was a lack of information on some variables e g ions that might contribute to conductivity 5 conclusions based on the results after adjusting for time and distance in the model there was still evidence of an effect of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities and the causal effect of effluent discharge on macroinvertebrate score pcos was inferred thus the protocol developed and recommended in this study was shown to be able to deal with spatial and temporal confounding it also had the advantage of using a causal diagram that acts as a conceptual model and facilitates communication between scientists and resource managers moreover this protocol based on the conceptual modelling approach can be used to support management decision making by tackling all of the tasks the protocol developed in this study demonstrated the benefits of the causal modelling approach as a useful tool for treatment plant managers and for researchers in the field of environmental impact studies using the approach introduced in this designed protocol similar models can be built and tested for datasets collected

19603,it is now widely accepted that coating on the nano surface would critically dictate the uptake and cytotoxicity of engineering nanomaterials however the influence of natural organic matter nom on the surface is quite limited to humic substances while the diversity of nom is neglected in the present study we tried to investigate the change of surface in the coexistence of bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha the isothermal titration calorimetric measurements show that ha can combine with bsa in both freshwater or seawater however the patterns are different in freshwater ha lowered the adsorption of bsa on pvp capped agnps through complexation with bsa which prevented the contact of sulfur in bsa with pvp agnps then in seawater bsa retained its sulfur availability to bind with pvp agnps furthermore the toxicity of pvp agnps incubated in the bsa ha solution was evaluated by measuring the level of reactive oxygen species generated by escherichia coli the results indicated that in seawater the adsorbed bsa promoted the toxicity of pvp agnps in the presence of ca2 and mg2 but the presence of ha limited this effect graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic acid bovine serum albumin silver nanoparticle reactive oxygen species escherichia coli 1 introduction over the past decades nanotechnology achieves great progress and has been referred as the next generation of technical revolution as of 2013 there were more than 1600 consumer products containing nanoscale materials according to the woodrow wilson database http www nanotechproject org the manufactured nanomaterials nms are widely applied in cosmetic medical applications paints and food packaging etc however nms released from these consumer products or industrial discharge may gain exposure risk for ecological system and human beings recently detections of nms in environment like soil air and sludge of sewage treatment plants have been reported bäuerlein et al 2017 carboni et al 2016 unlike their ion phase metal nanoparticles nps may induce membrane damage wang et al 2013 or inhibit specific enzymatic activity schultz et al 2012 yue et al 2016 although great progress on the nanotoxicity has been achieved adverse effect of nms in natural environment is still quite unpredictable which is mainly ascribed to the complexity of environmental substances once being discharged into aquatic environment nms would inevitably interact with natural organic matter nom lowry et al 2012 the concentration of nom usually ranges from a few mg l to a few hundred mg l c wall and choppin 2003 which is normally several orders of magnitude higher than nms in particular aqueous environments contain both autochthonous organic matter proteins lipids nucleic acids polysaccharides etc produced by aquatic organisms and allochthonous matter mostly humic acid ha or fulvic acid fa from the decomposition of plant residue docter et al 2015 which can all affect the behavior of nms for example previous studies have reported that ha can reduce cytotoxicity of nms through three pathways i minimizing direct contact between nms and cells ii scavenging free radicals or iii combining with free metal ions chen et al 2011 lin et al 2012 deng et al 2016 gao et al 2012 however it is concerned that most of the studies focused on influence of humic substances while ignored the diversity of nom sani kast et al 2017 usually concentration of protein like matters in natural water is relative low less than 1 mg l amino n scully et al 1988 but it would extensively increase in the urbanized river meng et al 2013 or wastewater vakondios et al 2014 until now only a few studies have investigated the influence of protein on nps in aquatic environment and it is interesting to find that nps with protein coating may induce more toxicity nasser and lynch 2015 mal et al 2017 although the mechanisms were still unclear lawrence et al 2016 have investigated the coating of carbon nanotubes in natural water which revealed the complex coating consisting of lipids proteins polysaccharides and carbonates even though the mechanism of coating formation under the coexistence of protein and humic substance is still limited in this work we carried out a systematic investigation to understand how would the coexistence of protein and ha influence the surface of silver nanoparticles agnps in artificial freshwater and seawater agnps are one of the most widely used nms due to their effective antibacterial activities chernousova and epple 2013 bovine serum albumin bsa was selected as the protein considering the specific binding between bsa and agnps duran et al 2015 here we used bsa as a simplistic model to investigate the nano surface under a more real environment as it has gradually been accepted that what the cell sees on the nano surface would critically dictate the uptake and cytotoxicity of nms walczyk et al 2010 saei et al 2017 catalano et al 2015 kim et al 2013 the results of this study could help us to better understand the possible transformation of agnps in aquatic environments and the role of different noms on the toxicity of nms 2 materials and methods chemicals

purchased from sigma chemical company usa characterization of pvp agnps the pvp agnps suspended in ultrapure water were characterized by tem and uv vis spectroscopy the tem samples were prepared by placing a drop of pvp agnps suspension on copper grids followed by solvent evaporation then the morphology and size of pvp agnps were determined by a jem 2100 instrument jeol japan the particle diameter distribution was analyzed by nano measurer software through tem images at least 500 nanoparticles were counted the uv vis spectrum was scanned from 300 to 650 nm using a u 3010 spectrophotometer moreover the pvp agnps stock solution was lyophilized and solid pvp agnps sample was characterized using fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy over the range 500 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 bruker germany all the above characterization results were recorded in supplementary material fig s1 in addition the mass ratio of coating agent to agnps was also examined briefly pvp agnps prepared in freshwater or seawater was further centrifuged and washed three times then the pellets were dissolved using 1 m nitric acid and the pvp mass could be determined using toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena ag preparation of artificial water the artificial water prepared according to the u s environmental protection agency protocol was capable of giving comparable results with natural water for tio2 nanoparticles ottofuelling et al 2011 in this study the artificial moderately hard freshwater and artificial seawater epa 821 r 02 013 and epa 821 r 02 014 were prepared for test media the corresponding artificial water samples without ca2 and mg2 were also prepared with the same components and processes in summary four groups of artificial water freshwater and seawater with and without ca2 and mg2 were prepared and stored at 4 c the ph of these different artificial water samples was measured and found to be constant at 7 64 0 11 incubation of pvp agnps first 1 g l ha and 2 g l bsa stock solutions were prepared with milliq water millipore zoug zg switzerland 18 2 mω cm then these stock solutions were mixed with artificial water from each group and finally diluted to a predetermined ha or bsa concentration and 75 v v artificial water by adding millq water finally six incubation media with different ha or bsa concentrations were prepared for each artificial water sample detailed compositions for the incubation media are listed in supplementary material table s1 then 50 μl stock solution of pvp agnps was added into the incubation media to reach a final 50 mg l concentration with 2 ml volume and incubated for 12 h in the dark at room temperature using a horizontal rotator for all the incubation experiments a protein lobind tube eppendorf was employed to minimize the nonspecific adsorption of protein to the tube wall status of pvp agnps after incubation after incubation measurements of dynamic light scattering dls and surface potential of pvp agnps in different incubation media were both performed utilizing a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk the dls measurements were performed at a laser wavelength of 660 nm and a detection angle of 173 at 298 15 k for surface potential pvp agnps after incubation were firstly isolated with free bsa or ha molecules through centrifugation then morphology and elemental composition of pvp agnps after incubation were further analyzed using tem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds on a jem 2100 f instrument jeol japan samples were prepared by dropping a suspension of incubated pvp agnps on copper grids and leaving it to dry overnight protein adsorption adsorption ability of pvp agnps towards bsa in freshwater and seawater were firstly evaluated using the intrinsic fluorescence signal of bsa briefly after incubation pvp agnps solution was centrifuged at 50 000 g for 20 min then fluorescence signal ex em 280 330 nm of supernatant was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan to calculate the dissociative amounts of bsa finally the mass ratio of absorbed bsa to pvp agnps could be obtained after that sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page was performed for bsa recovered from pvp agnps after incubation according to a previously well established technique docter et al 2014 firstly the agnps bsa ha complexes were isolated by centrifuging the mixture at 4 c at 18 000 g for 30 min then the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were washed with their corresponding incubation media the process was repeated three times bsa could be eluted from pvp agnps or ha by adding 100 μl of sds sample buffer 62 5 mm tris buffer ph 6 8 2 w v sds 10 v v glycerol 50 mm dtt and 0 01 w v bromophenol blue into the pellet followed by incubating for 5 min at 95 c eventually bsa recovered from pvp agnps was separated by 4 20 gradient sds page and detected with silver staining also the band intensity was analyzed using software gelanalyzer 2010a http www gelanalyzer com our pilot experiment confirmed that ha did not induce any bands or impact the band of protein under the above protocol data not shown another pilot experiment was conducted to determine whether most of the nanoparticles were settled down at 4 c at 18 000 g for 30 min the uv vis spectra of the supernatant of pvp agnps prepared in freshwater and seawater before or after centrifugation were recorded supplementary material fig s2 the characteristic absorbances at 415 nm and 515 nm for pvp agnps were used for evaluating the effect of sedimentation and it was found that around 90 of nanoparticles were settled down in addition pvp agnps were also incubated with bsa before and after alkylation using iodoacetamide to study the role of thiol group in the binding process between bsa and pvp agnps in a typical experiment 100 mg l bsa in artificial freshwater or seawater was firstly prepared and then 1 m freshly prepared iodoacetamide was added to reach a final 50 mm concentration after reaction for 30 min at room temperature pvp agnps sample was added into the solution to reach a concentration of 50 mg l and incubated for 12 h in the dark at room temperature the adsorbed bsa was recovered with sds page as described before fluorescence excitation spectroscopy macromolecules adsorbed on the pvp agnps could be semi quantitatively determined using fitc as the fluorescent probe through the specific binding between nh2 and fitc xia et al 2012 fitc has been widely used for labeling proteins and also applied previously for labeling ha muscolo et al 2007 the incubated agnps bsa ha complexes were collected through centrifugation at 4 c at 18 000 g for 30 min and washed with their corresponding incubation media then the pellet was re suspended and incubated with 10 mg l fitc prepared in 75 v v artificial water for 4 h at 25 c in the dark after that an ultrafiltration centrifuge tube amicon ultra 15 ml 30 kda centrifugal filter from millipore was used for isolating the labelled pvp agnps from unbound fitc after centrifugation at 4000 g for 30 min pvp agnps remained on the filter membrane while the unbound fitc molecules were isolated in the solution the process was repeated one more time and then the pellets were suspended with 2 ml milliq water the suspended solution was ultrasonicated before measuring the fluorescence signal the fluorescence excitation spectra of agnps bsa ha complexes were recorded the original agnps without fluorescent label were also detected to exclude their own potential fluorescence signal the excitation wavelength was scanned from 270 nm to 515 nm and the emission wavelength was set to 525 nm isothermal titration calorimetry itc itc was employed to explore possible interactions between bsa and ha in the artificial freshwater and seawater bsa was dissolved in 10 mm hepes naoh buffer ph 7 0 with 75 v v artificial freshwater or seawater to reach a final 40 g l mass concentration and a 0 2 g l solution of ha was prepared in the same solution as the bsa then solutions were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 5 min to remove possible dust or sediment loosli et al 2015 the bsa solution was titrated into the ha solution at 25 c using a microcal itc 200 malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk after the initial 0 2 μl injection of ha solution 19 further injections of 2 μl ha solution were performed finally the reaction enthalpy entropy change binding constant and reaction stoichiometry were obtained through data fitting using a one site binding model moreover following the titration reactions between bsa and ha the bsa solution was titrated into a control solution without ha to minimize the effect of dilution enthalpy differential pulse voltammetry dpv measurement the sulfur availability of bsa in different artificial water samples after the addition of ha was studied by dpv using a 797 va computrace system metrohm switzerland a hanging mercury electrode served as the working electrode and ag agcl 3 m kcl and pt electrode were used as the reference and auxiliary electrodes respectively during the experiment different volumes of bsa stock solution were successively added into a de aerated hepes naoh buffer ph 7 0 with 75 v v artificial water followed by four aliquots of ha solution the voltammograms were recorded after each addition of bsa or ha solution under the following parameters potential scanning from 0 2 v to 0 9 v 10 mv voltage step 40 ms pulse duration and 25 mv s 1 scan rate ros the testing organism escherichia coli atcc 8739 was purchased from guangdong microbiology culture center china and cultured with lb medium before conducting the toxicity test e coli was incubated at 37 c overnight and centrifuged at 3300 g for 10 min then the settled bacteria were washed by sterilized physiological saline twice and re suspended in physiological saline to adjust the od600 of solution to 1 0 1 8 subsequently dcfh ha was added to 10 ml of suspended solution to reach a final 30 mg l mass concentration then the bacteria were incubated at 37 c in the dark for 30 min the bacteria were eventually labelled with the fluorescent probe after dcfh da in solution was removed through re centrifuging and then suspended in 10 ml of physiological saline the incubated 50 mg l pvp agnps in different media listed in supplementary material table s1 were firstly diluted with their corresponding incubation media to 1 mg l before the toxicity test then 2 ml of diluted pvp agnps solution was added into a glass tube and followed by addition of 0 1 ml of prepared e coli moreover the ros levels induced by bsa ha and mixture of bsa ha were also studied three duplicate samples were set for each group after 4 h of incubation at 25 c in the dark the ros generation of e coli was assessed by the dcf level using a fluorescence spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of nano surface under the coexistence of ha and bsa the pvp agnps was incubated with mixtures of bsa and ha with varied ratios and nps incubated with bsa alone was treated as the control after 12 h of incubation the ζ potential and hydrodynamic radius r h from z average value of pvp agnps suspended in artificial water were plotted as shown in fig 1 a and b in the artificial freshwater the change in pvp agnps surface with the additions of ha or bsa was evident from the change inζ potential fig 1 a it was observed that the absolute value of ζ potential of pvp agnps was reduced by bsa from 11 8 to 6 72 mv in the presence of ca and mg and from 16 1 to 9 9 mv in the absence of ca and mg which implied the coating of protein then it gradually reverted to the original value with the addition of ha furthermore the amounts of bsa adsorbed on the pvp agnps under different ha concentrations were revealed through sds page fig 1 c it was found that even a small addition of ha could remarkably decrease the adsorption amounts of bsa in the freshwater media which was consistent with the trend exhibited by the ζ potential then the destruction of protein coating induced by ha in freshwater was also confirmed by tem fig 2 a c as shown in fig 2 b the formation of protein coating was clearly visible then we further calculated the theoretic thickness of bsa coating based on the absorbed amounts of bsa molecules per particle table s2 bsa molecule was assumed as a solid equilateral triangle with 8 4 nm edge length and a thickness of 3 2 nm ferrer et al 2001 therefore volume of single bsa molecule could be estimated furthermore it was supposed that absorbed bsa molecules accumulated together compactly eventually the theoretic thickness of bsa on pvp agnps was calculated which was 9 14 nm in freshwater and 3 34 nm in seawater it was found that the theoretic thickness of bsa in freshwater exceeded the maximum thickness 8 4 nm of monomolecular adsorption layer therefore multilayer adsorption of bsa should occur which was also observed in tem image however the protein coating completely disappeared with the addition of ha 150 mg l as shown in fig 2 c the above results indicate that in the artificial freshwater i there may be an adsorption competition on the surface of pvp agnps between ha and bsa or ii ha may form a complex with bsa to reduce the adsorption ability of bsa however it can be seen from fig 1 c that a fair amount of bsa was retained on the surface even with the addition of 150 mg l ha in the artificial seawater which was also supported by tem images fig 2 d f interestingly as shown in fig 1 c a decreasing trend of adsorbed bsa amounts decrease by 70 according to band intensity data not shown was observed in the presence of ca and mg likely due to the aggregation of pvp agnps as shown in fig 2 f and fig 1 b which reduced the available surface for protein adsorption furthermore whether in artificial freshwater or seawater the presence of bsa reduced the r h of pvp agnps by facilitating the dispersion of nanoparticles raw dls data is provided in supplementary material fig s3 maccuspie 2010 then the addition of ha slightly enhanced the r h of pvp agnps suspended without ca2 and mg2 while the r h of nps remarkably increased at the ha concentration of 150 mg l in the presence of ca2 and mg2 the presence of ca2 or mg2 can always induce intermolecular bridging for nom molecules lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 metreveli et al 2016 suggesting that a co adsorption of ha occurred on the surface of pvp agnps which resulted in the aggregation of nps the macromolecules adsorbed on the pvp agnps were then semi quantitatively determined using the fluorescent label fitc as shown in fig 3 the characteristic fluorescence peak of fitc ex at 495 nm was observed which suggested that the fluorescence probe was successfully attached to the surface though relative weak fluorescence signal was also observed for the pristine pvp capped agnps either in freshwater or seawater xia et al 2012 reported that no interaction was observed between pvp and fitc therefore it was inferred that the background fluorescence might stem from the adsorption of fitc on the ultrafiltration membrane in addition fluorescence signal of bare agnps 50 mg l in ultrapure water was also detected and it was confirmed that the original agnps could not cause significant fluorescence supplementary material fig s4 in the freshwater compared with the original agnps the pvp agnps incubated with bsa exhibited a much higher fluorescence intensity at ex 495 nm which should be due to the large amount of adsorbed bsa then the fluorescence signal of pvp agnps incubated in the presence of bsa increased with ha concentration however the adsorbed bsa amounts dramatically decreased with higher ha concentrations fig 1 c which suggested that the increased signal was induced by the adsorbed ha furthermore the fluorescence signal of pvp agnps incubated in 100 mg l ha was higher than that of pvp agnps incubated in a mixture of 100 mg l ha and 100 mg l bsa therefore it could be concluded that the coexistence of bsa and ha in freshwater not only decreases the adsorbed amounts of bsa on the pvp agnps but also reduces the adsorption of ha similarly we can conclude that the adsorption of ha also occurred in the seawater in the presence of bsa fig 3 but no evidence was found to verify that bsa affects the adsorption of ha 3 2 mechanism of the coating formation under the coexistence of ha and bsa although it was observed that bsa was absorbed on pvp agnps in both freshwater and seawater media the binding mechanism is still unclear firstly it was concerned that whether if the pvp layer played a key role in the interaction between bsa and agnps many studies have reported that pvp could strongly inhibit the adsorption of bsa yuan et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 wang et al 2012 zhu et al 2011 particularly yuan et al 2016 found that polyurethane film grafted with pvp reduced the adsorption level of bsa by 93 4 compared with the unmodified polyurethane film and the mass ratio between bsa and pvp could be estimated 0 0022 in the present study the mass ratio of pvp to agnps was around 0 2 table s2 which suggested that the coating pvp might exhibit fairly low effect to the adsorption of bsa furthermore it has been reported that sulfur bearing residues like cysteine can form covalent bonds with heavy metals which may induce the formation of protein coating wang et al 2013 banerjee and das 2014 and sulfidation of pvp capped agnps has been observed in the presence of protein coating miclaus et al 2016 therefore we used iodoacetamide to alkylate the exposed sulfhydryl moiety of bsa to examine whether pvp agnps are attached to bsa through the thiol group r s h as shown in fig 4 a the alkylated bsa was almost unable to adsorb onto pvp agnps in freshwater however it retained its adsorption ability in seawater this result strongly indicates that bsa attached to pvp agnps only through the thiol group of bsa in freshwater but it is still uncertain if bsa could bind with pvp agnps through disulfides in seawater as both r s h and r s s r groups can form covalent bonds with metals wang et al 2013 nevertheless the eds spectra of pvp agnps suggested that ag s bond through r s s r group might also play an important role for protein adsorption in seawater supplementary material fig s5 and table s3 as the atomic ratios of s ag dramatically increased for pvp agnps incubated with bsa the mechanism by which ha influences the coating formation was further analyzed firstly possible interactions between bsa and ha under different environmental conditions were studied by using itc which is commonly used to characterize intermolecular interactions li et al 2015 dubey et al 2017 basu and kumar 2016 the thermodynamic parameters of intermolecular interactions such as the binding constant enthalpy changes and binding stoichiometry can be calculated based on the molar concentrations of both molecules for data fitting since ha is a complex mixture of acids containing carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups an average molecular weight of ha 3400 da her et al 2002 was adopted in addition it has been reviewed that humic substance and colloidal natural organic matter are likely aggregations of smaller molecules as revealed by high resolution mass spectrometry mopper et al 2007 considering the huge gap of molecular weight between ha and bsa ha would be treated as small molecular ligands in the following discussion as shown in fig 4 b a clear exothermic peak was observed after each injection in the freshwater and the data was fitted well by a one site binding process however in the seawater the non linear regression did not properly fit the data fig 4 c which may due to the inter protein interaction and lower exothermic heat in the high ionic strength scenario nonetheless the interaction was found to be exothermic which indicated that ha could combine with bsa whether in freshwater or seawater this binding process was also supported by the fluorescence quenching and electrophoretic mobility change of bsa resulting from its complexation with ha kobbero et al 2008 wang et al 2015 in the freshwater the binding constant was calculated to be 3 3 0 8 104 m 1 other calculated thermodynamic parameters are provided in table s4 which is fairly close to the binding constant of ha with human serum albumin 6 192 0 008 104 m 1 at 298 k with ionic strength 0 1 m ding et al 2011 furthermore the interaction was enthalpically favorable δh 0 but entropically unfavorable δs 0 which implied that the complexation process might be driven by h bonding or van der waals force ross and subramanian 1981 interestingly it has been reported that polyphenols can combine with bsa through hydrogen bonds which may form between the oh group and the polar groups at the bsa surface ozdal et al 2013 xiao et al 2008 therefore the abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups in ha may be responsible for the interaction between ha and bsa compared to the freshwater less protein injections were required to reach saturation for ha in the seawater which implied that less binding sites in bsa were available for ha in the seawater similarly sargin et al recently reported that protein adsorption on ha aggregates decreased at higher ionic strength sargin et al 2016 at a high ionic strength the hydrophobic interaction was preferred but the conformation of bsa was also altered yamasaki et al 1990 which may have resulted in the alteration of the interaction mode between bsa and ha from the above analysis it is clear that the mechanisms for binding between ha and bsa differed in freshwater and seawater however it is still not fully understood how ha affects the coating formation therefore a hanging mercury electrode was utilized to study changes in sulfur availability of bsa with the additions of ha in different media as the covalent bond formed by sulfur and ag significantly affects the coating formation due to the strong affinity between metal and reduced sulfur ligand sulfide compounds like cysteine or bsa can be tightly immobilized on the surface of the mercury electrode ravichandran 2004 fig 5 a it was found that the formed hg s bond induced a reduction peak around 0 6 v krznaric et al 2001 ostatna et al 2010 as observed in fig 5 b during the dpv measurement it was observed that the peak current increased linearly with the addition of bsa at a lower concentration and soon reached a plateau level when the bsa concentration exceeded 60 mg l the main reason for this behavior is likely the adsorption saturation of bsa on the electrode surface that restricted the formation of hg s bond moreover the plateau level of peak current in seawater 24 52 na was considerably lower than that in freshwater 40 15 na which suggested that the mercury pellet exhibited a higher adsorption capacity in the freshwater furthermore the addition of ha into the electrolyte induced a remarkable decrease in peak current decreased by 88 7 in freshwater and 47 4 in seawater respectively caused by bsa fig 5 b c a competition model might not explain this scenario because hg exhibits relatively weaker affinity for ha lgk ranging from 10 1 to 4 5 gismera et al 2007 compared to its binding affinity for organic sulfur lgk ranging from 25 to 32 ravichandran 2004 therefore as discussed with reference to itc measurements ha likely combined with bsa which reduced the availability of thiol or disulfide bond in bsa through the steric repulsion as shown in fig 5 c the 20 mg l ha solution caused almost complete loss of sulfur availability for 100 mg l bsa in freshwater however around 25 of sulfur availability remained for bsa in seawater with the same concentrations based on the previously discussed binding mechanism between pvp agnps and bsa it is clear that the coating formation is strongly influenced by the steric repulsion induced by complexation of bsa with ha which prevents the contact between sulfur in bsa and the pvp agnps surface 3 3 toxicity effect of the nano surface under the coexistence of ha and bsa in this study the intracellular ros levels generated by e coli exposed to various ha bsa concentrations were measured to assess the toxicity of the incubated pvp agnps complexed with bsa ha as it has been previously reported that ros formation strongly affects the toxicity of agnps duran et al 2015 moreover divalent cations such as ca2 or mg2 may help to generate substantial hydrophobic interactions for proteins wu et al 2012 or promote the intermolecular interactions through cation bridging lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 metreveli et al 2016 therefore a control group without ca2 and mg2 was also evaluated to identify the role of these divalent cations in the toxicity tests as shown in fig 6 a compared with the control both ha and bsa affected the ros level of e coli to some extent however this effect was much weaker than that induced by pvp agnps nevertheless it was observed that bsa could increase ros level in seawater but had no effect in freshwater moreover after ha addition bsa decreased the ros level in freshwater but showed the opposite effect in seawater taken together with the previous discussions such differences in the interaction mechanisms of ha might be ascribed to the change in binding mechanism or surface functional groups as indicated by itc and dpv measurements furthermore the protein coating clearly influences the effect of ca2 and mg2 on the pvp agnps in the freshwater the presence of ca2 and mg2 had no effect on the ros level induced by agnps bsa complex while these ions increased the ros level for the incubated pvp agnps that lacked the protein coating fig 1 c in contrast in the seawater the two divalent cations significantly elevated the ros level for the pvp agnps with protein coating however they did not have any effect on the pvp agnps incubated in ha or pure seawater moreover in the normal seawater although the pvp agnps incubated in bsa and ha adsorbed almost the same amounts of bsa their ros levels tended to decrease when the adsorption of ha increased obviously the pvp agnps incubated in ha exhibited no apparent difference in toxicity compared with the original agnps while the pvp agnps with protein coating differed considerably from the original agnps such a difference might be ascribed to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms of agnps kittler et al reported that bsa might inhibit the cytotoxicity of agnps through binding to silver kittler et al 2010 however other studies found that agnps or zno nanoparticles with bsa coating exhibited better antimicrobial activity wu et al 2014 martinez robles et al 2016 it has been reported that the toxic effects of agnps are likely due to silver ions being released by agnps but this phenomenon is not fully understood for small sized agnps foldbjerg et al 2015 the particulate ag could directly adhere to the cell wall and penetrate the cell membrane to induce toxicity morones et al 2005 therefore for agnps with bsa coating the presence of bsa may shield the reactive ag metal from dissolution martin et al 2014 and simultaneously promote the adhesion of agnps to the cell membrane martinez robles et al 2016 in this study silver ions released by pvp agnps in solution may exhibit relative smaller toxic effect compared with particle ag as both bsa and ha could inhibit the dissolution of agnps martin et al 2014 liu and hurt 2010 however no positive feedback was observed in the ros level fig 6 b and c therefore it was inferred that particle ag might be mainly responsible for the toxic effect due to its direct interaction with cell chwalibog et al 2010 in freshwater the protein coating could help pvp agnps preferentially adhere to the cell by hindering the electrostatic repulsion fig 1 a however the presence of ha disrupted the formation of the protein coating which made the surface of pvp agnps similar to that of the original agnps therefore the pvp agnps incubated in the presence of both ha and bsa behaved in a similar manner as those incubated in ha alone or pure freshwater fig 6 b the elevated ros level induced by ca2 and mg2 might be due to the surface potential change fig 1 a however in the seawater the electrostatic repulsion was strongly screened and the high ionic concentration of cl inhibited the release of ag ions metreveli et al 2016 foldbjerg et al 2015 consequently no increase in ros level was observed for the pvp agnps incubated in ha alone or pure seawater in the presence of ca2 and mg2 fig 6 c however it was found that the protein coating could significantly elevate the ros level in the presence of ca2 and mg2 it is speculated that ca2 and mg2 may increase the adhesion ability of pvp agnps to the cell through specific ion interactions as it has been reported that bsa exhibits greater hydrophobicity under high ionic strength and in the presence of ca2 ions wu et al 2012 in the seawater bsa retained its adsorption ability on pvp agnps with the addition of ha thus all the pvp agnps incubated in the presence of bsa behaved similarly when ca2 and mg2 were present nonetheless the co adsorption of ha could decrease the ros level induced by agnps bsa complex which might be due to its ability to scavenge free radicals 4 conclusions to summarize our results indicated that effect of ca2 and mg2 on the ros level of e coli induced by incubated pvp agnps was related to the coating on the surface which was previously influenced by the organic matter type for the two synthetic water the coating formation on surface exhibited two totally different ways one method was to disrupt the coating formation which occurred in the freshwater sample the other method was co adsorption of ha and bsa on the surface which occurred in the seawater sample moreover it was observed that the presence of heavy metal ions organic solvents or ultraviolet radiation in aquatic environments could also induce a change in the protein conformation as a result in some cases proteins may be tightly adsorbed on the surface without considering the presence of ha it is suggested that the protein coated nps might exhibit a totally different behavior compared with ha coated nps therefore our results underline the importance of studying interactions between ha and proteins under different conditions to obtain a more authentic understanding of the transformation of nps in the natural environments acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51290283

19603,it is now widely accepted that coating on the nano surface would critically dictate the uptake and cytotoxicity of engineering nanomaterials however the influence of natural organic matter nom on the surface is quite limited to humic substances while the diversity of nom is neglected in the present study we tried to investigate the change of surface in the coexistence of bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha the isothermal titration calorimetric measurements show that ha can combine with bsa in both freshwater or seawater however the patterns are different in freshwater ha lowered the adsorption of bsa on pvp capped agnps through complexation with bsa which prevented the contact of sulfur in bsa with pvp agnps then in seawater bsa retained its sulfur availability to bind with pvp agnps furthermore the toxicity of pvp agnps incubated in the bsa ha solution was evaluated by measuring the level of reactive oxygen species generated by escherichia coli the results indicated that in seawater the adsorbed bsa promoted the toxicity of pvp agnps in the presence of ca2 and mg2 but the presence of ha limited this effect graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic acid bovine serum albumin silver nanoparticle reactive oxygen species escherichia coli 1 introduction over the past decades nanotechnology achieves great progress and has been referred as the next generation of technical revolution as of 2013 there were more than 1600 consumer products containing nanoscale materials according to the woodrow wilson database http www nanotechproject org the manufactured nanomaterials nms are widely applied in cosmetic medical applications paints and food packaging etc however nms released from these consumer products or industrial discharge may gain exposure risk for ecological system and human beings recently detections of nms in environment like soil air and sludge of sewage treatment plants have been reported bäuerlein et al 2017 carboni et al 2016 unlike their ion phase metal nanoparticles nps may induce membrane damage wang et al 2013 or inhibit specific enzymatic activity schultz et al 2012 yue et al 2016 although great progress on the nanotoxicity has been achieved adverse effect of nms in natural environment is still quite unpredictable which is mainly ascribed to the complexity of environmental substances once being discharged into aquatic environment nms would inevitably interact with natural organic matter nom lowry et al 2012 the concentration of nom usually ranges from a few mg l to a few hundred mg l c wall and choppin 2003 which is normally several orders of magnitude higher than nms in particular aqueous environments contain both autochthonous organic matter proteins lipids nucleic acids polysaccharides etc produced by aquatic organisms and allochthonous matter mostly humic acid ha or fulvic acid fa from the decomposition of plant residue docter et al 2015 which can all affect the behavior of nms for example previous studies have reported that ha can reduce cytotoxicity of nms through three pathways i minimizing direct contact between nms and cells ii scavenging free radicals or iii combining with free metal ions chen et al 2011 lin et al 2012 deng et al 2016 gao et al 2012 however it is concerned that most of the studies focused on influence of humic substances while ignored the diversity of nom sani kast et al 2017 usually concentration of protein like matters in natural water is relative low less than 1 mg l amino n scully et al 1988 but it would extensively increase in the urbanized river meng et al 2013 or wastewater vakondios et al 2014 until now only a few studies have investigated the influence of protein on nps in aquatic environment and it is interesting to find that nps with protein coating may induce more toxicity nasser and lynch 2015 mal et al 2017 although the mechanisms were still unclear lawrence et al 2016 have investigated the coating of carbon nanotubes in natural water which revealed the complex coating consisting of lipids proteins polysaccharides and carbonates even though the mechanism of coating formation under the coexistence of protein and humic substance is still limited in this work we carried out a systematic investigation to understand how would the coexistence of protein and ha influence the surface of silver nanoparticles agnps in artificial freshwater and seawater agnps are one of the most widely used nms due to their effective antibacterial activities chernousova and epple 2013 bovine serum albumin bsa was selected as the protein considering the specific binding between bsa and agnps duran et al 2015 here we used bsa as a simplistic model to investigate the nano surface under a more real environment as it has gradually been accepted that what the cell sees on the nano surface would critically dictate the uptake and cytotoxicity of nms walczyk et al 2010 saei et al 2017 catalano et al 2015 kim et al 2013 the results of this study could help us to better understand the possible transformation of agnps in aquatic environments and the role of different noms on the toxicity of nms 2 materials and methods chemicals

purchased from sigma chemical company usa characterization of pvp agnps the pvp agnps suspended in ultrapure water were characterized by tem and uv vis spectroscopy the tem samples were prepared by placing a drop of pvp agnps suspension on copper grids followed by solvent evaporation then the morphology and size of pvp agnps were determined by a jem 2100 instrument jeol japan the particle diameter distribution was analyzed by nano measurer software through tem images at least 500 nanoparticles were counted the uv vis spectrum was scanned from 300 to 650 nm using a u 3010

cm 1 bruker germany all the above characterization results were recorded in supplementary material fig s1 in addition the mass ratio of coating agent to agnps was also examined briefly pvp agnps prepared in freshwater or seawater was further centrifuged and washed three times then the pellets were dissolved using 1 m nitric acid and the pvp mass could be determined using toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena ag preparation of artificial water the artificial water prepared according to the u s environmental protection agency protocol was capable of giving comparable results with natural water for tio2 nanoparticles ottofuelling et al 2011 in this study the artificial moderately hard freshwater and artificial seawater epa 821 r 02 013 and epa 821 r 02 014 were prepared for test media the corresponding artificial water samples without ca2 and mg2 were also prepared with the same components and processes in summary four groups of artificial water freshwater and seawater with and without ca2 and mg2 were prepared and stored at 4 c the ph of these different artificial water samples was measured and found to be constant at 7 64 0 11 incubation of pvp agnps first 1 g l ha and 2 g l bsa stock solutions were prepared with milliq water millipore zoug zg switzerland 18 2 mω cm then these stock solutions were mixed with artificial water from each group and finally diluted to a predetermined ha or bsa concentration and 75 v v artificial water by adding millq water finally six incubation media with different ha or bsa concentrations were prepared for each artificial water sample detailed compositions for the incubation media are listed in supplementary material table s1 then 50 μl stock solution of pvp agnps was added into the incubation media to reach a final 50 mg l concentration with 2 ml volume and incubated for 12 h in the dark at room temperature using a horizontal rotator for all the incubation experiments a protein lobind tube eppendorf was employed to minimize the nonspecific adsorption of protein to the tube wall status of pvp agnps after incubation after incubation measurements of dynamic light scattering dls and surface potential of pvp agnps in different incubation media were both performed utilizing a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk the dls measurements were performed at a laser wavelength of 660 nm and a detection angle of 173 at 298 15 k for surface potential pvp agnps after incubation were firstly isolated with free bsa or ha molecules through centrifugation then morphology and elemental composition of pvp agnps after incubation were further analyzed using tem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds on a jem 2100 f instrument jeol japan samples were prepared by dropping a suspension of incubated pvp agnps on copper grids and leaving it to dry overnight protein adsorption adsorption ability of pvp agnps towards bsa in freshwater and seawater were firstly evaluated using the intrinsic fluorescence signal of bsa briefly after incubation pvp agnps solution was centrifuged at 50 000 g for 20 min then fluorescence signal ex em 280 330 nm of supernatant was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan to calculate the dissociative amounts of bsa finally the mass ratio of absorbed bsa to pvp agnps could be obtained after that sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page was performed for bsa recovered from pvp agnps after incubation according to a previously well established technique docter et al 2014 firstly the agnps bsa ha complexes were isolated by centrifuging the mixture at 4 c at 18 000 g for 30 min then the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were washed with their corresponding incubation media the process was repeated three times bsa could be eluted from pvp agnps or ha by adding 100 μl of sds sample buffer 62 5 mm tris buffer ph 6 8 2 w v sds 10 v v glycerol 50 mm dtt and 0 01 w v bromophenol blue into the pellet followed by incubating for 5 min at 95 c eventually bsa recovered from pvp agnps was separated by 4 20 gradient sds page and detected with silver staining also the band intensity was analyzed using software gelanalyzer 2010a http www gelanalyzer com our pilot experiment confirmed that ha did not induce any bands or impact the band of protein under the above protocol data not shown another pilot experiment was conducted to determine whether most of the nanoparticles were settled down at 4 c at 18 000 g for 30 min the uv vis spectra of the supernatant of pvp agnps prepared in freshwater and seawater before or after centrifugation were recorded supplementary material fig s2 the characteristic absorbances at 415 nm and 515 nm for pvp agnps were used for evaluating the effect of sedimentation and it was found that around 90 of nanoparticles were settled down in addition pvp agnps were also incubated with bsa before and after alkylation using iodoacetamide to study the role of thiol group in the binding process between bsa and pvp agnps in a typical experiment 100 mg l bsa in artificial freshwater or seawater was firstly prepared and then 1 m freshly prepared iodoacetamide was added to reach a final 50 mm concentration after reaction for 30 min at room temperature pvp agnps sample was added into the solution to reach a concentration of 50 mg l and incubated for 12 h in the dark at room temperature the adsorbed bsa was recovered with sds page as described before fluorescence excitation spectroscopy macromolecules adsorbed on the pvp agnps could be semi quantitatively determined using fitc as the fluorescent probe through the specific binding between nh2 and fitc xia et al 2012 fitc has been widely used for labeling proteins and also applied previously for labeling ha muscolo et al 2007 the incubated agnps bsa ha complexes were collected through centrifugation at 4 c at 18 000 g for 30 min and washed with their corresponding incubation media then the pellet was re suspended and incubated with 10 mg l fitc prepared in 75 v v artificial water for 4 h at 25 c in the dark after that an ultrafiltration centrifuge tube amicon ultra 15 ml 30 kda centrifugal filter from millipore was used for isolating the labelled pvp agnps from unbound fitc after centrifugation at 4000 g for 30 min pvp agnps remained on the filter membrane while the unbound fitc molecules were isolated in the solution the process was repeated one more time and then the pellets were suspended with 2 ml milliq water the suspended solution was ultrasonicated before measuring the fluorescence signal the fluorescence excitation spectra of agnps bsa ha complexes were recorded the original agnps without fluorescent label were also detected to exclude their own potential fluorescence signal the excitation wavelength was scanned from 270 nm to 515 nm and the emission wavelength was set to 525 nm isothermal titration calorimetry itc itc was employed to explore possible interactions between bsa and ha in the artificial freshwater and seawater bsa was dissolved in 10 mm hepes naoh buffer ph 7 0 with 75 v v artificial freshwater or seawater to reach a final 40 g l mass concentration and a 0 2 g l solution of ha was prepared in the same solution as the bsa then solutions were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 5 min to remove possible dust or sediment loosli et al 2015 the bsa solution was titrated into the ha solution at 25 c using a microcal itc 200 malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk after the initial 0 2 μl injection of ha solution 19 further injections of 2 μl ha solution were performed finally the reaction enthalpy entropy change binding constant and reaction stoichiometry were obtained through data fitting using a one site binding model moreover following the titration reactions between bsa and ha the bsa solution was titrated into a control solution without ha to minimize the effect of dilution enthalpy differential pulse voltammetry dpv measurement the sulfur availability of bsa in different artificial water samples after the addition of ha was studied by dpv using a 797 va computrace system metrohm switzerland a hanging mercury electrode served as the working electrode and ag agcl 3 m kcl and pt electrode were used as the reference and auxiliary electrodes respectively during the experiment different volumes of bsa stock solution were successively added into a de aerated hepes naoh buffer ph 7 0 with 75 v v artificial water followed by four aliquots of ha solution the voltammograms were recorded after each addition of bsa or ha solution under the following parameters potential scanning from 0 2 v to 0 9 v 10 mv voltage step 40 ms pulse duration and 25 mv s 1 scan rate ros the testing organism escherichia coli atcc 8739 was purchased from guangdong microbiology culture center china and cultured with lb medium before conducting the toxicity test e coli was incubated at 37 c overnight and centrifuged at 3300 g for 10 min then the settled bacteria were washed by sterilized physiological saline twice and re suspended in physiological saline to adjust the od600 of solution to 1 0 1 8 subsequently dcfh ha was added to 10 ml of suspended solution to reach a final 30 mg l mass concentration then the bacteria were incubated at 37 c in the dark for 30 min the bacteria were eventually labelled with the fluorescent probe after dcfh da in solution was removed through re centrifuging and then suspended in 10 ml of physiological saline the incubated 50 mg l pvp agnps in different media listed in supplementary material table s1 were firstly diluted with their corresponding incubation media to 1 mg l before the toxicity test then 2 ml of diluted pvp agnps solution was added into a glass tube and followed by addition of 0 1 ml of prepared e coli moreover the ros levels induced by bsa ha and mixture of bsa ha were also studied three duplicate samples were set for each group after 4 h of incubation at 25 c in the dark the ros generation of e coli was assessed by the dcf level using a fluorescence spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of nano surface under the coexistence of ha and bsa the pvp agnps was incubated with mixtures of bsa and ha with varied ratios and nps incubated with bsa alone was treated as the control after 12 h of incubation the ζ potential and hydrodynamic radius r h from z average value of pvp agnps suspended in artificial water were plotted as shown in fig 1 a and b in the artificial freshwater the change in pvp agnps surface with the additions of ha or bsa was evident from the change inζ potential fig 1 a it was observed that the absolute value of ζ potential of pvp agnps was reduced by bsa from 11 8 to 6 72 mv in the presence of ca and mg and from 16 1 to 9 9 mv in the absence of ca and mg which implied the coating of protein then it gradually reverted to the original value with the addition of ha furthermore the amounts of bsa adsorbed on the pvp agnps under different ha concentrations were revealed through sds page fig 1 c it was found that even a small addition of ha could remarkably decrease the adsorption amounts of bsa in the freshwater media which was consistent with the trend exhibited by the ζ potential then the destruction of protein coating induced by ha in freshwater was also confirmed by tem fig 2 a c as shown in fig 2 b the formation of protein coating was clearly visible then we further calculated the theoretic thickness of bsa coating based on the absorbed amounts of bsa molecules per particle table s2 bsa molecule was assumed as a solid equilateral triangle with 8 4 nm edge length and a thickness of 3 2 nm ferrer et al 2001 therefore volume of single bsa molecule could be estimated furthermore it was supposed that absorbed bsa molecules accumulated together compactly eventually the theoretic thickness of bsa on pvp agnps was calculated which was 9 14 nm in freshwater and 3 34 nm in seawater it was found that the theoretic thickness of bsa in freshwater exceeded the maximum thickness 8 4 nm of monomolecular adsorption layer therefore multilayer adsorption of bsa should occur which was also observed in tem image however the protein coating completely disappeared with the addition of ha 150 mg l as shown in fig 2 c the above results indicate that in the artificial freshwater i there may be an adsorption competition on the surface of pvp agnps between ha and bsa or ii ha may form a complex with bsa to reduce the adsorption ability of bsa however it can be seen from fig 1 c that a fair amount of bsa was retained on the surface even with the addition of 150 mg l ha in the artificial seawater which was also supported by tem images fig 2 d f interestingly as shown in fig 1 c a decreasing trend of adsorbed bsa amounts decrease by 70 according to band intensity data not shown was observed in the presence of ca and mg likely due to the aggregation of pvp agnps as shown in fig 2 f and fig 1 b which reduced the available surface for protein adsorption furthermore whether in artificial freshwater or seawater the presence of bsa reduced the r h of pvp agnps by facilitating the dispersion of nanoparticles raw dls data is provided in supplementary material fig s3 maccuspie 2010 then the addition of ha slightly enhanced the r h of pvp agnps suspended without ca2 and mg2 while the r h of nps remarkably increased at the ha concentration of 150 mg l in the presence of ca2 and mg2 the presence of ca2 or mg2 can always induce intermolecular bridging for nom molecules lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 metreveli et al 2016 suggesting that a co adsorption of ha occurred on the surface of pvp agnps which resulted in the aggregation of nps the macromolecules adsorbed on the pvp agnps were then semi quantitatively determined using the fluorescent label fitc as shown in fig 3 the characteristic fluorescence peak of fitc ex at 495 nm was observed which suggested that the fluorescence probe was successfully attached to the surface though relative weak fluorescence signal was also observed for the pristine pvp capped agnps either in freshwater or seawater xia et al 2012 reported that no interaction was observed between pvp and fitc therefore it was inferred that the background fluorescence might stem from the adsorption of fitc on the ultrafiltration membrane in addition fluorescence signal of bare agnps 50 mg l in ultrapure water was also detected and it was confirmed that the original agnps could not cause significant fluorescence supplementary material fig s4 in the freshwater compared with the original agnps the pvp agnps incubated with bsa exhibited a much higher fluorescence intensity at ex 495 nm which should be due to the large amount of adsorbed bsa then the fluorescence signal of pvp agnps incubated in the presence of bsa increased with ha concentration however the adsorbed bsa amounts dramatically decreased with higher ha concentrations fig 1 c which suggested that the increased signal was induced by the adsorbed ha furthermore the fluorescence signal of pvp agnps incubated in 100 mg l ha was higher than that of pvp agnps incubated in a mixture of 100 mg l ha and 100 mg l bsa therefore it could be concluded that the coexistence of bsa and ha in freshwater not only decreases the adsorbed amounts of bsa on the pvp agnps but also reduces the adsorption of ha similarly we can conclude that the adsorption of ha also occurred in the seawater in the presence of bsa fig 3 but no evidence was found to verify that bsa affects the adsorption of ha 3 2 mechanism of the coating formation under the coexistence of ha and bsa although it was observed that bsa was absorbed on pvp agnps in both freshwater and seawater media the binding mechanism is still unclear firstly it was concerned that whether if the pvp layer played a key role in the interaction between bsa and agnps many studies have reported that pvp could strongly inhibit the adsorption of bsa yuan et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 wang et al 2012 zhu et al 2011 particularly yuan et al 2016 found that polyurethane film grafted with pvp reduced the adsorption level of bsa by 93 4 compared with the unmodified polyurethane film and the mass ratio between bsa and pvp could be estimated 0 0022 in the present study the mass ratio of pvp to agnps was around 0 2 table s2 which suggested that the coating pvp might exhibit fairly low effect to the adsorption of bsa furthermore it has been reported that sulfur bearing residues like cysteine can form covalent bonds with heavy metals which may induce the formation of protein coating wang et al 2013 banerjee and das 2014 and sulfidation of pvp capped agnps has been observed in the presence of protein coating miclaus et al 2016 therefore we used iodoacetamide to alkylate the exposed sulfhydryl moiety of bsa to examine whether pvp agnps are attached to bsa through the thiol group r s h as shown in fig 4 a the alkylated bsa was almost unable to adsorb onto pvp agnps in freshwater however it retained its adsorption ability in seawater this result strongly indicates that bsa attached to pvp agnps only through the thiol group of bsa in freshwater but it is still uncertain if bsa could bind with pvp agnps through disulfides in seawater as both r s h and r s s r groups can form covalent bonds with metals wang et al 2013 nevertheless the eds spectra of pvp agnps suggested that ag s bond through r s s r group might also play an important role for protein adsorption in seawater supplementary material fig s5 and table s3 as the atomic ratios of s ag dramatically increased for pvp agnps incubated with bsa the mechanism by which ha influences the coating formation was further analyzed firstly possible interactions between bsa and ha under different environmental conditions were studied by using itc which is commonly used to characterize intermolecular interactions li et al 2015 dubey et al 2017 basu and kumar 2016 the thermodynamic parameters of intermolecular interactions such as the binding constant enthalpy changes and binding stoichiometry can be calculated based on the molar concentrations of both molecules for data fitting since ha is a complex mixture of acids containing carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups an average molecular weight of ha 3400 da her et al 2002 was adopted in addition it has been reviewed that humic substance and colloidal natural organic matter are likely aggregations of smaller molecules as revealed by high resolution mass spectrometry mopper et al 2007 considering the huge gap of molecular weight between ha and bsa ha would be treated as small molecular ligands in the following discussion as shown in fig 4 b a clear exothermic peak was observed after each injection in the freshwater and the data was fitted well by a one site binding process however in the seawater the non linear regression did not properly fit the data fig 4 c which may due to the inter protein interaction and lower exothermic heat in the high ionic strength scenario nonetheless the interaction was found to be exothermic which indicated that ha could combine with bsa whether in freshwater or seawater this binding process was also supported by the fluorescence quenching and electrophoretic mobility change of bsa resulting from its complexation with ha kobbero et al 2008 wang et al 2015 in the freshwater the binding constant was calculated to be 3 3 0 8 104 m 1 other calculated thermodynamic parameters are provided in table s4 which is fairly close to the binding constant of ha with human serum albumin 6 192 0 008 104 m 1 at 298 k with ionic strength 0 1 m ding et al 2011 furthermore the interaction was enthalpically favorable δh 0 but entropically unfavorable δs 0 which implied that the complexation process might be driven by h bonding or van der waals force ross and subramanian 1981 interestingly it has been reported that polyphenols can combine with bsa through hydrogen bonds which may form between the oh group and the polar groups at the bsa surface ozdal et al 2013 xiao et al 2008 therefore the abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups in ha may be responsible for the interaction between ha and bsa compared to the freshwater less protein injections were required to reach saturation for ha in the seawater which implied that less binding sites in bsa were available for ha in the seawater similarly sargin et al recently reported that protein adsorption on ha aggregates decreased at higher ionic strength sargin et al 2016 at a high ionic strength the hydrophobic interaction was preferred but the conformation of bsa was also altered yamasaki et al 1990 which may have resulted in the alteration of the interaction mode between bsa and ha from the above analysis it is clear that the mechanisms for binding between ha and bsa differed in freshwater and seawater however it is still not fully understood how ha affects the coating formation therefore a hanging mercury electrode was utilized to study changes in sulfur availability of bsa with the additions of ha in different media as the covalent bond formed by sulfur and ag significantly affects the coating formation due to the strong affinity between metal and reduced sulfur ligand sulfide compounds like cysteine or bsa can be tightly immobilized on the surface of the mercury electrode ravichandran 2004 fig 5 a it was found that the formed hg s bond induced a reduction peak around 0 6 v krznaric et al 2001 ostatna et al 2010 as observed in fig 5 b during the dpv measurement it was observed that the peak current increased linearly with the addition of bsa at a lower concentration and soon reached a plateau level when the bsa concentration exceeded 60 mg l the main reason for this behavior is likely the adsorption saturation of bsa on the electrode surface that restricted the formation of hg s bond moreover the plateau level of peak current in seawater 24 52 na was considerably lower than that in freshwater 40 15 na which suggested that the mercury pellet exhibited a higher adsorption capacity in the freshwater furthermore the addition of ha into the electrolyte induced a remarkable decrease in peak current decreased by 88 7 in freshwater and 47 4 in seawater respectively caused by bsa fig 5 b c a competition model might not explain this scenario because hg exhibits relatively weaker affinity for ha lgk ranging from 10 1 to 4 5 gismera et al 2007 compared to its binding affinity for organic sulfur lgk ranging from 25 to 32 ravichandran 2004 therefore as discussed with reference to itc measurements ha likely combined with bsa which reduced the availability of thiol or disulfide bond in bsa through the steric repulsion as shown in fig 5 c the 20 mg l ha solution caused almost complete loss of sulfur availability for 100 mg l bsa in freshwater however around 25 of sulfur availability remained for bsa in seawater with the same concentrations based on the previously discussed binding mechanism between pvp agnps and bsa it is clear that the coating formation is strongly influenced by the steric repulsion induced by complexation of bsa with ha which prevents the contact between sulfur in bsa and the pvp agnps surface 3 3 toxicity effect of the nano surface under the coexistence of ha and bsa in this study the intracellular ros levels generated by e coli exposed to various ha bsa concentrations were measured to assess the toxicity of the incubated pvp agnps complexed with bsa ha as it has been previously reported that ros formation strongly affects the toxicity of agnps duran et al 2015 moreover divalent cations such as ca2 or mg2 may help to generate substantial hydrophobic interactions for proteins wu et al 2012 or promote the intermolecular interactions through cation bridging lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 metreveli et al 2016 therefore a control group without ca2 and mg2 was also evaluated to identify the role of these divalent cations in the toxicity tests as shown in fig 6 a compared with the control both ha and bsa affected the ros level of e coli to some extent however this effect was much weaker than that induced by pvp agnps nevertheless it was observed that bsa could increase ros level in seawater but had no effect in freshwater moreover after ha addition bsa decreased the ros level in freshwater but showed the opposite effect in seawater taken together with the previous discussions such differences in the interaction mechanisms of ha might be ascribed to the change in binding mechanism or surface functional groups as indicated by itc and dpv measurements furthermore the protein coating clearly influences the effect of ca2 and mg2 on the pvp agnps in the freshwater the presence of ca2 and mg2 had no effect on the ros level induced by agnps bsa complex while these ions increased the ros level for the incubated pvp agnps that lacked the protein coating fig 1 c in contrast in the seawater the two divalent cations significantly elevated the ros level for the pvp agnps with protein coating however they did not have any effect on the pvp agnps incubated in ha or pure seawater moreover in the normal seawater although the pvp agnps incubated in bsa and ha adsorbed almost the same amounts of bsa their ros levels tended to decrease when the adsorption of ha increased obviously the pvp agnps incubated in ha exhibited no apparent difference in toxicity compared with the original agnps while the pvp agnps with protein coating differed considerably from the original agnps such a difference might be ascribed to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms of agnps kittler et al reported that bsa might inhibit the cytotoxicity of agnps through binding to silver kittler et al 2010 however other studies found that agnps or zno nanoparticles with bsa coating exhibited better antimicrobial activity wu et al 2014 martinez robles et al 2016 it has been reported that the toxic effects of agnps are likely due to silver ions being released by agnps but this phenomenon is not fully understood for small sized agnps foldbjerg et al 2015 the particulate ag could directly adhere to the cell wall and penetrate the cell membrane to induce toxicity morones et al 2005 therefore for agnps with bsa coating the presence of bsa may shield the reactive ag metal from dissolution martin et al 2014 and simultaneously promote the adhesion of agnps to the cell membrane martinez robles et al 2016 in this study silver ions released by pvp agnps in solution may exhibit relative smaller toxic effect compared with particle ag as both bsa and ha could inhibit the dissolution of agnps martin et al 2014 liu and hurt 2010 however no positive feedback was observed in the ros level fig 6 b and c therefore it was inferred that particle ag might be mainly responsible for the toxic effect due to its direct interaction with cell chwalibog et al 2010 in freshwater the protein coating could help pvp agnps preferentially adhere to the cell by hindering the electrostatic repulsion fig 1 a however the presence of ha disrupted the formation of the protein coating which made the surface of pvp agnps similar to that of the original agnps therefore the pvp agnps incubated in the presence of both ha and bsa behaved in a similar manner as those incubated in ha alone or pure freshwater fig 6 b the elevated ros level induced by ca2 and mg2 might be due to the surface potential change fig 1 a however in the seawater the electrostatic repulsion was strongly screened and the high ionic concentration of cl inhibited the release of ag ions metreveli et al 2016 foldbjerg et al 2015 consequently no increase in ros level was observed for the pvp agnps incubated in ha alone or pure seawater in the presence of ca2 and mg2 fig 6 c however it was found that the protein coating could significantly elevate the ros level in the presence of ca2 and mg2 it is speculated that ca2 and mg2 may increase the adhesion ability of pvp agnps to the cell through specific ion interactions as it has been reported that bsa exhibits greater hydrophobicity under high ionic strength and in the presence of ca2 ions wu et al 2012 in the seawater bsa retained its adsorption ability on pvp agnps with the addition of ha thus all the pvp agnps incubated in the presence of bsa behaved similarly when ca2 and mg2 were present nonetheless the co adsorption of ha could decrease the ros level induced by agnps bsa complex which might be due to its ability to scavenge free radicals 4 conclusions to summarize our results indicated that effect of ca2 and mg2 on the ros level of e coli induced by incubated pvp agnps was related to the coating on the surface which was previously influenced by the organic matter type for the two synthetic water the coating formation on surface exhibited two totally different ways one method was to disrupt the coating formation which occurred in the freshwater sample the other method was co adsorption of ha and bsa on the surface which occurred in the seawater sample moreover it was observed that the presence of heavy metal ions organic solvents or ultraviolet radiation in aquatic environments could also induce a change in the protein conformation as a result in some cases proteins may be tightly adsorbed on the surface without considering the presence of ha it is suggested that the protein coated nps might exhibit a totally different behavior compared with ha coated nps therefore our results underline the importance of studying interactions between ha and proteins under different conditions to obtain a more authentic understanding of the transformation of nps in the natural environments acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51290283

19604,we combined profiling of the bloom forming and potentially toxigenic cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens using a multiparameter probe equipped with a phycoerythrin sensor in vivo fluorometry ivl in lake mondsee austria with flow cytometric live analyses of discrete samples taken from several depths in the upper 20 m of the water column results obtained by ivl and acoustic flow cytometry afc were compared to microscopic analyses of integrated 0 21 m water samples using fixed material this comparison was made because the integrated samples are used for the austrian monitoring programme according to the eu water framework directive we demonstrate that afc provides quantitative analyses of the filaments of p rubescens that are significantly correlated to ivf and microscopic analyses allowing rapid within hours and more precise calculation of p rubescens biomass than estimates derived from ivl our analysis shows that vertically integrated water samples provide unreliable information on the concentration of p rubescens in the upper surface waters and on the peak concentration of p rubescens within the water column we conclude that the protocol that we developed is

2012 the phycoerythrin rich dull red filamentous cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens de candolle ex gomont anagnostidis and komárek 1988 formerly known as oscillatoria rubescens is distributed

usa chorus et al 2000 guellati et al 2017 kurmayer et al 2016 nürnberg et al 2003 this species produces several secondary metabolites of which the cyclic hepatotoxic heptapeptide microcystin lr is of special importance the world health organization who set a provisional guideline value of 1 μg l for microcystin lr in drinking water who 1998 a value that has been widely used as the basis for national standards in many countries on all continents ibelings et al 2014 but is often surpassed in toxic outbreaks of p rubescens in lakes kurmayer et al 2016 therefore rapid detection and quantification of p rubescens is crucial to evaluate potential risks connected with the exploitation of contaminated waters used for drinking recreation and irrigation purposes kurmayer et al 2017 manganelli et al 2010 cyanobacterial concentrations can be determined directly through microscopic examination and enumeration or indirectly through the measurement of the concentrations of

important indicator species for ecological status assessments bergkemper and weisse 2017a for instance six fold higher p rubescens biomass in 2015 than in 2014 led to downgrading of the ecological

limited diagnostic dna microarrays dna chips reviewed by humbert et al 2010 enable detection of cyanobacterial species and hepatotoxin encoding genes their detection limit has been determined by qpcr rantala et al 2008 in eiler s et al 2013 study ngs and microscopy taxa lists had low taxonomic correspondence probably reflecting methodological constraints of the pcr approach and discrepancies in taxonomic frameworks a hybrid technique consists of identifying and counting filaments of p rubescens and colonies of other cyanobacteria microscopically and then analysing the samples by pcr based methods for their toxin production kurmayer et al 2017 in the near future quantitative molecular tools should allow efficient surveillance of recreational waters and drinking water supplies cyanobacteria can be easily detected by in vivo fluorometry ivf with phycocyanin pc and phycoerythrin pe blue green algae sensors however these single or multiple wavelengths sensors do not quantify cell abundance and biomass in absolute terms but supply relative data on the biomass and pigment content of cyanobacteria based upon calibration using selected strains in the laboratory the fluorescence signals can be converted to cyanobacterial cell numbers and biomass this approach is useful to detect hidden peaks that are not visible from the lake surface and cannot be detected by remote sensing techniques hofmann and peeters 2013 of p rubescens that are usually located at low irradiance within the metalimnion or upper hypolimnion in north american and european lakes during

most bench top cytometers such as the afc that we used in situ flow cytometers such as cytobuoy dubelaar et al 1999 have already been used to detect phytoplankton including p rubescens pomati et al 2011 2013 with our routine instrument settings i e a sample volume of 0 5 ml analysed at a flow rate of 0 1 ml min 1 we measured 10 11 live samples per h although we analysed replicate samples at low p rubescens levels 10 103 filaments l 1 samples taken from 5 to 7 discrete depths of the upper 20 m of the water column could be measured within less than 3 h after sampling results for characteristic phytoplankton populations such as p rubescens that can be identified unequivocally without further processing are available immediately after afc measurements the time needed to analyse 10 samples quantitatively for other phytoplankton populations such as those shown in fig 1 was close to 1 h this was easily achieved by automatic gating using flowjo in summary our protocol is closer to ideal real time monitoring of p rubescens than competing techniques discussed in the next section we converted the flow cytometric signal to biovolume a proxy of biomass because this unit is usually used to assess the significance of p rubescens relative to other phytoplankton since biovolume is calculated from the average cell respectively filament length and width cell numbers can be easily converted

afc yielded a more accurate estimate of the p rubescens biovolume than the pe sensor fig 5 vertically integrated water samples e g 0 21 m in l mondsee used in the european water monitoring programmes provide unreliable information on the concentration of p rubescens in the upper surface waters and on the peak concentration of p rubescens within the water column profiling from the surface to the upper hypolimnion with ivl sensors and the subsequent data analysis takes less than 1 h but converting pe rfu data to p rubescens biovolume is imprecise fig 5b and discussion below therefore the extra effort of collecting water samples from several depths including the depth of the p rubescens maximum and performing afc analyses of those samples is well justified the gates used for unequivocal detection of the p rubescens population and other phytoplankton depend on the instrument settings i e gates are specific for each flow cytometer however the criteria used to identify a target population apply to all flow cytometers since the fluorescence i e chl a and pe fsc and ssc signals of the p rubescens filaments are all orders of magnitudes stronger than those of smaller single celled and colonial algae p rubescens can be detected with many other flow cytometers that are less sensitive than the afc used in the present study if the goal is to quantify only p rubescens the sample volume can be increased to detect filaments even at very low 5 103 l 1 concentrations however in areas of concern such as recreational waters or drinking water supplies where blooms of p rubescens may prevent further use of the water for the respective purpose kurmayer et al 2016 filaments can be measured in even smaller sample volumes if their concentration is 100 ml 1 corresponding to approximately 20 000 cells ml 1 this cell density has been identified by the who 2003 as threshold for moderate probability of acute health effects epa 2017 we analysed unfixed unstained p

cytometric measurements in logarithmic mode should span at least 6 decades fig 1a if live analyses are not feasible aldehyde fixed samples can be conducted with the afc used in the present study and other flow cytometers pomati et al 2013 poulton 2016 however we prefer live analyses because some algae are sensitive to fixation and preservation bergkemper and weisse 2017a we do not recommend to

alternative optical techniques several flow through and submersible in situ fluorometric probes have been developed and used by water authorities and researchers for real time monitoring of cyanobacterial populations reviewed by zamyadi et al 2016 for instance multi fluorescence probes such as the submersible fluoroprobe fp bbe moldaenke gmbh kiel germany have been applied in several lakes to quantify the biovolume of p rubescens garneau et al 2015 jacquet et al 2014 leboulanger et al 2002 based upon differences in fluorescence excitation spectra of accessory pigments the fp can differentiate between four major phytoplankton groups however this device requires calibration with laboratory cultures and proper calibration of the probe is a major challenge for its accurate application kring et al 2014 zamyadi et al 2016 the fp yielded reliable estimates of the p rubescens biovolume in lakes such as l bourget jacquet et al 2014 leboulanger et al 2002 and l zurich garneau et al 2015 posch et al 2012 in which this species constituted approximately half of the total phytoplankton biovolume ostermaier and kurmayer 2009 nevertheless a distinction between p rubescens and cryptophytes which have nearly identical fluorescence fingerprints when excited with the fp was unreliable and associated with very large errors in the abundance estimates of the respective species hofmann and peeters 2013 by combining fp detection with in situ hydroacoustics these authors were able to detect and quantify p rubescens accurately in prealpine lake ammer germany in lake mondsee cryptophytes contribute significantly to total phytoplankton biovolume not only in the epilimnion but also at the depths of the p rubescens peak bergkemper and weisse 2017b dokulil and teubner 2012 their presence affects the pe fluorescence signal of the ysi 6600 v2 probe used in the present study fig 4 thus biasing estimates of the p rubescens biovolume based upon the fp probe a major drawback of the fp and other in situ systems including ysi 6600 probe is that they cannot distinguish between species of cyanobacteria and therefore require verification by time consuming microscopy zamyadi et al 2016 however if fluorometric probes are combined with imaging cytometry reviewed by hildebrand et al 2016 and the instrument settings are optimized for filamentous cyanobacteria assessing p rubescens biovolume in near real time should be possible we use a flowcam fluid imaging technology yarmouth me usa imaging cytometer in our laboratory to analyse the phytoplankton community in lake mondsee and elsewhere bergkemper and weisse 2017b the instrument detects p rubescens filaments and provides estimates of their length and width which can be converted easily to biovolume with the current instrument settings i e using the 80 μm wide fc80fv flow cell and a 1 ml syringe we have to prefilter the phytoplankton samples through a 200 μm mesh to prevent clogging bergkemper and weisse 2017b which precludes precise quantification of large filaments in the future we will use a larger flow cell e g fc300 in combination with a 5 ml syringe and test if p rubescens can be quantified accurately with this instrument a general disadvantage of the advanced optical techniques including afc is that they need expensive equipment a caveat that also holds for the molecular approaches for lake monitoring with the primary goals to quantify the cyanobacterial and total phytoplankton species composition and biomass the optical methods are superior to currently available dna based analyses the latter have a larger potential for use as early warning systems to detect toxigenic cyanobacterial strains and identify potential health risks in recreational water and drinking water supplies 5 conclusions we combined profiling of the environmentally hazardous cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens using in vivo fluorometry ivf in a deep lake with live unstained analyses of phytoplankton samples by acoustic flow cytometry afc our main conclusions are that afc provides quantitative analyses of the filaments of p rubescens that are significantly correlated to ivf and microscopic analyses afc yields rapid within hours and precise calculation of p rubescens biovolume that is superior to estimates derived from ivl the combination of ivf with flow cytometry is a powerful and cost efficient tool to detect and quantify peaks of p rubescens in deep water layers and elsewhere acknowledgements we thank barbara kammerlander xiaoteng lu peter stadler and ulrike scheffel for technical

19604,we combined profiling of the bloom forming and potentially toxigenic cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens using a multiparameter probe equipped with a phycoerythrin sensor in vivo fluorometry ivl in lake mondsee austria with flow cytometric live analyses of discrete samples taken from several depths in the upper 20 m of the water column results obtained by ivl and acoustic flow cytometry afc were compared to microscopic analyses of integrated 0 21 m water samples using fixed material this comparison was made because the integrated samples are used for the austrian monitoring programme according to the eu water framework directive we demonstrate that afc provides quantitative analyses of the filaments of p rubescens that are significantly correlated to ivf and microscopic analyses allowing rapid within hours and more precise calculation of p rubescens biomass than estimates derived from ivl our analysis shows that vertically integrated water samples provide unreliable information on the concentration of p rubescens in the upper surface waters and on the peak concentration of p rubescens within the water column we conclude that the protocol that we developed is superior to the current monitoring practice graphical abstract image 1 keywords acoustic flow cytometry cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms in vivo fluorometry lakes planktothrix rubescens 1 introduction toxigenic cyanobacteria often dominate the eukaryotic beneficial algae in eutrophic waters worldwide forming cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms cyanohabs carmichael 2001 paerl and paul 2012 the phycoerythrin rich dull red filamentous cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens de candolle ex gomont anagnostidis and komárek 1988 formerly known as oscillatoria rubescens is distributed globally in oligotrophic to eutrophic freshwater lakes and reservoirs guiry and guiry 2017 toxic strains of p rubescens were reported from central europe scandinavia china north africa canada and the usa chorus et al 2000 guellati et al 2017 kurmayer et al 2016 nürnberg et al 2003 this species produces several secondary metabolites of which the cyclic hepatotoxic heptapeptide microcystin lr is of special importance the world health organization who set a provisional guideline value of 1 μg l for microcystin lr in drinking water who 1998 a value that has been widely used as the basis for national standards in many countries on all continents ibelings et al 2014 but is often surpassed in toxic outbreaks of p rubescens in lakes kurmayer et al 2016 therefore rapid detection and quantification of p rubescens is crucial to evaluate potential risks connected with the exploitation of contaminated waters used for drinking recreation and irrigation purposes kurmayer et al 2017 manganelli et al 2010 cyanobacterial concentrations can be determined directly through microscopic examination and enumeration or indirectly through the measurement of the concentrations of constituent pigments such as chlorophyll a chl a and phycocyanin newcombe 2009 because microcystin concentrations are directly related to cyanobacterial cell density and biomass kurmayer et al 2016 the who established guidelines for health risk originating from cyanobacterial cell levels in recreational waters who 2003 and several us states e g connecticut indiana kentucky oklahoma utah wisconsin use them for their swimming advisory level epa 2017 within monitoring programmes phytoplankton including p rubescens is usually analysed by the traditional utermöhl method from lugols s fixed samples using inverted microscopy utermöhl 1958 or by microscopic counting after filtration of a known sample volume onto membrane filters manganelli et al 2010 newcombe 2009 monitoring programmes such as those according to the eu water framework directive wfd require assessment of p rubescens biomass biovolume relative to that of the other phytoplankton taxa because it is an important indicator species for ecological status assessments bergkemper and weisse 2017a for instance six fold higher p rubescens biomass in 2015 than in 2014 led to downgrading of the ecological status of prealpine lake mondsee austria from high to good schafferer and pfister 2015 novel molecular techniques such as quantitative real time pcr or qpcr ostermaier and kurmayer 2010 zamyadi et al 2016 and next generation sequencing ngs eiler et al 2013 allow detection and semi quantification of p rubescens ramos et al 2017 but the application of these tools by monitoring agencies has been limited diagnostic dna microarrays dna chips reviewed by humbert et al 2010 enable detection of cyanobacterial species and hepatotoxin encoding genes their detection limit has been determined by qpcr rantala et al 2008 in eiler s et al 2013 study ngs and microscopy taxa lists had low taxonomic correspondence probably reflecting methodological constraints of the pcr approach and discrepancies in taxonomic frameworks a hybrid technique consists of identifying and counting filaments of p rubescens and colonies of other cyanobacteria microscopically and then analysing the samples by pcr based methods for their toxin production kurmayer et al 2017 in the near future quantitative molecular tools should allow efficient surveillance of recreational waters and drinking water supplies cyanobacteria can be easily detected by in vivo fluorometry ivf with phycocyanin pc and phycoerythrin pe blue green algae sensors however these single or multiple wavelengths sensors do not quantify cell abundance and biomass in absolute terms but supply relative data on the biomass and pigment content of cyanobacteria based upon calibration using selected strains in the laboratory the fluorescence signals can be converted to cyanobacterial cell numbers and biomass this approach is useful to detect hidden peaks that are not visible from the lake surface and cannot be detected by remote sensing techniques hofmann and peeters 2013 of p rubescens that are usually located at low irradiance within the metalimnion or upper hypolimnion in north american and european lakes during summer stratification halstvedt et al 2007 and references therein we combined profiling of p rubescens using a pe sensor in a multiparameter probe with live analyses using acoustic flow cytometry afc from several discrete depths 0 20 m in lake mondsee austria results obtained by ivl and acoustic flow cytometry afc were compared to microscopic analyses of integrated 0 21 m water samples using fixed

filaments of p rubescens that are significantly correlated to ivf data and microscopic analyses allowing rapid and cost efficient calculation of p rubescens cell numbers and biomass in deep water

of the fp and other in situ systems including ysi 6600 probe is that they cannot distinguish between species of cyanobacteria and therefore require verification by time consuming microscopy zamyadi et al 2016 however if fluorometric probes are combined with imaging cytometry reviewed by hildebrand et al 2016 and the instrument settings are optimized for filamentous cyanobacteria assessing p rubescens biovolume in near real time should be possible we use a flowcam fluid imaging technology yarmouth me usa imaging cytometer in our laboratory to analyse the phytoplankton community in lake mondsee and elsewhere bergkemper and weisse 2017b the instrument detects p rubescens filaments and provides estimates of their length and width which can be converted easily to biovolume with the current instrument settings i e using the 80 μm wide fc80fv flow cell and a 1 ml syringe we have to prefilter the phytoplankton samples through a 200 μm mesh to prevent clogging bergkemper and weisse 2017b which precludes precise quantification of large filaments in the future we will use a larger flow cell e g fc300 in combination with a 5 ml syringe and test if p rubescens can be quantified accurately with this instrument a general disadvantage of the advanced optical techniques including afc is that they need expensive equipment a caveat that also holds for the molecular approaches for lake monitoring with the primary goals to quantify the cyanobacterial and total phytoplankton species composition and biomass the optical methods are superior to currently available dna based analyses the latter have a larger potential for use as early warning systems to detect toxigenic cyanobacterial strains and identify potential health risks in recreational water and drinking water supplies 5 conclusions we combined profiling of the environmentally hazardous cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens using in vivo fluorometry ivf in a deep lake with live unstained analyses of phytoplankton samples by acoustic flow cytometry afc our main conclusions are that afc provides quantitative analyses of the filaments of p rubescens that are significantly correlated to ivf and microscopic analyses afc yields rapid within hours and precise calculation of p rubescens biovolume that is superior to estimates derived from ivl the combination of ivf with flow cytometry is a powerful and cost efficient tool to detect and quantify peaks of p rubescens in deep water layers and elsewhere acknowledgements we thank barbara kammerlander xiaoteng lu peter stadler and ulrike scheffel for technical
