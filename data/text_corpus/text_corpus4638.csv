23190,this paper experimentally investigates the performances of two bottom hinged flap wave energy converters bhf wecs operating in tandem firstly the inertia effects of a single bhf wec operating in isolation are theoretically and experimentally examined to show their negligibility in coastal water applications with the non dimensional wave number o 1 experiments of two in tandem bhf wecs with separation distance d varing from 0 5λ to λ incident wavelength with increment of λ 16 are then conducted in a small wave basin hydraulic pumps are used as the power take off and their forcing characteristics as an energy damper are determined using a rating platform time series images of flapping motions of the bhf wecs recorded with high speed cameras are analyzed using a processing and analysis procedure based on the correlation algorithm to evaluate their capture factors cf the cf variations of the first bhf wec with d exhibit a sinusoidal wave form with wavelength of λ 2 the combined cf of the two in tandem bhf wecs is always greater than 1 0 indicating that the wave energy outside the frontal area is drawn via diffraction it reaches the maximum at around d 14λ 16 with λ 4 apart from the minimum at around d 9λ 16 owing to the underlying mechanism of the bragg reflection graphical abstract image 1 keywords bottom hinged flap wave energy converter high speed imaging capture factor in tandem diffraction effect bragg reflection 1 introduction in coming decades the world wide concerns on global warming and expected peaks of reserves of conventional energy such as petroleum have resulted in wide and serious pursues of alternative energy solutions especially the renewable energy marine energy usually referred to as the combination of mainly wave energy tidal energy and ocean current energy is quite promising in its tremendous potentials renewability and zero carbon emissions wave energy being commonly regarded as the one with the largest potential one among marine energy resources ocean energy technology overview 2009 has particularly attracted many attentions and resulted in promoted developments of numerous types of wave energy converter wec so far there have been hundreds of patents granted world widely for wec s designs and inventions and related sub system improvements trend analysis on technology development of ocean wave energy 2009 those proposed inventions can generally be classified into several categories based on the wave dynamic features and power take off mechanism detailed reviews on device developments can be referred to e g falcão 2010 for the past decades devices inspired by the concepts of oscillating water column point absorbing and bottom hinged pitching were mostly developed with different wave device interaction characteristics among them a bottom hinged flap wec bhf wec oscillating in the wave surge direction categorized as the oscillating wave surge converter owsc has particularly in last decade been adopted folley et al 2007a and successfully resulted in designing and manufacturing several prototype wecs e g aquamarine power ltd s oyster whittaker and folley 2012 and aw energy s waveroller aw energy 2012 the bhf wec concept has advantages such as quite efficient power conversion babarit 2015 easy accessibility in nearshore waters folley et al 2007b and retract ability to submerge by folding the flap panel toward the sea bed to survive in the impact of extreme waves caused by extreme weather events e g typhoons in this regard the bhf wec is quite ideal for harvesting wave energy in the typhoon wave active near shore waters around taiwan therefore the authors were initially motivated to theoretically and numerically study the performance of a single 2d bhf wec chang et al 2015 we had preliminarily confirmed that the relations among the so called mechanical impedances are the key factors to the energy capture cf tom et al 2017 furthermore multiple wecs forming a modular or array are considered to have potential in exploiting wave energy with higher efficiency e g wilkinson et al 2017 renzi and dias 2012a b individual wecs in an array could interact with one another and thus behave differently than a single isolated wec does as a result this so called array interaction has gradually become an important issue for wave energy exploitation budal 1977 falnes 1980 and evans 1980 were the pioneers in studying the array problem of the point absorber type e g buoy for the array problem of bhf wec renzi and dias 2012a b theoretically analyzed an in line array configuration and found that high capture factors can be attained when the system is in resonance of transverse modes in order to elucidate the interaction mechanism two wecs in tandem operations as the simplest array form needs further studies srokosz and evans 1979 extends evans theory 1976 to the case of two independently oscillating 2d cylinders in tandem theoretically these two cylinders are capable of absorbing all the incident wave energy at a special condition away from their resonances at which they can only absorb very little energy scher et al 1983 and wilke 1984 conducted a 2d model test in a wave flume with two in tandem vertical panels oscillating in pure sway linear motions and compared the results with the theoretical predictions shown in srokosz and evans 1979 however few attentions have been paid to the performances of two 3d bhf wecs operating in tandem for wec performance evaluations numerical modellings have been generally acknowledged to be one of the powerful tools li and yu 2012 had reviewed different numerical schemes for a single heaving device folley 2016 had further comprehensively reviewed the state of the art numerical modeling for single devices of various concepts and arrays of heaving modes particularly on non linear viscous damping yu and li 2013 conducted successful rans simulations for a two body floating point absorber wave energy system and showed significant influences on the performance of a wec system by incorporating the drag damping force term bhinder et al 2015 compared the potential time domain viscous ptdv model with the cfd model with respect to a surging floating wec and found a good agreement for regular wave conditions so far in tandem bottom hinged owscs and associated effects of non linear viscous damping have not been reported possibly due to complicated interaction mechanism and computation thus experimental studies with real fluids might help shed lights on critical issues to facilitate the developments of numerical modeling this paper first experimentally examines the inertial effects of the mechanical impedances on a single bhf wec with a physical model having two hydraulic pumps as its pto and a mechanism of tunable inertia we especially focus on the impedances formed owing to the wave and the flap this experiment is conducted with an image based measurement with high speed imaging which is incorporated with the hydrodynamic theory for bhf wec developed by chang et al 2015 to form a robust experimental procedure then another image based methodology to evaluate the performance of wave energy capture capture factor cf is developed with the same high speed imaging after that we experimentally investigate the capture factors of two identical bhf wec models operating in tandem under a specific wave condition associated with the wave climates of taiwan as the separation distances between the two bhf wecs varied from λ 2 to λ incident wavelength with increment of λ 16 and an additional test with a value slightly larger than λ the corresponding oscillating motions of the bhf wecs are measured using two high speed cameras the final results show the performance characteristics of bhf wecs operating in tandem and an optimum separation distance in terms of λ 2 experimental setup and measurement technique 2 1 theory of image based measurement for bhf wec the schematic of a 2d bhf wec interacting with incident waves with frequency σ and wave number k i is shown in fig 1 and σ and k i are related in the dispersion relation σ 2 g k i tanh k i h where h is the water depth and g the acceleration of gravity the symbol s z denotes the horizontal stroke of the flap s motion at z coordinates and the flap pivots on o in fig 1 z 0 means the still water surface and ρ is the water density the damping coefficient of the pto system is denoted as f o and l is the lever arm of the pto s force with fig 1 chang et al 2015 used formulations similar to the 2d linear wavemaker theory dean and dalrymple 1991 and obtained the relationship between the angular stroke θ s and the incident wave height h as 1 θ s h w 1 p 3 2 w 2 f 1 f 2 p 1 p 2 2 and the formula for the theoretical cf of bhf wec as 2 cf e f o e i 2 w 1 p 3 w 1 p 3 2 w 2 f 1 f 2 p 1 p 2 2 where e f o and ei denote the energy taken off by the bhf wec s pto and the incident wave energy in one wave period respectively in eqs 1 and 2 w1 and w2 f1 and f2 and p1 p2 and p3 are the 2d non dimensional mechanical impedances formed respectively because of the wave the flap and the pto as described below the impedance w1 is formed owing to the waves radiated from the bhf wec and represents the effect of wave damping i e radiation damping effect as shown in eq 3 3 w 1 1 0 1 z 2 cosh k i 1 z d z 2 k i 1 0 cosh 2 k i 1 z d z k i sinh k i cosh k i 1 2 k i 4 2 k i sinh 2 k i where z z h and k i k i h the integrals in eq 3 correspond to that of the amplitude of the progressive wave potential generated by the flap type wavemaker dean and dalrymple 1991 the impedance w2 is formed owing to the standing waves that represents the effect of wave inertia i e added mass effect as shown in eq 4 4 w 2 n 1 1 0 1 z 2 cos k s n 1 z d z 2 k s n 1 0 cos 2 k s n 1 z d z n 1 k s n sin k s n cos k s n 1 2 k s n 4 2 k s n sin 2 k s n where k s n k s n h and k s n is the nth positive root to the equation 5 σ 2 g k s n tan k s n h the series of integrals in eq 4 correspond to that of the amplitudes of the standing wave potentials generated owing to the differences between the motion of the flap and the fluid motion induced by the progressive wave the formations of these integrals in eqs 3 and 4 follow the sturm liouville theory as pointed out by dean and dalrymple 1991 the impedances formed owing to the flap are f1 and f2 and 6 f 1 m g o m m b g o b 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 7 f 2 i σ 2 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 i 8 ρ h 4 where m m b and i denote the mass the mass of water displacement and the moment of inertia about the hinge o of the flap per unit width respectively and o m and o m denote the distances between the hinge o and the centers of mass and buoyancy of the flap respectively the term m g o m m b g o b in eq 6 indicates the maximum restoring moment experienced by the flap when it is negative i e m g o m m b g o b the impedance f2 represents the effect of the flap body s inertia the last three impedances p1 p2 and p3 are due to the pto as follows 8 p 1 k pto h 2 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 k pto 8 ρ σ 2 h 2 p 2 i pto σ 2 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 i pto 8 ρ h 4 9 p 3 l 2 f o σ h 2 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 l 2 f o 8 ρ σ h 2 where k pto denotes the stiffness per unit width of the pto i pto the moment of inertia per unit width of the pto about the hinge o and l l h in this paper hydraulic pumps are used as the pto of the wec model since hydraulic pump is a device used to overcome the viscous resistance associated with fluid flows to achieve fluid pumping it is evident that the dominant hydrodynamic impedance associated with hydraulic pump should be p3 i e pto s damping related impedance therefore p1 and p2 respectively due to the stiffness and the inertia of the pto can be neglected as compared to p3 furthermore the hydraulic pumps used in the experiment are small size and light weight as compared to the flap body dictating that p1 and p2 are also much smaller than the impedances associated with the flap body such as f1 and f2 in other cases however the stiffness and the inertia of the pto may need to be considered e g babarit et al 2012 therefore p1 and p2 are to be neglected in the following analyses in this paper i e w 2 f 1 f 2 p 1 p 2 w 2 f 1 f 2 as shown in eq 2 the formula for the theoretical cf indicate two necessary conditions to attain the maximum cf value cfmax 0 5 which is consistent with the previous results shown by evans 1976 and mei 1976 one of the two conditions is to match the damping impedances of the wave and the pto i e w 1 p3 the other is to make the impedance of the restoring moment experienced by the flap cancel the impedances other than w1 and p3 i e 10 w 2 f 1 f 2 0 due to the fact that w2 and f2 are always positive eqs 4 and 7 f1 needs to be negative in order to cancel w2 f2 i e m g o m m b g o b to form a restoring moment eq 6 as a result o m o b and or m m b i e the density of the flap is smaller than that of water can be used as a guideline for designing the flap another situation where w2 f1 f2 can be neglected is that w2 f1 and f2 are much smaller than w1 or p3 due to the fact that bhf wecs are in nature a coastal water application i e the wave condition k i o 1 applies therefore 11 sinh k i k i tanh k i k i cosh k i 1 1 2 k i 2 then w1 can be approximated with eqs 3 and 11 as 12 w 1 k i sinh k i cosh k i 1 2 k i 4 2 k i sinh 2 k i k i k i 1 1 2 k i 2 1 2 k i 4 2 k i 2 k i 1 16 k i 1 o 10 1 for estimating w2 we first substitute eq 1 into eq 5 to eliminate σ 2 and use eq 11 to obtain 13 k i 2 k s n tan k s n it can be shown that n 1 2 π k s n n π and k s n should be much closer to n π than to n 1 2 π since k i is only on the order of 1 taking the leading term n 1 in eq 4 k s 1 can be first estimated to be around 0 9 π using eq 13 and then substituted into eq 4 for calculating the leading term it finally shows that 14 w 2 4 0 10 3 o 10 3 for estimating f1 and f2 eqs 6 and 7 respectively we first approximate the flap as a rectangular uniform plate with o m and o b equal to about 0 5 h in practice the flap s mass m is about 0 5mb and thickness about 0 2 h since σ 2 g k i 2 h 1 using eq 1 with k i o 1 then 15 f 1 m g o m m b g o b 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 0 5 0 2 ρ h 2 g 0

condition according to the previous analysis based on the 2d bhf wec theory this theoretical result and the assumption based on it i e w2 f1 f2 being neglected will be validated experimentally as follows 2 2 bhf wec model in this study two identical bhf wec models are built for the experiments as fig 2 shows their schematic the flap panel has a movable platform inside on which metal weights plates can be added and stacked to change the mass of the flap the movable platform is achieved by installing a linear motion system composed mainly of a stepper motor a lead screw and two supporting rails the up and down translation motion of the platform can be controlled by commanding the stepper motor controller as the position of the platform changes so the mass center and hence the moment of inertia of the flap change i e f1 and f2 can be altered for experimental purposes the width height and thickness of the flap panel are respectively 0 5 m 0 55 m and 0 1 m two identical hydraulic pumps are used as the pto system each pump has two water inlet outlet orifices connected with a close loop tubing and check valves as the wave force acts on the flap panel to make it oscillate the hydraulic pumps compress out the working fluid tap water used here through one of the two orifices and suck in through the other as the piston rods push in or pull out we first conduct an experiment with one of the two identical bhf wecs to validate whether the effect on the flap s motion due to the impedance total w2 f1 f2 would be negligible under the wave condition k i o 1 as the theory predicts in this experiment of a single bhf wec operating in isolation the density of the flap is kept at 555 kg m3 its buoyancy center height o b is 0 220 m and its mass center height o m is changed from 0 218 m to 0 233 m and 0 244 m next in the experiment of double bhf wecs operating in tandem the density of both flap panels is still kept at 555 kg m3 and their o m remained fixed at 0 218 m 2 3 wave basin and instrument setup fig 3 illustrates the setups for experiments of a single bhf wec operating in isolation fig 3a and double bhf wecs operating in tandem fig 3b in the experiment of double bhf wecs two identical bhf wecs are respectively designated as flapper 1 whose position is fixed and confronting the incident waves at all times and flapper 2 whose position is allowed to move in order to change the separation distance d between these two bhf wecs from 0 5λ to λ incident wavelength with increment of λ 16 the wave basin facility 16 m long 2 m wide and 1 m deep includes a displacement piston type wavemaker by edinburgh designs with four paddles each unit has a width of 0 5 m wave gauges and transparent side windows to facilitate the high speed cameras to take photos the active absorption of the wavemaker on one end and the passive absorption of the artificial beach on the other are capable of efficiently minimizing the wave reflections in the basin with a fixed water depth of 0 5 m in general the generation time for monochromatic waves of each test is set at 60 s from the pre tests it is confirmed that the scattering effects from the device and the reflections from the lateral boundaries are insignificant to the measurements during such short durations with the width of the test model wec being only 1 4 of the flume width in addition the artificial beaches on the opposite end of the wavemakers being of vertical structure with wedge shaped fronts as shown in fig 3 could efficiently reduce reflection ratios to be less than 10 the input wave conditions are derived from the measurements of a wave gauge set at a distance of 2 m from the wavemakers with a sampling rate of 20 hz the wave data are then processed based on the zero up crossing method to obtain representative wave heights and periods the wave data of the northeast coastal waters of taiwan tzang et al 2011 are adopted and scaled down for the wave conditions used in the experiment of a single bhf wec operating in isolation as shown in table 1 in the experiment of double bhf wecs operating in tandem with varying separation distance in terms of wavelength because of the length limitation of the transparent side window that should keep both bhf wecs in view the incident wavelength needs to be shortened as shown in table 1 2 4 flapping motion analysis time series images of the oscillating flap as shown in fig 4 for an example are acquired by a high speed camera phantom v310 1280 800 pixel2 at 100 frame s to time resolve its flapping motion the spatial resolution of the images is 0 322 mm pixel after all the images are acquired the pixel position of the mark on the side of the flap in each image is identified using the correlation method as follows firstly we define an appropriate interrogation window a mask w m n pixel2 on the first image of a series to cover the mark and enhance the contrast of gray levels within the mask to prepare it as a template this mask or mark template is then moved around the mark s position of the first image on the next image and the calculations of the correlation function c as defined below are performed 17 c i j m 1 m n 1 n f i 1 i m j n f i 1 w i m n w i m 1 m n 1 n f i 1 i m j n f i 1 2 m 1 m n 1 n w i m n w i 2 where i denotes the serial number of image f i j the gray level at the point i j in pixel and the overbar the average value of gray levels within the window the i j location of the maximum correlation value within the search area will be designated the position of the mark at the next instance and then converted to the angular position of the flap at the next instance after repeating this procedure successively through the whole image series the oscillation angle θ of the flap as a function of time can be obtained in the process of identifying the location of the maximum correlation value the gaussian peak fitting model three point estimator raffel et al 2007 is used in order to achieve sub pixel accuracy 2 5 rating platform and power estimate for pto a pto rating platform is designed to measure the combined damping coefficient of the hydraulic pumps as shown in fig 5 a the platform is of a cage structure with a weighting mechanism which is composed of a steel wire and a pulley system and a platter for placing weights a mark is made on the steel wire with a black board behind as a dark background to enhance the optical contrast of the mark a high speed camera is used to acquire time series images of the translating mark under a weight pulling or pushing the hydraulic pumps these images are analyzed using the correlation method aforementioned to obtain the displacement of the mark as a function of time as shown in fig 5b the working principle of the pto rating platform is explained as follows the symbol m1 denotes the weight for the constant loading condition with the platter mass m2 of about 0 33 kg in order to establish the rating chart we set a series of constant loading m1 varing from 4 kg to 10 kg with increment of 0 1 kg the symbol y denotes the displacement of the mark i e the displacement of the piston of the hydraulic pump the symbols f g and f d denote the total weight force i e m 1 m 2 g and the air drag experienced by the platter respectively due to the fact that y and its first time derivative y d y d t identical to the velocity of the platter are quite small during the rating process f d is negligible therefore the force f acting on the hydraulic pumps and the damping coefficient f o can be evaluated as 18 f f g m 1 m 2 y m 1 m 2 g y f o f y m 1 m 2 g y y where y d 2 y d t 2 in the rating process the force f was measured as the velocity y had reached a terminal value so that y 0 in eq 18 fig 6 shows the representative pto rating data and associated fitting curves between the average rating force and the average rating velocity for both bhf wecs in both processes of push and pull it is clearly evident that the relationship between the rating force and the rating velocity is generally non linear the push and pull processes display slightly different features but the differences are more evident for bhf wec 1 especially for the relatively larger rating velocities the regression equations in fig 6 were further used for calculating the ptos damping coefficients the incident wave energy per unit width can be evaluated as dean and dalrymple 1991 19 e π 2 ρ a i 2 sinh 2 k j i 1 2 1 2 k i sinh 2 k i where a i denotes the complex amplitude of the incident wave potential the instantaneous power p t per unit width taken out by the pto can be calculated as 20 p t f t y t f o t y 2 t the work per unit width done by the pto over a wave period t is 21 w 0 t p t d t finally the capture factor cf of the wec is 22 cf w e 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation experiments for a single bhf wec as mentioned before this experiment is meant to validate whether the effect of w2 f1 f2 would be negligible at the coastal water wave condition we use the mechanism of the platform translation inside the flap to change o m while keep the flap s mass constant 31 02 kg m as shown in table 2 the mass center height o m of the flap is lifted from the lowest point 0 218 m almost the same as o b to the second point of 1 5 cm higher and to the third point of 2 6 cm higher resulting in an increasing moment of inertia and f2 and a decreasing f1 i e a decreasing restoring moment the average values of f1 and f2 exhibited in the experiments are evaluated using eqs 6 and 7 to be about 4e 03 o 10 3 and 5e 03 o 10 2 respectively comparing with the results of eqs 15 and 16 it can be said that f1 and f2 are at least not underestimated by the previous analysis table 2 also shows that w1 o 10 1 and w2 o 10 3 i e as estimated with eqs 12 and 14 to summarize w1 is at least one order of magnitude higher than w2 f1 and f2 in the experiment for comparison purposes the experimental θ s is equalized and normalized with the one formed owing to the wave height of 0 0709 m and o m 0 218 m θ s e n θ s 0 0709 h 14 41 similarly w2 f1 f2 is normalized with the one 4 379e 03 formed owing to o m 0 218 m as shown in table 2 it is clearly evident that θ s e n decreases as o m and normalized w2 f1 f2 increase i e the inertia effect indeed impedes the flapping motion however the reductions of θ s e n due to the increments of normalized w2 f1 f2 of 23 and 43 are only 6 and 10 respectively in other words the combined effect of w2 f1 and f2 is shown to be negligible therefore the effect due to w2 f1 f2 is not taken into account from this point on 3 2 evaluation experiments of double bhf wecs operating in tandem two wave energy converters operating in tandem can be regarded as the simplest form of an array how one wec interacts with the other is of significant interest in this experiment as shown in fig 3 b a smaller wavelength 1 56 m corresponding to the wave period of 1 02 s as shown in table 1 than that of the single bhf wec experiment chosen as explained above results in k i 2 01 o 1 i e the coastal water wave condition is still upheld both bhf wecs denoted as flapper 1 and flapper 2 are first tested in isolation as shown in fig 7 the two angular motions in time respectively for the two bhf wecs operating in isolation exhibit typical sinusoidal forms with different amplitudes resulting from the differences between the intrinsic damping characteristics of the two pto systems fig 6 despite the fact that both bhf wecs are identical in shape and size the angular crests θ troughs θ and strokes θ s obtained from the experiments of a single and double bhf wecs are summarized in table 3 it is noted in table 3 that the θ s in single bhf wec tests are about 11 7 and 11 9 for flappers 1 and 2 respectively i e almost the same angular stroke for both bhf wecs operating in isolation as also shown in fig 8 flapper 1 s θ s alternates above d 12λ 16 15λ 16 and below d 8λ 16 11λ 16 16λ 16 20λ 16 its single bhf wec value whereas flapper 2 s is below except for the case of d 16λ 16 once the separation distances became greater than 20λ 16 the values of θ s became close to those in isolation implying the effects of in tandem were also abased the reduction of flapper 2 s θ s when both bhf wecs operate in tandem is inevitable since flapper 2 can absorb only sheltered waves i e reduced wave energy from behind flapper 1 however the maximum reduction of flapper 2 s θ s is only about 15 implying that there might be extra wave energy coming from the outside of the frontal area of the bhf wec in other words 3d wave effects like diffraction may play an important role in capturing wave energy details follow table 4 tabulates the capture factors of flapper 1 cf1 and flapper 2 cf2 when both bhf wecs operate in isolation d 0 or in tandem with d ranging from λ 2 to λ with increment of λ 16 and of 1 1 4 λ the data of cf1 and cf2 in table 4 are also drawn in fig 9 in fig 9 the variation of cf1 with d exhibits a sinusoidal wave form with the minimum about 0 64 occurring at in between d 9λ 16 and 10λ 16 and the maximum about 0 84 occurring at in between d 13λ 16 and 14λ 16 therefore the distance between two consecutive extrema happens to be about λ 4 furthermore all resulting values of cf1 even with d 0 are greater than 0 5 i e the 2d theoretical maximum cf 2d cfmax implying that more wave energy is 3 dimensionally drawn to flapper 1 from surrounding water regions via diffraction renzi et al 2014 it is also observed that the d range where cf1 0 777 i e the cf when flapper 1 operates in isolation is about the same spanning of λ 4 as being noted in the results of θ s in table 3 this is the zone where the performance of flapper 1 is particularly enhanced due to the presence of the in tandem partner in the rear i e flapper 2 when flapper 2 operates in isolation the cf2 value i e cf2 0 530 at d 0 is slightly larger than 2d cfmax but only about 68 of that of flapper 1 because of the differences in the intrinsic damping characteristics of pto as mentioned above fig 6 compared with the in tandem performance of flapper 1 values of cf2 do not exhibit a clear periodic variation with d as shown in fig 9 the cf2 seems to remain almost constant of about 0 40 ranging from d λ 2 to 13λ 16 spanning about 1 4 1 8 λ and starts to increase after d 13λ 16 but never exceeds cf2 0 530 d 0 in fact flapper 2 faces different incoming waves when operating in different situations e g facing full incident wave when operating in isolation and residue of the incident wave when operating in tandem i e sheltered by flapper 1 therefore a factor to highlight the inter correlation between cf2 and cf1 when both bhf wecs operate in tandem if is proposed as 23 if e f o 2 1 cf 1 e i cf 2 1 cf 1 where e f o 2 denotes the energy taken off by the flapper 2 s pto in one wave period the denominator of if represents the nominal incoming wave energy incident to flapper 2 i e the residue of the incident wave energy nominally passing through flapper 1 thus if can be regarded as an effective capture factor for flapper 2 sheltered by its tandem partner flapper 1 as shown in fig 10 and table 4 all ifs are greater than 1 and exhibit a wave form similar with cf1 peaking around d 7λ 8 it is clearly evident that the incident wave energy stored in the areas adjacent to the frontal area of flapper 1 is diffracted by it and directed toward the frontal area of flapper 2 i e more energy other than the energy stored in the frontal area of flapper 1 is involved in the process also in table 4 and fig 9 the sums of cf1 and cf2 combined cf cfc cf1 cf2 when these two bhf wecs operate in tandem are greater than 1 0 for all d s clearly indicating again the same fact as described above the diffraction effect on the capture of wave energy other than that in the frontal area of the bhf wecs this effect reaches its maximum around d 14λ 16 i e cf1 and if also peak around this point therefore d 14λ 16 7λ 8 can be regarded as the optimum separation distance between two bhf wecs operating in tandem srokosz and evans 1979 extended evans theory evans 1976 to the case of two independently oscillating 2d cylinders in tandem theoretically these two cylinders are capable of absorbing all the incident wave energy i e the maximum cfc is 1 at special conditions most of which are conditions away from resonances where they can only absorb very little energy i e the cfc is very close to zero for the case of two vertical plates rolling about points located on their perspective bodies srokosz and evans 1979 predicted that the resonances occur close to the condition 24 2 k i b q π q 1 2 where b denotes the half distance between two plates i e d 2 in other words 25 d q π k i q λ 2 q 1 2 according to eqs 24 and 25 the two in tandem bhf wecs in this paper should absorb the minimum and very little energy at 2 k i b k i d π 2 π respectively corresponding to d 8λ 16 16λ 16 as shown in table 5 however as shown in table 4 and fig 9 cfc as well as cf1 and if appears minimum at about d 9λ 16 and is expected to reach minimum again at about d 9λ 16 λ 2 17λ 16 since the length between the minimum about d 9λ 16 and the maximum about d 14λ 16 is approximately λ 4 showing a positive phase shift of about 1λ 16 as compared to eq 25 furthermore all the cf data cf1 cf2 and cfc are significantly far from zero in summary it is clearly evident that 3d effects play a key role in the in tandem operation of bhf wecs that results in the deviated predictions by the 2d theory srokosz and evans 1979 the 2d theoretical predictions and 3d experimental results described above depict a phenomenon strikingly similar to the so called bragg reflection davies and heathershaw 1984 that is strong wave reflection occurs from periodic underwater obstacles e g submerged breakwaters sandbars with wavelength the distance between two adjacent obstacles equal to half wavelength of the incoming wave i e little wave energy is transmitted into the patch of these underwater obstacles with d λ 2 for coastal protections the mechanism of bragg reflection can be of great advantage mei et al 1988 for in tandem wecs operations however this suggested mechanism of bragg reflection should be avoided since the wave energy absorption would be minimized just because of inappropriate separation distance settings 4 conclusions experimental investigations on a single bhf wec operating in isolation and double bhf wecs operating in tandem are carried out in a small laboratory basin an image based methodology is developed with high speed imaging and a robust algorithm the correlation method for resolving the kinematics of the bhf wec along with bhf wec models equipped with devices to control the mass center height for examining the effect of the inertia impedances a rating platform is also set up for estimating pto s power output to evaluate the cfs of the bhf wecs when operating in tandem the negligibility of the effect of the inertia impedances at k i o 1 in coastal water applications firstly derived from the 2d bhf wec theory was clearly confirmed by the validation experiments of a single bhf wec with varying inertia impedances in addition the experiments on both bhf wecs operating in isolation illustrate that their values of cf are greater than the theoretical maximum value of 0 5 in 2d configurations cf1 0 78 cf2 0 53 owing to diffraction effects of waves in surrounding water regions in realistic 3d configurations the differences in cf between two seemingly identical bhf wec models result from different intrinsic damping characteristics of the associated pto systems the evaluation experiments on double bhf wecs operating in tandem at different separation distances d show that the angular strokes θ s of flapper 1 and cf1 exhibit similar sinusoidal variations the tandem operations result in not only that the combined cf cfc is always greater than 1 0 but also that cf1 is amplified in certain range of d to be greater than its value in the isolated operation it appears that all values of cf2 in the tandem operations are smaller than that in the isolated operation by introducing the inter correlation factor if however the effective performance of flapper 2 is clearly shown to vary in phase with that of flapper 1 cf1 and significantly surpass cf2 in the isolated operation all these results clearly indicate that diffraction effects play a key role in wave energy capture of bhf wecs both in isolated and tandem operations the maximum cfc cf1 and if occur around d 14λ 16 7λ 8 which can be regarded as the optimum separation distance on the other hand the minimum cfc cf1 and if which should be avoid occur around d 9λ 16 away from the maximum point by about λ 4 this minimum point shifts from the 2d theoretical prediction srokosz and evans 1979 by just about λ 16 but its cf values are significantly far from zero as predicted by the theory these deviations suggest that 3d effects play an important role in the tandem operations of double bhf wecs nevertheless this phenomenon of minimum energy capture can be related to the bragg reflection where little wave energy is transmitted into the region of underwater obstacles with d λ 2 more experimental or numerical investigations in 3d configurations are needed to obtain further

23190,this paper experimentally investigates the performances of two bottom hinged flap wave energy converters bhf wecs operating in tandem firstly the inertia effects of a single bhf wec operating in isolation are theoretically and experimentally examined to show their negligibility in coastal water applications with the non dimensional wave number o 1 experiments of two in tandem bhf wecs with separation distance d varing from 0 5λ to λ incident wavelength with increment of λ 16 are then conducted in a small wave basin hydraulic pumps are used as the power take off and their forcing characteristics as an energy damper are determined using a rating platform time series images of flapping motions of the bhf wecs recorded with high speed cameras are analyzed using a processing and analysis procedure based on the correlation algorithm to evaluate their capture factors cf the cf variations of the first bhf wec with d exhibit a sinusoidal wave form with wavelength of λ 2 the combined cf of the two in tandem bhf wecs is always greater than 1 0 indicating that the wave energy outside the frontal area is drawn via diffraction it reaches the maximum at around d 14λ 16 with λ 4 apart from the minimum at around d 9λ 16 owing to the underlying mechanism of the bragg reflection graphical abstract image 1 keywords bottom hinged flap wave energy converter high speed imaging capture factor in tandem diffraction effect bragg reflection 1 introduction in coming decades the world wide concerns on global warming and expected peaks of reserves of conventional energy such as petroleum have resulted in wide and serious pursues of alternative energy solutions especially the renewable energy marine energy usually referred to as the combination of mainly wave energy tidal energy and ocean current energy is quite promising in its tremendous potentials renewability and zero carbon emissions wave energy being commonly regarded as the one with the largest potential one among marine energy resources ocean energy technology overview 2009 has particularly attracted many attentions and resulted in promoted developments of numerous types of wave energy converter wec so far there have been hundreds of patents granted world widely for wec s designs and inventions and related sub system improvements trend analysis on technology development of ocean wave energy 2009 those proposed inventions can generally be classified into several categories based on the wave dynamic features and power take off mechanism detailed reviews on device developments can be referred to e g falcão 2010 for the past decades devices inspired by the concepts of oscillating water column point absorbing and bottom hinged pitching were mostly developed with different wave device interaction characteristics among them a bottom hinged flap wec bhf wec oscillating in the wave surge direction categorized as the oscillating wave surge converter owsc has particularly in last decade been adopted folley et al 2007a and successfully resulted in designing and manufacturing several prototype wecs e g aquamarine power ltd s oyster whittaker and folley 2012 and aw energy s waveroller aw energy 2012 the bhf wec concept has advantages such as quite efficient power conversion babarit 2015 easy accessibility in nearshore waters folley et al 2007b and retract ability to submerge by folding the flap panel toward the sea bed to survive in the impact of extreme waves caused by extreme weather events e g typhoons in this regard the bhf wec is quite ideal for harvesting wave energy in the typhoon wave active near shore waters around taiwan therefore the authors were initially motivated to theoretically and numerically study the performance of a single 2d bhf wec chang et al 2015 we had preliminarily confirmed that the relations among the so called mechanical impedances are the key factors to the energy capture cf tom et al 2017 furthermore multiple wecs forming a modular or array are considered to have potential in exploiting wave energy with higher efficiency e g wilkinson et al 2017 renzi and dias 2012a b individual wecs in an array could interact with one another and thus behave differently than a single isolated wec does as a result this so called array interaction has gradually become an important issue for wave energy exploitation budal 1977 falnes 1980 and evans 1980 were the pioneers in studying the array problem of the point absorber type e g buoy for the array problem of bhf wec renzi and dias 2012a b theoretically analyzed an in line array configuration and found that high capture factors can be attained when the system is in resonance of transverse modes in order to elucidate the interaction mechanism two wecs in tandem operations as the simplest array form needs further studies srokosz and evans 1979 extends evans theory 1976 to the case of two independently oscillating 2d cylinders in tandem theoretically these two cylinders are capable of absorbing all the incident wave energy at a special condition away from their resonances at which they can only absorb very little energy scher et al 1983 and wilke 1984 conducted a 2d model test in a wave flume with two in tandem vertical panels oscillating in pure sway linear motions and compared the results with the theoretical predictions shown in srokosz and evans 1979 however few attentions have been paid to the performances of two 3d bhf wecs operating in tandem for wec performance evaluations numerical modellings have been generally acknowledged to be one of the powerful tools li and yu 2012 had reviewed different numerical schemes for a single heaving device folley 2016 had further comprehensively reviewed the state of the art numerical modeling for single devices of various concepts and arrays of heaving modes particularly on non linear viscous damping yu and li 2013 conducted successful rans simulations for a two body floating point absorber wave energy system and showed significant influences on the performance of a wec system by incorporating the drag damping force term bhinder et al 2015 compared the potential time domain viscous ptdv model with the cfd model with respect to a surging floating wec and found a good agreement for regular wave conditions so far in tandem bottom hinged owscs and associated effects of non linear viscous damping have not been reported possibly due to complicated interaction mechanism and computation thus experimental studies with real fluids might help shed lights on critical issues to facilitate the developments of numerical modeling this paper first experimentally examines the inertial effects of the mechanical impedances on a single bhf wec with a physical model having two hydraulic pumps as its pto and a mechanism of tunable inertia we especially focus on the impedances formed owing to the wave and the flap this experiment is conducted with an image based measurement with high speed imaging which is incorporated with the hydrodynamic theory for bhf wec developed by chang et al 2015 to form a robust experimental procedure then another image based methodology to evaluate the performance of wave energy capture capture factor cf is developed with the same high speed imaging after that we experimentally investigate the capture factors of two identical bhf wec models operating in tandem under a specific wave condition associated with the wave climates of taiwan as the separation distances between the two bhf wecs varied from λ 2 to λ incident wavelength with increment of λ 16 and an additional test with a value slightly larger than λ the corresponding oscillating motions of the bhf wecs are measured using two high speed cameras the final results show the performance characteristics of bhf wecs operating in tandem and an optimum separation distance in terms of λ 2 experimental setup and measurement technique 2 1 theory of image based measurement for bhf wec the schematic of a 2d bhf wec interacting with incident waves with frequency σ and wave number k i is shown in fig 1 and σ and k i are related in the dispersion relation σ 2 g k i tanh k i h where h is the water depth and g the acceleration of gravity the symbol s z denotes the horizontal stroke of the flap s motion at z coordinates and the flap pivots on o in fig 1 z 0 means the still water surface and ρ is the water density the damping coefficient of the pto system is denoted as f o and l is the lever arm of the pto s force with fig 1 chang et al 2015 used formulations similar to the 2d linear wavemaker theory dean and dalrymple 1991 and obtained the relationship between the angular stroke θ s and the incident wave height h as 1 θ s h w 1 p 3 2 w 2 f 1 f 2 p 1 p 2 2 and the formula for the theoretical cf of bhf wec as 2 cf e f o e i 2 w 1 p 3 w 1 p 3 2 w 2 f 1 f 2 p 1 p 2 2 where e f o and ei denote the energy taken off by the bhf wec s pto and the incident wave energy in one wave period respectively in eqs 1 and 2 w1 and w2 f1 and f2 and p1 p2 and p3 are the 2d non dimensional mechanical impedances formed respectively because of the wave the flap and the pto as described below the impedance w1 is formed owing to the waves radiated from the bhf wec and represents the effect of wave damping i e radiation damping effect as shown in eq 3 3 w 1 1 0 1 z 2 cosh k i 1 z d z 2 k i 1 0 cosh 2 k i 1 z d z k i sinh k i cosh k i 1 2 k i 4 2 k i sinh 2 k i where z z h and k i k i h the integrals in eq 3 correspond to that of the amplitude of the progressive wave potential generated by the flap type wavemaker dean and dalrymple 1991 the impedance w2 is formed owing to the standing waves that represents the effect of wave inertia i e added mass effect as shown in eq 4 4 w 2 n 1 1 0 1 z 2 cos k s n 1 z d z 2 k s n 1 0 cos 2 k s n 1 z d z n 1 k s n sin k s n cos k s n 1 2 k s n 4 2 k s n sin 2 k s n where k s n k s n h and k s n is the nth positive root to the equation 5 σ 2 g k s n tan k s n h the series of integrals in eq 4 correspond to that of the amplitudes of the standing wave potentials generated owing to the differences between the motion of the flap and the fluid motion induced by the progressive wave the formations of these integrals in eqs 3 and 4 follow the sturm liouville theory as pointed out by dean and dalrymple 1991 the impedances formed owing to the flap are f1 and f2 and 6 f 1 m g o m m b g o b 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 7 f 2 i σ 2 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 i 8 ρ h 4 where m m b and i denote the mass the mass of water displacement and the moment of inertia about the hinge o of the flap per unit width respectively and o m and o m denote the distances between the hinge o and the centers of mass and buoyancy of the flap respectively the term m g o m m b g o b in eq 6 indicates the maximum restoring moment experienced by the flap when it is negative i e m g o m m b g o b the impedance f2 represents the effect of the flap body s inertia the last three impedances p1 p2 and p3 are due to the pto as follows 8 p 1 k pto h 2 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 k pto 8 ρ σ 2 h 2 p 2 i pto σ 2 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 i pto 8 ρ h 4 9 p 3 l 2 f o σ h 2 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 l 2 f o 8 ρ σ h 2 where k pto denotes the stiffness per unit width of the pto i pto the moment of inertia per unit width of the pto about the hinge o and l l h in this paper hydraulic pumps are used as the pto of the wec model since hydraulic pump is a device used to overcome the viscous resistance associated with fluid flows to achieve fluid pumping it is evident that the dominant hydrodynamic impedance associated with hydraulic pump should be p3 i e pto s damping related impedance therefore p1 and p2 respectively due to the stiffness and the inertia of the pto can be neglected as compared to p3 furthermore the hydraulic pumps used in the experiment are small size and light weight as compared to the flap body dictating that p1 and p2 are also much smaller than the impedances associated with the flap body such as f1 and f2 in other cases however the stiffness and the inertia of the pto may need to be considered e g babarit et al 2012 therefore p1 and p2 are to be neglected in the following analyses in this paper i e w 2 f 1 f 2 p 1 p 2 w 2 f 1 f 2 as shown in eq 2 the formula for the theoretical cf indicate two necessary conditions to attain the maximum cf value cfmax 0 5 which is consistent with the previous results shown by evans 1976 and mei 1976 one of the two conditions is to match the damping impedances of the wave and the pto i e w 1 p3 the other is to make the impedance of the restoring moment experienced by the flap cancel the impedances other than w1 and p3 i e 10 w 2 f 1 f 2 0 due to the fact that w2 and f2 are always positive eqs 4 and 7 f1 needs to be negative in order to cancel w2 f2 i e m g o m m b g o b to form a restoring moment eq 6 as a result o m o b and or m m b i e the density of the flap is smaller than that of water can be used as a guideline for designing the flap another situation where w2 f1 f2 can be neglected is that w2 f1 and f2 are much smaller than w1 or p3 due to the fact that bhf wecs are in nature a coastal water application i e the wave condition k i o 1 applies therefore 11 sinh k i k i tanh k i k i cosh k i 1 1 2 k i 2 then w1 can be approximated with eqs 3 and 11 as 12 w 1 k i sinh k i cosh k i 1 2 k i 4 2 k i sinh 2 k i k i k i 1 1 2 k i 2 1 2 k i 4 2 k i 2 k i 1 16 k i 1 o 10 1 for estimating w2 we first substitute eq 1 into eq 5 to eliminate σ 2 and use eq 11 to obtain 13 k i 2 k s n tan k s n it can be shown that n 1 2 π k s n n π and k s n should be much closer to n π than to n 1 2 π since k i is only on the order of 1 taking the leading term n 1 in eq 4 k s 1 can be first estimated to be around 0 9 π using eq 13 and then substituted into eq 4 for calculating the leading term it finally shows that 14 w 2 4 0 10 3 o 10 3 for estimating f1 and f2 eqs 6 and 7 respectively we first approximate the flap as a rectangular uniform plate with o m and o b equal to about 0 5 h in practice the flap s mass m is about 0 5mb and thickness about 0 2 h since σ 2 g k i 2 h 1 using eq 1 with k i o 1 then 15 f 1 m g o m m b g o b 8 ρ σ 2 h 4 0 5 0 2 ρ h 2 g 0

condition according to the previous analysis based on the 2d bhf wec theory this theoretical result and the assumption based on it i e w2 f1 f2 being neglected will be validated experimentally as follows 2 2 bhf wec model in this study two identical bhf wec models are built for the experiments as fig 2 shows their schematic the flap panel has a movable platform inside on which metal weights plates can be added and stacked to change the mass of the flap the movable platform is achieved by installing a linear motion system composed mainly of a stepper motor a lead screw and two supporting rails the up and down translation motion of the platform can be controlled by commanding the stepper motor controller as the position of the platform changes so the mass center and hence the moment of inertia of the flap change i e f1 and f2 can be altered for experimental purposes the width height and thickness of the flap panel are respectively 0 5 m 0 55 m and 0 1 m two identical hydraulic pumps are used as the pto system each pump has two water inlet outlet orifices connected with a close loop tubing and check valves as the wave force acts on the flap panel to make it oscillate the hydraulic pumps compress out the working fluid tap water used here through one of the two orifices and suck in through the other as the piston rods push in or pull out we first conduct an experiment with one of the two identical bhf wecs to validate whether the effect on the flap s motion due to the impedance total w2 f1 f2 would be negligible under the wave condition k i o 1 as the theory predicts in this experiment of a single bhf wec operating in isolation the density of the flap is kept at 555 kg m3 its buoyancy center height o b is 0 220 m and its mass center height o m is changed from 0 218 m to 0 233 m and 0 244 m next in the experiment of double bhf wecs operating in tandem the density of both flap panels is still kept at 555 kg m3 and their o m remained fixed at 0 218 m 2 3 wave basin and instrument setup fig 3 illustrates the setups for experiments of a single bhf wec operating in isolation fig 3a and double bhf wecs operating in tandem fig 3b in the experiment of double bhf wecs two identical bhf wecs are respectively designated as flapper 1 whose position is fixed and confronting the incident waves at all times and flapper 2 whose position is allowed to move in order to change the separation distance d between these two bhf wecs from 0 5λ to λ incident wavelength with increment of λ 16 the wave basin facility 16 m long 2 m wide and 1 m deep includes a displacement piston type wavemaker by edinburgh designs with four paddles each unit has a width of 0 5 m wave gauges and transparent side windows to facilitate the high speed cameras to take photos the active absorption of the wavemaker on one end and the passive absorption of the artificial beach on the other are capable of efficiently minimizing the wave reflections in the basin with a fixed water depth of 0 5 m in general the generation time for monochromatic waves of each test is set at 60 s from the pre tests it is confirmed that the scattering effects from the device and the reflections from the lateral boundaries are insignificant to the measurements during such short durations with the width of the test model wec being only 1 4 of the flume width in addition the artificial beaches on the opposite end of the wavemakers being of vertical structure with wedge shaped fronts as shown in fig 3 could efficiently reduce reflection ratios to be less than 10 the input wave conditions are derived from the measurements of a wave gauge set at a distance of 2 m from the wavemakers with a sampling rate of 20 hz the wave data are then processed based on the zero up crossing method to obtain representative wave heights and periods the wave data of the northeast coastal waters of taiwan tzang et al 2011 are adopted and scaled down for the wave conditions used in the experiment of a single bhf wec operating in isolation as shown in table 1 in the experiment of double bhf wecs operating in tandem with varying separation distance in terms of wavelength because of the length limitation of the transparent side window that should keep both bhf wecs in view the incident wavelength needs to be shortened as shown in table 1 2 4 flapping motion analysis time series images of the oscillating flap as shown in fig 4 for an example are acquired by a high speed camera phantom v310 1280 800 pixel2 at 100 frame s to time resolve its flapping motion the spatial resolution of the images is 0 322 mm pixel after all the images are acquired the pixel position of the mark on the side of the flap in each image is identified using the correlation method as follows firstly we define an appropriate interrogation window a mask w m n pixel2 on the first image of a series to cover the mark and enhance the contrast of gray levels within the mask to prepare it as a template this mask or mark template is then moved around the mark s position of the first image on the next image and the calculations of the correlation function c as defined below are performed 17 c i j m 1 m n 1 n f i 1 i m j n f i 1 w i m n w i m 1 m n 1 n f i 1 i m j n f i 1 2 m 1 m n 1 n w i m n w i 2 where i denotes the serial number of image f i j the gray level at the point i j in pixel and the overbar the average value of gray levels within the window the i j location of the maximum correlation value within the search area will be designated the position of the mark at the next instance and then converted to the angular position of the flap at the next instance after repeating this procedure successively through the whole image series the oscillation angle θ of the flap as a function of time can be obtained in the process of identifying the location of the maximum correlation value the gaussian peak fitting model three point estimator raffel et al 2007 is used in order to achieve sub pixel accuracy 2 5 rating platform and power estimate for pto a pto rating platform is designed to measure the combined damping coefficient of the hydraulic pumps as shown in fig 5 a the platform is of a cage structure with a weighting mechanism which is composed of a steel wire and a pulley system and a platter for placing weights a mark is made on the steel wire with a black board behind as a dark background to enhance the optical contrast of the mark a high speed camera is used to acquire time series images of the translating mark under a weight pulling or pushing the hydraulic pumps these images are analyzed using the correlation method aforementioned to obtain the displacement of the mark as a function of time as shown in fig 5b the working principle of the pto rating platform is explained as follows the symbol m1 denotes the weight for the constant loading condition with the platter mass m2 of about 0 33 kg in order to establish the rating chart we set a series of constant loading m1 varing from 4 kg to 10 kg with increment of 0 1 kg the symbol y denotes the displacement of the mark i e the displacement of the piston of the hydraulic pump the symbols f g and f d denote the total weight force i e m 1 m 2 g and the air drag experienced by the platter respectively due to the fact that y and its first time derivative y d y d t identical to the velocity of the platter are quite small during the rating process f d is negligible therefore the force f acting on the hydraulic pumps and the damping coefficient f o can be evaluated as 18 f f g m 1 m 2 y m 1 m 2 g y f o f y m 1 m 2 g y y where y d 2 y d t 2 in the rating process the force f was measured as the velocity y had reached a terminal value so that y 0 in eq 18 fig 6 shows the representative pto rating data and associated fitting curves between the average rating force and the average rating velocity for both bhf wecs in both processes of push and pull it is clearly evident that the relationship between the rating force and the rating velocity is generally non linear the push and pull processes display slightly different features but the differences are more evident for bhf wec 1 especially for the relatively larger rating velocities the regression equations in fig 6 were further used for calculating the ptos damping coefficients the incident wave energy per unit width can be evaluated as dean and dalrymple 1991 19 e π 2 ρ a i 2 sinh 2 k j i 1 2 1 2 k i sinh 2 k i where a i denotes the complex amplitude of the incident wave potential the instantaneous power p t per unit width taken out by the pto can be calculated as 20 p t f t y t f o t y 2 t the work per unit width done by the pto over a wave period t is 21 w 0 t p t d t finally the capture factor cf of the wec is 22 cf w e 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation experiments for a single bhf wec as mentioned before this experiment is meant to validate whether the effect of w2 f1 f2 would be negligible at the coastal water wave condition we use the mechanism of the platform translation inside the flap to change o m while keep the flap s mass constant 31 02 kg m as shown in table 2 the mass center height o m of the flap is lifted from the lowest point 0 218 m almost the same as o b to the second point of 1 5 cm higher and to the third point of 2 6 cm higher resulting in an increasing moment of inertia and f2 and a decreasing f1 i e a decreasing restoring moment the average values of f1 and f2 exhibited in the experiments are evaluated using eqs 6 and 7 to be about 4e 03 o 10 3 and 5e 03 o 10 2 respectively comparing with the results of eqs 15 and 16 it can be said that f1 and f2 are at least not underestimated by the previous analysis table 2 also shows that w1 o 10 1 and w2 o 10 3 i e as estimated with eqs 12 and 14 to summarize w1 is at least one order of magnitude higher than w2 f1 and f2 in the experiment for comparison purposes the experimental θ s is equalized and normalized with the one formed owing to the wave height of 0 0709 m and o m 0 218 m θ s e n θ s 0 0709 h 14 41 similarly w2 f1 f2 is normalized with the one 4 379e 03 formed owing to o m 0 218 m as shown in table 2 it is clearly evident that θ s e n decreases as o m and normalized w2 f1 f2 increase i e the inertia effect indeed impedes the flapping motion however the reductions of θ s e n due to the increments of normalized w2 f1 f2 of 23 and 43 are only 6 and 10 respectively in other words the combined effect of w2 f1 and f2 is shown to be negligible therefore the effect due to w2 f1 f2 is not taken into account from this point on 3 2 evaluation experiments of double bhf wecs operating in tandem two wave energy converters operating in tandem can be regarded as the simplest form of an array how one wec interacts with the other is of significant interest in this experiment as shown in fig 3 b a smaller wavelength 1 56 m corresponding to the wave period of 1 02 s as shown in table 1 than that of the single bhf wec experiment chosen as explained above results in k i 2 01 o 1 i e the coastal water wave condition is still upheld both bhf wecs denoted as flapper 1 and flapper 2 are first tested in isolation as shown in fig 7 the two angular motions in time respectively for the two bhf wecs operating in isolation exhibit typical sinusoidal forms with different amplitudes resulting from the differences between the intrinsic damping characteristics of the two pto systems fig 6 despite the fact that both bhf wecs are identical in shape and size the angular crests θ troughs θ and strokes θ s obtained from the experiments of a single and double bhf wecs are summarized in table 3 it is noted in table 3 that the θ s in single bhf wec tests are about 11 7 and 11 9 for flappers 1 and 2 respectively i e almost the same angular stroke for both bhf wecs operating in isolation as also shown in fig 8 flapper 1 s θ s alternates above d 12λ 16 15λ 16 and below d 8λ 16 11λ 16 16λ 16 20λ 16 its single bhf wec value whereas flapper 2 s is below except for the case of d 16λ 16 once the separation distances became greater than 20λ 16 the values of θ s became close to those in isolation implying the effects of in tandem were also abased the reduction of flapper 2 s θ s when both bhf wecs operate in tandem is inevitable since flapper 2 can absorb only sheltered waves i e reduced wave energy from behind flapper 1 however the maximum reduction of flapper 2 s θ s is only about 15 implying that there might be extra wave energy coming from the outside of the frontal area of the bhf wec in other words 3d wave effects like diffraction may play an important role in capturing wave energy details follow table 4 tabulates the capture factors of flapper 1 cf1 and flapper 2 cf2 when both bhf wecs operate in isolation d 0 or in tandem with d ranging from λ 2 to λ with increment of λ 16 and of 1 1 4 λ the data of cf1 and cf2 in table 4 are also drawn in fig 9 in fig 9 the variation of cf1 with d exhibits a sinusoidal wave form with the minimum about 0 64 occurring at in between d 9λ 16 and 10λ 16 and the maximum about 0 84 occurring at in between d 13λ 16 and 14λ 16 therefore the distance between two consecutive extrema happens to be about λ 4 furthermore all resulting values of cf1 even with d 0 are greater than 0 5 i e the 2d theoretical maximum cf 2d cfmax implying that more wave energy is 3 dimensionally drawn to flapper 1 from surrounding water regions via diffraction renzi et al 2014 it is also observed that the d range where cf1 0 777 i e the cf when flapper 1 operates in isolation is about the same spanning of λ 4 as being noted in the results of θ s in table 3 this is the zone where the performance of flapper 1 is particularly enhanced due to the presence of the in tandem partner in the rear i e flapper 2 when flapper 2 operates in isolation the cf2 value i e cf2 0 530 at d 0 is slightly larger than 2d cfmax but only about 68 of that of flapper 1 because of the differences in the intrinsic damping characteristics of pto as mentioned above fig 6 compared with the in tandem performance of flapper 1 values of cf2 do not exhibit a clear periodic variation with d as shown in fig 9 the cf2 seems to remain almost constant of about 0 40 ranging from d λ 2 to 13λ 16 spanning about 1 4 1 8 λ and starts to increase after d 13λ 16 but never exceeds cf2 0 530 d 0 in fact flapper 2 faces different incoming waves when operating in different situations e g facing full incident wave when operating in isolation and residue of the incident wave when operating in tandem i e sheltered by flapper 1 therefore a factor to highlight the inter correlation between cf2 and cf1 when both bhf wecs operate in tandem if is proposed as 23 if e f o 2 1 cf 1 e i cf 2 1 cf 1 where e f o 2 denotes the energy taken off by the flapper 2 s pto in one wave period the denominator of if represents the nominal incoming wave energy incident to flapper 2 i e the residue of the incident wave energy nominally passing through flapper 1 thus if can be regarded as an effective capture factor for flapper 2 sheltered by its tandem partner flapper 1 as shown in fig 10 and table 4 all ifs are greater than 1 and exhibit a wave form similar with cf1 peaking around d 7λ 8 it is clearly evident that the incident wave energy stored in the areas adjacent to the frontal area of flapper 1 is diffracted by it and directed toward the frontal area of flapper 2 i e more energy other than the energy stored in the frontal area of flapper 1 is involved in the process also in table 4 and fig 9 the sums of cf1 and cf2 combined cf cfc cf1 cf2 when these two bhf wecs operate in tandem are greater than 1 0 for all d s clearly indicating again the same fact as described above the diffraction effect on the capture of wave energy other than that in the frontal area of the bhf wecs this effect reaches its maximum around d 14λ 16 i e cf1 and if also peak around this point therefore d 14λ 16 7λ 8 can be regarded as the optimum separation distance between two bhf wecs operating in tandem srokosz and evans 1979 extended evans theory evans 1976 to the case of two independently oscillating 2d cylinders in tandem theoretically these two cylinders are capable of absorbing all the incident wave energy i e the maximum cfc is 1 at special conditions most of which are conditions away from resonances where they can only absorb very little energy i e the cfc is very close to zero for the case of two vertical plates rolling about points located on their perspective bodies srokosz and evans 1979 predicted that the resonances occur close to the condition 24 2 k i b q π q 1 2 where b denotes the half distance between two plates i e d 2 in other words 25 d q π k i q λ 2 q 1 2 according to eqs 24 and 25 the two in tandem bhf wecs in this paper should absorb the minimum and very little energy at 2 k i b k i d π 2 π respectively corresponding to d 8λ 16 16λ 16 as shown in table 5 however as shown in table 4 and fig 9 cfc as well as cf1 and if appears minimum at about d 9λ 16 and is expected to reach minimum again at about d 9λ 16 λ 2 17λ 16 since the length between the minimum about d 9λ 16 and the maximum about d 14λ 16 is approximately λ 4 showing a positive phase shift of about 1λ 16 as compared to eq 25 furthermore all the cf data cf1 cf2 and cfc are significantly far from zero in summary it is clearly evident that 3d effects play a key role in the in tandem operation of bhf wecs that results in the deviated predictions by the 2d theory srokosz and evans 1979 the 2d theoretical predictions and 3d experimental results described above depict a phenomenon strikingly similar to the so called bragg reflection davies and heathershaw 1984 that is strong wave reflection occurs from periodic underwater obstacles e g submerged breakwaters sandbars with wavelength the distance between two adjacent obstacles equal to half wavelength of the incoming wave i e little wave energy is transmitted into the patch of these underwater obstacles with d λ 2 for coastal protections the mechanism of bragg reflection can be of great advantage mei et al 1988 for in tandem wecs operations however this suggested mechanism of bragg reflection should be avoided since the wave energy absorption would be minimized just because of inappropriate separation distance settings 4 conclusions experimental investigations on a single bhf wec operating in isolation and double bhf wecs operating in tandem are carried out in a small laboratory basin an image based methodology is developed with high speed imaging and a robust algorithm the correlation method for resolving the kinematics of the bhf wec along with bhf wec models equipped with devices to control the mass center height for examining the effect of the inertia impedances a rating platform is also set up for estimating pto s power output to evaluate the cfs of the bhf wecs when operating in tandem the negligibility of the effect of the inertia impedances at k i o 1 in coastal water applications firstly derived from the 2d bhf wec theory was clearly confirmed by the validation experiments of a single bhf wec with varying inertia impedances in addition the experiments on both bhf wecs operating in isolation illustrate that their values of cf are greater than the theoretical maximum value of 0 5 in 2d configurations cf1 0 78 cf2 0 53 owing to diffraction effects of waves in surrounding water regions in realistic 3d configurations the differences in cf between two seemingly identical bhf wec models result from different intrinsic damping characteristics of the associated pto systems the evaluation experiments on double bhf wecs operating in tandem at different separation distances d show that the angular strokes θ s of flapper 1 and cf1 exhibit similar sinusoidal variations the tandem operations result in not only that the combined cf cfc is always greater than 1 0 but also that cf1 is amplified in certain range of d to be greater than its value in the isolated operation it appears that all values of cf2 in the tandem operations are smaller than that in the isolated operation by introducing the inter correlation factor if however the effective performance of flapper 2 is clearly shown to vary in phase with that of flapper 1 cf1 and significantly surpass cf2 in the isolated operation all these results clearly indicate that diffraction effects play a key role in wave energy capture of bhf wecs both in isolated and tandem operations the maximum cfc cf1 and if occur around d 14λ 16 7λ 8 which can be regarded as the optimum separation distance on the other hand the minimum cfc cf1 and if which should be avoid occur around d 9λ 16 away from the maximum point by about λ 4 this minimum point shifts from the 2d theoretical prediction srokosz and evans 1979 by just about λ 16 but its cf values are significantly far from zero as predicted by the theory these deviations suggest that 3d effects play an important role in the tandem operations of double bhf wecs nevertheless this phenomenon of minimum energy capture can be related to the bragg reflection where little wave energy is transmitted into the region of underwater obstacles with d λ 2 more experimental or numerical investigations in 3d configurations are needed to obtain further detailed insights into the amplification mechanism of cf acknowledgement this work is financially supported by the national science council of taiwan the grant number is nsc 100 2221 e 019 066 and nsc

23191,a time domain method is developed for estimating the transient response of very large floating structures under unsteady external loads the hybrid frequency time domain approach based on cummins equations is adopted first the discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity method in which a flexible structure is discretised into several rigid submodules connected by beam elements is used to establish the equations of motion for a flexible structure in frequency domain the equations of motion in frequency domain are transformed into time domain following the idea of cummins equations the unsteady external loads at any point of the flexible structure are transferred to the centre of gravity of each submodule using the hydrostatic analysis of a beam in calm water good agreements are obtained between the numerical and experimental data for a weight drop test and a moving point load test of a continuous flexible structure in calm water which validates the present time domain method finally the time domain method is used for simulating the transient response of an interconnected flexible structure under the combination of wave and unsteady external loads which highlights the significant effects of moving point loads on both the vertical displacement and bending moment of the structure keywords vlfs waves time domain hydroelasticity unsteady loads transient response 1 introduction very large floating structures vlfss which have various applications such as large floating bridges airports storage facilities and emergency bases have received considerable attention in both civil and ocean engineering fields wang et al 2007 due to the great length and width of this type of structure its flexural rigidity is relatively small and the elastic deformations are more important than the rigid body motions as a result the hydroelasticity theory has been developed to account for the coupling of fluid motion and structural deformation under linear assumption and harmonic excitation the hydroelastic response of a vlfs can be analysed in frequency domain a classical hydroelastic tool to analyse the interaction between the fluid and vlfss was developed by bishop and price 1979 since then many researchers have contributed to various aspects of this field consequently two numerical methods i e direct method and mode superposition method have been developed for the hydroelastic analysis of a vlfs loukogeorgaki et al 2012 in the direct method the equation of motion for a flexible structure is solved directly using conceptually full modes of the discretised system namba and ohkusu 1999 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 eatock taylor 2003 2007 ohkusu and namba 2004 and kim et al 2007 the mode superposition method utilizes the concept of generalized flexible modes and divides the hydroelastic problem into diffraction and radiation problems for each mode an analogy to the traditional hydrodynamic analysis for rigid body motions the procedure for the hydroelastic analysis using the mode superposition method contains three steps 1 evaluation of the natural oscillation modes dry modes senjanovic et al 2008a b or wet modes humamoto and fujita 2002 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 michailides et al 2013 of the flexible structure 2 hydrodynamic analysis for each mode the added mass radiation damping and wave excitation force and 3 superposition of all modes together and solution of the coupled modal equation to obtain the hydroelastic response of the flexible structure the mode superposition method has been widely adopted by many researchers to investigate the hydroelastic response of vlfss fu et al 2007 dong et al 2010 gao et al 2011 unlike the traditional direct method or the mode superposition method lu et al 2016 proposed a frequency domain discrete module beam bending based method for the hydroelastic analysis of a continuous vlfs in this method a continuous flexible structure is discretised into several submodules which are treated as rigid bodies the hydrodynamic forces the wave excitation and the radiation forces on each submodule are determined by using the multi body hydrodynamic analysis using hydrodynamic codes such as wamit lee and newman 2013 or hydrostar veritas 2010 total external forces including the inertia forces hydrostatic forces and hydrodynamic forces are assumed to be exerted on the centre of gravity of each submodule and each submodule is then simplified as a generalized lumped mass which is subjected to both forces and moments at the centre of gravity a beam element is adopted to connect two adjacent lumped masses to account for the structural deformation this idea is to some extent similar to the mass spring model used in mooring system analysis huang 1992 the difference is that the latter ignores the bending and torsional effects and thus a spring element is used to connect two adjacent masses to model the tension in mooring systems however for the flexible structure studied by lu et al 2016 all three effects i e tension bending and torsion are important and should be considered in the analysis of the structure in order to achieve this an imaginary beam instead of a spring can be applied to connect the adjacent lumped masses this approach gets an advantage over traditional ones by avoiding the predetermination of the oscillation modes of flexible structures which sometimes becomes very hard or even impossible for complex interconnected floating structures because of the strong coupling between the connector and global deformation modes of the structure sun et al 2018 extended the discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity method proposed by lu et al 2016 to analyse the hydroelastic response of a hinged vlfs in waves the results agreed well with those obtained by traditional mode superposition methods it should be noted that in sun s work the shearing forces of the hinge connection were directly calculated after solving the motion equations by using a constraint matrix method the constraint matrix is used to constrain the displacement due to the hinge this method is more straightforward than the additional generalized mode approach proposed by newman 1997 the latter may be difficult to implement for calculating the shearing forces of connections when the connections are complicated wei et al 2017 further developed the frequency domain method proposed by lu et al 2016 to predict the hydroelastic behaviour of floating structures in inhomogeneous seabed and wave field conditions some other applications of the discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity method can be referred to xu et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 considering the purpose of vlfss such as floating bridges and floating airport external unsteady dynamic loads may be introduced during the passage of vehicles or landing and take off of an airplane such loads will induce significant transient behaviour of the flexible structure this may affect the safety of the structure therefore the transient hydrodynamic response of vlfss is of practical importance and must be clearly clarified at the design stage when unsteady dynamic loads which are usually nonlinear on vlfs are considered the frequency domain method mentioned above is not applicable due to the limitation of linear assumption time domain approach is therefore an appropriate solution although the fully nonlinear potential flow model feng and bai 2017 or the viscous numerical wave tank technique nematbakhsh et al 2017 is capable of calculating wave fields and body motions simultaneously in time domain the hybrid frequency time domain method based on cummins equations taghipour et al 2008 is still favoured due to its convenience and low computational cost in this method the linear problem is first solved in the frequency domain and then the input output are transformed into time domain by fourier inverse transform and the nonlinear effects are accounted for as additional loads this hybrid frequency time domain approach was used by kashiwagi 2000 2004 and lee et al 2001 to investigate the transient response of a vlfs under unsteady dynamic loads a special care was paid to numerical accuracy in computing the memory effect function and the added mass at infinite frequency the frequency domain results in their analysis were obtained using the modal superposition method other applications of cummins equation based time domain method can be referred to rajendran et al 2016 and sengupta et al 2017 in addition to the hybrid frequency time domain method several direct time domain approaches were also developed qiu 2007 2009 applied a time domain finite element method to analyse the transient response of a floating beam excited by landing loads this was based on the direct method by coupling the equations of beam deflection and pressure cheng et al 2014 developed a direct time domain method using the time domain free surface green functions to investigate the transient behaviour of a vfls during unsteady external loads in waves based on the recently developed frequency domain hydroelasticity method lu et al 2016 a time domain method is developed in the present paper to investigate the transient response of vlfss under unsteady dynamic loads this follows the idea of the hybrid frequency time domain approach first the hydroelastic response of a vlfs is analysed in frequency domain using the approach proposed by lu et al 2016 then fourier inverse transform is adopted to transform the frequency domain results into time domain the unsteady dynamic load can be added to the time domain motion equations to perform the numerical analysis the weight drop test and moving weight test for a continuous vlfs in calm water conducted by endo and yago 1999 are adopted for validation of the present method after that the transient response of an interconnected vlfs under both waves and unsteady external loads is investigated using the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method 2 methodology 2 1 hydroelastic analysis in frequency domain the frequency domain discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity approach for a continuous flexible structure proposed by lu et al 2016 is adopted and extended to an interconnected flexible structure this hydroelasticity approach was inspired by comparing the differences of vertical motions between a rigid floating structure and a flexible one both of which have a larger dimension in the longitudinal direction than in other directions for a rigid body the heave and pitch motion correspond to an unchanged vertical displacement and rotation angle along the longitudinal direction respectively however for a flexible structure both the vertical displacement and rotation angle will vary along the longitudinal direction in order to approximate this deflection feature i e varied vertical displacement and rotation angle along the longitudinal direction the continuous structure is discretised into several rigid submodules which are freely floating as all submodules are freely floating their vertical displacements and rotation angles also vary along the longitudinal direction of the structure however there must be some differences of the vertical motions between the multi rigid submodule floating system and the original flexible floating structure the latter s vertical motion is also constrained by structural deformation while the former is not so this is the reason why a beam element is used to connect or constrain two adjacent rigid submodules in order to approximate the structural deformation inherent in the original flexible structure the general procedure for performing the hydroelastic analysis for a vlfs here the vlfs consists of two connected modules which is a simplified case for an interconnected multi module floating structure with the discrete module and euler bernoulli beam assumptions is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 2 three coordinate systems are adopted to describe the wave induced motion of the interconnected multi module floating system the global coordinate system oxyz the reference coordinate system o m x m y m z m m 1 2 n 1 n 2 and the body fixed local coordinate system o m x m y m z m the global coordinate system is fixed in space with oxy located at the still water level and z axis positive upwards the reference coordinate system is always parallel to the global coordinate system with the origin located at the centre of gravity for each submodule at rest the body fixed coordinate system coincides with the reference coordinate system at the initial stage but then moves with each submodule each module of the vlfs is discretised into several rigid submodules which are connected by elastic beams multi body hydrodynamic theory based on linear and rigid body assumption is applied to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction between these submodules the velocity potential of the fluid field including the incident potential ϕ i scattered potential ϕ s and radiated potential ϕ r is then obtained after which the wave excitation force f e added mass a ω or added mass force f a and radiation damping b ω or radiation damping force f rd are calculated then the total external force exerted on each submodule is expressed as f t f e f a f rd f i n f hs here f in and f hs are the inertia force and hydrostatic restoring force respectively with the assumption that the total external force and the physical properties such as the mass and moment of inertia are concentrated on the centre of gravity of each submodule each submodule is simplified as a generalized lumped mass at the centre of gravity it is noted that the term generalized is used as this lumped mass is subjected to both forces and moments and it has both translational and rotational displacements then the original hydroelasticity problem is now transformed into a new one where a segmented beam is subjected to several concentrated external forces and it is constrained by a connector the euler bernoulli beam deflection theory is used to obtain the vertical displacement bending and torsional moment and shear force of the floating structure under waves when performing the multi body hydrodynamic analysis the fore and back sides of the submodules that face each other are not meshed because this will lead to numerical problems in the boundary value problem caused by the gap resonance phenomenon tuitman et al 2012 this is consistent with the actual situation in which the fore and back sides of the submodules do not exist for a continuous floating structure 2 1 1 multi rigid body hydrodynamic analysis 2 1 1 1 governing equations and boundary conditions under linear assumption and harmonic excitation a spatio temporal variable θ x y z t can be expressed as 1 θ x y z t ξ x y z e i ω t where ξ x y z is a space dependent complex variable ω is the circular frequency of the excitation t represents time and i is an imaginary unit which satisfies i 2 1 thus only the space dependent part of variables are considered in the following frequency domain analysis based on the assumptions of an ideal fluid incompressible non viscous and irrotational and linearity the velocity potential of the fluid in the global coordinate system oxyz is expressed as 2 ϕ x y z ϕ i ϕ s m ϕ r m which is controlled by the laplace equations 2 ϕ 0 in the fluid domain ω and satisfies proper boundary conditions which will be given later the motion of a rigid body is characterized by six components corresponding to six degrees of freedom dofs the six dof displacement of a submodule is denoted as ξ m ξ 1 m ξ 2 m ξ 3 m ξ 4 m ξ 5 m ξ 6 m t m 1 2 n 1 n 2 here ξ j m j 1 2 3 represent the translational displacements of the centre of gravity of a submodule along the x m y m and z m axis respectively while ξ j m j 4 5 6 are the rotation angles around the x m y m and z m axis respectively with the definition of the displacement of each submodule the radiated potential ϕ r m may be re expressed as 3 ϕ r m j 1 6 ϕ j r m i ω j 1 6 ξ j m φ j r m where φ j r m is the radiated velocity potential induced by the jth dof motion of the mth submodule with an unitary motion amplitude the boundary conditions for the velocity potential are given as follows 4 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z z 0 0 o n s f ϕ z z

dispersion relationship ω 2 g k t a n h k h 2 1 1 2 total external force exerted on the centre of gravity of each submodule the three dimensional green function method is used to numerically solve the problem and obtain the scattered and radiated velocity potentials faltinsen 1993 after that the pressure p on the wetted surface of each submodule can be obtained using the linearized bernoulli equations 6 p ρ i ω ϕ ρ g ξ 3 ξ 4 y ξ 5 x the hydrodynamic loads on the floating system are normally divided into two parts namely 1 the forces and moments on the body when the structure is restrained from oscillating and it is subjected to the incident regular waves these loads correspond to the wave excitation forces and they are composed of the so called froude krylov forces and moments calculated with the incident potential ϕ i and the loads related to scattered waves calculated with the scattered potential ϕ s 2 the loads on the body when the structure is forced to oscillate with the wave excitation frequency in any rigid body motion mode there are no incident waves the hydrodynamic loads are identified as added mass and damping terms calculated with the radiation potential ϕ r the hydrostatic restoring coefficients are calculated based on hydrostatics and the calculation of hydrostatic forces requires the solution of the equation of motion for the structure the j th order j 1 2 6 wave excitation force of the mth submodule in the body fixed coordinate system is given as 7 f j e m s m ρ i ω ϕ i ϕ s n j m d s the j th order radiation force of the mth submodule caused by the pth mode of motion of the qth submodule is expressed as 8 a j p m q ω 2 ξ p q i ω ξ p q b j p m q f j p a m q f j p rd m q f j p r m q ω 2 ξ p q ρ s m φ p r q φ j r m n m d s where a j p m q and b j p m q denote the added mass and radiation damping coefficients in the jth mode of the submodule m caused by the pth oscillation mode of the qth submodule respectively the j th order hydrostatic restoring force of the mth submodule is given as follows 9 f j hs m s m ρ g ξ 3 m ξ 4 m y m ξ 5 m x m n j m d s c j m m ξ where c j m m whose dimension is 1 6 is the jth row of the hydrostatic coefficient matrix for the mth submodule according to eqs 7 9 the hydrodynamic forces can be re expressed in the matrix form as 10 f e f e 1 f e 2 f e n 1 n 2 6 n 1 6 n 2 1 11 f a ω 2 a ω ξ ω 2 a 11 a

dimension for these sub matrices is 6 6 the values can be obtained from eqs 7 9 the inertia force is expressed as follows 14 f i n ω 2 m ξ ω 2 m 1 0 0 0 m 2 0 0 0 m n 1 n 2 6 n 1 6 n 2 6 n 1 6 n 2 ξ 1

of each submodule is thus expressed as 15 f t f e f a f rd f hs f i n 2 1 2 structural dynamics as aforementioned each submodule of the system is simplified as a lumped mass at its centre of gravity and the adjacent lumped masses are connected by a beam element to approximately account for the structural deformation see fig 3 thus the original problem is now transformed into a new one in which a segmented beam is subjected to several concentrated external forces and restrained by a connector the structural parameters of the equivalent beam element between two adjacent lumped masses are determined according to the physical and geometrical properties of the original floating structure we consider two lumped masses p and q connected by a euler bernoulli beam element e fig 4 the displacements at two ends of the beam element which are also the displacements of the lump mass p and q are denoted as ξ p and ξ q respectively the forces exerted on the lumped mass p and q induced by the structural deformation of the beam element are denoted as f s t p and f s t q respectively it is noted that the dimension for the above mentioned four vectors is 6 1 the forces and displacements at two ends of the beam element can be related by a structural stiffness matrix 16 f s t p f s t q k e ξ p ξ q k e p p k e p q k e q p k e q q ξ p ξ q where k e whose dimension is 12 12 is the structural stiffness matrix of a beam element the form of which is given in appendix a k e p p k e p q k e q p and k e q q represent the 6 6 sub block matrices of the stiffness matrix k e 12 12 of a beam element e with two nodes p and q a detailed explanation of the stiffness matrix can be found in the reference mcguire et al 2000 special care is required for dealing with the beam elements at the free free ends e 0 and e n 1 n 2 in fig 3 and at the two sides of the connector e c 1 and e c 2 in fig 3 for the beam element e 0 the forces and displacements are expressed as 17 0 f s t 1 k 0 ξ 0 ξ 1 k 0 0 0 k 0 0 1 k 0 1 0 k 0 1 1 ξ 0 ξ 1 after some manipulation of eq 17 we have 18 f s t 1 k 0 1 0 k 0 0 0 1 k 0 0 1 k 0 1 1 ξ 1 k 0 1 1 ξ 1 similarly we can obtain 19 f s t n 1 n 2 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 n 1 n 2 1 1 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 n 1 n 2 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 ξ n 1 n 2 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 ξ n 1 n 2 as shown in fig 5 the displacements of two nodes l and r of the connector are denoted as ξ l and ξ r respectively the forces of the two nodes caused by the connector are denoted as f c l and f c r respectively the dimension for these four vectors is 6 1 the stiffness matrix of the connector in six degrees of freedom is denoted as 20 k c 6 6 k 1 c k 2 c k 3 c k 4 c k 5 c k 6 c then the forces of the two nodes of the connector can be related to the corresponding displacements as follows 21 f c l f c r k c k c k c k c ξ l ξ r the value of the stiffness matrix k c depends on the type of the connector for example if the connector is a hinge allowing rotation around y axis the components k jc j 1 2 3 4 6 should be given with a large value to approximate the infinite stiffness in these degrees of freedom while the value of k 5c is 0 this approach to consider the connection is referred to as stiffness approximation method sam the sam approach has advantages over the constraint matrix method feng and bai 2017 when the time domain analysis is performed based on frequency domain results for the entire structure the forces exerted on the lumped masses and of the two nodes of the connector due to the structural deformation are denoted as f st and are expressed by combining the results of each beam element as follows 22 f st f st 1 f st 2 f st n 1 f st l f st r f st n 1 1 f st n 1 n 2 k st ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n 1 ξ l ξ r ξ n 1 1 ξ n 1 n 2 where k st is the stiffness matrix of the entire structure and it is given by overlaying the beam element and connector stiffness matrix the expression for k st is given in appendix b now both the total external force f t and the structural deformation induced force f st on the lumped masses and the two nodes of the connector are obtained according to the d alembert s principle the two forces should balance each other i e 23 f t f s t 0 it should be noted that the total external force f t in eq 23 has been extended to include the terms relevant to the two nodes of the connector see appendix c by substituting eqs 10 15 and eq 22 into eq 23 we can obtain 24 ω 2 m a ω i ω b ω c k st ξ f e eq 24 is the frequency domain equation of motion for an interconnected two module flexible structure in waves it should be noted that the structural damping is neglected in the present methodology this is reasonable because the structural damping is relatively negligible with respect to the hydrodynamic damping by solving eq 24 the six dof motion of each lumped mass is obtained then the total external force exerted on the lumped masses is known as well now the original problem is transformed into a new one in which a segmented beam is subjected to concentrated forces see fig 3 the beam bending theory can be adopted to solve the deformation and forces at any cross section of the floating structure refer to sun et al 2018 the forces on the connector can also be obtained 2 1 3 determination of the natural frequencies of an interconnected flexible structure to determine the natural frequencies of a floating system is important when it comes to the structural safety of traditional floating structures or the power capture of wave energy devices by ignoring the radiation damping and wave excitation forces eq 24 may be used to determine the natural frequencies 25 ω nt 2 m a ω nt c k st ξ n t 0 where ω nt and ξ n t represent the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of an interconnected flexible structure respectively by setting m ˆ m a ω nt and k ˆ c k st we re write eq 25 as 26 ω nt 2 m ˆ ξ n t k ˆ ξ n t if m ˆ is a full rank matrix then the inverse of the matrix exists which is denoted as m ˆ 1 then eq 26 is re written as 27 ω nt 2 ξ n t m ˆ 1 k ˆ ξ n t mathematically speaking the square of the natural frequencies are the eigenvalues of the matrix m ˆ 1 k ˆ and the corresponding oscillation modes are the eigenvectors of the matrix m ˆ 1 k ˆ for a continuous flexible structure m ˆ is indeed a full rank matrix and the above mentioned analysis is valid however when a connector is considered the matrix m ˆ is no longer full rank see appendix c therefore eq 27 cannot be directly used to solve the natural frequencies of an interconnected floating structure recalling eq 22 it can be seen that the difference of the displacement vector ξ nt between the continuous and interconnected floating structure is that the latter contains components related to the two nodes of the connector ξ nt l and ξ nt r we re arrange the components of the displacement vector by putting ξ nt l and ξ nt r to the last two of the vector and keeping the others unchanged this new displacement vector is denoted as 28 ξ nt ξ n t 1 ξ n t 2 ξ n t n 1 ξ n t n 1 1 ξ n t n 1 n 2 ξ n t l ξ n t r ξ n t lm ξ n t cn where ξ n t lm whose dimension is 6 n 1 n 2 1 is the displacement vector for all lumped masses and ξ n t cn whose dimension is 12 1 for the two nodes of the connector the corresponding manipulation is performed for m ˆ and k ˆ and the new expressions are denoted as m and k respectively eq 26 can be re expressed using the new expressions as follows 29 ω nt 2 m ξ nt ω nt 2 m l m 0 ξ n t lm ξ n t cn k ξ nt k l m l m k l m cn k c n l m k c n c n ξ n t lm ξ n t cn where the dimensions for the sub matrices m l m k l m l m k l m cn k c n l m and k c n c n are 6 n 1 n 2 6 n 1 n 2 6 n 1 n 2 6 n 1 n 2 6 n 1 n 2 12 12 6 n 1 n 2 and 12 12 respectively then we can obtain from the second row of eq 29 30 ξ nt cn k c n c n 1 k c n l m ξ nt lm substituting eq 30 into the first row of eq 29 we can obtain 31 ω nt 2 m l m ξ n t lm k l m l m k l m cn k c n c n 1 k c n l m ξ n t lm it should be noted that m l m is a full rank matrix thus eq 31 can be re expressed as 32 ω nt 2 ξ nt lm m l m 1 k l m l m k l m cn k c n c n 1 k c n l m ξ nt lm eq 32 can be solve directly to obtain the natural frequencies and corresponding motion modes of an interconnected floating flexible structure 2 2 hydroelastic analysis in time domain by assuming linear behaviour and considering impulses in the components of motion cummins 1962 established a vector integro differential equation to describe the motion of floating structures in time domain which is known as cummins equation for an interconnected floating flexible structure in waves the equations of motion in time domain utilizing the frequency domain hydroelasticity method described in section 2 1 are given in the global coordinate system as follows 33 m a ξ t 0 t γ t τ ξ τ d τ c k st ξ t f e t where f e t is the wave excitation force in time domain ξ t ξ t and ξ t represent the displacement velocity and acceleration of the lumped masses and the two nodes of the connector in time domain it is noted that eq 33 is established on the lumped masses or the centres of gravity for all submodules the convolution terms in eq 33 captures the fluid memory effect γ t is the retardation function which can be related to the radiation damping as follows ogilvie 1964 34 γ t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω a is the added mass at the infinite frequency ω which can be expressed as 35 a a ω 1 ω 0 γ t sin ω t d t lim ω a ω if we denote equivalent forces on all lumped masses caused by the additional external unsteady loads as f un t for example the forces caused by the movement of vehicles on the floating bridge or by the take off and landing of airplanes on the floating airport the equations of motion of an interconnected floating flexible structure subjected to both wave and additional unsteady loads are given as follows 36 m a ξ t 0 t γ t τ ξ τ d τ c k st ξ t f e t f u n t where the expression of f un t is determined according to the specific problem concerned eq 36 can be numerically solved using the 4th runge kutta method the procedure of which is given in appendix d 3 validation of the time domain method the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method is first validated by the hydroelastic response of a vlfs model yago and endo 1996 under waves with no unsteady external dynamic loads the vlfs model is a continuous shallow draft flexible box with dimensions and characteristics given in table 1 fu et al 2007 created an interconnected structure by dividing the continuous vlfs model yago and endo 1996 into two identical modules by setting the stiffness of the connector as k 5 c 0 the vlfs model was taken as a hinged two module flexible structure both the continuous and interconnected vlfs model are adopted for the validation as no external unsteady loads are considered f un t in eq 36 is set as 0 when the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method is applied to a continuous flexible structure some modifications need to be made for the stiffness matrix of the entire structure shown in appendix b and for the hydrodynamic coefficients shown in appendix c the rows and columns which are related to the two nodes of the connector should be removed from the matrices the comparison of the time domain results with both frequency domain results and experimental results refer to yago and endo 1996 for the continuous vlfs is given in fig 6 two different values of wave length i e 120 m 0 4 times the vlfs length and 300 m equals the vlfs length were chosen for the comparison the continuous vlfs structure is discretised into 8 submodules refer to lu et al 2016 the fast fourier transform fft algorithm was adopted to obtain the vertical displacement amplitude from time series it can be seen that the time domain results agree well with results calculated by the present frequency domain hydroelasticity method section 2 1 moreover both the present time domain and frequency domain results show rather good agreement with experimental data similarly for the interconnected hinged vlfs the time domain results calculated using the present time domain method section 2 2 are compared with frequency domain results calculated using both the present frequency domain method section 2 1 and the three dimensional hydroelasticity method based on modal expansion method fu et al 2007 as suggested by sun et al 2018 each module of the hinged vlfs is divided into 4 identical submodules it can be seen from fig 7 that the agreement is rather good the good agreement indicated in figs 6 and 7 gives us confidence for the following analysis of the transient response of a vlfs under external unsteady loads when performing time domain analysis numerical error may exist for example when calculating the retardation function using eq 34 the frequency has to be cut off at a high value the approximate retardation function will also affect the accuracy of the added mass at infinity frequency see eq 35 by comparing the time domain results with frequency domain results it can be determined whether the cut off frequency is reasonable the results shown in figs 6 and 7 indicate that the cut off frequency adopted provides acceptable accuracy for time domain analysis 4 application of the time domain method for a vlfs under unsteady loads 4 1 the weight drop test for a continuous vlfs in calm water 4 1 1 description of the test first the time domain hydroelasticity method is used for simulating the weight drop test conducted by endo and yago 1999 the tested model is called vl 10 which is a 1 30 77 scaled model of the vlfs prototype shown in table 1 the weight drop test is taken as a typical impulsive experiment in this experiment the vertical displacement at points z1 z9 in fig 8 were measured a weight of 196n was dropped from a height of 0 12 m onto the hit point as shown in fig 8 the distance between the middle of the vl 10 labelled as z5 in fig 8 and the hit point is 3 81 m the acceleration of the weight during the impact was measured and the result was normalized by the acceleration due to gravity g see fig 9 as a result the dimensionless acceleration multiplied by 196n is regarded as the impact load caused by the weight drop it should be noted that when performing numerical analysis all physical or geometrical parameters are transferred to the prototype scale 4 1 2 a strategy for dealing with unsteady loads in the time domain model the impact load in the weight drop test can be simplified as a point load which means that the external load is exerted on a given point of the flexible structure for the present time domain hydroelasticity method the equations of motion are established on the centre of gravity of each submodule of the flexible structure as shown in fig 10 the vlfs is discretised into 8 submodules for the time domain hydroelastic analysis we denote the impact load as f d r o p t the position of which may not be at the centre of gravity for any of eight submodules therefore we need to seek a solution for transferring f d r o p t to the equivalent unsteady external loads f un t which are exerted on the centres of gravity for all submodules the strategy for dealing with the unsteady impact load in the weight drop test is illustrated in fig 11 suppose that at the time instant t t n the displacement ξ t n and the impact load f drop t n are known before using eq 36 to calculate the displacement at the next time step t t n 1 step 1 shown in fig 11 at the time instant t t n should be implemented namely the impact load f drop t n should be transferred on the centre of gravity for each submodule as equivalent loads f un t n the transfer of loads makes use of the quasi static deflection based on the d alembert s principle at t t n the force f drop t n m a ξ t n 0 t n γ t n τ ξ τ d τ leads to a quasi static incremental deflection δ ξ s t n which is calculated after some manipulations of eq 36 as follows 37 c k st δ ξ s t n f drop t n m a ξ t n 0 t n γ t n τ ξ τ d τ the equivalent f un t n is obtained by assuming that this load together with the inertia force and the radiation force including added mass and radiation damping forces will lead to the same quasi static incremental deflection as indicated in eq 37 therefore the equivalent f un t n is described by 38 c k st δ ξ s t n f un t n m a ξ t n 0 t n γ t n τ ξ τ d τ for both cases the quasi static deflections caused by the inertia and radiation forces are identical this is obvious as these two forces are the same in eq 37 and eq 38 and thus we only need to ensure that the quasi static incremental deflections caused by f drop t n and f un t n are identical eq 37 and eq 38 can then be reduced as follows 39 c k st δ ξ s t n f drop t n 40 c k st δ ξ s t n f un t n if we can solve the quasi static incremental displacement or deflection vector δ ξ s t n for 8 submodules induced by the impact load f drop t n from eq 39 the equivalent external loads f un t n can be obtained using eq 40 when solving eq 39 we use a different discretisation of the vlfs for example the vlfs is discretised into n 1 300 submodules much larger than 8 submodules used in hydroelastic analysis by setting a number of submodules of very small size the point load can be regarded as acting on the centre of gravity for one particular submodule for example the j 1 t h submodule the hydrostatic restoring coefficient matrix and the total structural stiffness matrix are noted as c 1 and k st 1 respectively the dimension is 6n 1 6n 1 for both matrices the quasi static incremental displacement vector is noted as δ ξ s 1 t n with the dimension 6n 1 1 a new form of eq 39 is obtained as follows 41 c 1 k st 1 δ ξ s 1 t n c 1 k st 1 δ ξ s 1 1 t n δ ξ s 1 2 t n δ ξ s 1 j 1 t n δ ξ s 1 n 1 t n 0 0 f drop t n 0 solving eq 41 gives the quasi static incremental displacement δ ξ s 1 t n of the whole flexible structure caused by the impact load during the drop test at the time instant t t n consequently the corresponding quasi static incremental displacement δ ξ s t n at the centre of gravity for each submodule totally 8 submodules in the hydroelastic analysis see fig 10 is also known which is substituted into eq 40 to calculate the unsteady loads f un t n subsequently the second step is carried out by substituting f un t n into eq 36 with f e t 0 to solve for the vertical displacement of the flexible structure at the next time step t t n 1 see fig 11 then the above mentioned two steps can be repeated to continuously update the vertical displacement of the flexible structure 4 1 3 numerical results for the weight drop test fig 12 shows the vertical displacements at the point z1 z9 obtained using the present time domain hydroelasticity method the experimental data are also plotted for comparison it should be noted that in fig 12 all results are presented in the prototype scale of the vlfs overall the agreement between numerical results and experimental results is favourable considering that the displacement at the model scale vl 10 is of the order of several millimetres and the duration of the transient response is quite short for the point z1 and z2 near the hit point it can be seen that the numerically calculated displacements are smaller in amplitude than experimental results this may be caused by the difference in the effective area of the impact load between the real situation and the idealized computation the size of the dropped weight is finite in the experiment while in the numerical simulation this weight is taken as an idealized point load for the points z3 z8 the numerical results vary less intensively have less high frequency oscillations compared to the experimental data the input for the numerical simulation see fig 9 is quite smooth and it may lose the high frequency signals which are expected to exist in the experiment by ignoring high frequency oscillations in the input the output i e the numerically calculated response may also lose some high frequency oscillations 4 2 the moving point load test for a continuous vlfs in calm water in this section the present time domain hydroelasticity method is used for simulating the moving point load test conducted by endo and yago 1999 the flexible structure is also the vl 10 model a 1 30 77 scaled model of the vlfs shown in table 1 as shown in fig 13 in the test a movable weight which weighs 6 9 kg 201016 kg in the prototype scale was translated on the runway from x l 0 19 to 0 9 with almost constant velocity 0 61 m s 12 2 km h in the prototype scale the strategy for dealing with the unsteady external loads caused by the movement of the weight is similar as that outlined in section 4 1 2 for each time step in the simulation we have the position of the moving point load x 0 t and the point load f moving x 0 t t this is different from the weight drop test in which the impact position is unchanged with time the procedure indicated in section 4 1 2 is used in each time step to obtain the equivalent unsteady loads f un t on each submodule of the flexible structure the structure is also divided into 8 submodules for the hydroelastic analysis after that the numerical simulation is performed by solving eq 36 with f e t set as 0 the numerical results are given in fig 14 together with experimental data for the purpose of comparison the vertical displacements at the points z1 z5 and z7 are given in the prototype scale it can be seen that the numerical results calculated using the present time domain hydroelasticity method show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data given by endo and yago 1999 this further validates the proposed numerical methodologies for calculating the transient response of a continuous flexible structure under unsteady external loads for the point z1 the numerical result has a more intensive variation high frequency oscillations compared to the experimental one especially at the beginning of the simulation a possible reason is that in the experiment the small amplitude high frequency oscillation may be damped by the real fluid effect such as viscous damping and structural damping all these effects are ignored in the numerical model in addition based on the fact that the experimental results for all three points are quite smooth these data may have been filtered with high frequency signals removed 4 3 transient response of an interconnected vlfs under both waves and unsteady external loads in this section a more complicated case will be considered the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method is used for the transient response of an interconnected vlfs under both wave loads and unsteady external loads which are chosen as moving point loads following fu et al 2007 we create an interconnected structure by dividing the continuous vlfs model yago and endo 1996 into two identical modules by setting the stiffness of the connector as k 5 c 0 the vlfs model was taken as a hinged two module flexible structure the geometrical and physical parameters of the vlfs can be referred to table 1 each module of the hinged vlfs is discretised into 4 submodules for the hydroelastic analysis in time domain in the numerical model a movable mass of 800000 kg was translated from the left side of the structure with constant velocity 5 m s from the time instant t 40s see fig 15 the amplitude and length of regular waves are 1 m and 420 m respectively the corresponding wave period is 19 55s for a water depth of 58 5 m considered here before performing the numerical simulation for the transient response of the vlfs under wave and unsteady external loads we investigate the natural frequencies and the corresponding oscillation modes for the vlfs using the approach proposed in section 2 1 3 as each module of the interconnected vlfs is discretised into 4 submodules the dimension for the displacement vector in eq 32 is 48 1 as stated before the square of natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors respectively derived from eq 32 therefore there are 48 natural frequencies and corresponding oscillation modes for the present discretisation i e 8 submodules it is noted that the consideration of a larger number of submodules to discretise the interconnected flexible structure will lead to a larger number of natural frequencies and oscillation modes what we concern is the heave and pitch motion of the centre of gravity of each submodule fig 16 shows three examples of calculated oscillation modes corresponding to three different natural frequencies or equivalently three different natural periods respectively we denote the natural period of the flexible structure as t 0 the oscillation mode corresponding to the natural period t 0 11 88s is the rigid body mode i e two rigid modules rotating around the hinge connection for t 0 9 46s although two modules still rotate around the hinge each of them shows structural deformation the oscillation mode corresponding to the natural period t 0 12 02s is the overall pitch motion no relative rotation around the hinge with structural deformation of each module based on the natural frequency analysis we find that the wave adopted for the following simulation wave length is 420 m will not trigger the resonance of the interconnected flexible structure the choice of such a wave length is reasonable because in reality the vlfs should be designed to avoid the occurrence of resonance for dominant frequencies of the wave spectrum for a given sea state the vertical displacement of the structure excited by the combination of wave and moving load is given in fig 17 it can be seen from fig 17 a that before the point load is exerted on the structure the deflection or the vertical displacement of the structure is periodic as the incident regular wave is periodic the contour of response of the structure is characterized by periodically varied oblique band of different colour it can be seen that the maximum structural deflection occurs at the middle where the hinge is applied and at the ends of structure where the deepest red colour of contour exists in fig 17 a from 40s a point load is exerted on the structure and moves forwards with a uniform velocity the dynamic response of the structure is affected by the moving load with positive upward deflection decreased and negative downward deflection increased the time series of structural deflection at different locations of the structure together with input waves are shown in fig 17 b g which shows clearly the effects of the moving point load on the dynamic response of the structure it should be noted that in this section we do not intend to provide an extensive analysis of the dynamic response of a flexible structure with moving point loads for different parameters of wave structure and point loads our purpose here is just to choose a case to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for dealing with such a complex problem the bending moment of the structure excited by the combination of wave and moving load is given in fig 18 the contour of the bending moment fig 18 a highlights the significant effects of the moving point loads the maximum bending moment is almost doubled due to the influence of the moving point loads compared with the bending moment of structure induced only by waves fig 18 b d show the time series of the bending moment for different locations along the longitudinal direction of the structure as both ends of the structure is free the bending moment at x l 0 0 5 and 1 is 0 which is not shown in fig 18 it can be seen that before the point load is put on the structure the time series of bending moment is smoothly sinusoidal after the point load is exerted an increase of bending moment occurs at x l 0 25 the bending moment is almost doubled moreover high frequency oscillation also appears as a disturbance to the wave frequency time series of bending moment to the authors knowledge no experimental results for such cases are available in open literature therefore there is no comparison between the present numerical results and other experimental data 5 conclusions a time domain discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity method is developed to investigate the transient response of vlfss under unsteady external loads this time domain method follows the idea of hybrid frequency time domain approach based on cummins equations first in frequency domain the hydroelasticity approach based on multi rigid body hydrodynamics and euler bernoulli beam bending theory is used to establish the equations of motion each module of an interconnected flexible structure is discretised into several rigid submodules the multi rigid body hydrodynamic theory is used to calculate the total external forces exerted on the centre of gravity of each submodule which include the wave excitation forces added mass forces radiation damping forces hydrostatic restoring forces and inertia forces after that each submodule is simplified as a generalized lumped mass at its centre of gravity the adjacent lumped masses are connected by a beam element to account for the effect of the structural deformation therefore each lumped mass is now subjected to both the total external forces and the forces induced by the structural deformation then the equations of motion for the flexible structure are established in frequency domain by considering the equilibrium of forces on each lumped mass and the displacement continuity at the connection based on the frequency domain hydroelastic motion equations an approach is proposed for determining the natural frequencies and the corresponding oscillation modes of an interconnected floating flexible structure which is important for both the structural safety of traditional floating system and the power capture for wave energy devices the equations of motion in frequency domain are then transformed into time domain following the idea of cummins equations an effective strategy is established for dealing with the unsteady point loads on the flexible structure i e transferring the unsteady point loads to the equivalent loads on the centre of gravity of each submodule by using the hydrostatic analysis of the flexible structure in calm water the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method is used for simulating a weight drop test and a moving point load test of a continuous vlfs in calm water good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is observed finally the time domain method is used for simulating a more complicated case where an interconnected flexible structure is subjected to the combination of wave and unsteady external loads this case is representative of an airplane moving on the floating airport or a vehicle moving on a floating bridge the numerical results highlight the significant effects of the moving point load on both vertical displacement and bending moment of the interconnected flexible structures acknowledgement this

23191,a time domain method is developed for estimating the transient response of very large floating structures under unsteady external loads the hybrid frequency time domain approach based on cummins equations is adopted first the discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity method in which a flexible structure is discretised into several rigid submodules connected by beam elements is used to establish the equations of motion for a flexible structure in frequency domain the equations of motion in frequency domain are transformed into time domain following the idea of cummins equations the unsteady external loads at any point of the flexible structure are transferred to the centre of gravity of each submodule using the hydrostatic analysis of a beam in calm water good agreements are obtained between the numerical and experimental data for a weight drop test and a moving point load test of a continuous flexible structure in calm water which validates the present time domain method finally the time domain method is used for simulating the transient response of an interconnected flexible structure under the combination of wave and unsteady external loads which highlights the significant effects of moving point loads on both the vertical displacement and bending moment of the structure keywords vlfs waves time domain hydroelasticity unsteady loads transient response 1 introduction very large floating structures vlfss which have various applications such as large floating bridges airports storage facilities and emergency bases have received considerable attention in both civil and ocean engineering fields wang et al 2007 due to the great length and width of this type of structure its flexural rigidity is relatively small and the elastic deformations are more important than the rigid body motions as a result the hydroelasticity theory has been developed to account for the coupling of fluid motion and structural deformation under linear assumption and harmonic excitation the hydroelastic response of a vlfs can be analysed in frequency domain a classical hydroelastic tool to analyse the interaction between the fluid and vlfss was developed by bishop and price 1979 since then many researchers have contributed to various aspects of this field consequently two numerical methods i e direct method and mode superposition method have been developed for the hydroelastic analysis of a vlfs loukogeorgaki et al 2012 in the direct method the equation of motion for a flexible structure is solved directly using conceptually full modes of the discretised system namba and ohkusu 1999 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 eatock taylor 2003 2007 ohkusu and namba 2004 and kim et al 2007 the mode superposition method utilizes the concept of generalized flexible modes and divides the hydroelastic problem into diffraction and radiation problems for each mode an analogy to the traditional hydrodynamic analysis for rigid body motions the procedure for the hydroelastic analysis using the mode superposition method contains three steps 1 evaluation of the natural oscillation modes dry modes senjanovic et al 2008a b or wet modes humamoto and fujita 2002 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 michailides et al 2013 of the flexible structure 2 hydrodynamic analysis for each mode the added mass radiation damping and wave excitation force and 3 superposition of all modes together and solution of the coupled modal equation to obtain the hydroelastic response of the flexible structure the mode superposition method has been widely adopted by many researchers to investigate the hydroelastic response of vlfss fu et al 2007 dong et al 2010 gao et al 2011 unlike the traditional direct method or the mode superposition method lu et al 2016 proposed a frequency domain discrete module beam bending based method for the hydroelastic analysis of a continuous vlfs in this method a continuous flexible structure is discretised into several submodules which are treated as rigid bodies the hydrodynamic forces the wave excitation and the radiation forces on each submodule are determined by using the multi body hydrodynamic analysis using hydrodynamic codes such as wamit lee and newman 2013 or hydrostar veritas 2010 total external forces including the inertia forces hydrostatic forces and hydrodynamic forces are assumed to be exerted on the centre of gravity of each submodule and each submodule is then simplified as a generalized lumped mass which is subjected to both forces and moments at the centre of gravity a beam element is adopted to connect two adjacent lumped masses to account for the structural deformation this idea is to some extent similar to the mass spring model used in mooring system analysis huang 1992 the difference is that the latter ignores the bending and torsional effects and thus a spring element is used to connect two adjacent masses to model the tension in mooring systems however for the flexible structure studied by lu et al 2016 all three effects i e tension bending and torsion are important and should be considered in the analysis of the structure in order to achieve this an imaginary beam instead of a spring can be applied to connect the adjacent lumped masses this approach gets an advantage over traditional ones by avoiding the predetermination of the oscillation modes of flexible structures which sometimes becomes very hard or even impossible for complex interconnected floating structures because of the strong coupling between the connector and global deformation modes of the structure sun et al 2018 extended the discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity method proposed by lu et al 2016 to analyse the hydroelastic response of a hinged vlfs in waves the results agreed well with those obtained by traditional mode superposition methods it should be noted that in sun s work the shearing forces of the hinge connection were directly calculated after solving the motion equations by using a constraint matrix method the constraint matrix is used to constrain the displacement due to the hinge this method is more straightforward than the additional generalized mode approach proposed by newman 1997 the latter may be difficult to implement for calculating the shearing forces of connections when the connections are complicated wei et al 2017 further developed the frequency domain method proposed by lu et al 2016 to predict the hydroelastic behaviour of floating structures in inhomogeneous seabed and wave field conditions some other applications of the discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity method can be referred to xu et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 considering the purpose of vlfss such as floating bridges and floating airport external unsteady dynamic loads may be introduced during the passage of vehicles or landing and take off of an airplane such loads will induce significant transient behaviour of the flexible structure this may affect the safety of the structure therefore the transient hydrodynamic response of vlfss is of practical importance and must be clearly clarified at the design stage when unsteady dynamic loads which are usually nonlinear on vlfs are considered the frequency domain method mentioned above is not applicable due to the limitation of linear assumption time domain approach is therefore an appropriate solution although the fully nonlinear potential flow model feng and bai 2017 or the viscous numerical wave tank technique nematbakhsh et al 2017 is capable of calculating wave fields and body motions simultaneously in time domain the hybrid frequency time domain method based on cummins equations taghipour et al 2008 is still favoured due to its convenience and low computational cost in this method the linear problem is first solved in the frequency domain and then the input output are transformed into time domain by fourier inverse transform and the nonlinear effects are accounted for as additional loads this hybrid frequency time domain approach was used by kashiwagi 2000 2004 and lee et al 2001 to investigate the transient response of a vlfs under unsteady dynamic loads a special care was paid to numerical accuracy in computing the memory effect function and the added mass at infinite frequency the frequency domain results in their analysis were obtained using the modal superposition method other applications of cummins equation based time domain method can be referred to rajendran et al 2016 and sengupta et al 2017 in addition to the hybrid frequency time domain method several direct time domain approaches were also developed qiu 2007 2009 applied a time domain finite element method to analyse the transient response of a floating beam excited by landing loads this was based on the direct method by coupling the equations of beam deflection and pressure cheng et al 2014 developed a direct time domain method using the time domain free surface green functions to investigate the transient behaviour of a vfls during unsteady external loads in waves based on the recently developed frequency domain hydroelasticity method lu et al 2016 a time domain method is developed in the present paper to investigate the transient response of vlfss under unsteady dynamic loads this follows the idea of the hybrid frequency time domain approach first the hydroelastic response of a vlfs is analysed in frequency domain using the approach proposed by lu et al 2016 then fourier inverse transform is adopted to transform the frequency domain results into time domain the unsteady dynamic load can be added to the time domain motion equations to perform the numerical analysis the weight drop test and moving weight test for a continuous vlfs in calm water conducted by endo and yago 1999 are adopted for validation of the present method after that the transient response of an interconnected vlfs under both waves and unsteady external loads is investigated using the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method 2 methodology 2 1 hydroelastic analysis in frequency domain the frequency domain discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity approach for a continuous flexible structure proposed by lu et al 2016 is adopted and extended to an interconnected flexible structure this hydroelasticity approach was inspired by comparing the differences of vertical motions between a rigid floating structure and a flexible one both of which have a larger dimension in the longitudinal direction than in other directions for a rigid body the heave and pitch motion correspond to an unchanged vertical displacement and rotation angle along the longitudinal direction respectively however for a flexible structure both the vertical displacement and rotation angle will vary along the longitudinal direction in order to approximate this deflection feature i e varied vertical displacement and rotation angle along the longitudinal direction the continuous structure is discretised into several rigid submodules which are freely floating as all submodules are freely floating their vertical displacements and rotation angles also vary along the longitudinal direction of the structure however there must be some differences of the vertical motions between the multi rigid submodule floating system and the original flexible floating structure the latter s vertical motion is also constrained by structural deformation while the former is not so this is the reason why a beam element is used to connect or constrain two adjacent rigid submodules in order to approximate the structural deformation inherent in the original flexible structure the general procedure for performing the hydroelastic analysis for a vlfs here the vlfs consists of two connected modules which is a simplified case for an interconnected multi module floating structure with the discrete module and euler bernoulli beam assumptions is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 2 three coordinate systems are adopted to describe the wave induced motion of the interconnected multi module floating system the global coordinate system oxyz the reference coordinate system o m x m y m z m m 1 2 n 1 n 2 and the body fixed local coordinate system o m x m y m z m the global coordinate system is fixed in space with oxy located at the still water level and z axis positive upwards the reference coordinate system is always parallel to the global coordinate system with the origin located at the centre of gravity for each submodule at rest the body fixed coordinate system coincides with the reference coordinate system at the initial stage but then moves with each submodule each module of the vlfs is discretised into several rigid submodules which are connected by elastic beams multi body hydrodynamic theory based on linear and rigid body assumption is applied to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction between these submodules the velocity potential of the fluid field including the incident potential ϕ i scattered potential ϕ s and radiated potential ϕ r is then obtained after which the wave excitation force f e added mass a ω or added mass force f a and radiation damping b ω or radiation damping force f rd are calculated then the total external force exerted on each submodule is expressed as f t f e f a f rd f i n f hs here f in and f hs are the inertia force and hydrostatic restoring force respectively with the assumption that the total external force and the physical properties such as the mass and moment of inertia are concentrated on the centre of gravity of each submodule each submodule is simplified as a generalized lumped mass at the centre of gravity it is noted that the term generalized is used as this lumped mass is subjected to both forces and moments and it has both translational and rotational displacements then the original hydroelasticity problem is now transformed into a new one where a segmented beam is subjected to several concentrated external forces and it is constrained by a connector the euler bernoulli beam deflection theory is used to obtain the vertical displacement bending and torsional moment and shear force of the floating structure under waves when performing the multi body hydrodynamic analysis the fore and back sides of the submodules that face each other are not meshed because this will lead to numerical problems in the boundary value problem caused by the gap resonance phenomenon tuitman et al 2012 this is consistent with the actual situation in which the fore and back sides of the submodules do not exist for a continuous floating structure 2 1 1 multi rigid body hydrodynamic analysis 2 1 1 1 governing equations and boundary conditions under linear assumption and harmonic excitation a spatio temporal variable θ x y z t can be expressed as 1 θ x y z t ξ x y z e i ω t where ξ x y z is a space dependent complex variable ω is the circular frequency of the excitation t represents time and i is an imaginary unit which satisfies i 2 1 thus only the space dependent part of variables are considered in the following frequency domain analysis based on the assumptions of an ideal fluid incompressible non viscous and irrotational and linearity the velocity potential of the fluid in the global coordinate system oxyz is expressed as 2 ϕ x y z ϕ i ϕ s m ϕ r m which is controlled by the laplace equations 2 ϕ 0 in the fluid domain ω and satisfies proper boundary conditions which will be given later the motion of a rigid body is characterized by six components corresponding to six degrees of freedom dofs the six dof displacement of a submodule is denoted as ξ m ξ 1 m ξ 2 m ξ 3 m ξ 4 m ξ 5 m ξ 6 m t m 1 2 n 1 n 2 here ξ j m j 1 2 3 represent the translational displacements of the centre of gravity of a submodule along the x m y m and z m axis respectively while ξ j m j 4 5 6 are the rotation angles around the x m y m and z m axis respectively with the definition of the displacement of each submodule the radiated potential ϕ r m may be re expressed as 3 ϕ r m j 1 6 ϕ j r m i ω j 1 6 ξ j m φ j r m where φ j r m is the radiated velocity potential induced by the jth dof motion of the mth submodule with an unitary motion amplitude the boundary conditions for the velocity potential are given as follows 4 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z z 0 0 o n s f ϕ z z

body fixed coordinate system more details can be referred to falnes 2002 the incident potential satisfying the boundary condition eq 4 is given as follows falnes 2002 5 ϕ i x y z i g a ω cosh k z h

dispersion relationship ω 2 g k t a n h k h 2 1 1 2 total external force exerted on the centre of gravity of each submodule the three dimensional green function method is used to numerically solve the problem and obtain the scattered and radiated velocity potentials faltinsen 1993 after that the pressure p on the wetted surface of each submodule can be obtained using the linearized bernoulli equations 6 p ρ i ω ϕ ρ g ξ 3 ξ 4 y ξ 5 x the hydrodynamic loads on the floating system are normally divided into two parts namely 1 the forces and moments on the body when the structure is restrained from oscillating and it is subjected to the incident regular waves these loads correspond to the wave excitation forces and they are composed of the so called froude krylov forces and moments calculated with the incident potential ϕ i and the loads related to scattered waves calculated with the scattered potential ϕ s 2 the loads on the body when the structure is forced to oscillate with the wave excitation frequency in any rigid body motion mode there are no incident waves the hydrodynamic loads are identified as added mass and damping terms calculated with the radiation potential ϕ r the hydrostatic restoring coefficients are calculated based on hydrostatics and the calculation of hydrostatic forces requires the solution of the equation of motion for the structure the j th order j 1 2 6 wave excitation force of the mth submodule in the body fixed coordinate system is given as 7 f j e m s m ρ i ω ϕ i ϕ s n j m d s the j th order radiation force of the mth submodule caused by the pth mode of motion of the qth submodule is expressed as 8 a j p m q ω 2 ξ p q i ω ξ p q b j p m q f j p a m q f j p rd m q f j p r m q ω 2 ξ p q ρ s m φ p r q φ j r m n m d s where a j p m q and b j p m q denote the added mass and radiation damping coefficients in the jth mode of the submodule m caused by the pth oscillation mode of the qth submodule respectively the j th order hydrostatic restoring force of the mth submodule is given as follows 9 f j hs m s m ρ g ξ 3 m ξ 4 m y m ξ 5 m x m n j m d s c j m m ξ where c j m m whose dimension is 1 6 is the jth row of the hydrostatic coefficient matrix for the mth submodule according to eqs 7 9 the hydrodynamic forces can be re expressed in the matrix form as 10 f e f e 1 f e 2 f e n 1 n 2 6 n 1 6 n 2 1 11 f a ω 2 a ω ξ ω 2 a 11 a

n 2 1 where a p q b p q and c p q p q 1 2 n 1 n 2 are the added mass radiation damping and restoring coefficient matrix of the pth submodule induced by the motion of the qth submodule respectively the dimension for these sub matrices is 6 6 the values can be obtained from eqs 7 9 the inertia force is expressed as follows 14 f i n ω 2 m ξ ω 2 m 1 0 0 0 m 2 0 0 0 m n 1 n 2 6 n 1 6 n 2 6 n 1 6 n 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n 1 n 2 6 n 1 6 n 2 1 where m p p 1 2 n 1 n 2 is the 6 6 mass matrix of the pth submodule the details of m p can refer to faltinsen 1993 the total external force exerted on the centre of gravity of each submodule is thus expressed as 15 f t f e f a f rd f hs f i n 2 1 2 structural dynamics as aforementioned each submodule of the system is simplified as a lumped mass at its centre of gravity and the adjacent lumped masses are connected by a beam element to approximately account for the structural deformation see fig 3 thus the original problem is now transformed into a new one in which a segmented beam is subjected to several concentrated external forces and restrained by a connector the structural parameters of the equivalent beam element between two adjacent lumped masses are determined according to the physical and geometrical properties of the original floating structure we consider two lumped masses p and q connected by a euler bernoulli beam element e fig 4 the displacements at two ends of the beam element which are also the displacements of the lump mass p and q are denoted as ξ p and ξ q respectively the forces exerted on the lumped mass p and q induced by the structural deformation of the beam element are denoted as f s t p and f s t q respectively it is noted that the dimension for the above mentioned four vectors is 6 1 the forces and displacements at two ends of the beam element can be related by a structural stiffness matrix 16 f s t p f s t q k e ξ p ξ q k e p p k e p q k e q p k e q q ξ p ξ q where k e whose dimension is 12 12 is the structural stiffness matrix of a beam element the form of which is given in appendix a k e p p k e p q k e q p and k e q q represent the 6 6 sub block matrices of the stiffness matrix k e 12 12 of a beam element e with two nodes p and q a detailed explanation of the stiffness matrix can be found in the reference mcguire et al 2000 special care is required for dealing with the beam elements at the free free ends e 0 and e n 1 n 2 in fig 3 and at the two sides of the connector e c 1 and e c 2 in fig 3 for the beam element e 0 the forces and displacements are expressed as 17 0 f s t 1 k 0 ξ 0 ξ 1 k 0 0 0 k 0 0 1 k 0 1 0 k 0 1 1 ξ 0 ξ 1 after some manipulation of eq 17 we have 18 f s t 1 k 0 1 0 k 0 0 0 1 k 0 0 1 k 0 1 1 ξ 1 k 0 1 1 ξ 1 similarly we can obtain 19 f s t n 1 n 2 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 n 1 n 2 1 1 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 n 1 n 2 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 ξ n 1 n 2 k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 ξ n 1 n 2 as shown in fig 5 the displacements of two nodes l and r of the connector are denoted as ξ l and ξ r respectively the forces of the two nodes caused by the connector are denoted as f c l and f c r respectively the dimension for these four vectors is 6 1 the stiffness matrix of the connector in six degrees of freedom is denoted as 20 k c 6 6 k 1 c k 2 c k 3 c k 4 c k 5 c k 6 c then the forces of the two nodes of the connector can be related to the corresponding displacements as follows 21 f c l f c r k c k c k c k c ξ l ξ r the value of the stiffness matrix k c depends on the type of the connector for example if the connector is a hinge allowing rotation around y axis the components k jc j 1 2 3 4 6 should be given with a large value to approximate the infinite stiffness in these degrees of freedom while the value of k 5c is 0 this approach to consider the connection is referred to as stiffness approximation method sam the sam approach has advantages over the constraint matrix method feng and bai 2017 when the time domain analysis is performed based on frequency domain results for the entire structure the forces exerted on the lumped masses and of the two nodes of the connector due to the structural deformation are denoted as f st and are expressed by combining the results of each beam element as follows 22 f st f st 1 f st 2 f st n 1 f st l f st r f st n 1 1 f st n 1 n 2 k st ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n 1 ξ l ξ r ξ n 1 1 ξ n 1 n 2 where k st is the stiffness matrix of the entire structure and it is given by overlaying the beam element and connector stiffness matrix the expression for k st is given in appendix b now both the total external force f t and the structural deformation induced force f st on the lumped masses and the two nodes of the connector are obtained according to the d alembert s principle the two forces should balance each other i e 23 f t f s t 0 it should be noted that the total external force f t in eq 23 has been extended to include the terms relevant to the two nodes of the connector see appendix c by substituting eqs 10 15 and eq 22 into eq 23 we can obtain 24 ω 2 m a ω i ω b ω c k st ξ f e eq 24 is the frequency domain equation of motion for an interconnected two module flexible structure in waves it should be noted that the structural damping is neglected in the present methodology this is reasonable because the structural damping is relatively negligible with respect to the hydrodynamic damping by solving eq 24 the six dof motion of each lumped mass is obtained then the total external force exerted on the lumped masses is known as well now the original problem is transformed into a new one in which a segmented beam is subjected to concentrated forces see fig 3 the beam bending theory can be adopted to solve the deformation and forces at any cross section of the floating structure refer to sun et al 2018 the forces on the connector can also be obtained 2 1 3 determination of the natural frequencies of an interconnected flexible structure to determine the natural frequencies of a floating system is important when it comes to the structural safety of traditional floating structures or the power capture of wave energy devices by ignoring the radiation damping and wave excitation forces eq 24 may be used to determine the natural frequencies 25 ω nt 2 m a ω nt c k st ξ n t 0 where ω nt and ξ n t represent the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of an interconnected flexible structure respectively by setting m ˆ m a ω nt and k ˆ c k st we re write eq 25 as 26 ω nt 2 m ˆ ξ n t k ˆ ξ n t if m ˆ is a full rank matrix then the inverse of the matrix exists which is denoted as m ˆ 1 then eq 26 is re written as 27 ω nt 2 ξ n t m ˆ 1 k ˆ ξ n t mathematically speaking the square of the natural frequencies are the eigenvalues of the matrix m ˆ 1 k ˆ and the corresponding oscillation modes are the eigenvectors of the matrix m ˆ 1 k ˆ for a continuous flexible structure m ˆ is indeed a full rank matrix and the above mentioned analysis is valid however when a connector is considered the matrix m ˆ is no longer full rank see appendix c therefore eq 27 cannot be directly used to solve the natural frequencies of an interconnected floating structure recalling eq 22 it can be seen that the difference of the displacement vector ξ nt between the continuous and interconnected floating structure is that the latter contains components related to the two nodes of the connector ξ nt l and ξ nt r we re arrange the components of the displacement vector by putting ξ nt l and ξ nt r to the last two of the vector and keeping the others unchanged this new displacement vector is denoted as 28 ξ nt ξ n t 1 ξ n t 2 ξ n t n 1 ξ n t n 1 1 ξ n t n 1 n 2 ξ n t l ξ n t r ξ n t lm ξ n t cn where ξ n t lm whose dimension is 6 n 1 n 2 1 is the displacement vector for all lumped masses and ξ n t cn whose dimension is 12 1 for the two nodes of the connector the corresponding manipulation is performed for m ˆ and k ˆ and the new expressions are denoted as m and k respectively eq 26 can be re expressed using the new expressions as follows 29 ω nt 2 m ξ nt ω nt 2 m l m 0 ξ n t lm ξ n t cn k ξ nt k l m l m k l m cn k c n l m k c n c n ξ n t lm ξ n t cn where the dimensions for the sub matrices m l m k l m l m k l m cn k c n l m and k c n c n are 6 n 1 n 2 6 n 1 n 2 6 n 1 n 2 6 n 1 n 2 6 n 1 n 2 12 12 6 n 1 n 2 and 12 12 respectively then we can obtain from the second row of eq 29 30 ξ nt cn k c n c n 1 k c n l m ξ nt lm substituting eq 30 into the first row of eq 29 we can obtain 31 ω nt 2 m l m ξ n t lm k l m l m k l m cn k c n c n 1 k c n l m ξ n t lm it should be noted that m l m is a full rank matrix thus eq 31 can be re expressed as 32 ω nt 2 ξ nt lm m l m 1 k l m l m k l m cn k c n c n 1 k c n l m ξ nt lm eq 32 can be solve directly to obtain the natural frequencies and corresponding motion modes of an interconnected floating flexible structure 2 2 hydroelastic analysis in time domain by assuming linear behaviour and considering impulses in the components of motion cummins 1962 established a vector integro differential equation to describe the motion of floating structures in time domain which is known as cummins equation for an interconnected floating flexible structure in waves the equations of motion in time domain utilizing the frequency domain hydroelasticity method described in section 2 1 are given in the global coordinate system as follows 33 m a ξ t 0 t γ t τ ξ τ d τ c k st ξ t f e t where f e t is the wave excitation force in time domain ξ t ξ t and ξ t represent the displacement velocity and acceleration of the lumped masses and the two nodes of the connector in time domain it is noted that eq 33 is established on the lumped masses or the centres of gravity for all submodules the convolution terms in eq 33 captures the fluid memory effect γ t is the retardation function which can be related to the radiation damping as follows ogilvie 1964 34 γ t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω a is the added mass at the infinite frequency ω which can be expressed as 35 a a ω 1 ω 0 γ t sin ω t d t lim ω a ω if we denote equivalent forces on all lumped masses caused by the additional external unsteady loads as f un t for example the forces caused by the movement of vehicles on the floating bridge or by the take off and landing of airplanes on the floating airport the equations of motion of an interconnected floating flexible structure subjected to both wave and additional unsteady loads are given as follows 36 m a ξ t 0 t γ t τ ξ τ d τ c k st ξ t f e t f u n t where the expression of f un t is determined according to the specific problem concerned eq 36 can be numerically solved using the 4th runge kutta method the procedure of which is given in appendix d 3 validation of the time domain method the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method is first validated by the hydroelastic response of a vlfs model yago and endo 1996 under waves with no unsteady external dynamic loads the vlfs model is a continuous shallow draft flexible box with dimensions and characteristics given in table 1 fu et al 2007 created an interconnected structure by dividing the continuous vlfs model yago and endo 1996 into two identical modules by setting the stiffness of the connector as k 5 c 0 the vlfs model was taken as a hinged two module flexible structure both the continuous and interconnected vlfs model are adopted for the validation as no external unsteady loads are considered f un t in eq 36 is set as 0 when the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method is applied to a continuous flexible structure some modifications need to be made for the stiffness matrix of the entire structure shown in appendix b and for the hydrodynamic coefficients shown in appendix c the rows and columns which are related to the two nodes of the connector should be removed from the matrices the comparison of the time domain results with both frequency domain results and experimental results refer to yago and endo 1996 for the continuous vlfs is given in fig 6 two different values of wave length i e 120 m 0 4 times the vlfs length and 300 m equals the vlfs length were chosen for the comparison the continuous vlfs structure is discretised into 8 submodules refer to lu et al 2016 the fast fourier transform fft algorithm was adopted to obtain the vertical displacement amplitude from time series it can be seen that the time domain results agree well with results calculated by the present frequency domain hydroelasticity method section 2 1 moreover both the present time domain and frequency domain results show rather good agreement with experimental data similarly for the interconnected hinged vlfs the time domain results calculated using the present time domain method section 2 2 are compared with frequency domain results calculated using both the present frequency domain method section 2 1 and the three dimensional hydroelasticity method based on modal expansion method fu et al 2007 as suggested by sun et al 2018 each module of the hinged vlfs is divided into 4 identical submodules it can be seen from fig 7 that the agreement is rather good the good agreement indicated in figs 6 and 7 gives us confidence for the following analysis of the transient response of a vlfs under external unsteady loads when performing time domain analysis numerical error may exist for example when calculating the retardation function using eq 34 the frequency has to be cut off at a high value the approximate retardation function will also affect the accuracy of the added mass at infinity frequency see eq 35 by comparing the time domain results with frequency domain results it can be determined whether the cut off frequency is reasonable the results shown in figs 6 and 7 indicate that the cut off frequency adopted provides acceptable accuracy for time domain analysis 4 application of the time domain method for a vlfs under unsteady loads 4 1 the weight drop test for a continuous vlfs in calm water 4 1 1 description of the test first the time domain hydroelasticity method is used for simulating the weight drop test conducted by endo and yago 1999 the tested model is called vl 10 which is a 1 30 77 scaled model of the vlfs prototype shown in table 1 the weight drop test is taken as a typical impulsive experiment in this experiment the vertical displacement at points z1 z9 in fig 8 were measured a weight of 196n was dropped from a height of 0 12 m onto the hit point as shown in fig 8 the distance between the middle of the vl 10 labelled as z5 in fig 8 and the hit point is 3 81 m the acceleration of the weight during the impact was measured and the result was normalized by the acceleration due to gravity g see fig 9 as a result the dimensionless acceleration multiplied by 196n is regarded as the impact load caused by the weight drop it should be noted that when performing numerical analysis all physical or geometrical parameters are transferred to the prototype scale 4 1 2 a strategy for dealing with unsteady loads in the time domain model the impact load in the weight drop test can be simplified as a point load which means that the external load is exerted on a given point of the flexible structure for the present time domain hydroelasticity method the equations of motion are established on the centre of gravity of each submodule of the flexible structure as shown in fig 10 the vlfs is discretised into 8 submodules for the time domain hydroelastic analysis we denote the impact load as f d r o p t the position of which may not be at the centre of gravity for any of eight submodules therefore we need to seek a solution for transferring f d r o p t to the equivalent unsteady external loads f un t which are exerted on the centres of gravity for all submodules the strategy for dealing with the unsteady impact load in the weight drop test is illustrated in fig 11 suppose that at the time instant t t n the displacement ξ t n and the impact load f drop t n are known before using eq 36 to calculate the displacement at the next time step t t n 1 step 1 shown in fig 11 at the time instant t t n should be implemented namely the impact load f drop t n should be transferred on the centre of gravity for each submodule as equivalent loads f un t n the transfer of loads makes use of the quasi static deflection based on the d alembert s principle at t t n the force f drop t n m a ξ t n 0 t n γ t n τ ξ τ d τ leads to a quasi static incremental deflection δ ξ s t n which is calculated after some manipulations of eq 36 as follows 37 c k st δ ξ s t n f drop t n m a ξ t n 0 t n γ t n τ ξ τ d τ the equivalent f un t n is obtained by assuming that this load together with the inertia force and the radiation force including added mass and radiation damping forces will lead to the same quasi static incremental deflection as indicated in eq 37 therefore the equivalent f un t n is described by 38 c k st δ ξ s t n f un t n m a ξ t n 0 t n γ t n τ ξ τ d τ for both cases the quasi static deflections caused by the inertia and radiation forces are identical this is obvious as these two forces are the same in eq 37 and eq 38 and thus we only need to ensure that the quasi static incremental deflections caused by f drop t n and f un t n are identical eq 37 and eq 38 can then be reduced as follows 39 c k st δ ξ s t n f drop t n 40 c k st δ ξ s t n f un t n if we can solve the quasi static incremental displacement or deflection vector δ ξ s t n for 8 submodules induced by the impact load f drop t n from eq 39 the equivalent external loads f un t n can be obtained using eq 40 when solving eq 39 we use a different discretisation of the vlfs for example the vlfs is discretised into n 1 300 submodules much larger than 8 submodules used in hydroelastic analysis by setting a number of submodules of very small size the point load can be regarded as acting on the centre of gravity for one particular submodule for example the j 1 t h submodule the hydrostatic restoring coefficient matrix and the total structural stiffness matrix are noted as c 1 and k st 1 respectively the dimension is 6n 1 6n 1 for both matrices the quasi static incremental displacement vector is noted as δ ξ s 1 t n with the dimension 6n 1 1 a new form of eq 39 is obtained as follows 41 c 1 k st 1 δ ξ s 1 t n c 1 k st 1 δ ξ s 1 1 t n δ ξ s 1 2 t n δ ξ s 1 j 1 t n δ ξ s 1 n 1 t n 0 0 f drop t n 0 solving eq 41 gives the quasi static incremental displacement δ ξ s 1 t n of the whole flexible structure caused by the impact load during the drop test at the time instant t t n consequently the corresponding quasi static incremental displacement δ ξ s t n at the centre of gravity for each submodule totally 8 submodules in the hydroelastic analysis see fig 10 is also known which is substituted into eq 40 to calculate the unsteady loads f un t n subsequently the second step is carried out by substituting f un t n into eq 36 with f e t 0 to solve for the vertical displacement of the flexible structure at the next time step t t n 1 see fig 11 then the above mentioned two steps can be repeated to continuously update the vertical displacement of the flexible structure 4 1 3 numerical results for the weight drop test fig 12 shows the vertical displacements at the point z1 z9 obtained using the present time domain hydroelasticity method the experimental data are also plotted for comparison it should be noted that in fig 12 all results are presented in the prototype scale of the vlfs overall the agreement between numerical results and experimental results is favourable considering that the displacement at the model scale vl 10 is of the order of several millimetres and the duration of the transient response is quite short for the point z1 and z2 near the hit point it can be seen that the numerically calculated displacements are smaller in amplitude than experimental results this may be caused by the difference in the effective area of the impact load between the real situation and the idealized computation the size of the dropped weight is finite in the experiment while in the numerical simulation this weight is taken as an idealized point load for the points z3 z8 the numerical results vary less intensively have less high frequency oscillations compared to the experimental data the input for the numerical simulation see fig 9 is quite smooth and it may lose the high frequency signals which are expected to exist in the experiment by ignoring high frequency oscillations in the input the output i e the numerically calculated response may also lose some high frequency oscillations 4 2 the moving point load test for a continuous vlfs in calm water in this section the present time domain hydroelasticity method is used for simulating the moving point load test conducted by endo and yago 1999 the flexible structure is also the vl 10 model a 1 30 77 scaled model of the vlfs shown in table 1 as shown in fig 13 in the test a movable weight which weighs 6 9 kg 201016 kg in the prototype scale was translated on the runway from x l 0 19 to 0 9 with almost constant velocity 0 61 m s 12 2 km h in the prototype scale the strategy for dealing with the unsteady external loads caused by the movement of the weight is similar as that outlined in section 4 1 2 for each time step in the simulation we have the position of the moving point load x 0 t and the point load f moving x 0 t t this is different from the weight drop test in which the impact position is unchanged with time the procedure indicated in section 4 1 2 is used in each time step to obtain the equivalent unsteady loads f un t on each submodule of the flexible structure the structure is also divided into 8 submodules for the hydroelastic analysis after that the numerical simulation is performed by solving eq 36 with f e t set as 0 the numerical results are given in fig 14 together with experimental data for the purpose of comparison the vertical displacements at the points z1 z5 and z7 are given in the prototype scale it can be seen that the numerical results calculated using the present time domain hydroelasticity method show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data given by endo and yago 1999 this further validates the proposed numerical methodologies for calculating the transient response of a continuous flexible structure under unsteady external loads for the point z1 the numerical result has a more intensive variation high frequency oscillations compared to the experimental one especially at the beginning of the simulation a possible reason is that in the experiment the small amplitude high frequency oscillation may be damped by the real fluid effect such as viscous damping and structural damping all these effects are ignored in the numerical model in addition based on the fact that the experimental results for all three points are quite smooth these data may have been filtered with high frequency signals removed 4 3 transient response of an interconnected vlfs under both waves and unsteady external loads in this section a more complicated case will be considered the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method is used for the transient response of an interconnected vlfs under both wave loads and unsteady external loads which are chosen as moving point loads following fu et al 2007 we create an interconnected structure by dividing the continuous vlfs model yago and endo 1996 into two identical modules by setting the stiffness of the connector as k 5 c 0 the vlfs model was taken as a hinged two module flexible structure the geometrical and physical parameters of the vlfs can be referred to table 1 each module of the hinged vlfs is discretised into 4 submodules for the hydroelastic analysis in time domain in the numerical model a movable mass of 800000 kg was translated from the left side of the structure with constant velocity 5 m s from the time instant t 40s see fig 15 the amplitude and length of regular waves are 1 m and 420 m respectively the corresponding wave period is 19 55s for a water depth of 58 5 m considered here before performing the numerical simulation for the transient response of the vlfs under wave and unsteady external loads we investigate the natural frequencies and the corresponding oscillation modes for the vlfs using the approach proposed in section 2 1 3 as each module of the interconnected vlfs is discretised into 4 submodules the dimension for the displacement vector in eq 32 is 48 1 as stated before the square of natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors respectively derived from eq 32 therefore there are 48 natural frequencies and corresponding oscillation modes for the present discretisation i e 8 submodules it is noted that the consideration of a larger number of submodules to discretise the interconnected flexible structure will lead to a larger number of natural frequencies and oscillation modes what we concern is the heave and pitch motion of the centre of gravity of each submodule fig 16 shows three examples of calculated oscillation modes corresponding to three different natural frequencies or equivalently three different natural periods respectively we denote the natural period of the flexible structure as t 0 the oscillation mode corresponding to the natural period t 0 11 88s is the rigid body mode i e two rigid modules rotating around the hinge connection for t 0 9 46s although two modules still rotate around the hinge each of them shows structural deformation the oscillation mode corresponding to the natural period t 0 12 02s is the overall pitch motion no relative rotation around the hinge with structural deformation of each module based on the natural frequency analysis we find that the wave adopted for the following simulation wave length is 420 m will not trigger the resonance of the interconnected flexible structure the choice of such a wave length is reasonable because in reality the vlfs should be designed to avoid the occurrence of resonance for dominant frequencies of the wave spectrum for a given sea state the vertical displacement of the structure excited by the combination of wave and moving load is given in fig 17 it can be seen from fig 17 a that before the point load is exerted on the structure the deflection or the vertical displacement of the structure is periodic as the incident regular wave is periodic the contour of response of the structure is characterized by periodically varied oblique band of different colour it can be seen that the maximum structural deflection occurs at the middle where the hinge is applied and at the ends of structure where the deepest red colour of contour exists in fig 17 a from 40s a point load is exerted on the structure and moves forwards with a uniform velocity the dynamic response of the structure is affected by the moving load with positive upward deflection decreased and negative downward deflection increased the time series of structural deflection at different locations of the structure together with input waves are shown in fig 17 b g which shows clearly the effects of the moving point load on the dynamic response of the structure it should be noted that in this section we do not intend to provide an extensive analysis of the dynamic response of a flexible structure with moving point loads for different parameters of wave structure and point loads our purpose here is just to choose a case to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for dealing with such a complex problem the bending moment of the structure excited by the combination of wave and moving load is given in fig 18 the contour of the bending moment fig 18 a highlights the significant effects of the moving point loads the maximum bending moment is almost doubled due to the influence of the moving point loads compared with the bending moment of structure induced only by waves fig 18 b d show the time series of the bending moment for different locations along the longitudinal direction of the structure as both ends of the structure is free the bending moment at x l 0 0 5 and 1 is 0 which is not shown in fig 18 it can be seen that before the point load is put on the structure the time series of bending moment is smoothly sinusoidal after the point load is exerted an increase of bending moment occurs at x l 0 25 the bending moment is almost doubled moreover high frequency oscillation also appears as a disturbance to the wave frequency time series of bending moment to the authors knowledge no experimental results for such cases are available in open literature therefore there is no comparison between the present numerical results and other experimental data 5 conclusions a time domain discrete module beam bending based hydroelasticity method is developed to investigate the transient response of vlfss under unsteady external loads this time domain method follows the idea of hybrid frequency time domain approach based on cummins equations first in frequency domain the hydroelasticity approach based on multi rigid body hydrodynamics and euler bernoulli beam bending theory is used to establish the equations of motion each module of an interconnected flexible structure is discretised into several rigid submodules the multi rigid body hydrodynamic theory is used to calculate the total external forces exerted on the centre of gravity of each submodule which include the wave excitation forces added mass forces radiation damping forces hydrostatic restoring forces and inertia forces after that each submodule is simplified as a generalized lumped mass at its centre of gravity the adjacent lumped masses are connected by a beam element to account for the effect of the structural deformation therefore each lumped mass is now subjected to both the total external forces and the forces induced by the structural deformation then the equations of motion for the flexible structure are established in frequency domain by considering the equilibrium of forces on each lumped mass and the displacement continuity at the connection based on the frequency domain hydroelastic motion equations an approach is proposed for determining the natural frequencies and the corresponding oscillation modes of an interconnected floating flexible structure which is important for both the structural safety of traditional floating system and the power capture for wave energy devices the equations of motion in frequency domain are then transformed into time domain following the idea of cummins equations an effective strategy is established for dealing with the unsteady point loads on the flexible structure i e transferring the unsteady point loads to the equivalent loads on the centre of gravity of each submodule by using the hydrostatic analysis of the flexible structure in calm water the proposed time domain hydroelasticity method is used for simulating a weight drop test and a moving point load test of a continuous vlfs in calm water good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is observed finally the time domain method is used for simulating a more complicated case where an interconnected flexible structure is subjected to the combination of wave and unsteady external loads this case is representative of an airplane moving on the floating airport or a vehicle moving on a floating bridge the numerical results highlight the significant effects of the moving point load on both vertical displacement and bending moment of the interconnected flexible structures acknowledgement this

23192,the aim of this paper is to develop a coupled nonlinear time domain simulation scheme for nonlinear interactions among sloshing flows and floating body motion for both regular and irregular wave excitation the contributions of a variety of nonlinear factors outside waves and inside sloshing induced forces as well as their influences on body coupled sway and roll motion were investigated the induced forces are due to the changes in the transient wet surface of the floating body and full nonlinear sloshing the effects of tank fill ratio and excitation wave height on the nonlinear coupled motion as well as the relationship between sloshing and floating body nonlinear coupled motion under large wave amplitudes and severe sea conditions were also investigated and the results are presented finally the numerical solutions are compared with existing experimental result the fully nonlinear sloshing and floating body coupled motion are simulated based on the potential flow theory with the transient position hydrodynamic assumption the boundary value problem is solved by the b spline higher order panel method the isitimfb iterative semi implicit time integration method for floating bodies is applied to solve for the body s velocity and displacements the sloshing energy dissipation is modeled by changing the boundary condition on the tank s solid boundaries an extended principle to determine the energy dissipation coefficient for both regular and irregular cases is extracted then the sloshing and floating body nonlinear coupled motion under large wave amplitudes and severe sea conditions are investigated and the numerical solutions are compared with existing experimental results the effects of tank fill ratio and excitation wave height on the nonlinear coupled motion is also investigated keywords nonlinear time domain simulation sloshing isitimfb energy dissipation 1 introduction loading and offloading operations of vessels such as fpsos and lng carriers near shore or in the open sea can cause liquid sloshing in the carrier s insulated tanks which are very large and partially filled with fluid violent sloshing waves can generate large loads which can damage the structure or influence stability vessel sway and roll motion in this coupled system both the global motions of the floating body and the tank sloshing flows will influence each other the literature review revealed several interesting studies on this topic generally the studies can be categorized into two approaches 1 the linear frequency domain approach based on potential theory molin et al 2002 malenica et al 2003 and 2 the time domain approach according to previous studies the assumption of linear sloshing and ship motion appears adequate in small amplitude coupled motion analysis however even if the incident wave is small and in the linear region violent nonlinear sloshing can occur due to resonance sloshing induced impact pressure can lead to a significant change in the transient wet surface and balance position of the hull in a certain frequency range the hydrodynamic load characteristics on the hull are nonlinear which inherently cannot be accounted for in linear theory some conclusions that can be drawn from previous studies include the following sloshing may be violent which can be modeled by navier stokes equation and nonlinear potential theory model the motion of floating structures can be linear or nonlinear but at the outside of the wave it is linear hydrodynamic forces can be calculated in the frequency domain or by strip theory froude krylov forces can be nonlinear the current study focuses on the influencing characteristics of sloshing and coupled effects on ship motions to model these the behaviors of both the external and the internal flow are needed for the external flow models based on linear potential theory are used and are accurate enough in most cases except for viscous effects such as roll damping faltinsen and timokha 2009 for the internal flow models based on linear potential theory and computational fluid dynamics cfd are used sloshing is a nonlinear phenomenon especially in resonance conditions although in some cases it is possible to accurately predict the coupled sloshing and ship motions by using linear theory rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 cfd methods account for nonlinearity in sloshing that cannot be ignored in some cases kim 2002 2003 presented a series of numerical results of the anti rolling tank and ship coupled motion by using a finite difference method and the commercial sea keeping program lamp kim et al 2007 nam et al 2009 and lee et al 2007 studied the coupled effects between the ship motion and the sloshing flows by using the impulse response function irf formulation for linear ship motion and a cfd simulation for nonlinear sloshing flows li et al 2012 investigated the coupled motion of sloshing and ship motion using the stf irf method for ship motion and the cfd model openfoam for the nonlinear sloshing flows the coupled model is established for the motion response of the ship in waves coupled with induced internal sloshing and their effects on sloshing induced impact loads which was analyzed by jiang 2014 and xue et al 2017 the linear ship motion is solved with an impulse irf method combined with openfoam to address the viscous sloshing flow however generally speaking cfd methods calculation time is prohibitively long and a more computationally efficient solution for the problem is needed a study of global ship motion coupled with tank sloshing using potential flow theory for flow inside and outside the vessel was conducted by hong et al 2012 and ning et al 2012 the research shows that the wave elevation and pressure can be obtained exactly if a highly nonlinear phenomenon does not occur a 2 d coupled numerical code was developed considering nonlinear sloshing and linear ship motions based on a boundary element method and later the results were verified by a series of corresponding model tests by zhao et al 2014 zhang 2016 extended the modal decomposition method for floating vessel simulations and developed an explicit seakeeping sloshing decoupling approach in this method the exact acceleration of a vessel at any instant is calculated explicitly in one step without iterations three dimensional cases of a floating vessel with four nonlinear sloshing tanks were also simulated this method was further used by wang et al 2017 in their 2d simulations su and liu 2017 also investigated the coupling effects of barge motion and sloshing using a nonlinear boussinesq type approach in terms of velocity potential for the sloshing simulation in the preliminary investigation on the coupling mechanism between ship motions and nonlinear sloshing roll motion is most affected compared to other degrees of freedom faltinsen and timokha 2001 2005 found that the damping due to viscous energy dissipation in the form of sloshing wave spilling and breaking in a certain frequency range plays an important role in determining the coupled motion and it must be carefully considered in the past such problems have been analyzed by using the navier stokes equations su et al 1982 and hamlin et al 1986 the calculation time of this method is prohibitively long so a more computationally efficient solution based on potential theory is considered with potential theory viscous effects are neglected and so development is needed to resolve an appropriate dissipation effect kim and shin 2008 proposed to add a damping term to the free surface condition unfortunately this approach introduces two damping coefficients which are not easy to define for modeling the coupled motions of ships with sloshing in internal tanks malenica et al 2003 proposed a model that modifies the tank wall condition instead of the free surface condition but it is only suitable for frequency domain analysis this method was improved by huang et al 2011 who reported a new energy dissipation condition which is applicable to time domain simulation the nonlinear body boundary conditions of a floating body and tank sloshing are complex the accurate calculation of the velocity potential for the time derivative is critical to obtain the correct pressure and force on the body surface at each time step to decouple this mutual dependence some methods have been suggested in the literature such as the indirect method wu and eatock 1994 the mode decomposition method koo and kim 2004 and the iterative method yan and ma 2007 each method has its own advantages and disadvantages in this paper the iterative method is applied due to the importance of nonlinearities for sloshing and to obtain the probability density functions of response variables caused by sloshing there are still many uncertainties in the methods described in the literature the method based on the linear assumption fails to incorporate the strong nonlinearities of internal sloshing and the transient position hydrodynamic nonlinearities of external ship motion while the cfd method can be prohibitively time consuming thus establishing a fast efficient time domain prediction technique which is capable of considering the strong nonlinear sloshing flows and nonlinear ship motion to simulate the real motion of vessels like an lng carrier or fpso in regular and irregular waves is necessary for vessel design a good understanding of the ship s performance and reliability is required however to date there has been a lack of systematic investigation of the nonlinear effects analysis of sloshing and ship coupled motion especially applied to sloshing energy dissipation in the present study a nonlinear numerical model is developed to examine the violent sloshing coupled with the floating body motion the fully nonlinear model the linear free surface condition and the transient nonlinear body condition satisfy the green function adopted to solve for the inner tank flow and the ship s outer domain in the numerical implementation the isitimfb iterative semi implicit time integration method for floating bodies is applied to solve for the body s velocity and displacements with high efficiency with acceptable accuracy the sloshing coupled with nonlinear floating body motion is simulated for large amplitudes of regular and irregular waves and the numerical solutions are compared with the existing experimental results the change in wave and sloshing induced forces caused by the change in hull wet surface and the full nonlinear free surface of the internal fluid on sway and roll are analyzed in detail with consideration given to a variety of non linear contributions and mechanisms 2 numerical modeling method 2 1 coordinate system three cartesian co ordinate systems are defined in one o y z is fixed in space and in the others o y z and o t y t z t are fixed on the floating body and on the tank respectively when the tank and floating body are at rest the o y z and o y z systems coincide and their origins are at the center of the undisturbed free surface along the vertical line through the center of gravity of the floating body g 0 the transient wetted surface of the body under the free surface s f is defined as s h the positive direction of the normal vector n points to the outside of the fluid domain s ω the free surface of the tank liquid is defined as s t f and tank wall wetted surface as s t h the directions of the axes are shown in fig 1 the relationships between the coordinate frames are 1 y z y t z t t y z t u y t z t y z y o z o t y t z t t cos α sin α sin α cos α where t is the transformation matrix and α is the angle between frames oyz and oyz 2 2 modeling of fully nonlinear sloshing 2 2 1 the boundary value problem for tank sloshing an ideal fluid is assumed so that the fluid velocity can be described by the gradient of the velocity potential ϕ the governing equations of the velocity potential in o y z system is given by 2 2 ϕ 0 i n s ω ς t ϕ y ς y ϕ z 0 o n z ς y t ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 g ς 0 o n z ς y t ϕ n u n o n s t h ϕ 0 t 0 ϕ t 0 t 0 z 0 it can be seen that the free surface condition is more easily described in the o t y t z t moving coordinate system of the liquid tank substituting eq 1 into the free surface condition eq 2 produces the governing equation of the velocity potential in o t y t z t coordinate system as given by wu et al 1998a 3 2 ϕ 0 i n s ω ς b t ϕ y t u ς b y t ϕ z t w 0 o n z t ς b y t t ϕ t u ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 g z o t g t 21 y t t 22 ς b 0 o n z t ς b y t t ϕ n u o t ω r b n o n s t

to the point in consideration g is the gravitational acceleration and u and w are the components of u in the y t and z t directions respectively t i j are entries in the matrix t the incident wave is generated by the motion of the tank the outgoing wave is dissipated by an energy dissipation condition as described below in eq 6 at each time step the velocity potential and the corresponding free surface profiles are obtained by solving the discretized form of the following integral equation 4 c p φ p s ω φ g n g φ n d l 0 where g is the green function satisfying the laplace equation and c p is the solid angle for two dimensional problems the simple source g is given by g ln r p q where r p q is the distance between the source q ξ η and the field points p y z duan 1995 the sloshing induced force f s l o s h i n g can be calculated by integrating bernoulli s pressure over the tank instantaneous wetted surface the pressure in the fluid can be similarly evaluated in o t y t z t moving system by using 5 p ρ ϕ t u ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 g z o t g t 21 y t t 22 ς b 2 2 2 an approximation for sloshing energy dissipation the theoretical wave elevation given by eq 2 does not account for viscous effects and can diverge at the resonance frequency the energy dissipation from viscosity prevents divergence in experimental tests to obtain a theoretical solution in good agreement with the experimental results the viscous effect should be considered to consider the viscous effect in the velocity potential problem defined in eq 2 huang et al 2011 assumed that energy dissipation mainly occurs in the boundary layer near the tank wall while solving the sloshing problem in the time domain to approximate the dissipation the wall boundary condition is modified from ϕ n u n to 6 ϕ n u n μ g ϕ t n y n n y n z o n s t h where n y and n z are the respective components of n in the spatial system o y z and μ is the energy dissipation coefficient in eq 6 the term μ g ϕ t n y depends on the wetted tank surface shape and only becomes effective on a wall with a nonzero normal vector horizontal components substituting eq 1 into eq 6 the modified wall boundary condition in o t y t z t moving system is governed by 7 ϕ n u n μ g ϕ t t 11 n y t t 12 n z t μ g u ϕ t 11 n y t t 12 n z t o n s t h note that the time derivative of the velocity potential ϕ t is required for accurately solving for the boundary condition 2 2 3 velocity potential time derivative calculation in a moving system the simplest way to calculate the velocity potential time derivative ϕ t is to use a backward finite difference scheme however the scheme suffers from the problem of saw tooth instabilities sen 1993 an alternative approach wu 1998b is to find ϕ t by solving a similar boundary value problem to that for ϕ the advantage of this method is that not only ϕ t can be obtained on the free surface but also the energy dissipation items in the spatial system o y z the boundary value problem for ϕ t is defined by 8 2 ϕ t 0 i n s ω ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 g ς o n z ς y t n ϕ t u t ω r b ω u t n n u ϕ o n s t h applying ϕ t to eq 1 shows 9 n ϕ t y z n ϕ t u ϕ y t z t then substituting eq 9 into eq 8 the boundary value problem for ϕ t in o t y t z t moving system is governed by 10 2 ϕ t 0 i n s ω ϕ t u ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 g z o t g t 21 y t t 22 ς b o n z t ς b y t t n ϕ t y t z t u o t ω r b ω u o t n o n s t h there is also a difficulty with solving for the time derivative ϕ t of the velocity potential in eq 10 the accelerations of the body should be known when solving the boundary value problem for ϕ t in turn to compute the force ϕ t is needed it should be noted here that the energy dissipation term μ g ϕ t n y in eq 6 is not considered in the boundary value problem for ϕ t its effects are only computed in the iterative method the scheme to overcome these difficulties is discussed in detail in section 2 5 2 3 nonlinear floating body hydrodynamics modeling 2 3 1 body nonlinear boundary value problem waves with large amplitudes can induce large ship motions the nonlinear body case is developed to identify the nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic force of the freely floating body the incident wave velocity potential is given as ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ p ϕ 0 is a prescribed incident wave velocity potential the boundary conditions of the disturbance velocity potentials ϕ p are described by 11 2 ϕ p 0 i n s ω 2 ϕ

field boundary and the fluid domain bottom condition and the velocity potential in the fluid domain can be described by the following integral equation duan 1995 and huang and duan 2012 12 2 π ϕ p p t

x t where f e x t and n e x t are the total forces and moments acting on the floating body u c and ω are the accelerations of the gravitational centers and m and i are the mass and inertia matrices respectively combining the gravitational and the external hydrostatic forces to a restoring force the total force can be calculated as follows 16 f e x t f f s l o s h i n g k η 2 j c η 2 j m g k n e x t n n s l o s h i n g n c where k is the spring constant c is the damping coefficient and m is the mass of the floating body to overcome the divergent phenomena caused by integration of ϕ t after differentiating t in bernoulli s pressure over the instantaneous wetted surface at each time step which requires the hydrodynamic forces are resolved by integrating first and differentiating in a second stage duan 1995 the wave induced force f and the moment n can be evaluated by 17 f ρ d d t s h t ϕ n d s ρ s h t u n ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 n d s g s h t z n d s ρ ϕ a 0 t v t a b k n ρ d d t s h t ϕ r b n

non dimensional coefficient b is the beam of the floating body and l is its length 2 4 a high order panel method based on the combination b spline in the time domain a b spline higher order panel method is developed to solve the boundary value problem for a freely floating bod in this approach the body geometry x p and the unknown potential ϕ are defined by the b spline respectively at any instant t the unknown ϕ and ϕ n can be expressed by 19 ϕ n p t i 0 n 1 ϕ n i t n i 3 u x p t i 0 n 1 d i t n i 3 u p s f t ϕ p t j 0 n 2 ϕ j t n j 3 u x p t j 0 n 2 d j t n j 3 u p s b t where n i 3 u

surface and the walls multiple knots and end point conditions of the b spline are used thus the intersections of boundary and continuity conditions are written as 20 ϕ p n s f ϕ n i ϕ p s b ϕ j ϕ 0 s

start of the simulation to reduce the effect of undesired transient waves which increases simulation stability and brings the onset of steady state earlier the ramp function is 21 r t 1 for t 2 t 1 cos π t 2 t 2 for t 2 t the ramp function is applied in 2t or 4t wave period depending on the input wave height h below an iterative semi implicit time integration method for floating bodies developed by yan and ma 2007 is applied to calculate the velocities of the floating body and the time derivative of the velocity potential ϕ t suppose all calculations before t t n 1 have been finished and the velocity potential its time derivative on the free surface and the positions of all boundaries including the free surface and the body surface have been obtained through updating the only difference in this work is the effect of ϕ t on the sloshing energy dissipation term defined by eq 7 the modified method is summarized below note all calculations before t t n 1 are completed and the velocity potential its time derivative on the free surface and the positions of all boundaries including the free surface and the body surface have been obtained through updating 1 predict the body acceleration u n 0 at time t n by curve fitting the accelerations at previous time steps using a least square method and estimating the corresponding body velocity by using the adams moulton method william 1971 as follows 22 u n 0 u n 1 δ t 12 5 u n 0 8 u n 1 u n 2 where u n 0 and u n 0 represent the predicted body velocity and acceleration values respectively at the current time step which are used as the initial values of the iteration 2 solve the boundary value problem for ϕ and ϕ p by using u n 0 in eqs 3 and 11 for the boundary condition on the tank and body surfaces 3 calculate the fluid velocity and the time derivative of the velocity potential on the tank internal fluid free surface 4 solve the boundary value problem for ϕ t n k using u n k 1 and u n k 1 in its boundary condition where the subscript n k 1 represents the variables at time t n but at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 calculate the total forces f n k and the acceleration by using 23 u n k m 1 α n f n k 1 α n f n k 1 estimate the new body velocity u n k using the same method by solving eq 22 5 solve the boundary value problem for ϕ using u n 0 in eqs 3 and 11 but now the tank body surface condition is replaced by eq 7 check whether the relative error of the accelerations or forces is small enough if not return to the beginning and continue the same procedure until the relative error of the accelerations or forces is small enough otherwise go to step 6 6 update the position of the body using the final body velocity and acceleration in the above loop by using the third order taylor expansion 24 s n 1 s n u n u δ t δ t 2 2 u n u δ t 3 6 d u n u d t where s n 1 is the displacement of the body to be used for the calculation of the next time step u n u and u n u represent the final values of the body velocity and acceleration in the above loop respectively an under relaxation coefficient α n is used in eq 23 to improve the convergent efficiency obtained from yan and ma 2007 3 experimental and time domain simulation parameters the focus of this section is on the coupled nonlinear effects of sloshing and body sway and roll motion the present nonlinear results are compared with the linear frequency domain and experimental results of rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 and molin et al 2002 2008 the experimental set ups and dimensions of model i and model ii are given in fig 2 and fig 3 during the experiments the tank liquid filling ratio varies and the barge draft is fixed the location of center of gravity mass and roll moments of inertia of the empty model are shown in table 1 and table 2 the barges were moored by a horizontal cabling spring system and motion outside of the degrees of freedom of heave sway and roll were not significant in beam waves and therefore well suited for validation for the theoretical method described in this work the resulting natural period in sway was 10 8 s model i and model ii were run with beam direction regular and irregular waves the irregular waves used a jonswap spectrum with γ 2 and a peak period t p of 1 6 s the specified h s values were 6 cm 9 cm and 12 cm sea states irr1 irr2 irr3 at a scale of 1 50 fig 4 indicates that the present numerical results are not very sensitive to the time step size the time marching scheme used in the present study works well for time steps as large as t 30 from this convergence study the time step t 40 was used for most simulations 3 1 calibration of the energy dissipation coefficient the sloshing energy dissipation coefficient μ scales the effect of energy dissipation from sloshing and is a critical facet of the potential flow sloshing model thus the nonlinear coupled motion is compared with a set of experimental data to show the effectiveness of the present method and to calibrate the energy dissipation coefficient for this purpose the experiment model i fig 2 is considered the sloshing effect depends on its internal energy dissipation for regular waves malenica et al 2003 suggests that this dissipation is not dependent on the excitation frequency and only refers to the coupled motion rao peak in the frequency domain however in some cases this is not clearly defined and can introduce significant uncertainty for different frequencies the energy dissipation is also different due to differences in sloshing intensity to fully reflect the sloshing characteristics a computation duration of 60t is considered the coupled motion rao in the time domain should be calculated from the steady state portion of respective time histories through fft due to the long term transient effects the sensitivity to the sway coupled motion rao from a range of μ from 0 0 to 1 1 is compared with the modeled tests in fig 5 the most notable point is that the sway rao curves of barges with tanks and without tanks have obvious differences in the intersection point of the two curves defined as the crossover frequency ω d for this case the crossover frequency is ω d 9 0 rad s when ω ω d sloshing weakens the barge sway motion and the optimum value of μ is 0 3 selected on the basis of the minimum error between the numerical and experimental results at the sloshing natural frequency however when ω ω d the sloshing is exacerbated by the barge sway motion and the optimum value of μ is 0 9 selected on the basis of the minimum error at the frequency according to the rao curve at the peak the amplitude of the sway rao is only slightly affected by the energy dissipation coefficient μ at ω d the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results using the present method this defines the sloshing energy dissipation coefficient μ in regular waves in the following section this rule is applied in different models and cases and validated by comparing with experimental results 3 2 comparison of experimental and numerical sway and roll motion of barge with tanks in regular waves to validate the above rule for the selection of μ and identify the role of nonlinearity and coupling effects a numerical comparison to experimental data is completed frequencies of minimum and maximum sway of model ii were investigated primarily to see how the nonlinear model could improve on the linear model results overall the present numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental and linear frequency domain results due to the coupling effect the peak of the sway motion appears near the natural frequency of the sway mode and the sway motion decreases at frequencies less than the first natural frequency of sloshing ω 1 when the frequencies are higher than but not close to the combined ω 1 the sway motion increases due to the fluid motion in the tanks for the case of two tanks with h l 0 5 fig 6 a at ω ω 1 the sway motion is almost zero the linear results are similar to the general trend of the experimental results however the experimental observation is underestimated at the peak compared with the linear results this is due to the phase shifts of the sloshing force based on linear theory detailed literature on sloshing phase can be found in faltinsen and timokha 2009 however the difference between linear and nonlinear results is found to be greater near ω 1 for the case of one tank with neither low nor high fill ratio fig 6a and c in addition the wave frequencies are almost equal to the resonance frequencies of the fluid motion in the tanks for example when ω 8 48 rad s the sway motion is almost zero for the case of one tank with h l 0 5 fig 6a this frequency is known as the cancellation frequency ω σ a time series for sway motion of the case of one tank with fill ratio h l 0 5 is shown in fig 7 when the incident wave front is at the barge position a significant sway motion is initiated this in turn excites sloshing in the tanks and thus a sloshing force starts to counteract the excitation force from the waves the sway motion decreases until an equilibrium is reached at this stage the sway induced sloshing force is almost equal and opposite to the wave excitation force as shown in fig 8 however ω 8 48 rad s is not the first order natural frequency which is ω 1 π g l tanh π h l based on linear theory this is because ω 1 decreases in a nonlinear fashion as the sloshing amplitude increases in other words a very small sway motion may be present with a violent sloshing response in the nonlinear model which does not occur at ω 1 at ω 8 65 and ω 8 7 rad s the wave frequency is slightly larger and the sway motion amplitude of steady state is much higher fig 7 the sloshing response is very sensitive to the change in sway frequency fig 9 illustrates how the sloshing induced force is larger and also opposing the wave excitation force the complex shape of the sloshing induced force time series indicates a strong nonlinearity that is also affecting the shape of the wave excitation force this implies that although the wave slope is small the nonlinear sloshing flow can result in a nonlinear wave excitation force if the present body nonlinear model is used however the steady state motion shows almost no higher order harmonics this indicates that the higher order component of the sloshing force and the external wave loads are filtered out by the system rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 experienced a similar trend in their experiments the linear theory does not accurately predict the frequencies of minimum and maximum sway motion because the assumption that a constant natural frequency for the fluid motion in the tank is not suitable due to the effect of large amplitude sloshing when the fill ratio h l is higher than the critical value of 0 3374 ω 1 decreases in the nonlinear model as the free surface elevation amplitude of the internal fluid increases the effect of the fill ratio has been further discussed by faltinsen and timokha 2001 this is also reinforced in the case of two tanks with h l 0 5 shown in fig 8a where the linear and nonlinear models give acceptable results near ω 1 because the amplitude of the sloshing motion is relatively small and does not change ω 1 the nonlinear simulation scheme presented shows satisfactory agreement when compared with experimental results in addition the nonlinear and experimental results do not converge monotonically to the linear results when ω ω 1 or ω ω 1 this indicates there are large errors in the linear sloshing model in predicting sloshing and floating body coupled motion the nonlinear effects in roll coupled motion is also assessed by numerical comparison to model ii experiment results the experimentally measured roll damping coefficient c d 0 2 molin et al 2008 was added to the numerical model the comparison of roll raos between the present nonlinear time domain the linear frequency domain results and the experimental results for regular waves are shown in fig 10 the positions of the first order natural frequency of sloshing ω 1 and the cancellation frequency ω σ are indicated the trends of the present nonlinear frequency domain and the experimental test results are consistent with small differences at the second peak the nonlinear solution is larger than the linear frequency domain solution the peak position of the nonlinear solution moves to the low frequency field and the trend more closely approximates the test results in a similar manner to the results in comparison of sway motion the difference between the nonlinear and linear solutions occurs in the vicinity of ω 1 ω σ calculated by linear theory is equal to ω 1 but ω σ calculated by nonlinear theory changes to a high frequency range the response amplitude calculated by nonlinear theory is larger than the linear solution near areas with a frequency less than the natural frequency of sloshing such as ω 4 5 rad s and ω 5 0 rad s the second peak position of roll response is likely to move to a lower frequency ω 6 0 6 25 rad s to analyze the reasons for differences between the linear and nonlinear solutions the comparison between the time history curve of sloshing induced and wave induced moment under different excitation frequency incident waves is given in fig 11 in a barge roll resonance interval such as ω 4 5 rad s the phase difference between the sloshing and the wave moment is approximately 180 and the amplitude is almost equal it is important to reduce barge roll motion amplitudes after superposition at the cancellation frequency ω σ 5 5 rad s which is far from the barge roll resonance frequency the wave induced moment is very small and the sloshing induced moment is more than an order of magnitude larger the total moment is almost equal to the sloshing induced moment after superposition due to the increase in natural frequency of the sloshing the sloshing induced moment is increased and the total moment increases thus the roll motion amplitude calculated by the nonlinear model is larger than the amplitude calculated by the linear theory in the frequency band of the second peak of the roll rao curve ω 6 0 6 25 rad s the sloshing induced moment is increases when accounting for nonlinearities and further nonlinearity is introduced in wave excitation by accounting for the change in body surface in the large amplitude barge motion model the second peak in the roll rao is caused by liquid sloshing the linear model does not account for nonlinear wave excitation nor for nonlinear sloshing loads which are two significant differences that account for the improved comparison to experimental data especially at higher frequencies since the second peak in the rao is caused by sloshing resonance improved accuracy in the sloshing loads in the nonlinear model explains the improved accuracy when compared to experimental results 3 3 investigation of the effect of tank fill ratio on barge motion the steady responses of the barge roll coupled motion of model ii at different fill rates are shown in fig 12 even under the action of the small amplitude wave excitation nonlinear sloshing can introduce large changes in roll response when compared to the linear model as seen in fig 12a because the second peak of the roll motion rao is caused by the liquid sloshing and the wave induced moment is small the nonlinear effect mainly comes from the liquid sloshing thus the difference between the linear and the nonlinear solutions is large near the sloshing natural frequency and the second peak with increasing liquid fill ratio this difference is gradually reduced when the tank is full of water the model degenerates into that of a single barge with effectively no difference between them near the first order natural frequency of sloshing ω 1 the steady state amplitude predicted by nonlinear theory is larger than the amplitude predicted by linear theory the former is closer to the experimental value as shown in fig 12b c for example the fill ratio h l 0 3625 is greater than the critical value h l 0 3347 studied by rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 in detail the sloshing natural frequency is shifted to a lower frequency therefore at or below ω 1 the increase in sloshing induced moment leads to the increase in roll motion amplitude based on the analysis of sloshing induced and wave induced moments at ω 4 9 rad s the roll motion amplitude calculated by linear theory is zero and ω ω 1 5 598 rad s as shown in fig 13 with decreasing incident wave frequency which is closer to the barge roll resonance frequency the wave induced moment increases however due to ω 1 shifting to a lower frequency the liquid sloshing moment does not decrease significantly as it moves away from ω 1 due to these factors the linear and nonlinear solutions are significantly different 3 4 the effect of wave height on barge motion in the linear theory assumption the coupled motion rao does not change with the variation in wave height however it is predicted that nonlinear theory is very sensitive to changes in wave height fig 14 illustrates the comparison of the nonlinear roll motion rao of model ii at different incident wave heights experimental results are for sea state irr1 and irr3 the two peaks of the roll coupled motion rao curve are significantly reduced with increasing wave height most notably the second peak changes to a low frequency field when h l 0 3625 another significant change is the anti rolling frequency band between the two peaks increased for a low filling condition h l 0 2375 the anti rolling effect of sloshing on a floating body is enhanced under large amplitude wave excitation which is does not occur with the linear theory assumption one reason for this is the wave excitation moment effect on the floating body roll motion increases and the growth of the sloshing induced moment is slower than the growth of the roll motion under large amplitude wave excitation in addition another reason for this is the growth of wave height does not scale linearly with the growth of the wave induced moment as shown in fig 14a at ω 4 0 rad s with increasing wave height the roll coupled motion amplitude is significantly reduced by analyzing the sloshing induced and the wave induced moments the relationship between the increase in the sloshing induced and the wave induced moments and the wave height growth is not linear additionally there is phase difference either in the sloshing induced moments or in the wave induced moments at different wave heights see fig 15 the nonlinear characteristics of both the wave induced and the sloshing induced moments are more obvious as their curves become less sinusoidal thus the total moment amplitude varies greatly and produce larger roll response in smaller waves and smaller roll response in larger waves this leads to an increase in the wave height and the two peaks of the roll coupled motion rao curve are significantly reduced and the liquid sloshing anti roll effect is increased 3 5 an analysis of different nonlinear factors on coupled motions the previous sections present analysis of the nonlinear effects of the floating body surface and sloshing on the coupled motion to investigate what type of nonlinear effect is most important in coupled motion two partly reduced numerical models n1 and n2 are used and compared with model i experimental data further comparison is done with the nonlinear time domain model in the numerical model n1 the hydrodynamic calculation of the floating body flow field is based on the linear theory and the sloshing in the liquid tank is based on the fully nonlinear theory in the numerical model n2 uses a nonlinear body flow field with a linear sloshing model as shown in fig 16 in the case of a small amplitude wave h 0 03 m the rao calculated by the nonlinear time domain model and n1 are close to each other with only with a slight difference near the peak of the rao curve ω 9 0 rad s however the difference is more obvious when the incident wave height increases this is because the effects of external wave force on the coupled motion are strengthened for example for ω 9 0 rad s and h 0 07 m the wave force amplitude calculated by n1 is only the 50 of that calculated by the nonlinear time domain model the second order component of the wave force is very small which has degenerated into a linear curve relative to significant high order nonlinear characteristics of the results of the nonlinear time domain model shown in fig 17 by analyzing the second order wave force shown in fig 18 the overall hydrodynamic force acting on the floating body increases apparently because the second order component of the wave force is greater near ω 9 0 rad s such nonlinear effects result in the increase of the coupled motion amplitude the coupled motion also shows distinctly nonlinear characteristics due to the influence of nonlinear sloshing as shown in fig 19 in the case of a large amplitude wave h 0 07 m a difference appears between the rao calculated by the nonlinear time domain model and n2 when the incident wave frequency ω is greater than the cancelation frequency ω σ the coupled motion response calculated by n2 is similar to that calculated by the linear frequency domain model the ω σ calculated by n2 is the same as the sloshing natural frequency ω 1 because ω 1 is based on the linear assumption in the linear sloshing model and does not increase with an increase in sloshing amplitude another big difference is the position of the rao curve s peak which when calculated by the nonlinear time domain model the response amplitude is too large when ω is greater than ω 1 through the analysis of hydrodynamic forces shown in fig 17 the wave force amplitudes calculated by the two numerical models are similar and the higher order nonlinear characteristics are all noticeable however the difference in the sloshing force calculation is large and the linear sloshing force amplitude calculated by n2 is almost twice that of the nonlinear time domain model and a phase difference exists between them from the above comparison the sloshing nonlinear effect has the greatest influence on coupled motion for small amplitude waves the floating body surface nonlinear effect has less of an effect on the coupled motion amplitude than the floating body hydrodynamics force for large amplitude waves the floating body surface nonlinear effect is particularly important it is significant that the floating body surface nonlinear effect has a great influence on the steady state response amplitude of the coupled motion the first order and second order components of the floating body external wave force are different and the second order component is relatively close to the first order component near ω 1 3 6 a comparison of the motions for a barge with tanks in irregular waves the analysis performed in the previous section showed that for a regular wave the number of motion peaks of the floating body is increased due to sloshing effects in the vicinity of the sloshing natural frequency it has an obvious anti rolling effect on the floating body s motion to investigate the response in more representative conditions of the ocean a comparison of response in irregular waves between the numerical and experimental model ii was completed the roll motion raos obtained by cross spectrum analysis of the nonlinear time history curves are compared with the frequency domain and the irregular wave experimental results fig 20 and fig 21 the roll damping coefficient c d and the sloshing energy dissipation coefficient μ are applied by 0 0 0 2 and 0 0 0 3 0 5 respectively in the calculation the optimal values are obtained by comparison with the experimental results as discussed earlier for an irregular wave the anti rolling effect of sloshing is noticeable near its first order natural frequency ω 1 however in some frequency ranges the barge motions are increased although the increase of both μ and c d are effective for anti rolling these effects are different due to differences in the mechanisms since the first peak of the roll motion rao is caused by the barge s inertia a change in c d has a significant effect however since the second peak is caused by liquid sloshing a change in c d has almost no effect on the peak as shown in fig 20 this shows that it is not enough to modify roll motion by simply adding roll damping to counteract sloshing and ship coupled motions the sloshing energy dissipation effect is very important and must be considered in ship motion equations as can be observed from fig 21 μ 0 3 and c d 0 2 values are more suitable for this barge s roll coupled motion in these conditions the numerical results agree well with the experimental results proving the reliability of the prediction of liquid violent sloshing and floating body nonlinear coupled motion in irregular waves when no sloshing energy dissipation is considered μ 0 0 the second peak amplitude of the roll motion rao is far greater than the experimental value instead when sloshing energy dissipation is considered whether μ is large μ 0 5 or small μ 0 3 the second peak amplitude of roll motion rao is significantly reduced this shows that μ also plays an important factor in the anti rolling effect for an irregular wave the value of μ is single and relatively stable according to a relationship between the ω d and ω in regular waves it should be noted the fill ratio has an important influence on the time domain simulation as it drives the magnitude of the sloshing effect for a regular wave the frequency domain results are different from the experimental results and from the present nonlinear results in the second peak of the roll motion rao curve the amplitude of the barge roll motion calculated by the frequency domain method is smaller than two others this difference occurs in the two states of liquid fill ratio one reason is that there are limitations of the frequency domain method for viscous corrections of roll motion and sloshing another reason is that the excitation force components of non monochromatic incident waves are superimposed on the floating body motion due to multiple frequency oscillation of the liquid sloshing in tanks which leads to the floating body motion that does not satisfy the linear single frequency assumption thus there is an error introduced in certain conditions in sloshing and ship coupled motion using the linear frequency domain theory under the action of the high sea states a floating body motion can lead to a large change in the wet surfaces of the body and tank the nonlinearity caused by the change in transient wet surface conditions relative to the average wet surface conditions cannot be ignored when the tank is subjected to large amplitude motion nonlinear sloshing is apparently enhanced and the frequency band of resonance is wider and the sloshing induced moment is larger around the natural frequency of sloshing therefore for these conditions strong nonlinear sloshing and floating body nonlinear coupled motion cannot be ignored the violent sloshing and floating body nonlinear roll coupled motion raos in different sea states are shown in fig 22 the two peaks of roll coupled motion rao decreased as the sea state increased and the second peak became smoother when h l 0 3625 the second peak moved to a low frequency another significant change is that at the low fill ratio h l 0 2375 the anti rolling frequency band between the two peaks increased this suggests that for the bad sea state the anti roll effect of sloshing to roll motion is enhanced which is similar to the role of roll rao variation for regular waves based on a comparison of each component of the floating body roll moment there is a phase difference between the sloshing induced and the wave induced moments for both low or high sea states as shown in fig 23 in the high sea state both nonlinear characteristics of the moments are more obvious based on the study of the roll moment rao as shown in fig 24 in the high sea state the growth of wave and sloshing excitation moment does not scale linearly with the growth of the waves and are slow to adapt to the growth of roll motion this leads to a significant reduction in the two peaks of the roll coupled motion rao for the high sea state the shape of the roll motion rao curve at the second peak becomes gentle mostly due to faster wave excitation moment growth and slower sloshing excitation moment at high frequencies ω 6 5 rad s thus the superimposed total moment and roll motion are both increased 4 conclusions a time domain method based on nonlinear potential flow theory is established to predict sloshing and ship coupled motion for large amplitude regular and irregular wave excitation the effects of the nonlinearities introduced in sloshing and wave excited are investigated through sensitivity studies and comparison with experimental data nonlinear sloshing affects the coupled sway and roll motion followed by nonlinear changes to the floating body wetted surface a modified wall boundary condition that is driven by an energy dissipation coefficient is used based on the investigations completed the following conclusions are made the present model successfully approximates sloshing energy dissipation and thus achieves the steady state of sloshing motion in a computationally efficient simulation and is a significant improvement in accuracy compared to linear models the value of energy dissipation coefficient μ in regular waves if ω ω d is 0 3 and if ω ω d it is 0 9 however for irregular wave excitations a value of μ 0 3 is relatively stable it is found that μ is independent of the wetted tank surface fill ratio and model scale and is an important aspect in the time domain simulation although the specific value may need to be modified for other tanks such as those with baffles this rule may be considered as a good reference when no other data is available in comparison to the results of the linear theory there are some factors that need attention first for small amplitude waves the corresponding frequency at peak and near zero of floating body sway motion rao showed a shift phenomenon under some conditions this phenomenon is associated with the changes in the sloshing natural frequency at which large amplitude sloshing occurs for large amplitude waves the floating body roll motion rao curves decrease near their second peaks induced by the sloshing peaks positions moving outwards the role of sloshing in reducing the roll is particularly evident because the anti roll frequency bands are wider this is the result of involvement between nonlinear effects of the floating body outside wave loads and the tank inside liquid sloshing loads near the sloshing natural frequency the first order and second order components of the outside wave forces are close because body motions are small while sloshing effects are large the offset of the coupled motion balances the position and the amplitude of the steady state coupled motion response to explore the impact of different nonlinear effect has in coupled motion two partly reduced numerical models n1 and n2 were applied to a calculation of the same barge with tanks for comparison with experimental and the nonlinear time domain model results under small amplitude waves the nonlinear changes of the floating body surface has little influence on the steady state amplitude of the coupled motion however it has more a distinct effect on the hydrodynamic forces and equilibrium position of the floating body for large amplitude waves or high sea states the nonlinear changes of a floating body surface are particularly important by using the present nonlinear model the ship sloshing coupled system by the potential theory can be reasonably represented in a wide range of conditions this is advantageous because it is much more computationally efficient than cfd models based on viscous fluid equations such as vof or sph methods as the research of foundation theories the investigations are limited to two dimensional problems however the sloshing induced total force is the key factor and the influence of the sloshing phenomena on the ship roll and sway motion is most significant in the coupled analysis the main nonlinear effects are reflected thus further research into the three dimensional problem can be developed under the guidance of the present conclusion acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51609232 and

23192,the aim of this paper is to develop a coupled nonlinear time domain simulation scheme for nonlinear interactions among sloshing flows and floating body motion for both regular and irregular wave excitation the contributions of a variety of nonlinear factors outside waves and inside sloshing induced forces as well as their influences on body coupled sway and roll motion were investigated the induced forces are due to the changes in the transient wet surface of the floating body and full nonlinear sloshing the effects of tank fill ratio and excitation wave height on the nonlinear coupled motion as well as the relationship between sloshing and floating body nonlinear coupled motion under large wave amplitudes and severe sea conditions were also investigated and the results are presented finally the numerical solutions are compared with existing experimental result the fully nonlinear sloshing and floating body coupled motion are simulated based on the potential flow theory with the transient position hydrodynamic assumption the boundary value problem is solved by the b spline higher order panel method the isitimfb iterative semi implicit time integration method for floating bodies is applied to solve for the body s velocity and displacements the sloshing energy dissipation is modeled by changing the boundary condition on the tank s solid boundaries an extended principle to determine the energy dissipation coefficient for both regular and irregular cases is extracted then the sloshing and floating body nonlinear coupled motion under large wave amplitudes and severe sea conditions are investigated and the numerical solutions are compared with existing experimental results the effects of tank fill ratio and excitation wave height on the nonlinear coupled motion is also investigated keywords nonlinear time domain simulation sloshing isitimfb energy dissipation 1 introduction loading and offloading operations of vessels such as fpsos and lng carriers near shore or in the open sea can cause liquid sloshing in the carrier s insulated tanks which are very large and partially filled with fluid violent sloshing waves can generate large loads which can damage the structure or influence stability vessel sway and roll motion in this coupled system both the global motions of the floating body and the tank sloshing flows will influence each other the literature review revealed several interesting studies on this topic generally the studies can be categorized into two approaches 1 the linear frequency domain approach based on potential theory molin et al 2002 malenica et al 2003 and 2 the time domain approach according to previous studies the assumption of linear sloshing and ship motion appears adequate in small amplitude coupled motion analysis however even if the incident wave is small and in the linear region violent nonlinear sloshing can occur due to resonance sloshing induced impact pressure can lead to a significant change in the transient wet surface and balance position of the hull in a certain frequency range the hydrodynamic load characteristics on the hull are nonlinear which inherently cannot be accounted for in linear theory some conclusions that can be drawn from previous studies include the following sloshing may be violent which can be modeled by navier stokes equation and nonlinear potential theory model the motion of floating structures can be linear or nonlinear but at the outside of the wave it is linear hydrodynamic forces can be calculated in the frequency domain or by strip theory froude krylov forces can be nonlinear the current study focuses on the influencing characteristics of sloshing and coupled effects on ship motions to model these the behaviors of both the external and the internal flow are needed for the external flow models based on linear potential theory are used and are accurate enough in most cases except for viscous effects such as roll damping faltinsen and timokha 2009 for the internal flow models based on linear potential theory and computational fluid dynamics cfd are used sloshing is a nonlinear phenomenon especially in resonance conditions although in some cases it is possible to accurately predict the coupled sloshing and ship motions by using linear theory rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 cfd methods account for nonlinearity in sloshing that cannot be ignored in some cases kim 2002 2003 presented a series of numerical results of the anti rolling tank and ship coupled motion by using a finite difference method and the commercial sea keeping program lamp kim et al 2007 nam et al 2009 and lee et al 2007 studied the coupled effects between the ship motion and the sloshing flows by using the impulse response function irf formulation for linear ship motion and a cfd simulation for nonlinear sloshing flows li et al 2012 investigated the coupled motion of sloshing and ship motion using the stf irf method for ship motion and the cfd model openfoam for the nonlinear sloshing flows the coupled model is established for the motion response of the ship in waves coupled with induced internal sloshing and their effects on sloshing induced impact loads which was analyzed by jiang 2014 and xue et al 2017 the linear ship motion is solved with an impulse irf method combined with openfoam to address the viscous sloshing flow however generally speaking cfd methods calculation time is prohibitively long and a more computationally efficient solution for the problem is needed a study of global ship motion coupled with tank sloshing using potential flow theory for flow inside and outside the vessel was conducted by hong et al 2012 and ning et al 2012 the research shows that the wave elevation and pressure can be obtained exactly if a highly nonlinear phenomenon does not occur a 2 d coupled numerical code was developed considering nonlinear sloshing and linear ship motions based on a boundary element method and later the results were verified by a series of corresponding model tests by zhao et al 2014 zhang 2016 extended the modal decomposition method for floating vessel simulations and developed an explicit seakeeping sloshing decoupling approach in this method the exact acceleration of a vessel at any instant is calculated explicitly in one step without iterations three dimensional cases of a floating vessel with four nonlinear sloshing tanks were also simulated this method was further used by wang et al 2017 in their 2d simulations su and liu 2017 also investigated the coupling effects of barge motion and sloshing using a nonlinear boussinesq type approach in terms of velocity potential for the sloshing simulation in the preliminary investigation on the coupling mechanism between ship motions and nonlinear sloshing roll motion is most affected compared to other degrees of freedom faltinsen and timokha 2001 2005 found that the damping due to viscous energy dissipation in the form of sloshing wave spilling and breaking in a certain frequency range plays an important role in determining the coupled motion and it must be carefully considered in the past such problems have been analyzed by using the navier stokes equations su et al 1982 and hamlin et al 1986 the calculation time of this method is prohibitively long so a more computationally efficient solution based on potential theory is considered with potential theory viscous effects are neglected and so development is needed to resolve an appropriate dissipation effect kim and shin 2008 proposed to add a damping term to the free surface condition unfortunately this approach introduces two damping coefficients which are not easy to define for modeling the coupled motions of ships with sloshing in internal tanks malenica et al 2003 proposed a model that modifies the tank wall condition instead of the free surface condition but it is only suitable for frequency domain analysis this method was improved by huang et al 2011 who reported a new energy dissipation condition which is applicable to time domain simulation the nonlinear body boundary conditions of a floating body and tank sloshing are complex the accurate calculation of the velocity potential for the time derivative is critical to obtain the correct pressure and force on the body surface at each time step to decouple this mutual dependence some methods have been suggested in the literature such as the indirect method wu and eatock 1994 the mode decomposition method koo and kim 2004 and the iterative method yan and ma 2007 each method has its own advantages and disadvantages in this paper the iterative method is applied due to the importance of nonlinearities for sloshing and to obtain the probability density functions of response variables caused by sloshing there are still many uncertainties in the methods described in the literature the method based on the linear assumption fails to incorporate the strong nonlinearities of internal sloshing and the transient position hydrodynamic nonlinearities of external ship motion while the cfd method can be prohibitively time consuming thus establishing a fast efficient time domain prediction technique which is capable of considering the strong nonlinear sloshing flows and nonlinear ship motion to simulate the real motion of vessels like an lng carrier or fpso in regular and irregular waves is necessary for vessel design a good understanding of the ship s performance and reliability is required however to date there has been a lack of systematic investigation of the nonlinear effects analysis of sloshing and ship coupled motion especially applied to sloshing energy dissipation in the present study a nonlinear numerical model is developed to examine the violent sloshing coupled with the floating body motion the fully nonlinear model the linear free surface condition and the transient nonlinear body condition satisfy the green function adopted to solve for the inner tank flow and the ship s outer domain in the numerical implementation the isitimfb iterative semi implicit time integration method for floating bodies is applied to solve for the body s velocity and displacements with high efficiency with acceptable accuracy the sloshing coupled with nonlinear floating body motion is simulated for large amplitudes of regular and irregular waves and the numerical solutions are compared with the existing experimental results the change in wave and sloshing induced forces caused by the change in hull wet surface and the full nonlinear free surface of the internal fluid on sway and roll are analyzed in detail with consideration given to a variety of non linear contributions and mechanisms 2 numerical modeling method 2 1 coordinate system three cartesian co ordinate systems are defined in one o y z is fixed in space and in the others o y z and o t y t z t are fixed on the floating body and on the tank respectively when the tank and floating body are at rest the o y z and o y z systems coincide and their origins are at the center of the undisturbed free surface along the vertical line through the center of gravity of the floating body g 0 the transient wetted surface of the body under the free surface s f is defined as s h the positive direction of the normal vector n points to the outside of the fluid domain s ω the free surface of the tank liquid is defined as s t f and tank wall wetted surface as s t h the directions of the axes are shown in fig 1 the relationships between the coordinate frames are 1 y z y t z t t y z t u y t z t y z y o z o t y t z t t cos α sin α sin α cos α where t is the transformation matrix and α is the angle between frames oyz and oyz 2 2 modeling of fully nonlinear sloshing 2 2 1 the boundary value problem for tank sloshing an ideal fluid is assumed so that the fluid velocity can be described by the gradient of the velocity potential ϕ the governing equations of the velocity potential in o y z system is given by 2 2 ϕ 0 i n s ω ς t ϕ y ς y ϕ z 0 o n z ς y t ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 g ς 0 o n z ς y t ϕ n u n o n s t h ϕ 0 t 0 ϕ t 0 t 0 z 0 it can be seen that the free surface condition is more easily described in the o t y t z t moving coordinate system of the liquid tank substituting eq 1 into the free surface condition eq 2 produces the governing equation of the velocity potential in o t y t z t coordinate system as given by wu et al 1998a 3 2 ϕ 0 i n s ω ς b t ϕ y t u ς b y t ϕ z t w 0 o n z t ς b y t t ϕ t u ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 g z o t g t 21 y t t 22 ς b 0 o n z t ς b y t t ϕ n u o t ω r b n o n s t

to the point in consideration g is the gravitational acceleration and u and w are the components of u in the y t and z t directions respectively t i j are entries in the matrix t the incident wave is generated by the motion of the tank the outgoing wave is dissipated by an energy dissipation condition as described below in eq 6 at each time step the velocity potential and the corresponding free surface profiles are obtained by solving the discretized form of the following integral equation 4 c p φ p s ω φ g n g φ n d l 0 where g is the green function satisfying the laplace equation and c p is the solid angle for two dimensional problems the simple source g is given by g ln r p q where r p q is the distance between the source q ξ η and the field points p y z duan 1995 the sloshing induced force f s l o s h i n g can be calculated by integrating bernoulli s pressure over the tank instantaneous wetted surface the pressure in the fluid can be similarly evaluated in o t y t z t moving system by using 5 p ρ ϕ t u ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 g z o t g t 21 y t t 22 ς b 2 2 2 an approximation for sloshing energy dissipation the theoretical wave elevation given by eq 2 does not account for viscous effects and can diverge at the resonance frequency the energy dissipation from viscosity prevents divergence in experimental tests to obtain a theoretical solution in good agreement with the experimental results the viscous effect should be considered to consider the viscous effect in the velocity potential problem defined in eq 2 huang et al 2011 assumed that energy dissipation mainly occurs in the boundary layer near the tank wall while solving the sloshing problem in the time domain to approximate the dissipation the wall boundary condition is modified from ϕ n u n to 6 ϕ n u n μ g ϕ t n y n n y n z o n s t h where n y and n z are the respective components of n in the spatial system o y z and μ is the energy dissipation coefficient in eq 6 the term μ g ϕ t n y depends on the wetted tank surface shape and only becomes effective on a wall with a nonzero normal vector horizontal components substituting eq 1 into eq 6 the modified wall boundary condition in o t y t z t moving system is governed by 7 ϕ n u n μ g ϕ t t 11 n y t t 12 n z t μ g u ϕ t 11 n y t t 12 n z t o n s t h note that the time derivative of the velocity potential ϕ t is required for accurately solving for the boundary condition 2 2 3 velocity potential time derivative calculation in a moving system the simplest way to calculate the velocity potential time derivative ϕ t is to use a backward finite difference scheme however the scheme suffers from the problem of saw tooth instabilities sen 1993 an alternative approach wu 1998b is to find ϕ t by solving a similar boundary value problem to that for ϕ the advantage of this method is that not only ϕ t can be obtained on the free surface but also the energy dissipation items in the spatial system o y z the boundary value problem for ϕ t is defined by 8 2 ϕ t 0 i n s ω ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 g ς o n z ς y t n ϕ t u t ω r b ω u t n n u ϕ o n s t h applying ϕ t to eq 1 shows 9 n ϕ t y z n ϕ t u ϕ y t z t then substituting eq 9 into eq 8 the boundary value problem for ϕ t in o t y t z t moving system is governed by 10 2 ϕ t 0 i n s ω ϕ t u ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 g z o t g t 21 y t t 22 ς b o n z t ς b y t t n ϕ t y t z t u o t ω r b ω u o t n o n s t h there is also a difficulty with solving for the time derivative ϕ t of the velocity potential in eq 10 the accelerations of the body should be known when solving the boundary value problem for ϕ t in turn to compute the force ϕ t is needed it should be noted here that the energy dissipation term μ g ϕ t n y in eq 6 is not considered in the boundary value problem for ϕ t its effects are only computed in the iterative method the scheme to overcome these difficulties is discussed in detail in section 2 5 2 3 nonlinear floating body hydrodynamics modeling 2 3 1 body nonlinear boundary value problem waves with large amplitudes can induce large ship motions the nonlinear body case is developed to identify the nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic force of the freely floating body the incident wave velocity potential is given as ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ p ϕ 0 is a prescribed incident wave velocity potential the boundary conditions of the disturbance velocity potentials ϕ p are described by 11 2 ϕ p 0 i n s ω 2 ϕ

differentiating t in bernoulli s pressure over the instantaneous wetted surface at each time step which requires the hydrodynamic forces are resolved by integrating first and differentiating in a

start of the simulation to reduce the effect of undesired transient waves which increases simulation stability and brings the onset of steady state earlier the ramp function is 21 r t 1 for t 2 t 1 cos π t 2 t 2 for t 2 t the ramp function is applied in 2t or 4t wave period depending on the input wave height h below an iterative semi implicit time integration method for floating bodies developed by yan and ma 2007 is applied to calculate the velocities of the floating body and the time derivative of the velocity potential ϕ t suppose all calculations before t t n 1 have been finished and the velocity potential its time derivative on the free surface and the positions of all boundaries including the free surface and the body surface have been obtained through updating the only difference in this work is the effect of ϕ t on the sloshing energy dissipation term defined by eq 7 the modified method is summarized below note all calculations before t t n 1 are completed and the velocity potential its time derivative on the free surface and the positions of all boundaries including the free surface and the body surface have been obtained through updating 1 predict the body

accelerations or forces is small enough otherwise go to step 6 6 update the position of the body using the final body velocity and acceleration in the above loop by using the third order taylor

values of the body velocity and acceleration in the above loop respectively an under relaxation coefficient α n is used in eq 23 to improve the convergent efficiency obtained from yan and ma 2007 3 experimental and time domain simulation parameters the focus of this section is on the coupled nonlinear effects of sloshing and body sway and roll motion the present nonlinear results are compared with the linear frequency domain and experimental results of rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 and molin et al 2002 2008 the experimental set ups and dimensions of model i and model ii are given in fig 2 and fig 3 during the experiments the tank liquid filling ratio varies and the barge draft is fixed the location of center of gravity mass and roll moments of inertia of the empty model are shown in table 1 and table 2 the barges were moored by a horizontal cabling spring system and motion outside of the degrees of freedom of heave sway and roll were not significant in beam waves and therefore well suited for validation for the theoretical method described in this work the resulting natural period in sway was 10 8 s model i and model ii were run with beam direction regular and irregular waves the irregular waves used a jonswap spectrum with γ 2 and a peak period t p of 1 6 s the specified h s values were 6 cm 9 cm and 12 cm sea states irr1 irr2 irr3 at a scale of 1 50 fig 4 indicates that the present numerical results are not very sensitive to the time step size the time marching scheme used in the present study works well for time steps as large as t 30 from this convergence study the time step t 40 was used for most simulations 3 1 calibration of the energy dissipation coefficient the sloshing energy dissipation coefficient μ scales the effect of energy dissipation from sloshing and is a critical facet of the potential flow sloshing model thus the nonlinear coupled motion is compared with a set of experimental data to show the effectiveness of the present method and to calibrate the energy dissipation coefficient for this purpose the experiment model i fig 2 is considered the sloshing effect depends on its internal energy dissipation for regular waves malenica et al 2003 suggests that this dissipation is not dependent on the excitation frequency and only refers to the coupled motion rao peak in the frequency domain however in some cases this is not clearly defined and can introduce significant uncertainty for different frequencies the energy dissipation is also different due to differences in sloshing intensity to fully reflect the sloshing characteristics a computation duration of 60t is considered the coupled motion rao in the time domain should be calculated from the steady state portion of respective time histories through fft due to the long term transient effects the sensitivity to the sway coupled motion rao from a range of μ from 0 0 to 1 1 is compared with the modeled tests in fig 5 the most notable point is that the sway rao curves of barges with tanks and without tanks have obvious differences in the intersection point of the two curves defined as the crossover frequency ω d for this case the crossover frequency is ω d 9 0 rad s when ω ω d sloshing weakens the barge sway motion and the optimum value of μ is 0 3 selected on the basis of the minimum error between the numerical and experimental results at the sloshing natural frequency however when ω ω d the sloshing is exacerbated by the barge sway motion and the optimum value of μ is 0 9 selected on the basis of the minimum error at the frequency according to the rao curve at the peak the amplitude of the sway rao is only slightly affected by the energy dissipation coefficient μ at ω d the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results using the present method this defines the sloshing energy dissipation coefficient μ in regular waves in the following section this rule is applied in different models and cases and validated by comparing with experimental results 3 2 comparison of experimental and numerical sway and roll motion of barge with tanks in regular waves to validate the above rule for the selection of μ and identify the role of nonlinearity and coupling effects a numerical comparison to experimental data is completed frequencies of minimum and maximum sway of model ii were investigated primarily to see how the nonlinear model could improve on the linear model results overall the present numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental and linear frequency domain results due to the coupling effect the peak of the sway motion appears near the natural frequency of the sway mode and the sway motion decreases at frequencies less than the first natural frequency of sloshing ω 1 when the frequencies are higher than but not close to the combined ω 1 the sway motion increases due to the fluid motion in the tanks for the case of two tanks with h l 0 5 fig 6 a at ω ω 1 the sway motion is almost zero the linear results are similar to the general trend of the experimental results however the experimental observation is underestimated at the peak compared with the linear results this is due to the phase shifts of the sloshing force based on linear theory detailed literature on sloshing phase can be found in faltinsen and timokha 2009 however the difference between linear and nonlinear results is found to be greater near ω 1 for the case of one tank with neither low nor high fill ratio fig 6a and c in addition the wave frequencies are almost equal to the resonance frequencies of the fluid motion in the tanks for example when ω 8 48 rad s the sway motion is almost zero for the case of one tank with h l 0 5 fig 6a this frequency is known as the cancellation frequency ω σ a time series for sway motion of the case of one tank with fill ratio h l 0 5 is shown in fig 7 when the incident wave front is at the barge position a significant sway motion is initiated this in turn excites sloshing in the tanks and thus a sloshing force starts to counteract the excitation force from the waves the sway motion decreases until an equilibrium is reached at this stage the sway induced sloshing force is almost equal and opposite to the wave excitation force as shown in fig 8 however ω 8 48 rad s is not the first order natural frequency which is ω 1 π g l tanh π h l based on linear theory this is because ω 1 decreases in a nonlinear fashion as the sloshing amplitude increases in other words a very small sway motion may be present with a violent sloshing response in the nonlinear model which does not occur at ω 1 at ω 8 65 and ω 8 7 rad s the wave frequency is slightly larger and the sway motion amplitude of steady state is much higher fig 7 the sloshing response is very sensitive to the change in sway frequency fig 9 illustrates how the sloshing induced force is larger and also opposing the wave excitation force the complex shape of the sloshing induced force time series indicates a strong nonlinearity that is also affecting the shape of the wave excitation force this implies that although the wave slope is small the nonlinear sloshing flow can result in a nonlinear wave excitation force if the present body nonlinear model is used however the steady state motion shows almost no higher order harmonics this indicates that the higher order component of the sloshing force and the external wave loads are filtered out by the system rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 experienced a similar trend in their experiments the linear theory does not accurately predict the frequencies of minimum and maximum sway motion because the assumption that a constant natural frequency for the fluid motion in the tank is not suitable due to the effect of large amplitude sloshing when the fill ratio h l is higher than the critical value of 0 3374 ω 1 decreases in the nonlinear model as the free surface elevation amplitude of the internal fluid increases the effect of the fill ratio has been further discussed by faltinsen and timokha 2001 this is also reinforced in the case of two tanks with h l 0 5 shown in fig 8a where the linear and nonlinear models give acceptable results near ω 1 because the amplitude of the sloshing motion is relatively small and does not change ω 1 the nonlinear simulation scheme presented shows satisfactory agreement when compared with experimental results in addition the nonlinear and experimental results do not converge monotonically to the linear results when ω ω 1 or ω ω 1 this indicates there are large errors in the linear sloshing model in predicting sloshing and floating body coupled motion the nonlinear effects in roll coupled motion is also assessed by numerical comparison to model ii experiment results the experimentally measured roll damping coefficient c d 0 2 molin et al 2008 was added to the numerical model the comparison of roll raos between the present nonlinear time domain the linear frequency domain results and the experimental results for regular waves are shown in fig 10 the positions of the first order natural frequency of sloshing ω 1 and the cancellation frequency ω σ are indicated the trends of the present nonlinear frequency domain and the experimental test results are consistent with small differences at the second peak the nonlinear solution is larger than the linear frequency domain solution the peak position of the nonlinear solution moves to the low frequency field and the trend more closely approximates the test results in a similar manner to the results in comparison of sway motion the difference between the nonlinear and linear solutions occurs in the vicinity of ω 1 ω σ calculated by linear theory is equal to ω 1 but ω σ calculated by nonlinear theory changes to a high frequency range the response amplitude calculated by nonlinear theory is larger than the linear solution near areas with a frequency less than the natural frequency of sloshing such as ω 4 5 rad s and ω 5 0 rad s the second peak position of roll response is likely to move to a lower frequency ω 6 0 6 25 rad s to analyze the reasons for differences between the linear and nonlinear solutions the comparison between the time history curve of sloshing induced and wave induced moment under different excitation frequency incident waves is given in fig 11 in a barge roll resonance interval such as ω 4 5 rad s the phase difference between the sloshing and the wave moment is approximately 180 and the amplitude is almost equal it is important to reduce barge roll motion amplitudes after superposition at the cancellation frequency ω σ 5 5 rad s which is far from the barge roll resonance frequency the wave induced moment is very small and the sloshing induced moment is more than an order of magnitude larger the total moment is almost equal to the sloshing induced moment after superposition due to the increase in natural frequency of the sloshing the sloshing induced moment is increased and the total moment increases thus the roll motion amplitude calculated by the nonlinear model is larger than the amplitude calculated by the linear theory in the frequency band of the second peak of the roll rao curve ω 6 0 6 25 rad s the sloshing induced moment is increases when accounting for nonlinearities and further nonlinearity is introduced in wave excitation by accounting for the change in body surface in the large amplitude barge motion model the second peak in the roll rao is caused by liquid sloshing the linear model does not account for nonlinear wave excitation nor for nonlinear sloshing loads which are two significant differences that account for the improved comparison to experimental data especially at higher frequencies since the second peak in the rao is caused by sloshing resonance improved accuracy in the sloshing loads in the nonlinear model explains the improved accuracy when compared to experimental results 3 3 investigation of the effect of tank fill ratio on barge motion the steady responses of the barge roll coupled motion of model ii at different fill rates are shown in fig 12 even under the action of the small amplitude wave excitation nonlinear sloshing can introduce large changes in roll response when compared to the linear model as seen in fig 12a because the second peak of the roll motion rao is caused by the liquid sloshing and the wave induced moment is small the nonlinear effect mainly comes from the liquid sloshing thus the difference between the linear and the nonlinear solutions is large near the sloshing natural frequency and the second peak with increasing liquid fill ratio this difference is gradually reduced when the tank is full of water the model degenerates into that of a single barge with effectively no difference between them near the first order natural frequency of sloshing ω 1 the steady state amplitude predicted by nonlinear theory is larger than the amplitude predicted by linear theory the former is closer to the experimental value as shown in fig 12b c for example the fill ratio h l 0 3625 is greater than the critical value h l 0 3347 studied by rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 in detail the sloshing natural frequency is shifted to a lower frequency therefore at or below ω 1 the increase in sloshing induced moment leads to the increase in roll motion amplitude based on the analysis of sloshing induced and wave induced moments at ω 4 9 rad s the roll motion amplitude calculated by linear theory is zero and ω ω 1 5 598 rad s as shown in fig 13 with decreasing incident wave frequency which is closer to the barge roll resonance frequency the wave induced moment increases however due to ω 1 shifting to a lower frequency the liquid sloshing moment does not decrease significantly as it moves away from ω 1 due to these factors the linear and nonlinear solutions are significantly different 3 4 the effect of wave height on barge motion in the linear theory assumption the coupled motion rao does not change with the variation in wave height however it is predicted that nonlinear theory is very sensitive to changes in wave height fig 14 illustrates the comparison of the nonlinear roll motion rao of model ii at different incident wave heights experimental results are for sea state irr1 and irr3 the two peaks of the roll coupled motion rao curve are significantly reduced with increasing wave height most notably the second peak changes to a low frequency field when h l 0 3625 another significant change is the anti rolling frequency band between the two peaks increased for a low filling condition h l 0 2375 the anti rolling effect of sloshing on a floating body is enhanced under large amplitude wave excitation which is does not occur with the linear theory assumption one reason for this is the wave excitation moment effect on the floating body roll motion increases and the growth of the sloshing induced moment is slower than the growth of the roll motion under large amplitude wave excitation in addition another reason for this is the growth of wave height does not scale linearly with the growth of the wave induced moment as shown in fig 14a at ω 4 0 rad s with increasing wave height the roll coupled motion amplitude is significantly reduced by analyzing the sloshing induced and the wave induced moments the relationship between the increase in the sloshing induced and the wave induced moments and the wave height growth is not linear additionally there is phase difference either in the sloshing induced moments or in the wave induced moments at different wave heights see fig 15 the nonlinear characteristics of both the wave induced and the sloshing induced moments are more obvious as their curves become less sinusoidal thus the total moment amplitude varies greatly and produce larger roll response in smaller waves and smaller roll response in larger waves this leads to an increase in the wave height and the two peaks of the roll coupled motion rao curve are significantly reduced and the liquid sloshing anti roll effect is increased 3 5 an analysis of different nonlinear factors on coupled motions the previous sections present analysis of the nonlinear effects of the floating body surface and sloshing on the coupled motion to investigate what type of nonlinear effect is most important in coupled motion two partly reduced numerical models n1 and n2 are used and compared with model i experimental data further comparison is done with the nonlinear time domain model in the numerical model n1 the hydrodynamic calculation of the floating body flow field is based on the linear theory and the sloshing in the liquid tank is based on the fully nonlinear theory in the numerical model n2 uses a nonlinear body flow field with a linear sloshing model as shown in fig 16 in the case of a small amplitude wave h 0 03 m the rao calculated by the nonlinear time domain model and n1 are close to each other with only with a slight difference near the peak of the rao curve ω 9 0 rad s however the difference is more obvious when the incident wave height increases this is because the effects of external wave force on the coupled motion are strengthened for example for ω 9 0 rad s and h 0 07 m the wave force amplitude calculated by n1 is only the 50 of that calculated by the nonlinear time domain model the second order component of the wave force is very small which has degenerated into a linear curve relative to significant high order nonlinear characteristics of the results of the nonlinear time domain model shown in fig 17 by analyzing the second order wave force shown in fig 18 the overall hydrodynamic force acting on the floating body increases apparently because the second order component of the wave force is greater near ω 9 0 rad s such nonlinear effects result in the increase of the coupled motion amplitude the coupled motion also shows distinctly nonlinear characteristics due to the influence of nonlinear sloshing as shown in fig 19 in the case of a large amplitude wave h 0 07 m a difference appears between the rao calculated by the nonlinear time domain model and n2 when the incident wave frequency ω is greater than the cancelation frequency ω σ the coupled motion response calculated by n2 is similar to that calculated by the linear frequency domain model the ω σ calculated by n2 is the same as the sloshing natural frequency ω 1 because ω 1 is based on the linear assumption in the linear sloshing model and does not increase with an increase in sloshing amplitude another big difference is the position of the rao curve s peak which when calculated by the nonlinear time domain model the response amplitude is too large when ω is greater than ω 1 through the analysis of hydrodynamic forces shown in fig 17 the wave force amplitudes calculated by the two numerical models are similar and the higher order nonlinear characteristics are all noticeable however the difference in the sloshing force calculation is large and the linear sloshing force amplitude calculated by n2 is almost twice that of the nonlinear time domain model and a phase difference exists between them from the above comparison the sloshing nonlinear effect has the greatest influence on coupled motion for small amplitude waves the floating body surface nonlinear effect has less of an effect on the coupled motion amplitude than the floating body hydrodynamics force for large amplitude waves the floating body surface nonlinear effect is particularly important it is significant that the floating body surface nonlinear effect has a great influence on the steady state response amplitude of the coupled motion the first order and second order components of the floating body external wave force are different and the second order component is relatively close to the first order component near ω 1 3 6 a comparison of the motions for a barge with tanks in irregular waves the analysis performed in the previous section showed that for a regular wave the number of motion peaks of the floating body is increased due to sloshing effects in the vicinity of the sloshing natural frequency it has an obvious anti rolling effect on the floating body s motion to investigate the response in more representative conditions of the ocean a comparison of response in irregular waves between the numerical and experimental model ii was completed the roll motion raos obtained by cross spectrum analysis of the nonlinear time history curves are compared with the frequency domain and the irregular wave experimental results fig 20 and fig 21 the roll damping coefficient c d and the sloshing energy dissipation coefficient μ are applied by 0 0 0 2 and 0 0 0 3 0 5 respectively in the calculation the optimal values are obtained by comparison with the experimental results as discussed earlier for an irregular wave the anti rolling effect of sloshing is noticeable near its first order natural frequency ω 1 however in some frequency ranges the barge motions are increased although the increase of both μ and c d are effective for anti rolling these effects are different due to differences in the mechanisms since the first peak of the roll motion rao is caused by the barge s inertia a change in c d has a significant effect however since the second peak is caused by liquid sloshing a change in c d has almost no effect on the peak as shown in fig 20 this shows that it is not enough to modify roll motion by simply adding roll damping to counteract sloshing and ship coupled motions the sloshing energy dissipation effect is very important and must be considered in ship motion equations as can be observed from fig 21 μ 0 3 and c d 0 2 values are more suitable for this barge s roll coupled motion in these conditions the numerical results agree well with the experimental results proving the reliability of the prediction of liquid violent sloshing and floating body nonlinear coupled motion in irregular waves when no sloshing energy dissipation is considered μ 0 0 the second peak amplitude of the roll motion rao is far greater than the experimental value instead when sloshing energy dissipation is considered whether μ is large μ 0 5 or small μ 0 3 the second peak amplitude of roll motion rao is significantly reduced this shows that μ also plays an important factor in the anti rolling effect for an irregular wave the value of μ is single and relatively stable according to a relationship between the ω d and ω in regular waves it should be noted the fill ratio has an important influence on the time domain simulation as it drives the magnitude of the sloshing effect for a regular wave the frequency domain results are different from the experimental results and from the present nonlinear results in the second peak of the roll motion rao curve the amplitude of the barge roll motion calculated by the frequency domain method is smaller than two others this difference occurs in the two states of liquid fill ratio one reason is that there are limitations of the frequency domain method for viscous corrections of roll motion and sloshing another reason is that the excitation force components of non monochromatic incident waves are superimposed on the floating body motion due to multiple frequency oscillation of the liquid sloshing in tanks which leads to the floating body motion that does not satisfy the linear single frequency assumption thus there is an error introduced in certain conditions in sloshing and ship coupled motion using the linear frequency domain theory under the action of the high sea states a floating body motion can lead to a large change in the wet surfaces of the body and tank the nonlinearity caused by the change in transient wet surface conditions relative to the average wet surface conditions cannot be ignored when the tank is subjected to large amplitude motion nonlinear sloshing is apparently enhanced and the frequency band of resonance is wider and the sloshing induced moment is larger around the natural frequency of sloshing therefore for these conditions strong nonlinear sloshing and floating body nonlinear coupled motion cannot be ignored the violent sloshing and floating body nonlinear roll coupled motion raos in different sea states are shown in fig 22 the two peaks of roll coupled motion rao decreased as the sea state increased and the second peak became smoother when h l 0 3625 the second peak moved to a low frequency another significant change is that at the low fill ratio h l 0 2375 the anti rolling frequency band between the two peaks increased this suggests that for the bad sea state the anti roll effect of sloshing to roll motion is enhanced which is similar to the role of roll rao variation for regular waves based on a comparison of each component of the floating body roll moment there is a phase difference between the sloshing induced and the wave induced moments for both low or high sea states as shown in fig 23 in the high sea state both nonlinear characteristics of the moments are more obvious based on the study of the roll moment rao as shown in fig 24 in the high sea state the growth of wave and sloshing excitation moment does not scale linearly with the growth of the waves and are slow to adapt to the growth of roll motion this leads to a significant reduction in the two peaks of the roll coupled motion rao for the high sea state the shape of the roll motion rao curve at the second peak becomes gentle mostly due to faster wave excitation moment growth and slower sloshing excitation moment at high frequencies ω 6 5 rad s thus the superimposed total moment and roll motion are both increased 4 conclusions a time domain method based on nonlinear potential flow theory is established to predict sloshing and ship coupled motion for large amplitude regular and irregular wave excitation the effects of the nonlinearities introduced in sloshing and wave excited are investigated through sensitivity studies and comparison with experimental data nonlinear sloshing affects the coupled sway and roll motion followed by nonlinear changes to the floating body wetted surface a modified wall boundary condition that is driven by an energy dissipation coefficient is used based on the investigations completed the following conclusions are made the present model successfully approximates sloshing energy dissipation and thus achieves the steady state of sloshing motion in a computationally efficient simulation and is a significant improvement in accuracy compared to linear models the value of energy dissipation coefficient μ in regular waves if ω ω d is 0 3 and if ω ω d it is 0 9 however for irregular wave excitations a value of μ 0 3 is relatively stable it is found that μ is independent of the wetted tank surface fill ratio and model scale and is an important aspect in the time domain simulation although the specific value may need to be modified for other tanks such as those with baffles this rule may be considered as a good reference when no other data is available in comparison to the results of the linear theory there are some factors that need attention first for small amplitude waves the corresponding frequency at peak and near zero of floating body sway motion rao showed a shift phenomenon under some conditions this phenomenon is associated with the changes in the sloshing natural frequency at which large amplitude sloshing occurs for large amplitude waves the floating body roll motion rao curves decrease near their second peaks induced by the sloshing peaks positions moving outwards the role of sloshing in reducing the roll is particularly evident because the anti roll frequency bands are wider this is the result of involvement between nonlinear effects of the floating body outside wave loads and the tank inside liquid sloshing loads near the sloshing natural frequency the first order and second order components of the outside wave forces are close because body motions are small while sloshing effects are large the offset of the coupled motion balances the position and the amplitude of the steady state coupled motion response to explore the impact of different nonlinear effect has in coupled motion two partly reduced numerical models n1 and n2 were applied to a calculation of the same barge with tanks for comparison with experimental and the nonlinear time domain model results under small amplitude waves the nonlinear changes of the floating body surface has little influence on the steady state amplitude of the coupled motion however it has more a distinct effect on the hydrodynamic forces and equilibrium position of the floating body for large amplitude waves or high sea states the nonlinear changes of a floating body surface are particularly important by using the present nonlinear model the ship sloshing coupled system by the potential theory can be reasonably represented in a wide range of conditions this is advantageous because it is much more computationally efficient than cfd models based on viscous fluid equations such as vof or sph methods as the research of foundation theories the investigations are limited to two dimensional problems however the sloshing induced total force is the key factor and the influence of the sloshing phenomena on the ship roll and sway motion is most significant in the coupled analysis the main nonlinear effects are reflected thus further research into the three dimensional problem can be developed under the guidance of the present conclusion acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51609232 and

temperature to the allowable stress at the design temperature of materials used in vessel construction 1 introduction recently the demand for liquefied gas propulsion technology has increased driven by the strengthening of imo regulations for clean shipping in 2014 dnv 2011 to achieve gas fueled propulsion one essential challenge is the type of fuel tanks that can be used several types of fuel storage tanks are available including membrane tanks or independent tanks e g imo type a b and c tanks imo 2008 2009 tanks other than imo type c tanks may need additional equipment to address the boil off gas from liquefied gases due to external heat ingress in a gas fueled ship generally a conventional pressure vessel is designed using a complete cylinder and dish ends which constrains its installation on an open deck or inside a hull because dead space is created between the vessel and the hull all space on any ship is of significant value a user or owner of a merchant ship with gas fueled propulsion may require more liquefied gas to be contained in a storage tank a storage tank shape that conforms to the hull with a high volume efficiency and a pressure that exceeds atmospheric pressure can satisfy the user s requirements ahn et al 2017 lee et al 2017 a prismatic pressure vessel can be an alternative solution to these challenges this tank is classified as an imo type c tank and can contain a relatively high pressure with high volume efficiency such a tank is normally manufactured as a modular extension of a structural component in any spatial direction and easily adapts to any size because of its repeated pattern its principal component is a beam structure or parallel plate structure which acts as a load bearing system ahn 2012 chang and bergan 2012 choi 2016 in the design of prismatic pressure vessels relevant design regulations must be considered for ship applications imo published the igc code imo 2008 and promulgates several requirements including msc 285 86 imo 2009 although msc 285 86 is currently undergoing revisions this standard has provided an interim guideline for gas fueled ships since 2009 most requirements are presented in the igc code which contains the requirements for the design manufacture commissioning and operation of all equipment for liquefied gas carriers in particular regarding pressure vessels the igc code describes a generally acceptable design theory that may be used the theory is accepted by standards such as en 13458 and the asme boiler and pressure vessel code hereafter the asme code section viii of the asme code specifies three divisions division 1 rules for the construction of pressure vessels division 2 alternative rules for the construction of pressure vessels and division 3 alternative rules for the construction of high pressure vessels division 1 consists of material selection the design and construction of pressure vessels for generally known shapes division 3 involves rules for pressure vessels that can withstand high pressures above 10 ksi 70 mpa specifically division 2 addresses a pressure vessel for on board transport a non circular vessel asme 2010a this division is applicable for the design of an on board pressure vessel for gas fuel storage division 1 adopts a relatively simple calculation with an approximation formula and the design and requirements for stress analysis are described through complex calculation methods in division 2 there are two different methods of designing pressure vessels design by rule and design by analysis design by rule provides design rules for commonly used pressure vessel shapes under loading within specified limits rules or guidance for the treatment of other loadings design by rule does not provide all load conditions and geometries therefore in the case of pressure vessels not covered by the design by rule strategy design by analysis is applied desai and patel 2014 stonehouse et al 2012 slagis 2005 otherwise the rules of classification groups are based on the igc code these rules are applicable to a conventional pressure vessel but not to a prismatic pressure vessel thus they cover only conventional pressure vessels abs 2010 dnv 2013 gl 2008 this study includes a strength assessment of a prismatic pressure vessel with plate structures based on numerical and experimental stress analyses the main purpose of manufacturing a prototype vessel is to evaluate the design concept manufacturability and use of a hydrostatic pressure test these considerations satisfy the asme code for approval by a third party

the finite element method section 5 discusses the experimental stress analysis results using strain gauges which indicate that the design concept of the prismatic pressure vessel is feasible for containing pressurized liquids section 6 summarizes and concludes this paper 2 design principle of a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel the basic principle of the plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel is as follows in the design we use a combination of three design principles first to design the parallel plate we check the force equilibrium when internal pressure is applied second we verify two conditions whether the parallel plate can withstand the weight of the upper part of the pressure vessel and whether buckling occurs finally it is confirmed that the stiffener installed outside the pressure vessel can withstand the internal pressure 2 1 parallel plate thickness calculation fig 1 shows the equilibrium of the force of the tensile stress on the internal parallel plate

the total area is as follows 1 a a t p p n y b t p p n x if the uniform internal pressure p acts on the external plate the tensile stress can be expressed as 2 σ a p a b if a b the thickness of the

vessel was designed using the equations proposed in section 2 the configuration and main dimensions of the prototype prismatic pressure vessel are shown in fig 5 this prototype has a capacity of approximately 80 m3 weighs 38 tons and sustains a 9 5 barg design pressure here the design pressure is normally identical to or higher than the maximum allowable working pressure mawp for pressure vessels that operate at the mawp the hydrostatic pressure test must be designed to withstand the following test pressures according to ug 99 in the asme code eq 19 should be satisfied during the minimum hydrostatic test pressure 19 m i n h y d r o s t a t i c t e s t p r e s s u r e 1 3 m a w p l s r when the actual conditions are used an lsr value of 1 1 is derived for use in this study with the above equation the test pressure is 13 6 barg 143 of the mawp asme 2010a the structural components are categorized into two groups primary and secondary components the primary components are the shell endbox structures parallel plates arches and semi arches the shell is the primary load bearing component the endbox provides high stiffness with cubical spaces with the shell walls and floor the parallel plates are attached in equal intervals of 1 m and divide the inside of the prismatic pressure vessel into several sections these plates transfer a load through tension membrane stresses in the parallel plates the endbox and parallel plates contain a manhole with a diameter of 600 mm the manhole enables a worker to move and test fluid to be transferred through the steel plates the arches and semi arches also transfer the load using the same principle as the parallel plates in particular the shape of the semi arches is designed by considering the pattern of stress flow in addition the secondary components are stiffeners and nozzles the stiffeners are attached on the outsides of the shells these stiffeners withstand the bending deformation of the shells the nozzles provide workers access to inlet or outlet piping the piping feeds or drains the testing fluid for the hydrostatic pressure test table 1 summarizes all structural components with the construction material according to

astm 1996 1999 section ii presents all material properties for use in pressure vessels a designer uses the tensile strength yield strength poisson s ratio and elastic modulus of certain materials the allowable stress value of a material depends on the safety factor of each division the asme code section viii division 2 recommends an allowable stress with a safety factor of at least 2 4 regarding

plastic collapse are satisfied using the finite element analysis results asme 2010a in the design stage the calculated stresses of each structural component satisfy the following criteria 20 p m s p l 1 5 s p l p b s 4 computational stress analyses 4 1 computational analysis conditions for the finite element analysis abaqus cae 6 12 commercial software was used the 3d shell elements in abaqus were used to make the finite element model for the prototype load conditions in the fem and experimental analysis three types of load conditions are assumed in fig 6 linear elastic described in section 4 2 nonlinear elastic plastic described in section 4 3 experimental condition described in section 5 material condition as described in section 3 the stress strain curve of the material to be used in the actual design and fabrication is analyzed and the nonlinear region of each material is input in the analysis the elastic plastic analysis method is a design method that uses the actual behavior of materials this method more accurately assesses the structural integrity and considers geometric nonlinearities to use this method the stress strain curve of each material must be used asme 2010a division 2 describes an equation that can generate the stress strain curve using several parameters such as the tensile strength and yield strength fig 7 illustrates the stress strain curves of the construction materials for the plastic and elastic regions mesh the mesh is the eight node shell element s8r the mesh size selection is based on the convergence study and the reference literature a mesh convergence study was preformed and the error in the mesh was estimated to be less than 5 stonehouse m 2012 based on the dnvgl guidelines for finite element analysis the element length is not to be greater than 2 longitudinal spaces with a minimum of three elements between primary supporting members and the rules for the classification of ships part 3 chapter 7 finite element analysis suggests a mesh size of 50 mm dnvgl 2015 dnvgl 2016 the mesh size is 50 mm and the mesh consists of 157 099 elements and 460 037 nodes simulia 2012a 2012b as shown in fig 8 boundary conditions the prototype foundation has appropriate boundary conditions four points on the bottom side one point is fixed as the reference point x 0 y 0 and z 0 the other points enable the vessel to deform in the axial directions x and y according to the pressure 4 2 linear elastic stress analysis in the linear elastic stress condition the pressure that acts on the pressure vessel is set to the mawp throughout the entire analysis where the stress value exceeded the allowable stress and the strain value became nonlinear is determined in the stress analysis the pressure vessel is divided into two groups primary components and secondary components when the load is applied to the entire prismatic pressure vessel the stress is expected to be highest near the endbox or around the hatch due to the pressure through the stress analysis the areas where the stress value is larger than that of the surroundings can be identified fig 9 and verification is required in these areas such as the shell endbox floor wall parallel plate arch and semi arch a plate area near the exit hatch which is expected to be concentrated at the load carrying plate part is composed of an inner parallel plate among the primary members points a and b a semi arch with a deformed shape point c an arch point d and near the end floor in the endbox a vertical manhole points e and f as shown in fig 10 fig 11 illustrate the results of linear elastic stress analysis at points a and b the expected elongation is small due to the hatch at these points the stresses are confirmed to be below the allowable stress when the mawp of 9 5 barg is applied to point a the stress is 55 25 mpa and the stress at point b is 43 3 mpa the safety factor of point a is 2 98 3 81 point c is a semi arch section of the vertically installed parallel plate whose shape is biased toward one side compared to point d and the stiffener is installed to distribute the concentrated stress in the semi arch due to stiffener the stress value is lower than the allowable stress 113 2 mpa point d is determined to have a higher stress than other points due to parallel plate elongation and is installed in the horizontal direction thus the plate is designed to contain a circle with radius r as a result the stress value is 105 1 mpa for points e and f due to the vertically installed manhole a concentrated stress is expected but the stress values are 39 0 mpa and 41 1 mpa respectively considering the primary components as a whole relatively high stress values of 113 2 mpa and 105 1 mpa are obtained at points c and d however since both points have lower values than the allowable stress of the material the design is suitably safe the endbox floor tends to be extended in the x and y directions but the two shell sides sustain the floor the endbox walls and parallel plates are placed in tension because the mawp is applied to the shell the endbox walls in the corner section are stronger than those in the middle section which implies that the shell sides support the components with respect to the strength and the endbox wall should have a relatively high load bearing capacity a curved shell shows a notably lower stress distribution than a flat shell thus the curved shell has a better geometry for distributing the stress without bending this curved shell can have a smaller thickness than that of the flat shell in the secondary components which should be made to withstand the additional load in the pressure vessel in the external shell part no parallel plate can withstand the stress due to the endbox and manhole g and h in the fig 10 and the total stress is analyzed points g and h are expected to have lower stresses than the parallel plate which is the primary component as a result of analysis both stress values of 60 3 mpa and 60 8 mpa are lower than the allowable stress according to the analysis of the linear elastic stress analysis the primary components have the highest stress at point c at a 9 5 barg mawp sufficient safety is confirmed throughout the entire stress analysis section 4 3 nonlinear elastic plastic load analysis the plastic collapse load may be obtained from the fem results using the nonlinear elastic plastic analysis method the fem considers internal pressure increments from zero to a significantly higher pressure than mawp or the test pressure here to quantify the plastic collapse load the appropriate pressure is selected to be 40 barg the internal pressure gradually increases and the calculated stresses also increase as shown in fig 12 while the pressure increases a certain load is obtained that causes structural instability due to the plastic deformation this result determines the vulnerable component and the rupture mechanism of the prismatic pressure vessel as in the case of the linear region the behaviors at each point of the primary and secondary members are analyzed the distribution of the overall stress is identical to that in the linear region the highest stress remains at point c which is the semi arch of the primary member the stress distribution around hatch points a and b confirms that the stress value of point a remains higher than that of point b which shows that the hatch causes a strong binding force in the width direction when the pressure is increased to 40 barg as a complete prototype pressure vessel would experience the stress value increases almost linearly and is less than the yield strength 250 mpa in other words it is confirmed that even at higher pressures than 9 5 barg which is designed as a standard the structure can withstand the pressure without plastic deformation the maximum stress values of points a and b are 213 5 mpa and 171 7 mpa respectively point c shows the highest stress distribution in the linear elastic analysis in the nonlinear elastic plastic analysis the highest stress occurs under a pressure of 29 barg at the mawp and 13 6 barg test pressure a lower stress value of 161 7 mpa is obtained thus there is no plastic deformation at the test pressure and sufficient safety is maintained the stress value remains unchanged at 20 barg or more the stress value is redistributed to the near region and plastic deformation is observed at point c at 35 barg point d is notably similar to point c and the stresses in these locations are higher than those at the other points plastic deformation is not observed when the pressure increases to 40 barg at points e and f the stress distributions extend from the vertical manhole to the other zones thus a low stress value appears even when the 13 6 barg test pressure is applied e and f have the lowest stress among all points even when a 40 barg pressure is applied in general for the primary components almost an identical tendency arises as that of the case of the linear elastic analysis high stresses are observed at points c and d and the stress distribution linearly increases to the 13 6 barg test pressure points g and h have a higher stress distribution than other points except for c and d as a characteristic feature it is confirmed that g point has an almost identical stress distribution until plastic deformation is observed and this stress reaches the plastic deformation threshold faster than those of the other points at 32 8 barg since point g is close to the point where the external shells meet the stress value is high due to the effect of bending the results of the nonlinear elastic plastic analysis show that plastic deformation does not occur anywhere before 32 8 barg thus the designed prototype pressure vessel has a better load capacity than expected 5 experimental stress analysis 5 1 experimental stress analysis conditions the purpose of the experimental stress analysis is to ensure structural stability using strain gauges actual stresses are obtained from the measured strains strain gauges are commonly used to determine the state of stress on a test part surface with increasing internal pressure the strains are increased the strains are converted to stresses using the stress strain curves of the construction materials the experimental procedures to obtain the pressure stress behavior of the prototype in practice are as follows the experiment requires strain gauges with a three wire quarter bridge a data acquisition system and a test pump as shown in fig 13 the support conditions are the same as those of the fem the strain gauges should be waterproof because they are underwater inside the prototype during the hydrostatic pressure test the kfw 5 120 c1 11 is a foil strain gauge for underwater service kyowa 1999 individual strain gauges are independently connected to a wheatstone bridge the arrangement of the bridge depends on the experimental conditions and purpose here a three wire quarter bridge circuit on the lead wire is used when the wire distance is greater than 6 m the resistance of the wire is not negligible and may decrease the input signal from the strain gauges vishay 2010 fig 14 a and b illustrate the attached strain gauges and fig 14 c shows the adhesive and waterproof treatment for the strain gauge the measuring points were selected to obtain the strains from each pressure which is similar to an fem analysis these points represent the parts with the structural behaviors of interest shown in section 4 2 and fig 10 the parallel plates a and b are the main load carrying components and the stress concentration points c d e and f are also points of interest the shells also have measuring points g and h six gauges a f and eight gauges g and h operate underwater and in air respectively the strain gauges are directly connected to the data acquisition system ni pxie 4330 with a wheatstone bridge the experiment goes from zero pressure to the mawp and test pressure this particular experiment was performed for 2 h and 20 min using the internal pressure profile in the fig 6 the internal pressure was changed from zero to an mawp of 9 5 barg from the mawp to the test pressure and from the test pressure to 20 barg the internal pressure profile changed at each pressure step the experiment was performed until plastic stress arose at the measurement points using the stress strain curves in fig 7 the corresponding plastic strain regime begins at 0 0033 5 2 experimental stress analysis in this section the experimental stresses of the prototype tank are presented with the fem results in fig 15 a and b for the same test period in the experiment a time lag exists due to the stress distribution after the pressure load is applied the time is required for pressure stabilization for the entire tank in the experimental analysis the strain values are obtained when the pressure becomes stable after a certain time period 5 2 1 primary member analysis a f parallel plates point a and b the fem analysis results in fig 15 b confirm that the maximum stress of point a is 55 25 mpa when the mawp is applied the experimental strain gauge data show a maximum value of 34 95 mpa which is lower than fem at point b the fem result is 43 3 mpa and the experimental result is 30 91 mpa in the fem model since the hatch part is not the primary member the hatch part is briefly modeled than the actual prototype pressure vessel thus the actual value is lower than expected stress value comparing analysis results when the test pressure and ultimate pressure are applied the measured fem value is at least 30 mpa lower than the maximum predicted value and even at 20 barg ultimate pressure the stress value is 3 4 times lower than the yield strength semi arch point c and d the maximum value at point c on the mawp is 113 mpa in the fem and 91 mpa in the experimental results respectively thus we obtain a maximum safety factor of 2 5 when the test pressure and ultimate pressure are loaded almost identical results to the fem results are obtained it is confirmed that the predicted results are similar to the actual results when considering the time delay in the test pressure load condition the safety factor is 1 55 1 57 and the yield strength is not reached even at 20 barg thus safe operation is confirmed over the entire range of pressure loads in point d the fem result is 105 11 mpa and the experimental result is 80 60 mpa the safety factor of fem is to be 2 5 or more compared with the actual yield strength when the stress results are measured with increasing pressure the safety factor is 1 67 2 20 at the test pressure and 1 35 1 57 at the ultimate pressure for the actual production prototype pressure vessel relative to the fem model lower stress values are obtained than the predicted value due to welding and stress distribution around the stiffener end box point e and f the stress at points e and f is lower than other points due to the external stiffener around the endbox point f is expected to have a lower stress than e because it is close to the stiffener at point e the experimental and fem values are almost similar to those in mawp and the fem value is slightly higher at the test pressure the stress value increased rapidly at 13 6 barg or more indicating that the strain gauges are detached rather than reach the yield strength at point f the stress is measured low until the test pressure when the pressure reaches 20 barg a higher stress value is obtained than the fem prediction at the test pressure or higher pressure the stress is not measured at point e but according to the tendency of other points this point is considered to be within the safe range both e and f are safe over the entire pressure range the thickness or shape at this part can be changed in later designs due to the high safety factor value at least 2 9 5 2 2 secondary member analysis g h external shell point g and h at point g and h the fem stress is greater than those from the experimental results because in the fem shell the external internal stress values are identical thus a higher stress value appears however the actual measurements show that the fem predicted stress value is different from the actual measured value because various stress distributions arise due to the shell thicknesses durelli et al 1961 since the strain gauges are connected and measured in the external shell it is confirmed that the stress value is lower than expected as shown in fem results the stress is lower than the other areas the experimental analysis results show that plastic deformation does not occur anywhere except point e these results show that the manufactured prototype has a better load capacity than that expected consequently the analysis result shows that the prototype designed in this study is suitable for containing pressurized liquid at up to 20 barg with no plastic deformation in this experimental and fem analysis it can be seen that there is a difference up to 30 according to previous studies of experimental and fem analysis from 13 3 25 error were occurred durelli et al 1961 little et al 2010 huda and ajani 2015 mohite 2017 it is confirmed that simulation predicts higher value than actual phenomenon the identified differences between experiment and fem simulation are welding material properties and pressure difference in internal external shell 6 conclusions a prismatic pressure vessel with a plate structure was introduced to contain high pressurized fluids for ship fuel the prototype of the prismatic pressure vessel was designed and analyzed to prove its applicability the main advantage of the prismatic pressure vessel is its higher volume efficiency than those of conventional pressure vessels a characteristic of the pressure vessel is its use of flat plate components such as shells parallel plates and arches with strong stiffeners on the shell the parallel plates are configured as a modular structure and carry the tension loads an experimental stress analysis was performed under the mawp and test pressure and a computational analysis using abaqus cae 6 12 was also performed both results indicate the feasibility of the prismatic pressure vessel for on board gas fuel storage in the computational analysis the plastic and elastic properties of the construction materials are considered when the stress results of the experiment and computational analysis are compared certain differences in the stress distributions are observed however identical structural behaviors are obtained the vulnerable location is the parallel plate with the semi arch which may collapse when a plastic collapse load is applied the stress results show that the designed prototype satisfies the design criteria according to the asme code and no failure is expected to occur during the operation and testing periods of the manufactured prototype

temperature to the allowable stress at the design temperature of materials used in vessel construction 1 introduction recently the demand for liquefied gas propulsion technology has increased driven by the strengthening of imo regulations for clean shipping in 2014 dnv 2011 to achieve gas fueled propulsion one essential challenge is the type of fuel tanks that can be used several types of fuel storage tanks are available including membrane tanks or independent tanks e g imo type a b and c tanks imo 2008 2009 tanks other than imo type c tanks may need additional equipment to address the boil off gas from liquefied gases due to external heat ingress in a gas fueled ship generally a conventional pressure vessel is designed using a complete cylinder and dish ends which constrains its installation on an open deck or inside a hull because dead space is created between the vessel and the hull all space on any ship is of significant value a user or owner of a merchant ship with gas fueled propulsion may require more liquefied gas to be contained in a storage tank a storage tank shape that conforms to the hull with a high volume efficiency and a pressure that exceeds atmospheric pressure can satisfy the user s requirements ahn et al 2017 lee et al 2017 a prismatic pressure vessel can be an alternative solution to these challenges this tank is classified as an imo type c tank and can contain a relatively high pressure with high volume efficiency such a tank is normally manufactured as a modular extension of a structural component in any spatial direction and easily adapts to any size because of its repeated pattern its principal component is a beam structure or parallel plate structure which acts as a load bearing system ahn 2012 chang and bergan 2012 choi 2016 in the design of prismatic pressure vessels relevant design regulations must be considered for ship applications imo published the igc code imo 2008 and promulgates several requirements including msc 285 86 imo 2009 although msc 285 86 is currently undergoing revisions this standard has provided an interim guideline for gas fueled ships since 2009 most requirements are presented in the igc code which contains the requirements for the design manufacture commissioning and operation of all equipment for liquefied gas carriers in particular regarding pressure vessels the igc code describes a generally acceptable design theory that may be used the theory is accepted by standards such as en 13458 and the asme boiler and pressure vessel code hereafter the asme code section viii of the asme code specifies three divisions division 1 rules for the construction of pressure vessels division 2 alternative rules for the construction of pressure vessels and division 3 alternative rules for the construction of high pressure vessels division 1 consists of material selection the design and construction of pressure vessels for generally known shapes division 3 involves rules for pressure vessels that can withstand high pressures above 10 ksi 70 mpa specifically division 2 addresses a pressure vessel for on board transport a non circular vessel asme 2010a this division is applicable for the design of an on board pressure vessel for gas fuel storage division 1 adopts a relatively simple calculation with an approximation formula and the design and requirements for stress analysis are described through complex calculation methods in division 2 there are two different methods of designing pressure vessels design by rule and design by analysis design by rule provides design rules for commonly used pressure vessel shapes under loading within specified limits rules or guidance for the treatment of other loadings design by rule does not provide all load conditions and geometries therefore in the case of pressure vessels not covered by the design by rule strategy design by analysis is applied desai and patel 2014 stonehouse et al 2012 slagis 2005 otherwise the rules of classification groups are based on the igc code these rules are applicable to a conventional pressure vessel but not to a prismatic pressure vessel thus they cover only conventional pressure vessels abs 2010 dnv 2013 gl 2008 this study includes a strength assessment of a prismatic pressure vessel with plate structures based on numerical and experimental stress analyses the main purpose of manufacturing a prototype vessel is to evaluate the design concept manufacturability and use of a hydrostatic pressure test these considerations satisfy the asme code for approval by a third party authorized inspection asme 2010a desai and patel 2014 mohite suraj and kotwal girish 2017 section 2 presents the design principle of the prismatic pressure vessel section 3 provides the configuration of the prototype construction materials and design considerations of the prismatic pressure vessel section 4 presents the procedure and results of the strength calculation by numerical analysis using the finite element method section 5 discusses the experimental stress analysis results using strain gauges which indicate that the design concept of the prismatic pressure vessel is feasible for containing pressurized liquids section 6 summarizes and concludes this paper 2 design principle of a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel the basic principle of the plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel is as follows in the design we use a combination of three design principles first to design the parallel plate we check the force equilibrium when internal pressure is applied second we verify two conditions whether the parallel plate can withstand the weight of the upper part of the pressure vessel and whether buckling occurs finally it is confirmed that the stiffener installed outside the pressure vessel can withstand the internal pressure 2 1 parallel plate thickness calculation fig 1 shows the equilibrium of the force of the tensile stress on the internal parallel plate due to the internal pressure that initially acts on the external plate when there are n x parallel plates in the x direction n y parallel plates in the y directions and the plate thickness is t p p the total area is as follows 1 a a t p p n y b t p p n x if the uniform internal pressure p acts on the external plate the tensile stress can be expressed as 2 σ a p a b if a b the thickness of the parallel plate can be defined as follows 3 t p p p a σ a n x n y 2 2 internal parallel plate buckling stress calculation fig 2 shows the effect of buckling caused by the weight of the upper external plate on the internal parallel plate an internal parallel plate is a primary component that must withstand the tensile stress when an internal pressure is applied and should be designed to withstand its own weight when the internal pressure does not support the plate assuming that the compressive force n x acts on the square plate in the downward direction the formula for the plate is as follows

vessel was designed using the equations proposed in section 2 the configuration and main dimensions of the prototype prismatic pressure vessel are shown in fig 5 this prototype has a capacity of approximately 80 m3 weighs 38 tons and sustains a 9 5 barg design pressure here the design pressure is normally identical to or higher than the maximum allowable working pressure mawp for pressure vessels that operate at the mawp the hydrostatic pressure test must be designed to withstand the following test pressures according to ug 99 in the asme code eq 19 should be satisfied during the

the above equation the test pressure is 13 6 barg 143 of the mawp asme 2010a the structural components are categorized into two groups primary and secondary components the primary components are the shell endbox structures parallel plates arches and semi arches the shell is the primary load bearing component the endbox provides high stiffness with cubical spaces with the shell walls and floor the parallel plates are attached in equal intervals of 1 m and divide the inside of the prismatic pressure vessel into several sections these plates transfer a load through tension membrane stresses in the parallel plates the endbox and parallel plates contain a manhole with a diameter of 600 mm the manhole enables a worker to move and test fluid to be transferred through the steel plates the arches and semi arches also transfer the load using the same principle as the parallel plates in particular the shape of the semi arches is designed by considering the pattern of stress flow in addition the secondary components are stiffeners and nozzles the stiffeners are attached on the outsides of the shells these stiffeners withstand the bending deformation of the shells the nozzles provide workers access to inlet or outlet piping the piping feeds or drains the testing fluid for the hydrostatic pressure test table 1 summarizes all structural components with the construction material according to

used to make the finite element model for the prototype load conditions in the fem and experimental analysis three types of load conditions are assumed in fig 6 linear elastic described in section 4 2 nonlinear elastic plastic described in section 4 3 experimental condition described in section 5 material condition as described in section 3 the stress strain curve of the material to be used in the actual design and fabrication is analyzed and the nonlinear region of each material is input in the analysis the elastic plastic analysis method is a design method that uses the actual behavior of materials this method more accurately assesses the structural integrity and considers geometric nonlinearities to use this method the stress strain curve of each material must be used asme 2010a division 2 describes an equation that can generate the stress strain curve using several parameters such as the tensile strength and yield strength fig 7 illustrates the stress strain curves of the construction materials for the plastic and elastic regions mesh the mesh is the eight node shell element s8r the mesh size selection is based on the convergence study and the reference literature a mesh convergence study was preformed and the error in the mesh was estimated to be less than 5 stonehouse m 2012 based on the dnvgl guidelines for finite element analysis the element length is not to be greater than 2 longitudinal spaces with a minimum of three elements between primary supporting members and the rules for the classification of ships part 3 chapter 7 finite element analysis

prototype foundation has appropriate boundary conditions four points on the bottom side one point is fixed as the reference point x 0 y 0 and z 0 the other points enable the vessel to deform in the axial directions x and y according to the pressure 4 2 linear elastic stress analysis in the linear elastic stress condition the pressure that acts on the pressure vessel is set to the mawp throughout the entire analysis where the stress value exceeded the allowable stress and the strain value became nonlinear is determined in the stress analysis the pressure vessel is divided into two groups primary components and secondary components when the load is applied to the entire prismatic pressure vessel the stress is expected to be highest near the endbox or around the hatch due to the pressure through the stress analysis the areas where the stress value is larger than that of the surroundings can be identified fig 9 and verification is required in these areas such as the shell endbox floor wall parallel plate arch and semi arch a plate area near the exit hatch which is expected to be concentrated at the load carrying plate part is composed of an inner parallel plate among the primary members points a and b a semi arch with a deformed shape point c an arch point d and near the end floor in the endbox a vertical manhole points e and f as shown in fig 10 fig 11 illustrate the results of linear elastic stress analysis at points a and b the expected elongation is small due to the hatch at these points the stresses are confirmed to be below the allowable stress when the mawp of 9 5 barg is applied to point a the stress is 55 25 mpa and the stress at point b is 43 3 mpa the safety factor of point a is 2 98 3 81 point c is a semi arch section of the vertically installed parallel plate whose shape is biased toward one side compared to point d and the stiffener is installed to distribute the concentrated stress in the semi arch due to stiffener the stress value is lower than the allowable stress 113 2 mpa point d is determined to have a higher stress than other points due to parallel plate elongation and is installed in the horizontal direction thus the plate is designed to contain a circle with radius r as a result the stress value is 105 1 mpa for points e and f due to the vertically installed manhole a concentrated stress is expected but the stress values are 39 0 mpa and 41 1 mpa respectively considering the primary components as a whole relatively high stress values of 113 2 mpa and 105 1 mpa are obtained at points c and d however since both points have lower values than the allowable stress of the material the design is suitably safe the endbox floor tends to be extended in the x and y directions but the two shell sides sustain the floor the endbox walls and parallel plates are placed in tension because the mawp is applied to the shell the endbox walls in the corner section are stronger than those in the middle section which implies that the shell sides support the components with respect to the strength and the endbox wall should have a relatively high load bearing capacity a curved shell shows a notably lower stress distribution than a flat shell thus the curved shell has a better geometry for distributing the stress without bending this curved shell can have a smaller thickness than that of the flat shell in the secondary components which should be made to withstand the additional load in the pressure vessel in the external shell part no parallel plate can withstand the stress due to the endbox and manhole g and h in the fig 10 and the total stress is analyzed points g and h are expected to have lower stresses than the parallel plate which is the primary component as a result of analysis both stress values of 60 3 mpa and 60 8 mpa are lower than the allowable stress according to the analysis of the linear elastic stress analysis the primary components have the highest stress at point c at a 9 5 barg mawp sufficient safety is confirmed throughout the entire stress analysis section 4 3 nonlinear elastic plastic load analysis the plastic collapse load may be obtained from the fem results using the nonlinear elastic plastic analysis method the fem considers internal pressure increments from zero to a significantly higher pressure than mawp or the test pressure here to quantify the plastic collapse load the appropriate pressure is selected to be 40 barg the internal pressure gradually increases and the calculated stresses also increase as shown in fig 12 while the pressure increases a certain load is obtained that causes structural instability due to the plastic deformation this result determines the vulnerable component and the rupture mechanism of the prismatic pressure vessel as in the case of the linear region the behaviors at each point of the primary and secondary members are analyzed the distribution of the overall stress is identical to that in the linear region the highest stress remains at point c which is the semi arch of the primary member the stress distribution around hatch points a and b confirms that the stress value of point a remains higher than that of point b which shows that the hatch causes a strong binding force in the width direction when the pressure is increased to 40 barg as a complete prototype pressure vessel would experience the stress value increases almost linearly and is less than the yield strength 250 mpa in other words it is confirmed that even at higher pressures than 9 5 barg which is designed as a standard the structure can withstand the pressure without plastic deformation the maximum stress values of points a and b are 213 5 mpa and 171 7 mpa respectively point c shows the highest stress distribution in the linear elastic analysis in the nonlinear elastic plastic analysis the highest stress occurs under a pressure of 29 barg at the mawp and 13 6 barg test pressure a lower stress value of 161 7 mpa is obtained thus there is no plastic deformation at the test pressure and sufficient safety is maintained the stress value remains unchanged at 20 barg or more the stress value is redistributed to the near region and plastic deformation is observed at point c at 35 barg point d is notably similar to point c and the stresses in these locations are higher than those at the other points plastic deformation is not observed when the pressure increases to 40 barg at points e and f the stress distributions extend from the vertical manhole to the other zones thus a low stress value appears even when the 13 6 barg test pressure is applied e and f have the lowest stress among all points even when a 40 barg pressure is applied in general for the primary components almost an identical tendency arises as that of the case of the linear elastic analysis high stresses are observed at points c and d and the stress distribution linearly increases to the 13 6 barg test pressure points g and h have a higher stress distribution than other points except for c and d as a characteristic feature it is confirmed that g point has an almost identical stress distribution until plastic deformation is observed and this stress reaches the plastic deformation threshold faster than those of the other points at 32 8 barg since point g is close to the point where the external shells meet the stress value is high due to the effect of bending the results of the nonlinear elastic plastic analysis show that plastic deformation does not occur anywhere before 32 8 barg thus the designed prototype pressure vessel has a better load capacity than expected 5 experimental stress analysis 5 1 experimental stress analysis conditions the purpose of the experimental stress analysis is to ensure structural stability using strain gauges actual stresses are obtained from the measured strains strain gauges are commonly used to determine the state of stress on a test part surface with increasing internal pressure the strains are increased the strains are converted to stresses using the stress strain curves of the construction materials the experimental procedures to obtain the pressure stress behavior of the prototype in practice are as follows the experiment requires strain gauges with a three wire quarter bridge a data acquisition system and a test pump as shown in fig 13 the support conditions are the same as those of the fem the strain gauges should be waterproof because they are underwater inside the prototype during the hydrostatic pressure test the kfw 5 120 c1 11 is a foil strain gauge for underwater service kyowa 1999 individual strain gauges are independently connected to a wheatstone bridge the arrangement of the bridge depends on the experimental conditions and purpose here a three wire quarter bridge circuit on the lead wire is used when the wire distance is greater than 6 m the resistance of the wire is not negligible and may decrease the input signal from the strain gauges vishay 2010 fig 14 a and b illustrate the attached strain gauges and fig 14 c shows the adhesive and waterproof treatment for the strain gauge the measuring points were selected to obtain the strains from each pressure which is similar to an fem analysis these points represent the parts with the structural behaviors of interest shown in section 4 2 and fig 10 the parallel plates a and b are the main load carrying components and the stress concentration points c d e and f are also points of interest the shells also have measuring points g and h six gauges a f and eight gauges g and h operate underwater and in air respectively the strain gauges are directly connected to the data acquisition system ni pxie 4330 with a wheatstone bridge the experiment goes from zero pressure to the mawp and test pressure this particular experiment was performed for 2 h and 20 min using the internal pressure profile in the fig 6 the internal pressure was changed from zero to an mawp of 9 5 barg from the mawp to the test pressure and from the test pressure to 20 barg the internal pressure profile changed at each pressure step the experiment was performed until plastic stress arose at the measurement points using the stress strain curves in fig 7 the corresponding plastic strain regime begins at 0 0033 5 2 experimental stress analysis in this section the experimental stresses of the prototype tank are presented with the fem results in fig 15 a and b for the same test period in the experiment a time lag exists due to the stress distribution after the pressure load is applied the time is required for pressure stabilization for the entire tank in the experimental analysis the strain values are obtained when the pressure becomes stable after a certain time period 5 2 1 primary member analysis a f parallel plates point a and b the fem analysis results in fig 15 b confirm that the maximum stress of point a is 55 25 mpa when the mawp is applied the experimental strain gauge data show a maximum value of 34 95 mpa which is lower than fem at point b the fem result is 43 3 mpa and the experimental result is 30 91 mpa in the fem model since the hatch part is not the primary member the hatch part is briefly modeled than the actual prototype pressure vessel thus the actual value is lower than expected stress value comparing analysis results when the test pressure and ultimate pressure are applied the measured fem value is at least 30 mpa lower than the maximum predicted value and even at 20 barg ultimate pressure the stress value is 3 4 times lower than the yield strength semi arch point c and d the maximum value at point c on the mawp is 113 mpa in the fem and 91 mpa in the experimental results respectively thus we obtain a maximum safety factor of 2 5 when the test pressure and ultimate pressure are loaded almost identical results to the fem results are obtained it is confirmed that the predicted results are similar to the actual results when considering the time delay in the test pressure load condition the safety factor is 1 55 1 57 and the yield strength is not reached even at 20 barg thus safe operation is confirmed over the entire range of pressure loads in point d the fem result is 105 11 mpa and the experimental result is 80 60 mpa the safety factor of fem is to be 2 5 or more compared with the actual yield strength when the stress results are measured with increasing pressure the safety factor is 1 67 2 20 at the test pressure and 1 35 1 57 at the ultimate pressure for the actual production prototype pressure vessel relative to the fem model lower stress values are obtained than the predicted value due to welding and stress distribution around the stiffener end box point e and f the stress at points e and f is lower than other points due to the external stiffener around the endbox point f is expected to have a lower stress than e because it is close to the stiffener at point e the experimental and fem values are almost similar to those in mawp and the fem value is slightly higher at the test pressure the stress value increased rapidly at 13 6 barg or more indicating that the strain gauges are detached rather than reach the yield strength at point f the stress is measured low until the test pressure when the pressure reaches 20 barg a higher stress value is obtained than the fem prediction at the test pressure or higher pressure the stress is not measured at point e but according to the tendency of other points this point is considered to be within the safe range both e and f are safe over the entire pressure range the thickness or shape at this part can be changed in later designs due to the high safety factor value at least 2 9 5 2 2 secondary member analysis g h external shell point g and h at point g and h the fem stress is greater than those from the experimental results because in the fem shell the external internal stress values are identical thus a higher stress value appears however the actual measurements show that the fem predicted stress value is different from the actual measured value because various stress distributions arise due to the shell thicknesses durelli et al 1961 since the strain gauges are connected and measured in the external shell it is confirmed that the stress value is lower than expected as shown in fem results the stress is lower than the other areas the experimental analysis results show that plastic deformation does not occur anywhere except point e these results show that the manufactured prototype has a better load capacity than that expected consequently the analysis result shows that the prototype designed in this study is suitable for containing pressurized liquid at up to 20 barg with no plastic deformation in this experimental and fem analysis it can be seen that there is a difference up to 30 according to previous studies of experimental and fem analysis from 13 3 25 error were occurred durelli et al 1961 little et al 2010 huda and ajani 2015 mohite 2017 it is confirmed that simulation predicts higher value than actual phenomenon the identified differences between experiment and fem simulation are welding material properties and pressure difference in internal external shell 6 conclusions a prismatic pressure vessel with a plate structure was introduced to contain high pressurized fluids for ship fuel the prototype of the prismatic pressure vessel was designed and analyzed to prove its applicability the main advantage of the prismatic pressure vessel is its higher volume efficiency than those of conventional pressure vessels a characteristic of the pressure vessel is its use of flat plate components such as shells parallel plates and arches with strong stiffeners on the shell the parallel plates are configured as a modular structure and carry the tension loads an experimental stress analysis was performed under the mawp and test pressure and a computational analysis using abaqus cae 6 12 was also performed both results indicate the feasibility of the prismatic pressure vessel for on board gas fuel storage in the computational analysis the plastic and elastic properties of the construction materials are considered when the stress results of the experiment and computational analysis are compared certain differences in the stress distributions are observed however identical structural behaviors are obtained the vulnerable location is the parallel plate with the semi arch which may collapse when a plastic collapse load is applied the stress results show that the designed prototype satisfies the design criteria according to the asme code and no failure is expected to occur during the operation and testing periods of the manufactured prototype 
23194,a hydroelastic model is considered to examine the proliferation of water waves over little deformation on a versatile seabed the versatile base surface is modelled as a thin large plate and depends upon euler bernoulli beam equation in such circumstances two different modes of time harmonic proliferating waves exist rather than one mode of proliferating waves for any particular frequency the waves with smaller wavenumber proliferate along the free surface and the other with higher wavenumber spreads along the versatile base surface the expression for first and second order potentials and henceforth the reflection and transmission coefficients upto second order for both modes are acquired by the strategy in view of green s function method a fix of sinusoidal swells is considered for instance to approve the scientific outcomes it is seen that when the train of occurrence waves engenders because of the free surface unsettling influence or the flexural wave movement in the fluid we generally acquire the reflected and transmitted vitality exchange from the free surface wave mode to the flexural wave mode further we understand that the practical changes in the flexural unbending nature on the versatile base surface have a remarkable effect on the issue of water wave proliferation over small bottom distortions keywords versatile base surface bottom distortion green s function sinusoidal bed reflection coefficient transmission coefficient 1 introduction the issue of diffraction of waves by a floating or submerged deterrents is essential for their conceivable applications in the territory of waterfront and marine building and thus this kind of issues have been contemplated by numerous specialists in late decades the issue including reflection of surface waves by little base distortions has received an increasing amount of application as its mechanism is critical in the improvement of shore parallel bars or pipes at the point when a stream of incident dynamic water waves experiences a deterrent on the base of a sea the wave stream is mostly reflected by it and is incompletely transmitted over it in any case there exists a class for most of the part normally occurring base standing impediments for example sand swells which can be thought to be little in some sense for which some kind of perturbation strategy can be utilized for acquiring the first order correction to the reflection and transmission coefficients miles 1981 explored the issue of slant incident surface water waves spread over a little base twisting on an impermeable seabed a simplified perturbation technique followed by the finite cosine transform strategy are utilized as a part of the scientific examination of the issue to get the reflection and transmission coefficients up to the first order utilizing fourier transform strategy davies 1982 settled the reflection of typical incident surface waves by a fix of sinusoidal distortion on the seabed in a finite locale utilizing the linearized wave hypothesis staziker et al 1996 considered the issue of ordinary water wave dissipating by a bed elevation of any shape on a generally even bed surface the conduct of water waves over an impermeable occasional bed with free surface was understood by porter and porter 2003 in a two dimensional context utilizing linear water wave hypothesis they presented an exchange matrix technique which diminished the calculation to that required for a solitary period without bargaining the whole linear wave hypothesis chakrabarti and mohapatra 2013 considered the reflection and transmission of surface water waves by semi infinite floating flexible plates on a sea by utilizing eigenfunction extension method at the point when a seabed is made out of permeable material hydrodynamic attributes are modified by the wave instigated pore weight and soil relocations inside the dirt skeleton on the seabed utilizing galerkin eigenfunction extension method zhu 2001 contemplated the issue of water waves engendering inside permeable media on an undulating bed silva et al 2002 considered the issue of reflection as well as transmission of waves in an ocean where a permeable medium was expected to lie on the bed of fluctuating calm profundity jeng 2001 created wave scattering connection in a permeable seabed by utilizing the complex wavenumber in the poro versatile model of waves with seabed communication tsai et al 2006 researched the wave transmission over a submerged penetrable barrier on a permeable inclining seabed mohapatra 2015 explored the issue of wave diffraction by little distortion on a permeable bed in a sea by utilizing the green s integral hypothesis with the presentation of suitable green s function every issue depicted above is centered just around the wave movement in a sea with a free surface though the base is thought to be either an inflexible or permeable bed with little deformation in any case the flexibility of the seabed of variable profundity is additionally one of the imperative parts of the examination which has not been represented in these past examinations yet a couple of quantities of scientists have contemplated the wave structure communication issues within sight of a flexible seabed saha and bora 2015 examined the trapped modes upheld by a level submerged barrel set in either of the layers of a two layer fluid flowing over a flexible base at a finite profundity recently mohapatra 2017 considered a hydro elastic frame to inspect the diffracted waves by a moving sphere in a solitary layer fluid flowing over an infinitely extended versatile base surface in a sea of finite profundity there is a remarkable enthusiasm for late circumstances to research the wave engendering issues in a sea with free surface while the lower surface of the fluid is enveloped by a thin sheet of the flexible horizontal base surface displayed as a versatile plate no examination of the issue of water wave diffraction by an uneven structure for such kind of seabed has occurred till date this has inspired us to consider the issue of proliferation of water waves over little distortion on the flexible base surface rather than an inflexible or permeable base surface of an along the side unbounded sea because of the appearance of the versatile base surface at the seabed the linearized base limit condition turns into a fifth order one not at all like a straightforward homogenous neumann condition satisfied on account of an unbending bed in the present paper the effect of the versatile plate parameter on the proliferation of water waves over base distortion is analyzed by using the green s function technique it may be noted that the present paper is different than the earlier works studied by chakrabarti and mohapatra 2013 and mohapatra 2015 while in chakrabarti and mohapatra 2013 they discussed the scattering of water waves by floating ice plates on a sea having an impermeable bed surface by utilizing eigenfunction extension technique and in mohapatra 2015 he studied the reflection and transmission of water waves by a small bottom distortion on a permeable seabed by applying green s function method however in the present work we consider a hydroelastic model to study the water wave diffraction problem involving small bottom distortion on a versatile base surface in a sea especially when the seabed is always changing its shape such as in the earthquake regions 2 formulation of the problem let us consider an inviscid fluid which is incompressible and comparatively small amplitude under the action of gravity flowing over a versatile base surface of the seabed the versatile base surface is assumed as a narrow plate which obeys the euler bernoulli beam condition further the width of the versatile base surface is small in comparison with the wavelength of the incoming waves here the motion of fluid is assumed to be irrotational and time harmonic with angular frequency ω the sketch of the problem in cartesian coordinates is illustrated in fig 1 we consider a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system x y where the x axis chosen horizontal and the y axis is taken vertically downwards the fluid is of infinite horizontal extent in x direction while the depth is along the y direction let the line y 0 represents the mean position of the undisturbed free surface of the fluid and the line y d represents the position of the versatile base surface assume that a train of regular incident waves proliferates along the positive x direction of the fluid further we assume that the seabed has a small bottom deformation in the form y d ξ f x where ξ 1 is a non dimensional number which represents a measure of the smallness of bottom deformation and the function f x represents the shape of the bottom deformation which is differentiable and converges to zero as x tends to infinity when a train of incident waves travelling from a large distance proliferates over a bottom deformation on the seabed then the train of incident waves is partly reflected by the bottom deformation say reflected waves and partly transmitted over it say transmitted waves here the main concern is to evaluate the reflection and transmission coefficients associated with the reflected and transmitted wave fields respectively assuming the linearized wave theory the motion of the fluid particle in the region x 0 y d ξ f x is depicted by a potential function which is expressed as ℜ φ x y e i ω t where φ is called as the spatial potential function in such situation the governing equation for the physical problem involving the function φ is 2 1 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 0 x 0 y d ξ f x the linearized free surface boundary condition at y 0 is 2 2 φ y k φ 0 y 0 and the linearized versatile base surface boundary condition at y d is given by 2 3 d 4 x 4 ε k 1 φ n k φ 0 y d ξ f x where k ω 2 g g is the acceleration due to gravity d represents the flexural rigidity of the versatile base surface on the seabed which is expressed as d e h 3 12 ρ g 1 p e and p are the young s modulus and the poisson s ratio respectively for the versatile base surface ρ denotes the density of the fluid h represents the width of the versatile base surface ε ρ ρ h e ρ represents the density of the versatile base and n denotes the derivative in a direction normal to the bottom surface of the seabed the time dependence term of e i ω t has been cut off throughout the analysis assuming a non dimensional number ξ to be small enough to neglect the third and higher order terms then the linearized condition on the versatile base surface which is given in equation 2 3 can be written in a suitable form as 2 4 d 4 x 4 ε k 1 φ y ξ x f x φ x ξ 2 2 f x 2 3 φ y 3 2 f x f x 2 φ x y f x 2 φ y k φ ξ f x φ y ξ 2 2 f x 2 2 φ y 2 o ξ 3 0 y d now within the frame of linearized wave theory a train of two dimensional regular incident waves proliferates along the positive x direction takes the following form 2 5 φ i n c x y q α y e i α x where 2 6 q α y k sinh α d y d α 4 ε k 1 α cosh α d y k sinh α d d α 4 ε k 1 α cosh α d and the unknown constant α satisfies the dispersion relation 2 7 α 2 d α 4 ε k 1 k 2 tan h α d k α d α 4 ε k 2 0 as we assumed earlier that the width of the versatile base surface is very small as compared to the wavelength of the incident proliferating wave so that ρ h 1 and hence it does not effect on the zeros of equation 2 7 in equation 2 7 there are two distinct positive real zeros v 1 and v 2 say 0 v 1 v 2 that represent the wavenumber of incident proliferating waves four complex zeros of the form x 1 i y 1 and x 2 i y 2 with x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 that relate to the damped proliferating waves and a countable infinity number of purely imaginary zeros i ν 2 i ν 1 i ν 1 i ν 2 that correspond to evanescent waves where ν 1 ν 2 are positive real numbers satisfy the following equation 2 8 k 2 ν n 2 d ν n 4 ε k 1 tan ν n d k ν n d ν n 4 ε k 2 0 here the negative values of all of above zeros are also represent the zeros of dispersion equation 2 7 which indicate the wavenumbers of proliferating waves in the negative direction as the dispersion equation is having exactly two distinct positive real zeros v 1 and v 2 so two different waves exist in the specified fluid region x 0 y d ξ f x the wave with smaller wavenumber proliferates along the free surface say free surface mode and the wave with larger wavenumber proliferates along the versatile base surface say flexural mode when a train of two dimensional incident waves proliferates over a versatile base surface with a little bottom deformation on the seabed then the train of incident waves is partly reflected by it and partly transmitted over it therefore our primary concern is to calculate the reflection as well as transmission coefficients approximately first consider a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates along the positive x direction which is in the form 2 9 φ 0 v 1 x y q v 1 y e i v 1 x where the function q is defined as in equation 2 6 it may be noted here that when a train of regular incident proliferating waves of any individual mode come across a floating or submerged structure in a fluid then some of the reflected and transmitted energy transfer from one wave mode to the other therefore when the train of regular incident proliferating wave of mode v 1 comes across the cylindrical deformation at the bottom of the fluid then the reflected as well as transmitted wave of both modes v 1 and v 2 appear in the entire fluid region thus the far field behavior of the potential φ is given by 2 10 φ r e i v 1 x e i v 1 x q v 1 y r q v 2 y e i v 2 x x t q v 1 y e i v 1 x t q v 2 y e i v 2 x x where the unknown constants r and r are the reflection coefficients related to the reflected waves with wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 respectively due to a train of regular incident waves of wavenumber v 1 and the value of these coefficients are to be evaluated similarly the unknown constants t and t are the transmission coefficients related to the transmitted waves with wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 respectively because of a train of regular incident proliferating wave of mode v 1 and the value of these coefficients are to be evaluated in this particular case when a train of incident proliferating waves of mode v 1 proliferates along x direction then the potential φ satisfies the laplace s equation 2 1 the linearized free surface boundary condition 2 2 the linearized bottom condition 2 4 and the far field condition 2 10 in the next when a train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 flexural mode engenders because of the flexural wave movement in the fluid over little deformation on the versatile seabed the potential function in the fluid is given by 2 11 φ 0 v 2 x y e i v 2 x q v 2 y in this case the far field condition for the potential function φ is 2 12 φ r q v 1 y e i v 1 x r e i v 2 x e i v 2 x q v 2 y x t q v 1 y e i v 1 x t q v 2 y e i v 2 x x where r and r are the reflection coefficients of wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 respectively because of a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 2 similarly t and t are the complex valued constants which correspond to the transmission coefficients of wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 respectively because of a train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 our main aim is to determine these coefficients when a train of occurrence waves engenders with wavenumber v 2 then the velocity potential function of the fluid needs to satisfy the laplace s equation the linearized free surface boundary condition the linearized bottom surface condition and the far field condition which involves the unknown constants r r t and t procedure to calculate the analytical values of the coefficients r r t and t for the case of the train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 and r r t and t for the case of the train of incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 is quite a tough task for any bottom deformation on a seabed however by assuming small bottom deformation a perturbation expansion technique can be utilized here to calculate these unknown coefficients up to first order with the help of the perturbation expansion technique the entire fluid region x 0 y d ξ f x reduces to the uniform finite strip x 0 y d and then proceed to calculate the first order correction to the potential function and henceforth the reflection as well as transmission coefficients in the following mathematical technique 3 method of solution consider a problem of diffraction of normal incident waves by a small bottom deformation on a versatile base surface of the seabed since the versatile base surface of seabed assumed to be fixed at y d ξ f x which involves a small non dimensional parameter ξ 1 we will utilize a simplified perturbation technique only to convert the original bvp to an uncomplicated bvp for the first order potential function now the solution of new bvp which involves the first order velocity potential can work out by applying a procedure in view of green s integral theorem with the presentation of appropriate green s function first let us assume that a train of regular incident waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates over the bottom deformation on an infinitely extended versatile base surface of the seabed when there is no base distortion on the seabed then the proliferating waves proliferate without any deterrent and in this case only the transmitted waves proliferate along the positive x direction this concept along with the linearized bottom condition given in 2 4 suggests that the velocity potential of the fluid φ the reflection coefficients r and r and the transmission coefficients t and t because of a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 can be written as 3 1 φ φ 0 ξ φ 1 ξ 2 φ 2 o ξ 3 r ξ r 1 ξ 2 r 2 o ξ 3 r ξ r 1 ξ 2 r 2 o ξ 3 t ξ t 1 ξ 2 t 2 o ξ 3 t 1 ξ t 1 ξ 2 t 2 o ξ 3 where the bivariate functions φ 0 φ 1 and φ 2 are the zeroth order first order and second order potentials respectively in equations 3 1 and 2 4 the non dimensional parameter ξ means it characterizes the smallness of bottom distortion of the seabed maiti and mandal 2006 the pair of unknown constants r 1 r 1 and t 1 t 1 are the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients respectively with respect to wavenumbers v 2 and v 1 similarly the pair of unknown constants r 2 r 2 and t 2 t 2 are the second order reflection as well as transmission coefficients respectively with respect to wavenumbers v 2 and v 1 as mentioned earlier in mei 1985 here also the expressions for φ r r t and t given in equation 3 1 need to polish for the case of large scale reflection so that it can take care of bragg resonance case moreover the expressions highlighted for φ r r t and t are only reasonable for very small reflection and excluding the case of bragg resonance it may be noted here that in the equations given by 3 1 the expression for t is not in the same form as r r and t when there is no bottom distortion on the seabed then no reflection and full transmission occur in this case that is the full transmitted waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferate along the positive x direction of the fluid because of full transmission which occurs in the case of no bottom distortion the expansion of transmission coefficient t for the case bottom distortion starts with 1 maiti and mandal 2006 also the similar observation can be drawn from equation 2 10 by taking x we know that when a train of regular incident waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates along positive x direction in a sea with no bottom distortion the velocity potential function of the fluid is in the form q v 1 y e i v 1 x given in equation 2 9 therefore in equation 2 10 the value of t and t must be 1 and 0 respectively for the case when there is no bottom distortion and the velocity potential function φ will be in the form q v 1 y e i v 1 x along the positive x direction of the fluid thus due to this reason the value of t starts with 1 for the case of bottom distortion now applying the expressions for φ r r t and t in the governing equation 2 1 along with the boundary conditions 2 2 2 4 and 2 10 and then on both sides compare the respective like coefficients of zeroth order first order and second order terms of ξ we observe that the potential functions φ 0 φ 1 and φ 2 respectively follow three bvps which are represented by the following form bvp with respect to potential function φ 0 bvp i 3 2 2 φ 0 x 2 2 φ 0 y 2 0 0 y d 3 3 φ 0 y k φ 0 0 y 0 3 4 d 4 x 4 ε k 1

horizontal versatile base surface in order that the governing equation along with linearized boundary conditions given in equations 3 2 3 5 are satisfied the solution φ 0 x y of the bvp i is in the same form φ 0 v 1 as given in equation 2 9 it may be noted here that the bvp ii represents a problem of diffraction of waves by a little distortion on an infinitely extended versatile bed surface and asymptotic condition of the problem which associates the solution φ 0 x y of the bvp i to resolve the problem bvp ii for acquiring the first order potential function φ 1 we need to employ green s integral theorem with the development of a proper green s function then by employing the asymptotic condition in the solution of this problem a pair of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 correspond to the reflected waves of wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 and a pair of the first order transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 correspond to the transmitted waves with wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 can be evaluated explicitly now we develop a proper green s function for acquiring the solution of bvp ii defined by equations 3 6 3 10 with the assumption that a source term is submerged completely in the fluid we can construct a source potential concerning two dimensional green s function for laplace s equation let us consider a point p x y be the position of source term in the fluid now the source potential in terms of green s function g x y x y follows a bvp given by 3 16 2 g x 2 2 g y 2 0 0 y d 3 17 g y k g 0 y 0 3 18 d 4 x 4 ε k 1 g y k g 0 y d 3 19 g x y x y ln r r 0 where r 2 x x 2 y y 2 here the source potential of the fluid g x y x y represents outgoing cylindrical waves as x x tends to infinity now we acquire the solution of bvp ii given by equations 3 16 3 18 in terms of green s function g x y x y 3 20 g x y x y ln r r 1 0 c 1 v cosh v d y c 2 v sinh v y cos v x x d v where c 1 v and c 2 v are unknown functions to be determined and r 1 2 x x 2 y y 2 applying the respective linearized conditions at the free surface and on the versatile base surface of the fluid we get the value of c 1 v and c 2 v as follows 3 21 c 1 v 2 d v 4 ε k 1 k sinh v d y v cosh v d y cosh v d w v 3 22 c 2 v v sinh v d k cosh v d c 1 v 2 e v y v where 3 23 w v k 2 v 2 d v 4 ε k 1 sinh v d d v 4 ε k 2 k v cosh v d in equation 3 22 the term v in the denominator can never be taken zero as it indicates that there are no propagating waves in the fluid since w v has two distinct simple zeros at v v 1 and v v 2 so the integration in equation 3 20 contains two poles at v 1 and v 2 now solving equation 3 20 by using equations 3 21 3 22 we acquire the source potential g x y x y as follows 3 24 g x y x y 2 π i v 1 cosh v 1 d y v 1 sinh v 1 d k cosh v 1 d sinh v 1 y s v 1 v 1 cosh v 1 d w v 1 e i v 1 x x v 2 cosh v 2 d y v 2 sinh v 2 d k cosh v 2 d sinh v 2 y s v 2 v 2 cosh v 2 d w v 2 e i v 2 x x 2 π n 1 ν n cos ν n d y ν n sin ν n d k cos ν n d sin ν n y s ν n ν n cos ν n d w i ν n e ν n

denotes the evanescent waves spread along positive horizontal direction in the fluid since the source potential g x y x y behaves like a cylindrical wave at infinity therefore by assuming x x tends to infinity in equation 3 24 we can determine the source potential g x y x y as follows 3 26 g x y x y 2 π i v 1 cosh v 1 d y v 1 sinh v 1 d k cosh v 1 d sinh v 1 y s v 1 v 1 cosh v 1 d w v 1 e i v 1 x x

application of green s integral theorem for the source potential function g and the first order potential φ 1 in the following form 3 27 ω φ 1 g n g φ 1 n d s 0 where ω denotes a closed contour which consists of the straight lines x x 0 y d x x x y d x x 0 y d x x x y d and a small circle of radius γ with center x y and ultimately assuming γ tends to zero and x tends to infinity as both functions g x y x y and φ 1 converge to zero when x tends to infinity so the contribution to the integrals from the lines x x 0 y d and x x 0 y d are zero when x tends to infinity also using the linearized free surface boundary condition for the functions g and φ 1 the integral given in equation 3 27 along the line x x x y 0 becomes zero for any value of x now putting together all the respective integral values in equation 3 27 the resultant form of this equation becomes 3 28 φ 1 x y 1 2 π k u x v 1 g y x d x y d x which solves the bvp ii for acquiring the expression for first order velocity potential function φ 1 at point p x y the bvp iii given in equations 3 11 3 15 represents a linear diffraction problem involving an unknown second order potential function φ 2 x y which associates with the solution φ 1 x y of the bvp ii the same procedure which was discussed earlier in the case of first order potential function φ 1 can be followed in this problem bvp iii for acquiring the second order potential function φ 2 thus the resultant expression for the second order correction of the potential function φ 2 in the fluid is as follows 3 29 φ 2 x y 1 2 π k v v 1 x g y x d x y d x where v v 1 x is given in equation 3 15 substituting the value of g given in equation 3 26 in the above equation we get φ 2 x y in the form 3 30 φ 2 x y i v v 1 x v 1 φ v 1 w v 1 e i v 1 x x v 2 φ v 2 w v 2 e i v 2 x x d x where 3 31 φ v i k sinh v i d y d v i 4 ε k 1 v i cosh v i d y d v i 4 ε k 1 v i cosh v i d k sinh v i d i 1 2 then by employing the asymptotic condition in the solution of this problem a pair of second order reflection coefficients r 2 and r 2 correspond to the reflected waves of wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 and a pair of the second order transmission coefficients t 2 and t 2 correspond to the transmitted waves with wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 can be evaluated explicitly in this paper we investigate the effect of versatile base surface on the problem of diffraction of water waves over little bottom deformation on the versatile seabed by assuming the linear wave theory under the assumption of linear wave theory the velocity potential satisfies laplace s equation 2 1 in the fluid further we have assumed that the boundary conditions at the free surface and versatile base surface given in equations 2 2 and 2 4 respectively are in linear form a simplified perturbation theory is utilized to reduce the entire equation which governs the original linear bvp to simple linear bvp s for the zeroth first and second order correction of the potential functions as the bvps corresponding to zeroth first and second order correction of the potentials are in linear form therefore the non linear effects of diffraction problem on higher order solution can not arise in our case detailed investigations related to non linear effects of diffraction problem on higher order can be found in bhatta 2005 chau and taylor 1992 mciver and mciver 1990 and rahman et al 1999 4 determination of hydrodynamic coefficients in this section we proceed to acquire the first and second order correction of reflection as well as transmission coefficients related to the reflected and transmitted waves because of a train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads over little deformation on the versatile seabed 4 1 first order coefficients to acquire the first order hydrodynamic reflection as well as transmission coefficients we need to solve equation 3 28 further by substituting the value of source potential g x y x y given in equation 3 26 on y d thus after solving equation 3 28 the expression for the potential φ 1 x y can be written as 4 1 φ 1 x y i v 1 φ v 1 w v 1 e i v 1 x x v 2 φ v 2 w v 2 e i v 2 x x u x v 1 d x where φ v i i 1 2 is given in equation 3 31 now the expressions for a pair of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 can be evaluated by considering the value of φ 1 x y when x tends to in equation 4 1 and then compare it with equation 3 9 by substituting x y with x y thus we acquire the final expression for r 1 and r 1 as 4 2 r 1 i v 1 y v 1 v 1 w v 1 f x e 2 i v 1 x d x 4 3 r 1 i v 2 y v 1 v 2 w v 2 f x e i v 1 v 2 x d x where the function y is defined as follows 4 4 y x y k x sinh d x k cosh d x x cosh d x k sinh d x d y 4 ε k 1 y similarly a pair of first order transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 can be evaluated by assuming x tends to infinity in equation 4 1 and comparing with the corresponding expression for φ 1 from equation 3 9 thus we acquire the final expression for t 1 and t 1 as 4 5 t 1 i v 1 y v 1 v 1 w v 1 f x d x 4 6 t 1 i v 2 y v 1 v 2 w v 2 f x e i v 1 v 2 x d x therefore a pair of first order reflection coefficients as well as transmission coefficients calculated from equations 4 3 4 4 and 4 5 4 6 when the shape of the bottom distortion of the versatile base surface is finally known next assume that a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 2 proliferates over the bottom deformation on an infinitely extended versatile base surface of the seabed the same procedure which was discussed earlier for the case of mode v 1 is carried out in acquiring the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients r 1 r 1 t 1 and t 1 in this case the required expression of these coefficients are as follows 4 7 r 1 i v 1 y v 2 v 1 w v 1 f x e i v 1 v 2 x d x 4 8 r 1 i v 2 y v 2 v 2 w v

reflection coefficients r 2 and r 2 can be evaluated by considering the value of φ 2 x y when x tends to in equation 3 30 and then compare it with equation 3 14 by substituting x y with x y thus we acquire the final expression for r 2 and r 2 as 4 11 r 2 i v 1 w v 1 v v 1 x e i v 1 x d x 4 12 r 2 i v 2 w v 2 v v 1 x e i v 2 x d x similarly a pair of second order transmission coefficients t 2 and t 2 can be evaluated by assuming x tends to infinity in equation 3 30 and comparing with the corresponding expression for φ 2 from equation 3 14 thus we acquire the final expression for t 2 and t 2 as 4 13 t 2 i v 1 w v 1 v v 1 x e i v 1 x d x 4 14 t 2 i v 2 w v 2 v v 1 x e i v 2 x d x therefore a pair of second order reflection coefficients as well as transmission coefficients can be calculated explicitly from equations 4 11 4 14 when the solution φ 1 x y of the bvp ii as well as the shape of the bottom distortion of the versatile base surface are finally known next assume that a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 2 proliferates over the bottom deformation on an infinitely extended versatile base surface of the seabed the same procedure which was discussed earlier for the case of mode v 1 is carried out in acquiring the second order reflection as well as transmission coefficients r 2 r 2 t 2 and t 2 in this case the required expression of these

section we move forward to investigate the effect of the versatile base surface on first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients for a fixed sinusoidal swell of the bottom distortion 5 a fixed form of bottom profile davies 1982 investigated a problem of water diffraction by a fixed sinusoidal swells of bottom distortion on an impenetrable seabed and acquired that a fixed sinusoidal surface has a potential to give back the energy from incident wave which is more qualitatively involvement in respect of coastal protection from the harsh and uneven sea due to the fact of being of the great significance of sinusoidal swells bed surface from the physical point of view a lot of emphases laid upon them therefore consideration of sinusoidal swell bed surface is deemed appropriate discussed in davies and heathershaw 1984 consider a sinusoidal swells bed surface with amplitude a on an otherwise plane base surface on the versatile seabed is in the form 5 1 f x a sin p x n π p x n π p 0 otherwise where the patch of sinusoidal swells bed surface having a total n number of ripples and p denotes the ripple wavenumber of sinusoidal swell bed surface in the region n π p x n π p suppose that a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates over little deformation on a versatile seabed the expressions for a pair of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 and a pair of first order transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 acquire by replacing the function f x from equation 5 1 into equations 4 2 4 3 and 4 5 4 6 thus the required expression for these coefficients are as follows 5 2 r 1 1 n 2 a v 1 p y v 1 v 1 w v 1 sin 2 n v 1 π p p 2 4 v 1 2 5 3 r 1 1 n 2 a v 2 p y v 1 v 2 w v 2 sin n v 1 v 2 π p p 2 v 1 v 2 2 5 4 t 1 1 n 2 a v 2 p y v 1 v 2 w v 2 sin n v 1 v 2 π p p 2 v 1 v 2 2 the transmission coefficient t 1 in connection with the waves with wavenumber v 1 vanishes identically for this fixed shape sinusoidal swell of bottom deformation on the versatile base surface in the region n π p n π p next we consider the case of the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 proliferates over little deformation on a versatile seabed in this case a pair of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 and a pair of transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 acquire by replacing the function f x from equation 5 1 into equations 4 7 4 10 thus the required expression of these coefficients are as follows 5 5 r 1 1 n 2 a v 1 p y v 2 v 1 w v 1 sin n v 1 v 2 π p p 2 v 1 v 2 2 5 6 r 1 1 n 2 a v 2

vanishes identically the expressions for r 1 r 1 t 1 and t 1 given in equations 5 2 5 7 demonstrate that the behavior of the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients are oscillatory in nature for a given number of ripples in the patch of the sinusoidal swells bed surface furthermore it is observed from equation 5 2 that when the wavenumber v 1 of normal incident waves become approximately half the wavenumber p of the bottom deformation on the versatile seabed the reflection coefficient turns inexhaustible it means the entire theory moves towards the feasibility of a resonant interaction between the sinusoidal ripples on the versatile bed surface and the incident waves contrary to our assumption that the first order correction of the reflection coefficient r 1 is a small quantity therefore we only consider the cases that eliminating the situation to keep away from the rebuttal appearing out of the resonant case similarly it observes in equations 5 3 5 4 that when the wavenumber p of sinusoidal ripples approaches to the sum or difference of the wavenumbers the resonance interaction can be forecasted between the sinusoidal ripples on the versatile base surface and the incident waves similarly the resonance appearance can be analyzed for the case when the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 proliferates over little deformation on a versatile seabed 6 numerical results and discussion figs 2 7 demonstrate the absolute values of the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients graphically in the case of a train of regular incident proliferating wave with wavenumber v 1 proliferates over a little deformation on the versatile base surface of a seabed assume that the versatile base surface model as a plate in all the figures the depth of the sea fixed as 20 a the non dimensional number ε a as 0 and the ripple wavenumber p a as 1 the different plots in figs 2 4 correspond to different flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 as 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 where the sum of the ripples in the sinusoidal swells of bottom distortion of the versatile base surface fixed as 4 fig 2 shows that whenever the flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile base surface decreases the utmost values of r 1 for reflected waves with wavenumber v 1 increase and due to this the amplitude of the reflected waves increases in this case figs 3 and 4 display the first order reflection coefficient due to reflected waves and the transmission coefficient due to transmitted waves with wavenumber v 2 respectively for the case when the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 1 it is seen that when the value of flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of the versatile base surface decreases the utmost value for the case of both first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients increases the non zero value of both reflection coefficient due to reflected waves and the transmission coefficient due to transmitted waves with wavenumber v 2 indicates that some vitality exchange from one wave mode to the other is almost always possible moreover the absolute value of first order reflection coefficient due to reflected wave with wavenumber v 2 is found to be smaller in comparison to those of the reflected wave with wavenumber v 1 also from figs 2 4 it has been noticed that when the value of d a 4 raises the rate of change for the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients is higher for both free surface unsettling influence wave as well as flexural wave movement cases that implies the reflected as well as transmitted energy are quite conscious of the change of flexural rigidity parameter for the case of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates along the positive direction of the versatile seabed however when the value of flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile base surface decreases the absolute value of first order reflection and transmission coefficients become more than those of the smaller flexural rigidity parameters of the versatile seabed the different plots in figs 5 7 associate to different number of ripples on the patch of sinusoidal swells on the bottom distortion of the versatile seabed for these plots the flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of the versatile base surface is fixed at 3 5 it is observed from these figures that the utmost values for both first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients due to the free surface unsettling influence waves with wavenumbers v 1 and flexural waves with wavenumber v 2 raise when the sum of ripples on the patch of sinusoidal swells raises however when the sum of ripples on the versatile seabed becomes large then the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients converted into inexhaustible for some definite values of k a the above phenomena are called bragg resonance case which arises when the first order reflection coefficient turns into much bigger than the little non dimensional parameter ξ it implies the simplified perturbation expansion which introduced in the previous section 3 comes to an end when the first order reflection coefficient becomes much bigger than the distortion parameter as was discussed by mei 1985 again figs 5 and 6 show that when the sum of ripples on the patch of bottom distortion raises the oscillatory behavior of the first order coefficients r 1 and r 1 with respect to k a is clearly observable with increasing the number of zeros however the common characteristics of r 1 and r 1 remain the same figs 2 and 5 indicate that the maximum values of first order reflection coefficient are bigger in comparison to that of the example of mohapatra 2015 this happens because of the inclusion of the versatile base surface instead of assuming porous base surface similarly the case when a train of regular incident waves with wavenumber v 2 flexural mode proliferates over the seabed is also quite interesting because of the presence of the versatile base surface where the vitality is always possible to be transformed from one mode to the other like the case of the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 1 figs 8 13 show the absolute values of the first order reflection and transmission coefficient against k a in these figures we consider the depth of fluid d as 20 a the non dimensional parameter ε a as zero and the ripple wavenumber of the patch of the sinusoidal swells of bottom deformation p a as 1 figs 8 and 9 display the first order coefficients r 1 and r 1 because of the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 in these figures the different plots correspond to different flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 as 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 while the sum of ripples n in the patch of distortion on the versatile base surface is taken as 4 it has been noticed that when the non dimensionalized flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of the versatile base surface increases the utmost values of the absolute value of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 decrease in this case the decreasing rate of the first order reflection coefficient is quite inappreciable for low to average values of k a in both cases however the decreasing rate is smaller for bigger values of k a that means the versatile base surface does not have much effect on the reflected energy because of free surface wave influence and flexural wave movement in the fluid due to the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 moreover the rate of change for values of r 1 and r 1 are very inappreciable as compared to r 1 and t 1 respectively fig 10 shows the absolute value of first order transmission coefficient t 1 due to transmitted waves for the case when a train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 in this figure the different plots correspond to different flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of versatile base surface as 3 and 4 5 it is observed from this figure that when the value of flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 increases the rate of change for the first order transmission coefficient t 1 is very inappreciable this shows that the absolute value of non dimensionalized first order transmission coefficient t 1 is insensitive to the change in flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile base surface and it does not change remarkably when the versatile base surface is approached as an unbending surface it may be attributed to the fact that because of the versatile base surface is somewhat underneath the free surface of the fluid the flexural wave movement in the fluid is not much influenced by the change in the flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile base surface of the seabed that means the versatile base surface of seabed does not have much effect on the transmitted energy due to free surface unsettling influence in the fluid because of the train of incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 moreover the non zero values of the absolute values of the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients for a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 2 indicate that some conversion of reflected as well as transmitted energy from one wave mode to the other is almost always possible figs 11 13 show the different plots associate to the different number of ripples on a patch of sinusoidal swells on the versatile bottom surface where the non dimensionalized flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of the bed surface is taken as 3 5 it is observed that when the sum of ripples on the bottom distortion of versatile seabed raises the absolute values of r 1 and r 1 always exist and their utmost values become more in this case however when the sum of ripples becomes huge the first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 turns into inexhaustible for certain values of k a similar observation can be drawn from the case of the first order transmission coefficient t 1 thus in the case of the train of regular incident proliferating wave of mode v 2 also the simplified perturbation analysis which is introduced in section 3 comes to an end at the case of bragg resonance phenomena which happens when the first order reflection coefficient is much bigger than the distortion parameter computational results show that there is no singularity near k a 0 1 for the case of t 1 r 1 and t 1 which are plotted in figs 4 7 8 10 11 and 13 at k a 0 098 the values of p a v 1 a and v 2 a are 1 0 118680 and 0 respectively however for k a 0 101 the values of p a v 1 a and v 2 a are 1 0 120761 and 0 017338 respectively it may be attributed to the fact that only one proliferating wave exists upto the value of k a 0 1 and then two different proliferating waves exist for the values of k a 0 1 due to this there is a spike in the curves near to k a 0 1 in the case of t 1 r 1 and t 1 the work discussed in this paper is about solving a new hydroelastic model analytically to examine the proliferation of water waves over little bottom distortion on a versatile seabed to the best of the authors knowledge no investigation of the issue of water wave scattering by an uneven bottom distortion for a versatile seabed has carried out till date neither experimentally nor by any field measurements however our present work may compare up to some extent with the work of maiti and mandal 2006 as both problems bear little similarities it is to be noted that there is one basic similarity in the problem of the present work and the work by maiti and mandal 2006 while in maiti and mandal 2006 for any particular frequency there were two different time harmonic proliferating modes which proliferate in a sea with impermeable bottom distortion our work presents a problem where the same number of proliferating modes exist for any specified frequency and they proliferate over little bottom distortion on a versatile seabed figs 5 7 and 11 13 illustrate the features of the work of maiti and mandal 2006 such as the comparison of the increasing nature of the reflection and transmission coefficients depending on the number of ripples on the patch of bottom distortion but the numerical estimates of these coefficients are not the same due to different physical considerations and formulations 7 conclusion assuming the linearized wave theory we have examined the effect of the versatile base surface on the problem of proliferation of waves over little deformation on an infinitely extended versatile seabed in this case the versatile base surface is model as a thin plate and its width is minimal in comparison with the wavelength of the incoming wave in such circumstances two different modes of proliferating waves exist rather than one mode of spreading wave for any particular frequency the waves with smaller wavenumber proliferate along the free surface surface mode and the waves with bigger wavenumber spread along the versatile base surface flexural mode the first and second order potential functions are acquired by the strategy in view of green s integral theorem with the presentation of a suitable green s function for a fixed example of a patch of sinusoidal swells the first order corrections to the reflection as well as transmission coefficients for both modes are acquired in terms of integrals involving a function which is the frame of the bottom distortion on an infinitely extended versatile seabed it has seen that when the train of occurence wave engenders because of the free surface unsettling influence in the fluid the reflection and transmission for both wave modes decrease because of the increasing in flexural unbending nature of the versatile bed surface on the seabed however for a train of regular incident waves engenders because of flexural mode the reflected energy related to both wave modes decreases while the transmitted energy related to free surface wave mode increases because of the increasing in flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile bed surface again the non zero values of reflection and transmission coefficients because of either the free surface unsettling influence or the flexural wave movement in the fluid show that we generally find a possibility of some vitality exchange from one wave mode to other furthermore the utmost value of the reflection and transmission coefficients for both modes increases with the number of ripples of the sinusoidal swells bottom deformation on the versatile base surface of the seabed the results developed in this paper are expected to be qualitatively useful in tackling the water waves scattering problems in the earthquake regions

23194,a hydroelastic model is considered to examine the proliferation of water waves over little deformation on a versatile seabed the versatile base surface is modelled as a thin large plate and depends upon euler bernoulli beam equation in such circumstances two different modes of time harmonic proliferating waves exist rather than one mode of proliferating waves for any particular frequency the waves with smaller wavenumber proliferate along the free surface and the other with higher wavenumber spreads along the versatile base surface the expression for first and second order potentials and henceforth the reflection and transmission coefficients upto second order for both modes are acquired by the strategy in view of green s function method a fix of sinusoidal swells is considered for instance to approve the scientific outcomes it is seen that when the train of occurrence waves engenders because of the free surface unsettling influence or the flexural wave movement in the fluid we generally acquire the reflected and transmitted vitality exchange from the free surface wave mode to the flexural wave mode further we understand that the practical changes in the flexural unbending nature on the versatile base surface have a remarkable effect on the issue of water wave proliferation over small bottom distortions keywords versatile base surface bottom distortion green s function sinusoidal bed reflection coefficient transmission coefficient 1 introduction the issue of diffraction of waves by a floating or submerged deterrents is essential for their conceivable applications in the territory of waterfront and marine building and thus this kind of issues have been contemplated by numerous specialists in late decades the issue including reflection of surface waves by little base distortions has received an increasing amount of application as its mechanism is critical in the improvement of shore parallel bars or pipes at the point when a stream of incident dynamic water waves experiences a deterrent on the base of a sea the wave stream is mostly reflected by it and is incompletely transmitted over it in any case there exists a class for most of the part normally occurring base standing impediments for example sand swells which can be thought to be little in some sense for which some kind of perturbation strategy can be utilized for acquiring the first order correction to the reflection and transmission coefficients miles 1981 explored the issue of slant incident surface water waves spread over a little base twisting on an impermeable seabed a simplified perturbation technique followed by the finite cosine transform strategy are utilized as a part of the scientific examination of the issue to get the reflection and transmission coefficients up to the first order utilizing fourier transform strategy davies 1982 settled the reflection of typical incident surface waves by a fix of sinusoidal distortion on the seabed in a finite locale utilizing the linearized wave hypothesis staziker et al 1996 considered the issue of ordinary water wave dissipating by a bed elevation of any shape on a generally even bed surface the conduct of water waves over an impermeable occasional bed with free surface was understood by porter and porter 2003 in a two dimensional context utilizing linear water wave hypothesis they presented an exchange matrix technique which diminished the calculation to that required for a solitary period without bargaining the whole linear wave hypothesis chakrabarti and mohapatra 2013 considered the reflection and transmission of surface water waves by semi infinite floating flexible plates on a sea by utilizing eigenfunction extension method at the point when a seabed is made out of permeable material hydrodynamic attributes are modified by the wave instigated pore weight and soil relocations inside the dirt skeleton on the seabed utilizing galerkin eigenfunction extension method zhu 2001 contemplated the issue of water waves engendering inside permeable media on an undulating bed silva et al 2002 considered the issue of reflection as well as transmission of waves in an ocean where a permeable medium was expected to lie on the bed of fluctuating calm profundity jeng 2001 created wave scattering connection in a permeable seabed by utilizing the complex wavenumber in the poro versatile model of waves with seabed communication tsai et al 2006 researched the wave transmission over a submerged penetrable barrier on a permeable inclining seabed mohapatra 2015 explored the issue of wave diffraction by little distortion on a permeable bed in a sea by utilizing the green s integral hypothesis with the presentation of suitable green s function every issue depicted above is centered just around the wave movement in a sea with a free surface though the base is thought to be either an inflexible or permeable bed with little deformation in any case the flexibility of the seabed of variable profundity is additionally one of the imperative parts of the examination which has not been represented in these past examinations yet a couple of quantities of scientists have contemplated the wave structure communication issues within sight of a flexible seabed saha and bora 2015 examined the trapped modes upheld by a level submerged barrel set in either of the layers of a two layer fluid flowing over a flexible base at a finite profundity recently mohapatra 2017 considered a hydro elastic frame to inspect the diffracted waves by a moving sphere in a solitary layer fluid flowing over an infinitely extended versatile base surface in a sea of finite profundity there is a remarkable enthusiasm for late circumstances to research the wave engendering issues in a sea with free surface while the lower surface of the fluid is enveloped by a thin sheet of the flexible horizontal base surface displayed as a versatile plate no examination of the issue of water wave diffraction by an uneven structure for such kind of seabed has occurred till date this has inspired us to consider the issue of proliferation of water waves over little distortion on the flexible base surface rather than an inflexible or permeable base surface of an along the side unbounded sea because of the appearance of the versatile base surface at the seabed the linearized base limit condition turns into a fifth order one not at all like a straightforward homogenous neumann condition satisfied on account of an unbending bed in the present paper the effect of the versatile plate parameter on the proliferation of water waves over base distortion is analyzed by using the green s function technique it may be noted that the present paper is different than the earlier works studied by chakrabarti and mohapatra 2013 and mohapatra 2015 while in chakrabarti and mohapatra 2013 they discussed the scattering of water waves by floating ice plates on a sea having an impermeable bed surface by utilizing eigenfunction extension technique and in mohapatra 2015 he studied the reflection and transmission of water waves by a small bottom distortion on a permeable seabed by applying green s function method however in the present work we consider a hydroelastic model to study the water wave diffraction problem involving small bottom distortion on a versatile base surface in a sea especially when the seabed is always changing its shape such as in the earthquake regions 2 formulation of the problem let us consider an inviscid fluid which is incompressible and comparatively small amplitude under the action of gravity flowing over a versatile base surface of the seabed the versatile base surface is assumed as a narrow plate which obeys the euler bernoulli beam condition further the width of the versatile base surface is small in comparison with the wavelength of the incoming waves here the motion of fluid is assumed to be irrotational and time harmonic with angular frequency ω the sketch of the problem in cartesian coordinates is illustrated in fig 1 we consider a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system x y where the x axis chosen horizontal and the y axis is taken vertically downwards the fluid is of infinite horizontal extent in x direction while the depth is along the y direction let the line y 0 represents the mean position of the undisturbed free surface of the fluid and the line y d represents the position of the versatile base surface assume that a train of regular incident waves proliferates along the positive x direction of the fluid further we assume that the seabed has a small bottom deformation in the form y d ξ f x where ξ 1 is a non dimensional number which represents a measure of the smallness of bottom deformation and the function f x represents the shape of the bottom deformation which is differentiable and converges to zero as x tends to infinity when a train of incident waves travelling from a large distance proliferates over a bottom deformation on the seabed then the train of incident waves is partly reflected by the bottom deformation say reflected waves and partly transmitted over it say transmitted waves here the main concern is to evaluate the reflection and transmission coefficients associated with the reflected and transmitted wave fields respectively assuming the linearized wave theory the motion of the fluid particle in the region x 0 y d ξ f x is depicted by a potential function which is expressed as ℜ φ x y e i ω t where φ is called as the spatial potential function in such situation the governing equation for the physical problem involving the function φ is 2 1 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 0 x 0 y d ξ f x the linearized free surface boundary condition at y 0 is 2 2 φ y k φ 0 y 0 and the linearized versatile base surface boundary condition at y d is given by 2 3 d 4 x 4 ε k 1 φ n k φ 0 y d ξ f x where k ω 2 g g is the acceleration due to gravity d represents the flexural rigidity of the versatile base surface on the seabed which is expressed as d e h 3 12 ρ g 1 p e and p are the young s modulus and the poisson s ratio respectively for the versatile base surface ρ denotes the density of the fluid h represents the width of the versatile base surface ε ρ ρ h e ρ represents the density of the versatile base and n denotes the derivative in a direction normal to the bottom surface of the seabed the time dependence term of e i ω t has been cut off throughout the analysis assuming a non dimensional number ξ to be small enough to neglect the third and higher order terms then the linearized condition on the versatile base surface which is given in equation 2 3 can be written in a suitable form as 2 4 d 4 x 4 ε k 1 φ y ξ x f x φ x ξ 2 2 f x 2 3 φ y 3 2 f x f x 2 φ x y f x 2 φ y k φ ξ f x φ y ξ 2 2 f x 2 2 φ y 2 o ξ 3 0 y d now within the frame of linearized wave theory a train of two dimensional regular incident waves proliferates along the positive x direction takes the following form 2 5 φ i n c x y q α y e i α x where 2 6 q α y k sinh α d y d α 4 ε k 1 α cosh α d y k sinh α d d α 4 ε k 1 α cosh α d and the unknown constant α satisfies the dispersion relation 2 7 α 2 d α 4 ε k 1 k 2 tan h α d k α d α 4 ε k 2 0 as we assumed earlier that the width of the versatile base surface is very small as compared to the wavelength of the incident proliferating wave so that ρ h 1 and hence it does not effect on the zeros of equation 2 7 in equation 2 7 there are two distinct positive real zeros v 1 and v 2 say 0 v 1 v 2 that represent the wavenumber of incident proliferating waves four complex zeros of the form x 1 i y 1 and x 2 i y 2 with x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 that relate to the damped proliferating waves and a countable infinity number of purely imaginary zeros i ν 2 i ν 1 i ν 1 i ν 2 that correspond to evanescent waves where ν 1 ν 2 are positive real numbers satisfy the following equation 2 8 k 2 ν n 2 d ν n 4 ε k 1 tan ν n d k ν n d ν n 4 ε k 2 0 here the negative values of all of above zeros are also represent the zeros of dispersion equation 2 7 which indicate the wavenumbers of proliferating waves in the negative direction as the dispersion equation is having exactly two distinct positive real zeros v 1 and v 2 so two different waves exist in the specified fluid region x 0 y d ξ f x the wave with smaller wavenumber proliferates along the free surface say free surface mode and the wave with larger wavenumber proliferates along the versatile base surface say flexural mode when a train of two dimensional incident waves proliferates over a versatile base surface with a little bottom deformation on the seabed then the train of incident waves is partly reflected by it and partly transmitted over it therefore our primary concern is to calculate the reflection as well as transmission coefficients approximately first consider a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates along the positive x direction which is in the form 2 9 φ 0 v 1 x y q v 1 y e i v 1 x where the function q is defined as in equation 2 6 it may be noted here that when a train of regular incident proliferating waves of any individual mode come across a floating or submerged structure in a fluid then some of the reflected and transmitted energy transfer from one wave mode to the other therefore when the train of regular incident proliferating wave of mode v 1 comes across the cylindrical deformation at the bottom of the fluid then the reflected as well as transmitted wave of both modes v 1 and v 2 appear in the entire fluid region thus the far field behavior of the potential φ is given by 2 10 φ r e i v 1 x e i v 1 x q v 1 y r q v 2 y e i v 2 x x t q v 1 y e i v 1 x t q v 2 y e i v 2 x x where the unknown constants r and r are the reflection coefficients related to the reflected waves with wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 respectively due to a train of regular incident waves of wavenumber v 1 and the value of these coefficients are to be evaluated similarly the unknown constants t and t are the transmission coefficients related to the transmitted waves with wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 respectively because of a train of regular incident proliferating wave of mode v 1 and the value of these coefficients are to be evaluated in this particular case when a train of incident proliferating waves of mode v 1 proliferates along x direction then the potential φ satisfies the laplace s equation 2 1 the linearized free surface boundary condition 2 2 the linearized bottom condition 2 4 and the far field condition 2 10 in the next when a train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 flexural mode engenders because of the flexural wave movement in the fluid over little deformation on the versatile seabed the potential function in the fluid is given by 2 11 φ 0 v 2 x y e i v 2 x q v 2 y in this case the far field condition for the potential function φ is 2 12 φ r q v 1 y e i v 1 x r e i v 2 x e i v 2 x q v 2 y x t q v 1 y e i v 1 x t q v 2 y e i v 2 x x where r and r are the reflection coefficients of wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 respectively because of a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 2 similarly t and t are the complex valued constants which correspond to the transmission coefficients of wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 respectively because of a train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 our main aim is to determine these coefficients when a train of occurrence waves engenders with wavenumber v 2 then the velocity potential function of the fluid needs to satisfy the laplace s equation the linearized free surface boundary condition the linearized bottom surface condition and the far field condition which involves the unknown constants r r t and t procedure to calculate the analytical values of the coefficients r r t and t for the case of the train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 and r r t and t for the case of the train of incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 is quite a tough task for any bottom deformation on a seabed however by assuming small bottom deformation a perturbation expansion technique can be utilized here to calculate these unknown coefficients up to first order with the help of the perturbation expansion technique the entire fluid region x 0 y d ξ f x reduces to the uniform finite strip x 0 y d and then proceed to calculate the first order correction to the potential function and henceforth the reflection as well as transmission coefficients in the following mathematical technique 3 method of solution consider a problem of diffraction of normal incident waves by a small bottom deformation on a versatile base surface of the seabed since the versatile base surface of seabed assumed to be fixed at y d ξ f x which involves a small non dimensional parameter ξ 1 we will utilize a simplified perturbation technique only to convert the original bvp to an uncomplicated bvp for the first order potential function now the solution of new bvp which involves the first order velocity potential can work out by applying a procedure in view of green s integral theorem with the presentation of appropriate green s function first let us assume that a train of regular incident waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates over the bottom deformation on an infinitely extended versatile base surface of the seabed when there is no base distortion on the seabed then the proliferating waves proliferate without any deterrent and in this case only the transmitted waves proliferate along the positive x direction this concept along with the linearized bottom condition given in 2 4 suggests that the velocity potential of the fluid φ the reflection coefficients r and r and the transmission coefficients t and t because of a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 can be written as 3 1 φ φ 0 ξ φ 1 ξ 2 φ 2 o ξ 3 r ξ r 1 ξ 2 r 2 o ξ 3 r ξ r 1 ξ 2 r 2 o ξ 3 t ξ t 1 ξ 2 t 2 o ξ 3 t 1 ξ t 1 ξ 2 t 2 o ξ 3 where the bivariate functions φ 0 φ 1 and φ 2 are the zeroth order first order and second order potentials respectively in equations 3 1 and 2 4 the non dimensional parameter ξ means it characterizes the smallness of bottom distortion of the seabed maiti and mandal 2006 the pair of unknown constants r 1 r 1 and t 1 t 1 are the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients respectively with respect to wavenumbers v 2 and v 1 similarly the pair of unknown constants r 2 r 2 and t 2 t 2 are the second order reflection as well as transmission coefficients respectively with respect to wavenumbers v 2 and v 1 as mentioned earlier in mei 1985 here also the expressions for φ r r t and t given in equation 3 1 need to polish for the case of large scale reflection so that it can take care of bragg resonance case moreover the expressions highlighted for φ r r t and t are only reasonable for very small reflection and excluding the case of bragg resonance it may be noted here that in the equations given by 3 1 the expression for t is not in the same form as r r and t when there is no bottom distortion on the seabed then no reflection and full transmission occur in this case that is the full transmitted waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferate along the positive x direction of the fluid because of full transmission which occurs in the case of no bottom distortion the expansion of transmission coefficient t for the case bottom distortion starts with 1 maiti and mandal 2006 also the similar observation can be drawn from equation 2 10 by taking x we know that when a train of regular incident waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates along positive x direction in a sea with no bottom distortion the velocity potential function of the fluid is in the form q v 1 y e i v 1 x given in equation 2 9 therefore in equation 2 10 the value of t and t must be 1 and 0 respectively for the case when there is no bottom distortion and the velocity potential function φ will be in the form q v 1 y e i v 1 x along the positive x direction of the fluid thus due to this reason the value of t starts with 1 for the case of bottom distortion now applying the expressions for φ r r t and t in the governing equation 2 1 along with the boundary conditions 2 2 2 4 and 2 10 and then on both sides compare the respective like coefficients of zeroth order first order and second order terms of ξ we observe that the potential functions φ 0 φ 1 and φ 2 respectively follow three bvps which are represented by the following form bvp with respect to potential function φ 0 bvp i 3 2 2 φ 0 x 2 2 φ 0 y 2 0 0 y d 3 3 φ 0 y k φ 0 0 y 0 3 4 d 4 x 4 ε k 1

horizontal versatile base surface in order that the governing equation along with linearized boundary conditions given in equations 3 2 3 5 are satisfied the solution φ 0 x y of the bvp i is in the same form φ 0 v 1 as given in equation 2 9 it may be noted here that the bvp ii represents a problem of diffraction of waves by a little distortion on an infinitely extended versatile bed surface and asymptotic condition of the problem which associates the solution φ 0 x y of the bvp i to resolve the problem bvp ii for acquiring the first order potential function φ 1 we need to employ green s integral theorem with the development of a proper green s function then by employing the asymptotic condition in the solution of this problem a pair of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 correspond to the reflected waves of wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 and a pair of the first order transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 correspond to the transmitted waves with wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 can be evaluated explicitly now we develop a proper green s function for acquiring the solution of bvp ii defined by equations 3 6 3 10 with the assumption that a source term is submerged completely in the fluid we can construct a source potential concerning two dimensional green s function for laplace s equation let us consider a point p x y be the position of source term in the fluid now the source potential in terms of green s function g x y x y follows a bvp given by 3 16 2 g x 2 2 g y 2 0 0 y d 3 17 g y k g 0 y 0 3 18 d 4 x 4 ε k 1 g y k g 0 y d 3 19 g x y x y ln r r 0 where r 2 x x 2 y y 2 here the source potential of the fluid g x y x y represents outgoing cylindrical waves as x x tends to infinity now we acquire the solution of bvp ii given by equations 3 16 3 18 in terms of green s function g x y x y 3 20 g x y x y ln r r 1 0 c 1 v cosh v d y c 2 v sinh v y cos v x x d v where c 1 v and c 2 v are unknown functions to be determined and r 1 2 x x 2 y y 2 applying the respective linearized conditions at the free surface and on the versatile base surface of the fluid we get the value of c 1 v and c 2 v as follows 3 21 c 1 v 2 d v 4 ε k 1 k sinh v d y v cosh v d y cosh v d w v 3 22 c 2 v v sinh v d k cosh v d c 1 v 2 e v y v where 3 23 w v k 2 v 2 d v 4 ε k 1 sinh v d d v 4 ε k 2 k v cosh v d in equation 3 22 the term v in the denominator can never be taken zero as it indicates that there are no propagating waves in the fluid since w v has two distinct simple zeros at v v 1 and v v 2 so the integration in equation 3 20 contains two poles at v 1 and v 2 now solving equation 3 20 by using equations 3 21 3 22 we acquire the source potential g x y x y as follows 3 24 g x y x y 2 π i v 1 cosh v 1 d y v 1 sinh v 1 d k cosh v 1 d sinh v 1 y s v 1 v 1 cosh v 1 d w v 1 e i v 1 x x v 2 cosh v 2 d y v 2 sinh v 2 d k cosh v 2 d sinh v 2 y s v 2 v 2 cosh v 2 d w v 2 e i v 2 x x 2 π n 1 ν n cos ν n d y ν n sin ν n d k cos ν n d sin ν n y s ν n ν n cos ν n d w i ν n e ν n

denotes the evanescent waves spread along positive horizontal direction in the fluid since the source potential g x y x y behaves like a cylindrical wave at infinity therefore by assuming x x tends to

application of green s integral theorem for the source potential function g and the first order potential φ 1 in the following form 3 27 ω φ 1 g n g φ 1 n d s 0 where ω denotes a closed contour which consists of the straight lines x x 0 y d x x x y d x x 0 y d x x x y d and a small circle of radius γ with center x y and ultimately assuming γ tends to zero and x tends to infinity as both functions g x y x y and φ 1 converge to zero when x tends to infinity so the contribution to the integrals from the lines x x 0 y d and x x 0 y d are zero when x tends to infinity also using the linearized free surface boundary condition for the functions g and φ 1 the integral given in equation 3 27 along the line x x x y 0 becomes zero for any value of x now putting together all the respective integral values in equation 3 27 the resultant form of this equation becomes 3 28 φ 1 x y 1 2 π k u x v 1 g y x d x y d x which solves the bvp ii for acquiring the expression for first order velocity potential function φ 1 at point p x y the bvp iii given in equations 3 11 3 15 represents a linear diffraction problem involving an unknown second order potential function φ 2 x y which associates with the solution φ 1 x y of the bvp ii the same procedure which was discussed earlier in the case of first order potential function φ 1 can be followed in this problem bvp iii for acquiring the second order potential function φ 2 thus the resultant expression for the second order correction of the potential function φ 2 in the fluid is as follows 3 29 φ 2 x y 1 2 π k v v 1 x g y x d x y d x where v v 1 x is given in equation 3 15 substituting the value of g given in equation 3 26 in the above equation we get φ 2 x y in the form 3 30 φ 2 x y i v v 1 x v 1 φ v 1 w v 1 e i v 1 x x v 2 φ v 2 w v 2 e i v 2 x x d x where 3 31 φ v i k sinh v i d y d v i 4 ε k 1 v i cosh v i d y d v i 4 ε k 1 v i cosh v i d k sinh v i d i 1 2 then by employing the asymptotic condition in the solution of this problem a pair of second order reflection coefficients r 2 and r 2 correspond to the reflected waves of wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 and a pair of the second order transmission coefficients t 2 and t 2 correspond to the transmitted waves with wavenumbers v 1 and v 2 can be evaluated explicitly in this paper we investigate the effect of versatile base surface on the problem of diffraction of water waves over little bottom deformation on the versatile seabed by assuming the linear wave theory under the assumption of linear wave theory the velocity potential satisfies laplace s equation 2 1 in the fluid further we have assumed that the boundary conditions at the free surface and versatile base surface given in equations 2 2 and 2 4 respectively are in linear form a simplified perturbation theory is utilized to reduce the entire equation which governs the original linear bvp to simple linear bvp s for the zeroth first and second order correction of the potential functions as the bvps corresponding to zeroth first and second order correction of the potentials are in linear form therefore the non linear effects of diffraction problem on higher order solution can not arise in our case detailed investigations related to non linear effects of diffraction problem on higher order can be found in bhatta 2005 chau and taylor 1992 mciver and mciver 1990 and rahman et al 1999 4 determination of hydrodynamic coefficients in this section we proceed to acquire the first and second order correction of reflection as well as transmission coefficients related to the reflected and transmitted waves because of a train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads over little deformation on the versatile seabed 4 1 first order coefficients to acquire the first order hydrodynamic reflection as well as transmission coefficients we need to solve equation 3 28 further by substituting the value of source potential g x y x y given in equation 3 26 on y d thus after solving equation 3 28 the expression for the potential φ 1 x y can be written as 4 1 φ 1 x y i v 1 φ v 1 w v 1 e i v 1 x x v 2 φ v 2 w v 2 e i v 2 x x u x v 1 d x where φ v i i 1 2 is given in equation 3 31 now the expressions for a pair of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 can be evaluated by considering the value of φ 1 x y when x tends to in equation 4 1 and then compare it with equation 3 9 by substituting x y with x y thus we acquire the final expression for r 1 and r 1 as 4 2 r 1 i v 1 y v 1 v 1 w v 1 f x e 2 i v 1 x d x 4 3 r 1 i v 2 y v 1 v 2 w v 2 f x e i v 1 v 2 x d x where the function y is defined as follows 4 4 y x y k x sinh d x k cosh d x x cosh d x k sinh d x d y 4 ε k 1 y similarly a pair of first order transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 can be evaluated by assuming x tends to infinity in equation 4 1 and comparing with the corresponding expression for φ 1 from equation 3 9 thus we acquire the final expression for t 1 and t 1 as 4 5 t 1 i v 1 y v 1 v 1 w v 1 f x d x 4 6 t 1 i v 2 y v 1 v 2 w v 2 f x e i v 1 v 2 x d x therefore a pair of first order reflection coefficients as well as transmission coefficients calculated from equations 4 3 4 4 and 4 5 4 6 when the shape of the bottom distortion of the versatile base surface is finally known next assume that a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 2 proliferates over the bottom deformation on an infinitely extended versatile base surface of the seabed the same procedure which was discussed earlier for the case of mode v 1 is carried out in acquiring the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients r 1 r 1 t 1 and t 1 in this case the required expression of these coefficients are as follows 4 7 r 1 i v 1 y v 2 v 1 w v 1 f x e i v 1 v 2 x d x 4 8 r 1 i v 2 y v 2 v 2 w v 2 f x e 2 i v 2 x d x 4 9 t 1 i v 1 y v 2 v 1 w v 1 e i v 2 v 1 x f x d x 4 10 t 1 i v 2 y v 2 v 2 w v 2 f x d x 4 2 second order coefficients for this case the expressions for a pair of second order reflection coefficients r 2 and r 2 can be evaluated by considering the value of φ 2 x y when x tends to in equation 3 30 and then compare it with equation 3 14 by substituting x y with x y thus we acquire the final expression for r 2 and r 2 as 4 11 r 2 i v 1 w v 1 v v 1 x e i v 1 x d x 4 12 r 2 i v 2 w v 2 v v 1 x e i v 2 x d x similarly a pair of second order transmission coefficients t 2 and t 2 can be evaluated by assuming x tends to infinity in equation 3 30 and comparing with the corresponding expression for φ 2 from equation 3 14 thus we acquire the final expression for t 2 and t 2 as 4 13 t 2 i v 1 w v 1 v v 1 x e i v 1 x d x 4 14 t 2 i v 2 w v 2 v v 1 x e i v 2 x d x therefore a pair of second order reflection coefficients as well as transmission coefficients can be calculated explicitly from equations 4 11 4 14 when the solution φ 1 x y of the bvp ii as well as the shape of the bottom distortion of the versatile base surface are finally known next assume that a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 2 proliferates over the bottom deformation on an infinitely extended versatile base surface of the seabed the same procedure which was discussed earlier for the case of mode v 1 is carried out in acquiring the second order reflection as well as transmission coefficients r 2 r 2 t 2 and t 2 in this case the required expression of these coefficients are as follows 4 15 r 2 i v 1 w v 1 v v 2 x e i v 1 x d x 4 16 r 2 i v 2 w v 2 v v 2 x e i v 2 x d x 4 17 t 2 i v 1 w v 1 v v 2 x e i v 1 x d x 4 18 t 2 i v 2 w v 2 v v 2 x e i v 2 x d x

section we move forward to investigate the effect of the versatile base surface on first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients for a fixed sinusoidal swell of the bottom distortion 5 a fixed form of bottom profile davies 1982 investigated a problem of water diffraction by a fixed sinusoidal swells of bottom distortion on an impenetrable seabed and acquired that a fixed sinusoidal surface has a potential to give back the energy from incident wave which is more qualitatively involvement in respect of coastal protection from the harsh and uneven sea due to the fact of being of the great significance of sinusoidal swells bed surface from the physical point of view a lot of emphases laid upon them therefore consideration of sinusoidal swell bed surface is deemed appropriate discussed in davies and heathershaw 1984 consider a sinusoidal swells bed surface with amplitude a on an otherwise plane base surface on the versatile seabed is in the form 5 1 f x a sin p x n π p x n π p 0 otherwise where the patch of sinusoidal swells bed surface having a total n number of ripples and p denotes the ripple wavenumber of sinusoidal swell bed surface in the region n π p x n π p suppose that a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates over little deformation on a versatile seabed the expressions for a pair of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 and a pair of first order transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 acquire by replacing the function f x from equation 5 1 into equations 4 2 4 3 and 4 5 4 6 thus the required expression for these coefficients are as follows 5 2 r 1 1 n 2 a v 1 p y v 1 v 1 w v 1 sin 2 n v 1 π p p 2 4 v 1 2 5 3 r 1 1 n 2 a v 2 p y v 1 v 2 w v 2 sin n v 1 v 2 π p p 2 v 1 v 2 2 5 4 t 1 1 n 2 a v 2 p y v 1 v 2 w v 2 sin n v 1 v 2 π p p 2 v 1 v 2 2 the transmission coefficient t 1 in connection with the waves with wavenumber v 1 vanishes identically for this fixed shape sinusoidal swell of bottom deformation on the versatile base surface in the region n π p n π p next we consider the case of the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 proliferates over little deformation on a versatile seabed in this case a pair of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 and a pair of transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 acquire by replacing the function f x from equation 5 1 into equations 4 7 4 10 thus the required expression of these coefficients are as follows 5 5 r 1 1 n 2 a v 1 p y v 2 v 1 w v 1 sin n v 1 v 2 π p p 2 v 1 v 2 2 5 6 r 1 1 n 2 a v 2 p y v 2 v 2 w v 2 sin 2 n v 2 π p p 2 4 v 2 2 5 7 t 1 1 n 2 a v 1 p y v 2 v 1 w v 1 sin n v 2 v 1 π p p 2 v 2 v 1 2 for this particular choice of shape function the transmission coefficient t 1 vanishes identically the expressions for r 1 r 1 t 1 and t 1 given in equations 5 2 5 7 demonstrate that the behavior of the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients are oscillatory in nature for a given number of ripples in the patch of the sinusoidal swells bed surface furthermore it is observed from equation 5 2 that when the wavenumber v 1 of normal incident waves become approximately half the wavenumber p of the bottom deformation on the versatile seabed the reflection coefficient turns inexhaustible it means the entire theory moves towards the feasibility of a resonant interaction between the sinusoidal ripples on the versatile bed surface and the incident waves contrary to our assumption that the first order correction of the reflection coefficient r 1 is a small quantity therefore we only consider the cases that eliminating the situation to keep away from the rebuttal appearing out of the resonant case similarly it observes in equations 5 3 5 4 that when the wavenumber p of sinusoidal ripples approaches to the sum or difference of the wavenumbers the resonance interaction can be forecasted between the sinusoidal ripples on the versatile base surface and the incident waves similarly the resonance appearance can be analyzed for the case when the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 proliferates over little deformation on a versatile seabed 6 numerical results and discussion figs 2 7 demonstrate the absolute values of the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients graphically in the case of a train of regular incident proliferating wave with wavenumber v 1 proliferates over a little deformation on the versatile base surface of a seabed assume that the versatile base surface model as a plate in all the figures the depth of the sea fixed as 20 a the non dimensional number ε a as 0 and the ripple wavenumber p a as 1 the different plots in figs 2 4 correspond to different flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 as 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 where the sum of the ripples in the sinusoidal swells of bottom distortion of the versatile base surface fixed as 4 fig 2 shows that whenever the flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile base surface decreases the utmost values of r 1 for reflected waves with wavenumber v 1 increase and due to this the amplitude of the reflected waves increases in this case figs 3 and 4 display the first order reflection coefficient due to reflected waves and the transmission coefficient due to transmitted waves with wavenumber v 2 respectively for the case when the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 1 it is seen that when the value of flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of the versatile base surface decreases the utmost value for the case of both first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients increases the non zero value of both reflection coefficient due to reflected waves and the transmission coefficient due to transmitted waves with wavenumber v 2 indicates that some vitality exchange from one wave mode to the other is almost always possible moreover the absolute value of first order reflection coefficient due to reflected wave with wavenumber v 2 is found to be smaller in comparison to those of the reflected wave with wavenumber v 1 also from figs 2 4 it has been noticed that when the value of d a 4 raises the rate of change for the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients is higher for both free surface unsettling influence wave as well as flexural wave movement cases that implies the reflected as well as transmitted energy are quite conscious of the change of flexural rigidity parameter for the case of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 1 proliferates along the positive direction of the versatile seabed however when the value of flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile base surface decreases the absolute value of first order reflection and transmission coefficients become more than those of the smaller flexural rigidity parameters of the versatile seabed the different plots in figs 5 7 associate to different number of ripples on the patch of sinusoidal swells on the bottom distortion of the versatile seabed for these plots the flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of the versatile base surface is fixed at 3 5 it is observed from these figures that the utmost values for both first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients due to the free surface unsettling influence waves with wavenumbers v 1 and flexural waves with wavenumber v 2 raise when the sum of ripples on the patch of sinusoidal swells raises however when the sum of ripples on the versatile seabed becomes large then the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients converted into inexhaustible for some definite values of k a the above phenomena are called bragg resonance case which arises when the first order reflection coefficient turns into much bigger than the little non dimensional parameter ξ it implies the simplified perturbation expansion which introduced in the previous section 3 comes to an end when the first order reflection coefficient becomes much bigger than the distortion parameter as was discussed by mei 1985 again figs 5 and 6 show that when the sum of ripples on the patch of bottom distortion raises the oscillatory behavior of the first order coefficients r 1 and r 1 with respect to k a is clearly observable with increasing the number of zeros however the common characteristics of r 1 and r 1 remain the same figs 2 and 5 indicate that the maximum values of first order reflection coefficient are bigger in comparison to that of the example of mohapatra 2015 this happens because of the inclusion of the versatile base surface instead of assuming porous base surface similarly the case when a train of regular incident waves with wavenumber v 2 flexural mode proliferates over the seabed is also quite interesting because of the presence of the versatile base surface where the vitality is always possible to be transformed from one mode to the other like the case of the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 1 figs 8 13 show the absolute values of the first order reflection and transmission coefficient against k a in these figures we consider the depth of fluid d as 20 a the non dimensional parameter ε a as zero and the ripple wavenumber of the patch of the sinusoidal swells of bottom deformation p a as 1 figs 8 and 9 display the first order coefficients r 1 and r 1 because of the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 in these figures the different plots correspond to different flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 as 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 while the sum of ripples n in the patch of distortion on the versatile base surface is taken as 4 it has been noticed that when the non dimensionalized flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of the versatile base surface increases the utmost values of the absolute value of first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 decrease in this case the decreasing rate of the first order reflection coefficient is quite inappreciable for low to average values of k a in both cases however the decreasing rate is smaller for bigger values of k a that means the versatile base surface does not have much effect on the reflected energy because of free surface wave influence and flexural wave movement in the fluid due to the train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 moreover the rate of change for values of r 1 and r 1 are very inappreciable as compared to r 1 and t 1 respectively fig 10 shows the absolute value of first order transmission coefficient t 1 due to transmitted waves for the case when a train of regular incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 in this figure the different plots correspond to different flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of versatile base surface as 3 and 4 5 it is observed from this figure that when the value of flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 increases the rate of change for the first order transmission coefficient t 1 is very inappreciable this shows that the absolute value of non dimensionalized first order transmission coefficient t 1 is insensitive to the change in flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile base surface and it does not change remarkably when the versatile base surface is approached as an unbending surface it may be attributed to the fact that because of the versatile base surface is somewhat underneath the free surface of the fluid the flexural wave movement in the fluid is not much influenced by the change in the flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile base surface of the seabed that means the versatile base surface of seabed does not have much effect on the transmitted energy due to free surface unsettling influence in the fluid because of the train of incident proliferating wave spreads with wavenumber v 2 moreover the non zero values of the absolute values of the first order reflection as well as transmission coefficients for a train of regular incident proliferating waves with wavenumber v 2 indicate that some conversion of reflected as well as transmitted energy from one wave mode to the other is almost always possible figs 11 13 show the different plots associate to the different number of ripples on a patch of sinusoidal swells on the versatile bottom surface where the non dimensionalized flexural rigidity parameter d a 4 of the bed surface is taken as 3 5 it is observed that when the sum of ripples on the bottom distortion of versatile seabed raises the absolute values of r 1 and r 1 always exist and their utmost values become more in this case however when the sum of ripples becomes huge the first order reflection coefficients r 1 and r 1 turns into inexhaustible for certain values of k a similar observation can be drawn from the case of the first order transmission coefficient t 1 thus in the case of the train of regular incident proliferating wave of mode v 2 also the simplified perturbation analysis which is introduced in section 3 comes to an end at the case of bragg resonance phenomena which happens when the first order reflection coefficient is much bigger than the distortion parameter computational results show that there is no singularity near k a 0 1 for the case of t 1 r 1 and t 1 which are plotted in figs 4 7 8 10 11 and 13 at k a 0 098 the values of p a v 1 a and v 2 a are 1 0 118680 and 0 respectively however for k a 0 101 the values of p a v 1 a and v 2 a are 1 0 120761 and 0 017338 respectively it may be attributed to the fact that only one proliferating wave exists upto the value of k a 0 1 and then two different proliferating waves exist for the values of k a 0 1 due to this there is a spike in the curves near to k a 0 1 in the case of t 1 r 1 and t 1 the work discussed in this paper is about solving a new hydroelastic model analytically to examine the proliferation of water waves over little bottom distortion on a versatile seabed to the best of the authors knowledge no investigation of the issue of water wave scattering by an uneven bottom distortion for a versatile seabed has carried out till date neither experimentally nor by any field measurements however our present work may compare up to some extent with the work of maiti and mandal 2006 as both problems bear little similarities it is to be noted that there is one basic similarity in the problem of the present work and the work by maiti and mandal 2006 while in maiti and mandal 2006 for any particular frequency there were two different time harmonic proliferating modes which proliferate in a sea with impermeable bottom distortion our work presents a problem where the same number of proliferating modes exist for any specified frequency and they proliferate over little bottom distortion on a versatile seabed figs 5 7 and 11 13 illustrate the features of the work of maiti and mandal 2006 such as the comparison of the increasing nature of the reflection and transmission coefficients depending on the number of ripples on the patch of bottom distortion but the numerical estimates of these coefficients are not the same due to different physical considerations and formulations 7 conclusion assuming the linearized wave theory we have examined the effect of the versatile base surface on the problem of proliferation of waves over little deformation on an infinitely extended versatile seabed in this case the versatile base surface is model as a thin plate and its width is minimal in comparison with the wavelength of the incoming wave in such circumstances two different modes of proliferating waves exist rather than one mode of spreading wave for any particular frequency the waves with smaller wavenumber proliferate along the free surface surface mode and the waves with bigger wavenumber spread along the versatile base surface flexural mode the first and second order potential functions are acquired by the strategy in view of green s integral theorem with the presentation of a suitable green s function for a fixed example of a patch of sinusoidal swells the first order corrections to the reflection as well as transmission coefficients for both modes are acquired in terms of integrals involving a function which is the frame of the bottom distortion on an infinitely extended versatile seabed it has seen that when the train of occurence wave engenders because of the free surface unsettling influence in the fluid the reflection and transmission for both wave modes decrease because of the increasing in flexural unbending nature of the versatile bed surface on the seabed however for a train of regular incident waves engenders because of flexural mode the reflected energy related to both wave modes decreases while the transmitted energy related to free surface wave mode increases because of the increasing in flexural rigidity parameter of the versatile bed surface again the non zero values of reflection and transmission coefficients because of either the free surface unsettling influence or the flexural wave movement in the fluid show that we generally find a possibility of some vitality exchange from one wave mode to other furthermore the utmost value of the reflection and transmission coefficients for both modes increases with the number of ripples of the sinusoidal swells bottom deformation on the versatile base surface of the seabed the results developed in this paper are expected to be qualitatively useful in tackling the water waves scattering problems in the earthquake regions
