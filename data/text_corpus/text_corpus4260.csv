international maritime safety standards mitigation of risks associated with ship navigation routed accidents e g collisions groundings etc remain challenging in 2017 3145 ship incidents and casualties were reported in emcip these incidents resulted in 26 ships lost 106 fatalities and 957 injuries emsa 2019 based on the same data records it may be concluded that from 2011 to 2016 more than 60 of casualties resulted from flooding during this period the passenger ship segment that represents 23 of the fleet at risk was the second highest contributor to all marine casualties over the same period 172 ships sunk primarily due to collision followed by foundering these two categories account for almost 50 of the fatalities recorded these alarming accident records could be attributed to the inadequacy of safety regulations e g solas 2007 to control risks associated with vessel dynamic behavior pertaining to ship design and operations under rare or extreme conditions with the later in mind this paper presents a rapid 6 dof maneuvering model that could be useful for the evaluation of ship dynamic response before during and after a hard grounding event the method presented is original in terms of simultaneously evaluating 1 coupled heave pitch and roll ship motions 2 velocities in way of contact 3 6 dof evasive maneuvers in a way that accounts for all pertinent phenomena involved along a ship s traveled path e g waves shallow water effects and applies to modern single and twin screw vessels selected key ship parameters of relevance to ship evasiveness and associated navigation routed accidents in restricted waters are taken under consideration such conditions may be representative of many collision and grounding events kujala et al 2009 pagiaziti et al 2015 schröder hinrichs et al 2012 for completeness the effects of shallow water short waves different propulsion and steering arrangements on maneuvering motions are discussed in detail the new elements of the method are verified and the method is validated using three well documented experiments that represent different rudder propeller combinations chillcce and el moctar 2018 simman 2020 and data of modern twin propeller twin rudder tptr passenger vessel provided by a shipyard 2 literature review since the 1970 s various mathematical models have been derived and validated with the aim to represent the influence of maneuvering and seakeeping motions on ship dynamics beck et al 1989 ittc 2017a matusiak 2017 traditionally maneuvering dynamics have been modeled in calm seas i e sheltered waters or harbor conditions and aimed to define ship behavior following an operator s decision on the other hand the development of seakeeping methods focused on the evaluation of motions in waves in the absence of any control in plane actions multi dof unified seakeeping maneuvering theories have been developed progressively and applied to cases of specialist intact ship stability phenomena spyrou et al 2000 ship overtaking scenarios yu et al 2019 or solvers used to simulate ship dynamic behavior in real conditions matusiak 2017 modern methods use the so called maneuvering modeling group mmg standard methodology yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 they also make use of time domain approaches that combine various levels of hydrodynamic nonlinearity hirdaris et al 2016 key academic developments of relevance to this paper can be summarized in two groups namely i the derivation and validation of unified models that simulate ship operations in deep or shallow waters under varying environmental assumptions and ii improved idealization of the effects of evasive ship dynamics pertaining to accidental events collisions groundings etc with reference to the former various 4 and 6 dof models have been derived for example perez et al 2007 proposed a 4 dof maneuvering model using the equations of motion presented in fossen 2002 in their work a genetic algorithm has been used to adjust the maneuvering parameters initially estimated from the 2 5d seakeeping approach of faltinsen and zhao 1991 seo and kim 2011 presented the numerical analysis of ship maneuverability in regular waves in this work froude krylov diffraction radiation and 2nd order mean drift forces were estimated by a rankine panel method and hydrodynamic actions were added into the maneuvering model as external forces a similar model has been introduced by sprenger et al 2017 who assessed the optimum maneuverability of ships to ultimately satisfy eedi requirements imo 2013 in their work they also accounted for 2nd order hydrodynamic actions that may influence the water resistance and maneuvering derivatives in calm waters this approach has been extended by tillig and ringsberg 2018 to account for the effects of vessel drift and rudder angle when resistance in waves is accounted for with reference to 6 dof models notable developments have been limited the unified model presented by bailey et al 2002 remains topical the method combines frequency domain green function seakeeping dynamics in random or irregular seaways with a linear convolution integral to account for the influence of unsteady memory effects during ship maneuvering in waves although the model is mathematically robust wave prediction is not exact also computations may be lengthy for use in practical applications primarily because of time variations related to the encounter frequency and heading angles these practical implementation issues are also of relevance to the more recently presented model of chillcce and el moctar 2018 their approach makes use of a rankine panel method and hydrodynamic coefficients by rans pmm tests in calm waters and regular waves the method of matusiak 2017 combines maneuvering with a time domain non linear seakeeping model in a single set of coupled equations of motion that are solved simultaneously convolution terms are used to represent the memory effect of radiation forces in heave pitch and roll empirically derived coefficients of in plane motion components are utilized this model has been applied to reveal the occurrence of large amplitude roll motions in stern quartering irregular seas during a turning maneuver acanfora and matusiak 2014 matusiak and stigler 2012 in the model by matusiak 2017 external hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull are represented by empirical hydrodynamic coefficients a beneficial method that may be used to assess the credibility of those on maneuvering is sensitivity analysis over a range of vessels progressing along various maneuvering trajectories e g see gavrilin and steen 2018 and sukas et al 2019 such approach is considered beneficial in terms of qualifying uncertainties associated with modelling and simulation assumptions with reference to shallow water effects key developments on the influence of ship maneuvering forces and moments have been introduced by vantorre 2001 vantorre et al 2017 rotteveel 2013 and liu et al 2015 these authors highlighted the importance of ship resistance in shallow and confined waters accordingly it is understood that in restricted conditions i the tactical diameter of vessels may enlarge especially due to hull damping effects ii increases in ship resistance may lead to decrease in maneuvering capability and iii changes in pressure hull distributions may lead to increased hydrodynamic forces whereas advances in marine hydrodynamics look promising work on evasive ship dynamics pertaining to accidental events collisions groundings etc is still very limited and subject to both computational uncertainties and costs varsta et al 2004a 2004b coupled a 6 dof ship dynamics model with a simplified contact model representing hard grounding ståhlberg et al 2013 highlighted the importance of ship velocity and time history in determining vessel evasive maneuvers in case of collision yu and amdahl 2016 presented a coupled approach for simultaneously calculating structural damage and the 6 dof ship motions in ship collisions none of these studies focused on the development of rapid assessment tools that account for the combined influence of seakeeping and maneuvering induced dynamics on vessel response during both grounding and collision events recently kim et al 2020 introduced a 3d fsi model coupling explicit fea structural dynamics with seakeeping maneuvering and calm water resistance this work re affirmed the importance of developing simplified and accurate tools with the aim to practically implement the influence of multiphysics modelling assumptions on ship structural crashworthiness and associated rule development 3 theory the rigid body time domain 6 dof rapid assessment model introduced in this paper is based on the following assumptions i hull in plane forces are represented by quasi steady flow reactions and described by non dimensional coefficients referring to motion velocities and accelerations ii short waves are modeled according to faltinsen 1990 and sakamoto and baba 1986 iii shallow water idealisations account for increase in ship resistance changes in added mass damping as well as changes in flow straightening coefficient wake fraction and thrust deduction factors iv heave pitch and roll motions are assumed to be small and represented by the linear relations of forces and motion components these are not affected by shallow water thus out of plane motions are small and gmt0 gml0 are assumed constant v the action of short waves is restricted to in plane motions thus the wave induced heave pitch and roll are assumed to be negligible vi for computational economy memory effects are not taken under consideration 3 1 motions the translational velocities of surge u sway v and heave w and rotational degrees of freedom namely roll p pitch q and yaw r are shown in fig 1 the earth fixed coordinate system is represented as o x y z the body fixed coordinate system o x y z is attached amidships l p p 2 at a distance x g positive toward the bow accordingly it rests on the still waterline passing through the vessel symmetry plane x z with the longitudinal x axis pointing positive towards the bow the lateral y axis directed towards the starboard side and the vertical z axis pointing downwards the ship heading forms a positive angle ψ from the earth fixed x axis to the body fixed x axis the drift angle β is defined at amidships with respect to the ship s longitudinal and lateral velocity vectors the rudder angle δ is positive towards the port side the change of the course of the ship ψ is positive during the starboard turn where the rudder angle is negative the ship position is established in the earth fixed coordinate system using a transformation rotation matrix corresponding to the rotation angles φ θ a n d ψ about x y and z axis respectively see fig 1 the translational and angular velocities are transformed from the body coordinate to inertial coordinate systems as per fossen 2011 accordingly the coordinate transformation see eq 1 is embedded as a subblock of the 6 dof maneuvering model see fig 6 the general form of rigid body motion comprises of translation and rotation dof governed by newton s 2nd law of motion thus forces representing the external loading action on the ship when she progresses with some forward speed are expressed by the conservation of linear and angular momentum in principle hydrodynamic forces act on the cog of the ship with respect to an inertial frame of reference it is difficult to express external forces in such a manner hence the body fixed coordinate system was defined which is transformed into the inertial frame of reference as 1 x g u c o s ψ c o s θ v c o s ψ s i n θ s i n ϕ s i n ψ c o s ϕ w s i n ψ s i n ϕ c o s ψ c o s ϕ s i

mass multiplier terms on the right hand side are the coriolis and centripetal forces the terms multiple of g represent the hydrostatic forces as per fossen 2011 and lewandowski 2004 the remaining terms describe damping control and environmental forces discussed in subsequent sections 3 2 3 7 the hydrostatic terms in surge sway and yaw do not affect in plane motions instead they are activated by heave roll and pitch motion components caused by grounding mass multipliers on the right hand side of eq 2 reflect the influence of coriolis and centripetal forces on maneuvering the linear model of heave pitch and roll motion components given by eq 2 requires the knowledge of natural periods and critical damping ratios the natural frequencies of heave pitch and roll motions are presented as

turnock 2007 as follows 15 x r u d 0 5 c d ρ v x r 2 v y r 2 a r u d cos γ r β r 0 5 c l ρ v x r 2 v y r 2 a r u d sin γ r β r y r u d 0 5 c l ρ v x r 2 v y r 2 a r u d cos γ r β r 0 5 c d ρ v x r 2 v

f c d 0 in the above eqs 15 and 16 the stall of the rudder was assumed to be 30 and λ presents a lift reduction factor in way of the slip stream radius defined according to söding 1982 and brix 1993 as 17 λ v a v c o r r f w h e r e f 2 2 2 0 886 r δ r c r u d 8 the effects of vortical flow on the rudder were neglected the influence of the hull ahead of the rudder was included in the rudder force as a factor of the order 1 a h this represents the increase of the lateral force due to the presence of the hull above the rudder root söding 1982 18 a h 1 1 4 9 x p x r t 3 c r u d t 2 the propeller flow velocity forms an angle β r see fig 2 therefore the total angle of attack α at the rudder including the rudder deflection δ was defined as 19 β r tan 1 v y r v x r α δ γ r β r the above is based on the description of the rudder angle as illustrated in fig 2 γ r is the flow straightening coefficient depending on the hull form and turning motion of the ship yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 this idealization is of relevance for a scenario whereby a ship is maneuvering and the flow passing through the hull of the ship reduces the angle of attack on the rudder liu and hekkenberg 2017 molland and turnock 2007 the flow straightening coefficient for a single screw and single propeller configuration was then defined according to lee and shin 1998 as 20 γ r 1 20501 c b b l 0 7391 β r 0 γ r 2 7236 c b b l 0 021 β r 0 3 3 2 twin propeller twin rudder tptr configuration the tptr configuration assumed that both propellers have similar design characteristics and therefore hydrodynamic flow effects differ only in terms of flow straightening coefficients accordingly the twin screw rudder flow straightening coefficient was defined as 21 γ r p s 1 20501 c b b l 0 7391 β r 0 γ r p s 2 7236 c b b l 0 021 β r 0 3 4 hull hydrodynamic in plane forces as per taimuri et al 2019 the in plane hull forces acting on an spsr and tptr configuration can be defined as 22 x h u l l x v v v 2 x v r v r x

eq 22 the external sway hydrodynamic damping term y h u l l contributes to roll damping k h u l l the point of the lateral hull force y h u l l acts at some distance in between the still water line and the keel of the ship this vertical distance can be calculated by a static drift test kim et al 2007 or from charts available in literature e g hirano and takashina 1980 along these lines 0 5t may be considered acceptable estimate of effect of external sway force on roll moment it is noted that the model does not account for coupling between yaw and roll motions this is because during grounding the change in wetted surface area and flow over non symmetrical part of the hull are minimal and hence maneuvering is not affected by the small amplitudes of heave roll and pitch notwithstanding to further justify this choice two different cases of calm water simulations at high speed deep waters and at low speed shallow waters were considered with yaw roll coupled hydrodynamic coefficients as per hirano and takashina 1980 in both cases time histories of motion are identical see fig 3 at low speed and shallow turning circle trajectories are practically the same see fig 3 a and at higher speed and deep waters some rather marginal differences become evident see fig 3 b the non dimensional hull forces and velocities for a ship progressing with instantaneous velocity u were defined as 23

simulations regression based semi empirical equations or model tests the semi empirical formulas presented in table 6 appendix b summarize the hydrodynamic coefficients for an spsr vessel the 6 dof surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw added mass approximations are summarized in appendix a table 5 surge sway and yaw added masses were defined according to brix 1993 clarke et al 1982 and roll pitch and heave added masses were defined from the strip theory of frank 1967 journée 1992 3 5 reference technique for the evaluation of maneuvering hull coefficients the empirical formulae presented in table 6 appendix b are for a single screw vessel only cfd or pmm based hydrodynamic coefficients of a tptr ship could be used however cfd simulations or pmm tests are expensive thus a novel reference technique that may be applicable to either spsr or tptr vessels was derived for the improved prediction of hull external forces the method assumes that the changes in the hydrodynamic coefficients may be attributed to changes in the main particulars of a tptr ship and are of the same order as for equivalent spsr ships the procedure is illustrated in fig 4 where as an example the hydrodynamic coefficients of a reference tptr vessel known from pmm tests are defined as c t r u e r e f the coefficients calculated using the combination of semi empirical formulations presented in appendix b are defined as c a p p r o x r e f and the corresponding coefficients for a new build tptr vessel are defined as c a p p r o x n b c e s t i m a t e n b is evaluated once a sufficient correlation of c t r

essentially a model calibration technique the theoretical basis of this technique relies on the use of a correction factor namely c t r u e r e f c a p p r o x r e f that obviously makes use of the results model test c t r u e r e f known values from experiments and c a p p r o x r e f empirical formula of the reference ship this is done separately for each hydrodynamic coefficient producing a set of correction factors these correction factors are then used to correct the new vessel c e s t i m a t e n b hydrodynamic derivatives originating from the empirical formulas c a p p r o x n b for the new ship eq 24 manuscript the idea is to reduce the uncertainties of hydrodynamic coefficients of a twin screw vessel when utilizing single screw semi empirical hydrodynamic coefficients similar sort of approach is used for converting deep water hydrodynamic derivatives to shallow water by means of a correction factor for linear and higher order hydrodynamic coefficients kijima et al 1990

maneuvering simulations 4 1 general approach the method developed is summarized in fig 6 the general particulars of the hull resistance curve rudder and propeller details were the assumed input hydrodynamic derivatives were then derived from semi empirical formulations model tests cfd and or their combinations when considering shallow waters there is an increase in ship resistance added masses and damping incorporated in the model taimuri et al 2019 to maintain the rapidness of the method the influence of short waves was precomputed by numerically integrating the waterline and adding as input a response surface accounting for wave heading ship speed and associated hydrodynamic actions chroni et al 2015 papanikolaou et al 2016 a runge kutta solver of the 4th order was used to solve the differential equations matusiak 2017 since motions represented by eq 2 are coupled through acceleration terms the equations were first de coupled numerically and in turn accelerations were integrated into velocities considering input from each time step at the same time step velocities were integrated into position vectors using eq 1 the differential ordinary equation used to evaluate the rudder angle set by the autopilot controller was defined as eq 36 matusiak 2017 36 δ s g n δ t δ ω δ 4 2 simulation cases ship general particulars are summarized in table 1 the method was tested and validated against experimental records for dtc chillcce and el moctar 2018 kvlcc2 and onrt simman 2020 and key data made available from a shipyard for fsb dtc and kvlcc2 resistances were obtained from the benchmark study of sprenger et al 2015 and adolfo marón 2016 respectively the holtrop and mennen 1982 method was utilized to obtain the resistance of onrt and fsb ships see fig 7 the open water propeller characteristics curve for dtc were defined as per sprenger et al 2015 and for kvlcc2 according to stern et al 2011 based on propeller parameters the k t curves of fsb were estimated based on the wageningen b propeller series bernitsas et al 1981 and for the onrt propeller characteristics were gathered from simman 2020 a summary of all propeller parameters is given in table 2 the rudder details of the ships are summarized in table 3 4 3 selection of hydrodynamic coefficients hydrodynamic coefficients were evaluated using the empirical formulation from the model test data of different ships given by clarke et al 1982 inoue et al 1981 khattab 1984 kijima et al 1990a lee and shin 1998 norrbin 1970 yoshimura and masumoto 2011 and are presented in table 6 appendix b for both dtc and kvlcc2 eq 22 was used table 4 summarizes all hydrodynamic coefficients the deep water semi empirical formulae used for dtc are summarized in table 6 in appendix b for deep waters kvlcc2 runs utilized model test hydrodynamic derivatives based on cmt measurements aksu and köse 2017 and semi empirical hydrodynamic coefficients see appendix b for shallow waters derivatives were selected from cfd mucha 2017 and semi empirical hydrodynamic coefficients see appendix c the reference technique makes use of similar hull form and comparable control devices see fig 4 a twin screw david taylor model basin surface combatant dtmb 5415 was used as reference ship for onrt with hydrodynamic coefficients based on the pmm tests of yoon 2009 as reported in sukas et al 2019b the hydrodynamic coefficient of a twin screw ferry with a bow thruster were chosen for fsb as presented in yasukawa and hirata 2013 see table 4 4 4 verification of heave roll and pitch for the intended use the objective of the verification process was to qualify that a linear undamped dynamic response caused by a step wise excitation is twice the stationary response matusiak 2000 thorby 2008 accordingly heave pitch and roll motion responses were evaluated by dynamically heaving heeling and trimming the vessel step forces were applied to the ship separately and then dynamic displacement and rotation were observed before the system converges to steady state fig 8 illustrates the dynamic response to an impulse for the case of kvlcc2 the maximum heave roll and pitch responses due to step loading were quantified as 1 97 2 0 and 1 975 times the steady state response amplitude respectively in turning circle tests steady motion may be achieved after some time of the rudder execution where the vessel path remains circular and this circular diameter and steady vessel speed are utilized to build the centrifugal force acting on the ship see eq 37 and matusiak 2000 such centrifugal force will contribute to an external moment m φ e x t the external moment will be equal to the static righting moment m s t s e e e q 38 therefore the analytical form of the heeling angle at a steady turn can be evaluated as 37 f φ s t ρ ψ 2 d s 2 w h e r e ψ v s 0 5 d s 38 m φ e x t ρ ψ v s k g 0 5 t m s t ρ g gm 0 φ m φ e x t m s t 0 ρ ψ v s k g 0 5 t ρ g gm 0 φ φ ψ v s k g 0 5 t g g m 0 simulation of the turning circle of kvlcc2 was performed at 35 rudder angle and 15 5 knots speed utilizing then eqs 37 and 38 the analytical steady yaw rate and heel angle were calculated as 0 51 s and 0 259 respectively using simulations yaw rate and heel angles were estimated respectively as 0 5213 s and 0 255 these values show that there is a negligible difference of 2 percent between the numerical and analytical predictions 5 results and discussion 5 1 dtc and kvlcc2 spsr ships for dtc maneuvering simulations were compared to the work of chillcce and el moctar 2018 and results from eu fp7 shopera project http shopera org fig 9 a illustrates good approximation of calm water turning circle trajectories minor fluctuations in the model test measurements appear possibly due to the reflection of the ship generated wave from the tank walls maneuvering in short waves seems to predict reasonable trajectories together with the translation motion only in the early stage of the turn drifting of the ship appears to deviate in head and following waves conditions see fig 9 b d trajectories in beam seas follow the measured data however sway velocities are overpredicted in both head waves and following seas this is reflected in the marginally imprecise drifting direction of the vessel s trajectory in head and following waves inconsistencies may appear due to differences in draft and speed correction factors or due to the fact that short waves assume vertical walls in way of the waterline and only reflection of the waves is considered the influence of short waves on rudder and propeller forces are also neglected in any case the profile of the translational motions is well apprehended in the simulations numerical simulations show that using semi empirical based hydrodynamic coefficients see appendix b may lead to correct estimation of initial trajectories and motions in deep calm waters and short waves for kvlcc2 results were compared with the free running model test measurements of simman 2020 fig 10 illustrates the calm water simulations in deep sea conditions comparisons were made against experimental values made available from simman 2020 the translation and rotation motions estimated from emp simulations appear to correlate well in way of the steady state part of the model test measurements very little deviation was observed when cmt aksu and köse 2017 based hydrodynamic coefficients were used the advance of the ship from simulations lies well within 2 of the measured data and therefore differences are numerically acceptable it is possible that assumptions in defining the rudder forces e g semi empirical definition of the flow straightening coefficient may have lead to larger drift angle predictions of the ship fig 11 a and b illustrate the validation of 20 5 zig zag and 35 portside turning circle maneuvers in calm shallow waters conditions respectively differences in turning circle trajectory are more significant when emp instead of cfd hydrodynamic derivatives are used see fig 11 b this is not the case for zig zag test with rudder angle of 20 fig 11 a moreover the zigzag test validates well with the initial heading and yaw rate until the reach of the ship zero heading after first execute afterwards results start deviating the drift angle is underpredicted in comparison to the free running model test fig 11 measured tests conducted in shallow waters for kvlcc2 at different model tanks confirm these variations eloot et al 2015 a validation of the differences pertaining to deep and shallow water maneuvering phenomena are shown in fig 12 simulations for kvlcc2 based on empirical hydrodynamic coefficients confirm that the model behavior follows the physics of deep and shallow water simulations vantorre et al 2017 whereas the tactical diameter and steady turn rate increase irrespective to the trajectory the influence of sway motions and yaw rate remain small the fact that a larger drift angle causes higher advance of the ship is related to the free under hull flow effects 5 2 onrt and fsb tptr ships the maneuvering simulations and their validations presented in this section aim to demonstrate the reliability of the developed reference method see table 4 and figs 4 and 6 for tptr vessels onrt trajectories and motions comparisons were made against simman 2020 fig 13 illustrates the calm water 35 portside turning circle simulation of onrt excluding heave displacement and heave velocity the remaining 5 dof motions have been presented along the ship s track the profile of all motions matches the trajectories from model test data advance of the ship is within 8 range of the measurement data however differences in numerical versus experimental surge and sway velocities and slower rate of change of ship heading angle results in 16 increase in ship transfer and tactical diameter for the case of 20 zig zag maneuver toward the starboard side shown in fig 14 reasonable trajectories and time histories of motions were obtained the 1st and 2nd overshot angles are within 15 of the free running model test notwithstanding there is a slight decrease in the reach and period of the zig zag maneuver 13 and 7 respectively other than pitch angular displacement all other translational and angular displacements and velocities match almost perfectly at the initial phase of the turning maneuvers despite the small increase motion periods the model does not take into account the roll induced pitch moment which might explain the deviation in pitch behavior for fsb calm water maneuvering simulation comparisons were based on numerical data provided by a shipyard fig 15 top illustrates differences in the steady state part of the turning circle maneuver these discrepancies may relate to numerical simulation uncertainties the simulation of the zig zag maneuver shown in fig 15 bottom is quite satisfactory a slight decrease of the surge velocity drop of the ship is observed in all cases this ranges from 2 to 9 as compared to model experiments see figs 13 15 the yaw rate from the model scale measurements is higher than computational results for the case of the turning circle trajectories it varies between 11 and 20 additionally a phase shift in yaw is noticed in zig zag maneuver of onrt figs 16 and 17 show the turning circle and zig zag trajectory comparisons of hydrodynamic coefficients that have been empirically estimated using eq 22 appendix b and table 6 against those used in the reference technique for onrt when the empirical hydrodynamic coefficients for tptr configuration ships are employed the yawing rate of the ship increases by 35 for the fsb vessel turning circle the speed drop from empirical and reference techniques are almost equal see fig 18 top this may be due to similar trends in increasing yaw rates on the other hand the trajectory obtained when the empirical formula is used is smaller although the speed drop matched well for the zig zag maneuver of fsb see fig 18 bottom amplitudes of motions are considerably larger than the ones simulated by the reference technique in all cases only roll motion appears to match well against results when the empirical formulae is used as illustrated in figs 16 18 that semi empirical hydrodynamic coefficients for a spsr ship see table 6 appendix b is not the best choice for estimating maneuvering of a tptr vessel this is because it shows poor performance in terms of evaluating ship trajectories and motion time histories therefore the reference method as proposed above seems to give good results for onrt and fsb where the reference ship is a surface combatant for onrt and a ferry with a bow thruster for fsb vessel the key reasons of discrepancies may be attributed to the following during pmm tests the model is towed at a constant speed on the other hand the mathematical model accounts for the instantaneous ship velocity and assumes that the velocity drop may be overcome by making hydrodynamic coefficients non dimensional for both ships resistances wake fraction and thrust deduction are estimated from holtrop and mennen 1982 formulation similarly flow straightening coefficients are semi empirically calculated one way to reduce certain level of uncertainties in the estimation of flow straightening coefficient wake fraction and thrust deduction factor is to implement the reference technique on these parameters obtained from similar kind of vessel however this approach lies beyond the scope of this publication the sources of uncertainties in the model scale pmm test are transferred to the reference techniques thus results also depend on how well the experiments are performed 6 conclusions this paper presents a 6 dof modular maneuvering model and reference technique that may be used for the rapid estimation of maneuvering trajectories and motion time histories of single or twin screw propulsion ships results were validated against experiments available for zig zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations it was demonstrated that by suitably combining existing semi empirical formulations for the hull rudder and propulsion hydrodynamics found in literature into a single formulation satisfactory prediction of maneuvering trajectories for spsr ships of differing type can be obtained whereas experimental data for a broader range of ship designs were not available it is believed that the reference technique proposed provides reasonable maneuvering predictions for tptr ships with significantly different main particulars it is therefore believed that the method and modelling approach presented could be used to simulate well ship dynamics it is noted that whereas the model could also be combined with gusty winds dynamic positioning or towing models such applications are out of scope of this research that intends to better understand the influence of hydrodynamic actions on hard grounding induced dynamic response credit authorship contribution statement ghalib taimuri methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data curation

21300,we present a modular mathematical model and a reference technique for the rapid estimation of maneuvering trajectories and motion time histories of single and twin screw propulsion ships heave roll and pitch radiation damping are estimated from a non linear unified seakeeping maneuvering time domain tool using numerical decay tests and then implemented to a 6 dof model in the form of critical damping and natural period short waves are idealised by numerical integration along the vessel s waterline profile and associated hydrodynamic actions are implemented in a response curve format for the rapid assessment of hull in plane hydrodynamic forces derivatives are implemented via semi empirical methods cfd or model test data results are validated against experiments available for zig zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations it is concluded that the approach presented is feasible for the prediction of maneuvering

international maritime safety standards mitigation of risks associated with ship navigation routed accidents e g collisions groundings etc remain challenging in 2017 3145 ship incidents and casualties were reported in emcip these incidents resulted in 26 ships lost 106 fatalities and 957 injuries emsa 2019 based on the same data records it may be concluded that from 2011 to 2016 more than 60 of casualties resulted from flooding during this period the passenger ship segment that represents 23 of the fleet at risk was the second highest contributor to all marine casualties over the same period 172 ships sunk primarily due to collision followed by foundering these two categories account for almost 50 of the fatalities recorded these alarming accident records could be attributed to the inadequacy of safety regulations e g solas 2007 to control risks associated with vessel dynamic behavior pertaining to ship design and operations under rare or extreme conditions with the later in mind this paper presents a rapid 6 dof maneuvering model that could be useful for the evaluation of ship dynamic response before during and after a hard grounding event the method presented is original in terms of simultaneously evaluating 1 coupled heave pitch and roll ship motions 2 velocities in way of contact 3 6 dof evasive maneuvers in a way that accounts for all pertinent phenomena involved along a ship s traveled path e g waves shallow water effects and applies to modern single and twin screw vessels selected key ship parameters of relevance to ship evasiveness and associated navigation routed accidents in restricted waters are taken under consideration such conditions may be representative of many collision and grounding events kujala et al 2009 pagiaziti et al 2015 schröder hinrichs et al 2012 for completeness the effects of shallow water short waves different propulsion and steering arrangements on maneuvering motions are discussed in detail the new elements of the method are verified and the method is validated using three well documented experiments that represent different rudder propeller combinations chillcce and el moctar 2018 simman 2020 and data of modern twin propeller twin rudder tptr passenger vessel provided by a shipyard 2 literature review since the 1970 s various mathematical models have been derived and validated with the aim to represent the influence of maneuvering and seakeeping motions on ship dynamics beck et al 1989 ittc 2017a matusiak 2017 traditionally maneuvering dynamics have been modeled in calm seas i e sheltered waters or harbor conditions and aimed to define ship behavior following an operator s decision on the other hand the development of seakeeping methods focused on the evaluation of motions in waves in the absence of any control in plane actions multi dof unified seakeeping maneuvering theories have been developed progressively and applied to cases of specialist intact ship stability phenomena spyrou et al 2000 ship overtaking scenarios yu et al 2019 or solvers used to simulate ship dynamic behavior in real conditions matusiak 2017 modern methods use the so called maneuvering modeling group mmg standard methodology yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 they also make use of time domain approaches that combine various levels of hydrodynamic nonlinearity hirdaris et al 2016 key academic developments of relevance to this paper can be summarized in two groups namely i the derivation and validation of unified models that simulate ship operations in deep or shallow waters under varying environmental assumptions and ii improved idealization of the effects of evasive ship dynamics pertaining to accidental events collisions groundings etc with reference to the former various 4 and 6 dof models have been derived for example perez et al 2007 proposed a 4 dof maneuvering model using the equations of motion presented in fossen 2002 in their work a genetic algorithm has been used to adjust the maneuvering parameters initially estimated from the 2 5d seakeeping approach of faltinsen and zhao 1991 seo and kim 2011 presented the numerical analysis of ship maneuverability in regular waves in this work froude krylov diffraction radiation and 2nd order mean drift forces were estimated by a rankine panel method and hydrodynamic actions were added into the maneuvering model as external forces a similar model has been introduced by sprenger et al 2017 who assessed the optimum maneuverability of ships to ultimately satisfy eedi requirements imo 2013 in their work they also accounted for 2nd order hydrodynamic actions that may influence the water resistance and maneuvering derivatives in calm waters this approach has been extended by tillig and ringsberg 2018 to account for the effects of vessel drift and rudder angle when resistance in waves is accounted for with reference to 6 dof models notable developments have been limited the unified model presented by bailey et al 2002 remains topical the method combines frequency domain green function seakeeping dynamics in random or irregular seaways with a linear convolution integral to account for the influence of unsteady memory effects during ship maneuvering in waves although the model is mathematically robust wave prediction is not exact also computations may be lengthy for use in practical applications primarily because of time variations related to the encounter frequency and heading angles these practical implementation issues are also of relevance to the more recently presented model of chillcce and el moctar 2018 their approach makes use of a rankine panel method and hydrodynamic coefficients by rans pmm tests in calm waters and regular waves the method of matusiak 2017 combines maneuvering with a time domain non linear seakeeping model in a single set of coupled equations of motion that are solved simultaneously convolution terms are used to represent the memory effect of radiation forces in heave pitch and roll empirically derived coefficients of in plane motion components are utilized this model has been applied to reveal the occurrence of large amplitude roll motions in stern quartering irregular seas during a turning maneuver acanfora and matusiak 2014 matusiak and stigler 2012 in the model by matusiak 2017 external hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull are represented by empirical hydrodynamic coefficients a beneficial method that may be used to assess the credibility of those on maneuvering is sensitivity analysis over a range of vessels progressing along various maneuvering trajectories e g see gavrilin and steen 2018 and sukas et al 2019 such approach is considered beneficial in terms of qualifying uncertainties associated with modelling and simulation assumptions with reference to shallow water effects key developments on the influence of ship maneuvering forces and moments have been introduced by vantorre 2001 vantorre et al 2017 rotteveel 2013 and liu et al 2015 these authors highlighted the importance of ship resistance in shallow and confined waters accordingly it is understood that in restricted conditions i the tactical diameter of vessels may enlarge especially due to hull damping effects ii increases in ship resistance may lead to decrease in maneuvering capability and iii changes in pressure hull distributions may lead to increased hydrodynamic forces whereas advances in marine hydrodynamics look promising work on evasive ship dynamics pertaining to accidental events collisions groundings etc is still very limited and subject to both computational uncertainties and costs varsta et al 2004a 2004b coupled a 6 dof ship dynamics model with a simplified contact model representing hard grounding ståhlberg et al 2013 highlighted the importance of ship velocity and time history in determining vessel evasive maneuvers in case of collision yu and amdahl 2016 presented a coupled approach for simultaneously calculating structural damage and the 6 dof ship motions in ship collisions none of these studies focused on the development of rapid assessment tools that account for the combined influence of seakeeping and maneuvering induced dynamics on vessel response during both grounding and collision events recently kim et al 2020 introduced a 3d fsi model coupling explicit fea structural dynamics with seakeeping maneuvering and calm water resistance this work re affirmed the importance of developing simplified and accurate tools with the aim to practically implement the influence of multiphysics modelling assumptions on ship structural crashworthiness and associated rule development 3 theory the rigid body time domain 6 dof rapid assessment model introduced in this paper is based on the following assumptions i hull in plane forces are represented by quasi steady flow reactions and described by non dimensional coefficients referring to motion velocities and accelerations ii short waves are modeled according to faltinsen 1990 and sakamoto and baba 1986 iii shallow water idealisations account for increase in ship resistance changes in added mass damping as well as changes in flow straightening coefficient wake fraction and thrust deduction factors iv heave pitch and roll motions are assumed to be small and represented by the linear relations of forces and motion components these are not affected by shallow water thus out of plane motions are small and gmt0 gml0 are assumed constant v the action of short waves is restricted to in plane motions thus the wave induced heave pitch and roll are assumed to be negligible vi for computational economy memory effects are not taken under consideration 3 1 motions the translational velocities of surge u sway v and heave w and rotational degrees of freedom namely roll p pitch q and yaw r are shown in fig 1 the earth fixed coordinate system is represented as o x y z the body fixed coordinate system o x y z is attached amidships l p p 2 at a distance x g positive toward the bow accordingly it rests on the still waterline passing through the vessel symmetry plane x z with the longitudinal x axis pointing positive towards the bow the lateral y axis directed towards the starboard side and the vertical z axis pointing downwards the ship heading forms a positive angle ψ from the earth fixed x axis to the body fixed x axis the drift angle β is defined at amidships with respect to the ship s longitudinal and lateral velocity vectors the rudder angle δ is positive towards the port side the change of the course of the ship ψ is positive during the starboard turn where the rudder angle is negative the ship position is established in the earth fixed coordinate system using a transformation rotation matrix corresponding to the rotation angles φ θ a n d ψ about x y and z axis respectively see fig 1 the translational and angular velocities are transformed from the body coordinate to inertial coordinate systems as per fossen 2011 accordingly the coordinate transformation see eq 1 is embedded as a subblock of the 6 dof maneuvering model see fig 6 the general form of rigid body motion comprises of translation and rotation dof governed by newton s 2nd law of motion thus forces representing the external loading action on the ship when she progresses with some forward speed are expressed by the conservation of linear and angular momentum in principle hydrodynamic forces act on the cog of the ship with respect to an inertial frame of reference it is difficult to express external forces in such a manner hence the body fixed coordinate system was defined which is transformed into the inertial frame of reference as 1 x g u c o s ψ c o s θ v c o s ψ s i n θ s i n ϕ s i n ψ c o s ϕ w s i n ψ s i n ϕ c o s ψ c o s ϕ s i

mass multiplier terms on the right hand side are the coriolis and centripetal forces the terms multiple of g represent the hydrostatic forces as per fossen 2011 and lewandowski 2004 the remaining terms describe damping control and environmental forces discussed in subsequent sections 3 2 3 7 the hydrostatic terms in surge sway and yaw do not affect in plane motions instead they are activated by heave roll and pitch motion components caused by grounding mass multipliers on the right hand side of eq 2 reflect the influence of coriolis and centripetal forces on maneuvering the linear model of heave pitch and roll motion components given by eq 2 requires the knowledge of natural periods and critical damping ratios the natural frequencies of heave pitch and roll motions are presented as

as 17 λ v a v c o r r f w h e r e f 2 2 2 0 886 r δ r c r u d 8 the effects of vortical flow on the rudder were neglected the influence of the hull ahead of the rudder was included in the rudder force

flow velocity forms an angle β r see fig 2 therefore the total angle of attack α at the rudder including the rudder deflection δ was defined as 19 β r tan 1 v y r v x r α δ γ r β r the above is based on the description of the rudder angle as illustrated in fig 2 γ r is the flow straightening coefficient depending on the hull form and turning motion of the ship yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 this idealization is of relevance for a scenario whereby a ship is maneuvering and the flow passing through the hull of the ship reduces the angle of attack on the rudder liu and hekkenberg 2017 molland and turnock 2007 the flow straightening coefficient for a single screw and single propeller configuration was then defined according to lee and shin 1998 as 20 γ r 1 20501 c b b l 0 7391 β r 0 γ r 2 7236 c b b l 0 021 β r 0 3 3 2 twin propeller twin rudder tptr configuration the tptr configuration assumed that both propellers have similar design characteristics and therefore hydrodynamic flow effects differ only in terms of flow straightening coefficients accordingly the twin screw rudder flow straightening coefficient was defined as 21 γ r p s 1 20501 c b b l 0 7391 β r 0 γ r p s 2 7236 c b b l 0 021 β r 0 3 4 hull hydrodynamic in plane forces as per taimuri et al 2019 the in plane hull forces acting on an spsr and tptr configuration can be defined as 22 x h u l l x v v v 2 x v r v r x

eq 22 the external sway hydrodynamic damping term y h u l l contributes to roll damping k h u l l the point of the lateral hull force y h u l l acts at some distance in between the still water line and the keel of the ship this vertical distance can be calculated by a static drift test kim et al 2007 or from charts available in literature e g hirano and takashina 1980 along these lines 0 5t may be considered acceptable estimate of effect of external sway force on roll moment it is noted that the model does not account for coupling between yaw and roll motions this is because during grounding the change in wetted surface area and flow over non symmetrical part of the hull are minimal and hence maneuvering is not affected by the small amplitudes of heave roll and pitch notwithstanding to further justify this choice two different cases of calm water simulations at high speed deep waters and at low speed shallow waters were considered with yaw roll coupled hydrodynamic coefficients as per hirano and takashina 1980 in both cases time histories of motion are identical see fig 3 at low speed and shallow turning circle trajectories are practically the same see fig 3 a and at higher speed and deep waters some rather marginal differences become evident see fig 3 b the non dimensional hull forces and velocities for a ship progressing with instantaneous velocity u were defined as 23

simulations regression based semi empirical equations or model tests the semi empirical formulas presented in table 6 appendix b summarize the hydrodynamic coefficients for an spsr vessel the 6 dof surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw added mass approximations are summarized in appendix a table 5 surge sway and yaw added masses were defined according to brix 1993 clarke et al 1982 and roll pitch and heave added masses were defined from the strip theory of frank 1967 journée 1992 3 5 reference technique for the evaluation of maneuvering hull coefficients the empirical formulae presented in table 6 appendix b are for a single screw vessel only cfd or pmm based hydrodynamic coefficients of a tptr ship could be used however cfd simulations or pmm tests are expensive thus a novel reference technique that may be applicable to either spsr or tptr vessels was derived for the improved prediction of hull external forces the method assumes that the changes in the hydrodynamic coefficients may be attributed to changes in the main particulars of a tptr ship and are of the same order as for equivalent spsr ships the procedure is illustrated in fig 4 where as an example the hydrodynamic coefficients of a reference tptr vessel known from pmm tests are defined as c t r u e r e f the coefficients calculated using the combination of semi empirical formulations presented in appendix b are defined as c a p p r o x r e f and the corresponding coefficients for a new build tptr vessel are defined as c a p p r o x n b c e s t i m a t e n b is evaluated once a sufficient correlation of c t r

essentially a model calibration technique the theoretical basis of this technique relies on the use of a correction factor namely c t r u e r e f c a p p r o x r e f that obviously makes use of the results model test c t r u e r e f known values from experiments and c a p p r o x r e f empirical formula of the reference ship this is done separately for each hydrodynamic coefficient producing a set of correction factors these correction factors are then used to correct the new vessel c e s t i m a t e n b hydrodynamic derivatives originating from the empirical formulas c a p p r o x n b for

masses and damping incorporated in the model taimuri et al 2019 to maintain the rapidness of the method the influence of short waves was precomputed by numerically integrating the waterline and adding as input a response surface accounting for wave heading ship speed and associated hydrodynamic actions chroni et al 2015 papanikolaou et al 2016 a runge kutta solver of the 4th order was used to solve the differential equations matusiak 2017 since motions represented by eq 2 are coupled through acceleration terms the equations were first de coupled numerically and in turn accelerations were integrated into velocities considering input from each time step at the same time step velocities were integrated into position vectors using eq 1 the differential ordinary equation used to evaluate

and validated against experimental records for dtc chillcce and el moctar 2018 kvlcc2 and onrt simman 2020 and key data made available from a shipyard for fsb dtc and kvlcc2 resistances were obtained from the benchmark study of sprenger et al 2015 and adolfo marón 2016 respectively the holtrop and mennen 1982 method was utilized to obtain the resistance of onrt and fsb ships see fig 7 the open water propeller characteristics curve for dtc were defined as per sprenger et al 2015 and for kvlcc2 according to stern et al 2011 based on propeller parameters the k t curves of fsb were estimated based on the wageningen b propeller series bernitsas et al 1981 and for the onrt propeller characteristics were gathered from simman 2020 a summary of all propeller parameters is given in table 2 the

utilized model test hydrodynamic derivatives based on cmt measurements aksu and köse 2017 and semi empirical hydrodynamic coefficients see appendix b for shallow waters derivatives were selected from cfd mucha 2017 and semi empirical hydrodynamic coefficients see appendix c the reference technique makes use of similar hull form and comparable control devices see fig 4 a twin screw david taylor model basin surface combatant dtmb 5415 was used as reference ship for onrt with hydrodynamic coefficients based on the pmm tests of yoon 2009 as reported in sukas et al 2019b the hydrodynamic coefficient of a twin screw ferry with a bow thruster were chosen for fsb as presented in yasukawa and hirata 2013 see table 4 4 4 verification of heave roll and pitch for the intended use the objective of the verification process was to qualify that a linear undamped dynamic response caused by a step wise excitation is twice the stationary response matusiak 2000 thorby 2008 accordingly heave pitch and roll motion responses were evaluated by dynamically heaving heeling and trimming the vessel step forces were applied to the ship separately and then dynamic displacement and rotation were observed before the system converges to steady state fig 8 illustrates the dynamic response to an impulse for the case of kvlcc2 the maximum heave roll and pitch responses due to step loading were quantified as 1 97 2 0 and 1 975 times the steady state response amplitude respectively in turning circle tests steady motion may be achieved after some time of the rudder execution where the vessel path remains circular and this circular diameter and steady vessel speed are utilized to build the centrifugal force acting on the ship see eq 37 and matusiak 2000 such centrifugal force will contribute to an external moment m φ e x t the external moment will be equal to the static righting moment m s t s e e e q 38 therefore the analytical form of the heeling angle at a steady turn can be evaluated as 37 f φ s t ρ ψ 2 d s 2 w h e r e ψ v s 0 5 d s 38 m φ e x t ρ ψ v s k g 0 5 t m s t ρ g gm 0 φ m φ e x t m s t 0 ρ ψ v s k g 0 5 t ρ g gm 0 φ φ ψ v s k g 0 5 t g g m 0 simulation of the turning circle of kvlcc2 was performed at 35 rudder angle and 15 5 knots speed utilizing then eqs 37 and 38 the analytical steady yaw rate and heel angle were calculated as 0 51 s and 0 259 respectively using simulations yaw rate and heel angles were estimated respectively as 0 5213 s and 0 255 these values show that there is a negligible difference of 2 percent between the numerical and analytical predictions 5 results and discussion 5 1 dtc and kvlcc2 spsr ships for dtc maneuvering simulations were compared to the work of chillcce and el moctar 2018 and results from eu fp7 shopera project http shopera org fig 9 a illustrates good approximation of calm water turning circle trajectories minor fluctuations in the model test measurements appear possibly due to the reflection of the ship generated wave from the tank walls maneuvering in short waves seems to predict reasonable trajectories together with the translation motion only in the early stage of the turn drifting of the ship appears to deviate in head and following waves conditions see fig 9 b d trajectories in beam seas follow the measured data however sway velocities are overpredicted in both head waves and following seas this is reflected in the marginally imprecise drifting direction of the vessel s trajectory in head and following waves inconsistencies may appear due to differences in draft and speed correction factors or due to the fact that short waves assume vertical walls in way of the waterline and only reflection of the waves is considered the influence of short waves on rudder and propeller forces are also neglected in any case the profile of the translational motions is well apprehended in the simulations numerical simulations show that using semi empirical based hydrodynamic coefficients see appendix b may lead to correct estimation of initial trajectories and motions in deep calm waters and short waves for kvlcc2 results were compared with the free running model test measurements of simman 2020 fig 10 illustrates the calm water simulations in deep sea conditions comparisons were made against experimental values made available from simman 2020 the translation and rotation motions estimated from emp simulations appear to correlate well in way of the steady state part of the model test measurements very little deviation was observed when cmt aksu and köse 2017 based hydrodynamic coefficients were used the advance of the ship from simulations lies well within 2 of the measured data and therefore differences are numerically acceptable it is possible that assumptions in defining the rudder forces e g semi empirical definition of the flow straightening coefficient may have lead to larger drift angle predictions of the ship fig 11 a and b illustrate the validation of 20 5 zig zag and 35 portside turning circle maneuvers in calm shallow waters conditions respectively differences in turning circle trajectory are more significant when emp instead of cfd hydrodynamic derivatives are used see fig 11 b this is not the case for zig zag test with rudder angle of 20 fig 11 a moreover the zigzag test validates well with the initial heading and yaw rate until the reach of the ship zero heading after first execute afterwards results start deviating the drift angle is underpredicted in comparison to the free running model test fig 11 measured tests conducted in shallow waters for kvlcc2 at different model tanks confirm these variations eloot et al 2015 a validation of the differences pertaining to deep and shallow water maneuvering phenomena are shown in fig 12 simulations for kvlcc2 based on empirical hydrodynamic coefficients confirm that the model behavior follows the physics of deep and shallow water simulations vantorre et al 2017 whereas the tactical diameter and steady turn rate increase irrespective to the trajectory the influence of sway motions and yaw rate remain small the fact that a larger drift angle causes higher advance of the ship is related to the free under hull flow effects 5 2 onrt and fsb tptr ships the maneuvering simulations and their validations presented in this section aim to demonstrate the reliability of the developed reference method see table 4 and figs 4 and 6 for tptr vessels onrt trajectories and motions comparisons were made against simman 2020 fig 13 illustrates the calm water 35 portside turning circle simulation of onrt excluding heave displacement and heave velocity the remaining 5 dof motions have been presented along the ship s track the profile of all motions matches the trajectories from model test data advance of the ship is within 8 range of the measurement data however differences in numerical versus experimental surge and sway velocities and slower rate of change of ship heading angle results in 16 increase in ship transfer and tactical diameter for the case of 20 zig zag maneuver toward the starboard side shown in fig 14 reasonable trajectories and time histories of motions were obtained the 1st and 2nd overshot angles are within 15 of the free running model test notwithstanding there is a slight decrease in the reach and period of the zig zag maneuver 13 and 7 respectively other than pitch angular displacement all other translational and angular displacements and velocities match almost perfectly at the initial phase of the turning maneuvers despite the small increase motion periods the model does not take into account the roll induced pitch moment which might explain the deviation in pitch behavior for fsb calm water maneuvering simulation comparisons were based on numerical data provided by a shipyard fig 15 top illustrates differences in the steady state part of the turning circle maneuver these discrepancies may relate to numerical simulation uncertainties the simulation of the zig zag maneuver shown in fig 15 bottom is quite satisfactory a slight decrease of the surge velocity drop of the ship is observed in all cases this ranges from 2 to 9 as compared to model experiments see figs 13 15 the yaw rate from the model scale measurements is higher than computational results for the case of the turning circle trajectories it varies between 11 and 20 additionally a phase shift in yaw is noticed in zig zag maneuver of onrt figs 16 and 17 show the turning circle and zig zag trajectory comparisons of hydrodynamic coefficients that have been empirically estimated using eq 22 appendix b and table 6 against those used in the reference technique for onrt when the empirical hydrodynamic coefficients for tptr configuration ships are employed the yawing rate of the ship increases by 35 for the fsb vessel turning circle the speed drop from empirical and reference techniques are almost equal see fig 18 top this may be due to similar trends in increasing yaw rates on the other hand the trajectory obtained when the empirical formula is used is smaller although the speed drop matched well for the zig zag maneuver of fsb see fig 18 bottom amplitudes of motions are considerably larger than the ones simulated by the reference technique in all cases only roll motion appears to match well against results when the empirical formulae is used as illustrated in figs 16 18 that semi empirical hydrodynamic coefficients for a spsr ship see table 6 appendix b is not the best choice for estimating maneuvering of a tptr vessel this is because it shows poor performance in terms of evaluating ship trajectories and motion time histories therefore the reference method as proposed above seems to give good results for onrt and fsb where the reference ship is a surface combatant for onrt and a ferry with a bow thruster for fsb vessel the key reasons of discrepancies may be attributed to the following during pmm tests the model is towed at a constant speed on the other hand the mathematical model accounts for the instantaneous ship velocity and assumes that the velocity drop may be overcome by making hydrodynamic coefficients non dimensional for both ships resistances wake fraction and thrust deduction are estimated from holtrop and mennen 1982 formulation similarly flow straightening coefficients are semi empirically calculated one way to reduce certain level of uncertainties in the estimation of flow straightening coefficient wake fraction and thrust deduction factor is to implement the reference technique on these parameters obtained from similar kind of vessel however this approach lies beyond the scope of this publication the sources of uncertainties in the model scale pmm test are transferred to the reference techniques thus results also depend on how well the experiments are performed 6 conclusions this paper presents a 6 dof modular maneuvering model and reference technique that may be used for the rapid estimation of maneuvering trajectories and motion time histories of single or twin screw propulsion ships results were validated against experiments available for zig zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations it was demonstrated that by suitably combining existing semi empirical formulations for the hull rudder and propulsion hydrodynamics found in literature into a single formulation satisfactory prediction of maneuvering trajectories for spsr ships of differing type can be obtained whereas experimental data for a broader range of ship designs were not available it is believed that the reference technique proposed provides reasonable maneuvering predictions for tptr ships with significantly different main particulars it is therefore believed that the method and modelling approach presented could be used to simulate well ship dynamics it is noted that whereas the model could also be combined with gusty winds dynamic positioning or towing models such applications are out of scope of this research that intends to better understand the influence of hydrodynamic actions on hard grounding induced dynamic response credit authorship contribution statement ghalib taimuri methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data curation

21301,porous structures have been widely applied in the coastal and ocean engineering in the cfd computational fluid dynamics simulations of interactions between waves and porous structures the microscopic model establishment approach usually requires huge amounts of fine grids around the model boundary thus causing a huge computational overhead this paper establishes a cfd numerical model using a macroscopic approach to simulate the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate by analysing the pressure loss of the interaction above and adding it into the momentum equation as a source term the macroscopic porosity simulation can be implemented without using huge amounts of fine grids around the perforations a series of cfd simulations of wave interacting with a vertical porous plate are performed based on the established numerical model and the corresponding tank tests are conducted the effects of wave characteristics and porosity of porous plate on horizontal wave force and the reflection and transmission coefficients are analyzed the results demonstrate that the established model is reliable for engineering analysis and thereby being of great significance for reference purpose in the cfd simulations of waves interacting with porous structures keywords porous plate wave structure interaction cfd simulation model tests pressure loss 1 introduction with the exploitation and utilization of ocean resources the construction of ocean engineering structures such as the offshore platform and offshore wind turbines has been greatly developed at the same time a major issue to consider is the complex interaction between various kinds of ocean environmental loads waves and ocean engineering structures which may potentially cause the destruction and instability of the structures therefore the investigations on reducing wave reflection and wave force of ocean engineering structures are of great importance the porous or perforated structures have been widely applied in the coastal and ocean engineering constructions due to their excellent ability of absorbing wave impact and protecting structures some examples of such porous structures are the fixed permeable caisson pile and slotted breakwaters huang et al 2011 slotted floating box type breakwaters huang et al 2014 submerged porous breakwaters liu et al 2012b and wave absorbing chambers of floating offshore base liu et al 2013 in the interaction between waves and porous structures two main aspects need to be considered impact of wave on the porous structures and vice versa on the one hand the impact of wave on a porous structure is measured by the wave force being applied on the structure in general a porous structure is connected or combined with other coastal or ocean engineering structures meaning that the wave force on the porous structure will eventually be transferred to the entire structure on the other hand the impact of porous structures on waves mainly includes the wave transmission reflection and dissipation which can be described by the transmission and reflection coefficients focusing on the two aspects above many investigations have been conducted in previous research work the wave tank test is a widely adopted method for investigating the interaction between wave and structures and many experimental investigations on various porous structures have been carried out by employing such method neelamani et al 2000 conducted an experiment on wave interacting with a vertical cylinder encircled by a perforated square caisson and found that the wave forces and moments on the cylinder are influenced by the porosity of the outer caisson tabet aoul and lambert 2003 conducted a series of tank tests and investigated the point pressure and total horizontal wave force on porous structures with different porous plates the effect of phase difference on horizontal wave force was analyzed and a formula to calculate the maximum wave force on porous plate and the rear solid plate was proposed lee et al 2014 conducted a three dimensional experiment to study the evolution of stem waves on partially perforated walls and found that the perforation can effectively reduce the wave height metallinos et al 2016 investigated the wave propagation of a submerged porous breakwater on a steep slope in a physical model test francis et al 2020 analyzed the effect of porosity on wave energy dissipation by conducting an experimental test on solitary wave interacting with vertical porous plates in addition there are also a number of investigations which are concentrated on developing analytical solutions of wave interacting with porous structures sollitt and cross 1972 solved the reflection and transmission coefficients of porous structures using characteristic function expansion method and gave a governing equation for fluid motion in the porous media li et al 2002 presented analytical results on the reflection of obliquely incident waves by breakwaters with a partially perforated wall and then further examined the wave absorbing performance of the breakwater with double partially perforated front walls suh et al 2006 and liu et al 2008 conducted analytical investigations on wave interacting with perforated wall caissons and validated the analytical models with experiments kaligatla and manisha 2017 2018 used the mild slope equations to investigate the effects of bottom topography on linear wave dissipation with vertical porous barriers geng et al 2018 analyzed the wave absorption efficiency of multi layer perforated plates in an ideal fluid based on the linear potential flow theory and then studied the influence of the thickness the porosity and the layout form of the plates on the wave absorptivity gutpta and gayen 2019 analyzed the effect of two submerged unequal permeable plates the permeability was considered as the variation along the submergence depth and the propagation of water waves were solved under the assumptions of linear water wave theory by using have lock s expansion of water wave potential to expand the velocity potential the interaction between incident surface water waves and two asymmetric curved porous plates which assume the shape of ellipse was investigated in a similar method by gayen and gupta 2020 mackay and johanning 2020 compared two analytical solutions of wave interacting with a vertical porous plate where both solutions assume that the evanescent modes in the wave field can be neglected by comparing the results from bem boundary element method modelling it was shown that the assumption is reasonable and the two analytical solutions can well predict the wave force on plate and the transmission and reflection coefficients zheng et al 2020a b established the semi analytical method using the linear potential flow theory and eigenfunction expansion to investigate the wave scattering of a floating porous elastic plate with arbitrary shape 2020 hydroelastic interaction between water waves and multiple circular floating porous elastic plates 2020 many numerical investigations on wave interacting with porous structures have been conducted liu et al 2012a used the semi analytical scaled boundary finite element method to deal with the short crested wave interaction with a concentric cylindrical structure with double layered perforated walls a sph smooth particle hydrodynamics method was adopted by meringolo et al 2015 and ren et al 2018 to simulate the interaction between wave and perforated breakwaters cfd method which numerically solves governing equations of fluid motion based on eular grids has been widely applied for simulating the interaction between fluid and solid structures ren and ma 2015 established a three dimensional numerical wave tank nwt using cfd method and simulated the nonlinear waves interaction with multiple perforated quasi ellipse caissons it was found that the wave forces on caissons would be reduced with the decreased incident wave period and a closer transverse distance between caissons can produce larger wave forces chen et al 2019 used the commercial cfd software ansys fluent to establish a two dimensional nwt and conducted investigation on wave interacting with a vertical perforated wall mounted in front of solid wall the influences of the perforation ratio and the gap width between the perforated and solid walls on wave force and reflection coefficient were analyzed the cfd investigations above both follow the approach of explicitly creating the geometric model of porous wall and generating high quality grids for the fluid field especially for the field around structure boundaries however for a porous wall the size of grids around the wall needs to be small enough to capture the complex geometric boundaries such requirement leads to a large number of mesh cells and poses a huge computational overhead thus these cfd simulations are usually performed on supercomputers gorobets 2016 elhanafi et al 2018 burmester et al 2020 koop 2020 in fact for engineering applications comparing to the microscopic processes of the interaction between waves and porous structures the macroscopic results or the macroscopic effects of the porous structure on incident waves are more worth to be concerned when an incident wave passes through a porous barrier the main macroscopic performance is its pressure loss mackay and johanning 2020 liu et al 1999 presented a numerical model for simulating wave interaction with porous structures where the flow in porous structures is described by the spatially averaged navier stokes equations and the drag forces caused by the presence of a solid skeleton are modeled by the empirical linear and nonlinear frictional forms the numerical model was validated by two cases of a flow passing through a porous dam and the breaking wave overtopping a caisson breakwater protected by porous armor units del jesus et al 2012 proposed a numerical model for heterogeneous media where porosity varies along the porous body such as multilayered rubble mound breakwaters the model integrates a new set of equations covered three terms that reflected the physical processes of flow interaction with porous structures by solving the proposed numerical model and comparing the simulated results with experiments the model was verified to be effective higuera et al 2014 analyzed the pressure loss of flows passing through porous structures and simulated the porous dam break and the interaction between waves and rubble breakwater using openfoam by means of adding the pressure loss term above into the momentum equation of the porous media region the numerical results were consistent with the experiments which indicated that this macroscopic approach is reasonable for simulating waves interacting with porous structures molines et al 2020 used a macroscopic approach to establish a cfd model for simulating wave attacking mound breakwaters with parapets on by openfoam and validated the established model with laboratory experiments a series of numerical experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of nine crown wall geometries with and without parapets a typical case for investigating the characteristics of wave interacting with thin vertical porous structures is a vertical porous plate occupying the full water column on a flat seabed which is simplified from caisson breakwaters with porous vertical wall since the present studies related to this case so far are mostly conducted through experiments and analytical methods there is a compelling need for numerically simulating the case while taking additional factors into considerations for example due to the importance of viscosity and turbulence in the wave structure interactions the fluid dynamic characteristics of the case also need further clarification in this paper a nwt is created in by ansys fluent the pressure loss of waves passing through a vertical porous plate is analyzed by adding the pressure loss term into momentum equation of porous plate region a numerical model of the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate is established a series of experiments of wave interacting with vertical porous plates and the corresponding numerical simulations are conducted the wave force on porous plate and the reflection and transmission coefficients are investigated this paper is organized as follows the setup of wave tank experiments is presented in section 2 the creation of nwt and pressure loss model is presented in section 3 together with the details of cfd simulations section 4 shows the numerical and experimental results and the discussion finally the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 experimental setup the tank tests were conducted at the nonlinear wave flume at dalian university of technology dut the length of flume is 60 m the width is 4 m and the working water depth is 0 2 m 2 0 m equipped with the hydraulic servo push plate wave making system the wave flume can produce regular and irregular waves with the wave period ranging 0 5s 5 0s in this experiment the flume is divided into two parts and the porous plate is arranged in a narrow water tank with a width of 1 010 m fig 1 shows the porous plates used in the tank tests which are made from aluminum the porous plates have circular holes arranged in a regular grid pattern with hole radius r and interval s as shown in fig 2 the porosity ε of the plate is defined as the ratio of the area of openings to the total area of plate which is calculated as 1 ε π r 2 s 2 a series of porous plates with width of 1 m height of 1 5 m thickness of 3 mm and the porosities ε 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 with a same interval s 25 mm are used in the tank tests the porous plates are and fixed on a rigid frame the horizontal wave force is measured by two load cells connected with the top and bottom sides of frame respectively fig 3 shows the load cells used in the tank tests and their installation the load cells are based on the principle of resistance strain and can measure the forces in three orthogonal directions and output measurements in the form of voltage signals to enable the porous plates being close enough to the tank floor the lower load cell is located in a small pit beneath the tank floor a temporary raised section of floor was installed in the section of the flume where the porous plate is installed a 5 mm gap is maintained between the frame and the side walls and the floor of the flume to avoid load transferring from the porous plate to the flume the layout of the flume including the raised section of the floor and wave probes are illustrated in fig 4 which is not drawn to scale for clarity there are 5 wave probes placed in front of and behind the plate for monitoring the wave surface elevations and the used wave probes are shown as fig 5 fig 6 shows the synchronous acquisition system the signals from load cells and wave probes are sent to their corresponding amplifiers and then collected by the data acquisition card controlled by a computer this allows for synchronization between wave surface elevations and wave force in monitoring fig 7 shows one of the porous plates installed in the tank the water depth at the porous plate is 1 m with a 0 5 m freeboard on the porous plate to ensure that no overtopping occurred a series of regular wave conditions are applied in the tests with the normalized wave number k d ranging 0 6 3 4 and the wave steepness k a ranging 0 05 0 20 where k is the wave number d is the water depth and a is the wave amplitude before the model tests empty water tank tests are conducted to correct the wave making system to ensure that the required wave conditions can be generated 3 cfd method 3 1 numerical wave tank 3 1 1 governing equations the wave flow in wave tank can be described by the general form of navier stokes equations 2 u x v y 0 3 u t

hirt and nichols 1981 5 f i t f i u x f i v y 0 6 i 1 2 f i 1 where f i is the volume fraction of the i th phase 3 1 2 wave generation and absorption the numerical wave tank is created by using ansys fluent a cfd software based on finite volume method fvm fig 8 shows the empty nwt which can generate expected waves on the left boundary and eliminate waves with the wave absorbing region at the end in this paper the waves in nwt are generated using pushing board method with regular linear wave conditions applied the motion equations of pushing board on the left boundary are 7 x b t s 0 2 sin ω t 8 u b t ω s 0 2 cos ω t where x b t and u b t are the displacement and velocity of pushing board respectively ω is the wave frequency s 0 is the stroke of pushing board which can be obtained from equation 9 and expressed as equation 10 zou 2005 li and teng 2015 9 η x t s 0 2 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d cos k x ω t h 2 cos k x ω t 10 s 0 2 k d sinh 2 k d 4 sinh 2 k d h where η is the wave surface elevation h is the wave height the pushing board is modeled as rigid body by using users define function udf in fluent the velocity of the pushing board can be set as according to equation 8 and then the wave in equation 9 can be generated to avoid the influence of the reflection wave at the end of tank a wave absorbing region is set by adding linearly increasing damping source terms into the momentum equations the momentum equations with added damping source terms can be expressed as madsen 1983 11 u t u u x v u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 μ x u 12 v t u v x v v y 1 ρ p y ν 2 v x 2 2

wave absorbing region and the length of wave absorbing region l e x 2 x 1 is usually taken 1 2 times of wave length α is an empirical coefficient which is usually taken as 3 0 12 0 s 1 and is set as 8 0 s 1 in this paper after comparing the wave elimination effect since the boundary layer effect at seabed is not important in this problem the bottom and the right boundary of the nwt are set as full slip walls and the top boundary is set with pressure out condition 3 1 3 mesh convergence validation for mesh convergence validation the mesh of nwt is refined as shown in fig 9 in x direction the side length of the mesh cells is refined to 1 10 of s 0 in the motion region of pushing board to δ x evenly in the wave transmission domain and becomes sparse gradually in the wave absorbing region in y direction the side length of the mesh cells is refined to δ y evenly in the region of one wave height above and below the free surface and the side length of mesh cells in the remaining region becomes sparse gradually as the cells are farther from the dense region in the middle table 1 shows four mesh characteristics of δ x and δ y the simulated wave surface elevations of a same wave condition wave period t 1 90s wave height h 0 0772 m water depth d 1 0 m and wave length λ 4 85 m under different mesh characteristics are compared besides after comparing the influences of different time step on the results the t 1000 time step is chosen in the numerical simulation fig 10 shows the time series of wave surface elevation under different mesh characteristics it can be seen that four curves differ slightly and are all in good agreement with the analytical solution the simulated wave heights under four mesh characteristics are shown in table 2 by comparing with simulated waves heights with the targeting value mesh 2 is selected due to its enough high simulation precision and a relatively smaller number of mesh cells fig 11 shows the instantaneous wave surface shape under mesh 2 at t 15s when the wave in tank is stable the wave shape indicates that the wave absorption in the end of tank is effective 3 2 porous plate implementation 3 2 1 pressure loss model as mentioned in section 1 the macroscopic method is considered reasonable and feasible when using cfd method to simulate the interaction between waves and porous structure as opposed to the microscopic approach that requires huge computational cost the macroscopic porosity effect is represented by an averaged pressure loss through the porous media where the detailed geometry does not need to be resolved explicitly the pressure loss of the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate will be analyzed in this subsection darcy 1956 onducted a study on water flowing through sand and found that the pressure loss across the structure can be assumed to be linearly proportional to the flow passing through as shown in equation 14 14 i 1 ρ g p y a p u where i is the hydraulic gradient a p is an empirical coefficient u is the averaged discharge velocity forcheimer 1901 added a quadratic term into the pressure loss for modelling more energetic flows as shown in equation 15 15 i 1 ρ g p y a p u b p u u where b p is an empirical coefficient polubarinova kochina 1962 considered the added mass effects of unsteady flows and added the transient term in the formulation as shown in equation 16 16 i 1 ρ g p y a p u b p u u c p u t where c p is an empirical coefficient sollitt and cross 1972 further proposed that when a wave passing through a vertical thin porous barrier the pressure loss δ p can be expressed as shown in equation 17 17 δ p ρ ν u l c f 2 u u c u t where l is a length scale which is related to geometry characteristics of porous structures c is an inertial coefficient u is the velocity normal to the plate c f is a dimensionless friction coefficient which can be obtained from equation 18 molin 2011 18 c f 1 ε ε 2 δ where δ is the discharge coefficient usually taken as 0 4 0 5 mackay and johanning 2020 and it is chosen as 0 5 in this paper the first term is a linear viscous friction term the second term is a quadratic turbulent dissipation term and the third term is a transient term sollitt and cross 1972 noted that the linear viscous friction term is dominant at low reynolds number while the quadratic turbulent dissipation term becomes dominant at high reynolds number the reynolds numbers for wave interaction with thin porous plates are usually sufficiently high so that the linear viscous friction term can be neglected in this paper the transient term accounts for added mass effects and transient interaction between wave and porous structures which has the same meaning like the imaginary part of porous effect parameter accounts for the inertial effect of the porous medium in yu 1995 mei et al 1974 and mciver 1998 calculated the inertial coefficient c of the transient term both by using the long wave approximation in acoustics they proposed different forms of expression of c as follows 19 c s 2 π log sin π ε 2 20 c s 0 3898 ε 0 03239 ε 1 2415 0 8862 ε however under the test conditions in this paper the value of c is so small that the transient term has very small contribution to the pressure loss compared to the quadratic turbulent dissipation term a comparison with c 0 and c 0 is conducted to confirm the assumption where c is calculated by equation 20 with ε 0 1 0 4 and the wave condition of wave period t 1 90s wave height h 0 0772 m water depth d 1 0 m wave length λ 4 85 m is applied fig 12 shows the time series of horizontal wave force on porous plate and the results show that the situations of c 0 have nearly no difference with those of c 0 meaning that the neglect of transient term is reasonable for the test conditions in this paper therefore the pressure loss can be well approximated solely by the turbulent dissipation term the pressure loss per unit length is added into the momentum equation of x direction as a source term in the geometric region of the porous plate by using the udf of fluent the nwt can then be utilized to simulate the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate according to equations 17 and 18 the added source term in the momentum equation of x direction can be expressed as 21 s p o r o u s 1 ρ δ p δ n c f 2 δ n u u 1 ε 2 ε 2 δ δ n u u where δ n is the thickness of plate 3 2 2 turbulence modelling a laminar flow model has been used for the entire computational domain the justification for this choice is as follows first the turbulent dissipation in the vicinity of the porous plate is already accounted by the turbulent sink term in the macroscopic porosity model hence the use of a turbulence model would result in an additional turbulent loss jensen et al 2014 second outside the porous region the tank floor is smooth enough to assume a slip condition 3 3 cfd simulation porous plates of different porosity are simulated by cfd method under regular wave conditions as shown in table 3 which are the same as the wave conditions conducted in the tank test shown in section 2 aiming to avoid the model test scale effect the suitable wave theory for w16 and w17 should be the third order stokes waves however the linear wave theory is also used like w1 w15 in the following analysis with the reason of that the difference of using the two theories are only around 5 for the averaged maximum wave force after comparison fig 13 shows the layout of the nwt with porous plate and the wave probes to avoid the effect of secondary reflection waves from wave making board the porous plate needs to be sufficiently far away from the wave making board the wave absorbing region also requires a reasonable length to eliminate waves therefore for different wave conditions the length of whole tank l ranges 30 60 m and the length of the wave absorbing region b ranges 10 20 m the porous plate is set as 5 m away from the wave absorbing region which maintains adequate length for monitoring transmission waves there are 5 wave probes in front of and behind the plate in total which are arranged in the same way as the tank tests fig 14 shows the generated mesh of the nwt with porous plate which is the same as empty nwt except for the mesh cells in and nearby the plate domain which are further refined appropriately 4 results and discussion fig 15 shows the results of a time series of horizontal wave force on porous plate for the convenience of comparing the results of cfd method and experiment the phase position of experimental results is adjusted to be consistent with cfd results and due to the space limitation only the results of ε 0 2 under partial wave conditions are listed it can be observed that for horizontal wave force the numerical results are nearly identical with experimental ones in period but in terms of amplitude large difference occurs in some wave conditions which will be further discussed and explained next fig 16 shows the wave surface elevations monitored by different wave probes under w5 the numerical results are nearly identical with experimental ones from the wave surface elevations in front of and behind the porous plate it can be learned that obvious transmission and reflection have occurred after the interaction between incident wave and porous plate for further analysis the transmission and reflection coefficients are introduced 22 k t h t h i 23 k r h r h i where k t and k r are transmission and reflection coefficients h t h r h i are transmission reflection and incident wave heights respectively for both cfd simulations and experiments the transmission wave heights can be obtained by the monitored wave surface elevations behind the plate in the meantime the wave surface elevations in front of the plate need to be decomposed for obtaining the incident and reflection wave heights a two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 is applied in this paper which requires the distance between two wave probes being the integer multiples of half wave length the three wave probes in front of the porous plate are 0 8 m 0 5 m and 1 3 m apart from each other which meets the requirement above for all wave conditions in this paper furthermore the analysis on three 2 probe combinations can help verify the decomposed wave components and make the results more reliable 4 1 effects of normalized wave number fig 17 shows the numerical and experimental amplitudes of horizontal wave force against normalized wave number k d with different porosity the numerical and experimental values are both normalized by the following equation 24 f x f x ρ g a b d k d tanh k d where f x is the amplitude values of horizontal wave force f x is the normalized values b 1 0 m is the width of porous plate it can be seen from fig 17 that the numerical values are in good agreement with experimental ones under high frequency waves with k d 1 30 whereas noticeable difference occurs under low frequency wave conditions with k d 1 30 the experimental values show obvious oscillations under low frequency waves which agrees with the difference observed in fig 15 under wave conditions w7 w9 and w11 and the oscillation degree decreases with the porosity increases as shown in fig 17 fig 18 shows the results of transmission and reflection coefficients against k d and similar difference between numerical and experimental values is observed as the results of wave force for further analyzing the difference above the results of mackay et al 2019 based on bem method are together compared as shown in figs 17 and 18 it can be obtained that the results of the cfd model established in this paper agree well with the results of mackay s model indicating that the cfd simulations are reliable and the experimental results may be not accuracy under low frequency wave conditions the possible reasons for the difference are discussed as follows first the experiments are not conducted on a flat seabed and the raised floor has effects on the incident waves of certain wave length which is not taken into consideration in the cfd simulations cfd simulations for comparison purpose are conducted under w9 and w11 which includes the raised floor shown in fig 4 and the results are presented in fig 19 it is found that the raised floor has an effect of decreasing the force amplitude which can be explained by the misalignment of the waves by the ramp such misalignment causes the vertical component of the force to increase and the horizontal one to decrease however the magnitude of the force decrease is very small so the raised floor cannot be mainly accounted for the difference between numerical and experimental results another explanation for the difference is that the experiment results under low frequency waves are affected by the secondary reflection waves the wave reflected by the porous plate will be reflected again by the wave making board which will be superimposed on the incident wave because of the phase difference between the secondary reflection wave and the incident wave the superimposed wave may be larger or smaller than the original incident wave thus causing the measured experimental values showing obvious oscillations and not agreeing with the true values for low frequency cases since the waves travel so fast and the distance between wave making board and porous plate is relatively short the secondary reflection waves would arrive at porous plate before the measured values become steady in the cfd simulations the influence of secondary reflected waves has been fully avoided by extending the length of nwt thus extending the wave propagation distance therefore the reason of oscillation under low frequency wave conditions of experimental results can be ensured as the secondary refection effect and the established numerical model is considered reliable for simulating the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate it can be learned from fig 17 that for the same porous plate the horizontal wave force decreases gradually with the increasing normalized wave number k d and finally approaches a constant this indicates that for different k d values the sensitivities of wave force change are also different the wave force decreases rapidly when the normalized wave number increases at small values as the normalized wave number approaches larger values decreasing effect on wave force become minor it can also be observed that the range of k d in which the wave force decreases rapidly is also reduced with increased porosity the normalized wave numbers also have effects on reflection and transmission coefficients as can be learned from fig 17 for the same porous plate with increasing values of k d the reflection coefficient is on a decreasing trend and finally approaches a constant value while the transmission coefficient is on an opposite trend similar to the wave force at low normalized wave numbers and the changes become minor at high normalized wave numbers with the increased porosity the range of k d in which the reflection and transmission coefficients changing rapidly becomes smaller the porosity also has other impacts on the magnitudes of wave force and reflection and transmission coefficients which will be further discussed in section 4 3 the effects of normalized wave numbers can be explained as follows the horizontal wave force reflects the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces of porous plate as k d increases the flow velocity normal to the plate decreases which leads to the subsequent decrease in the pressure loss according to the pressure loss model hence the pressure difference decreases which results in a decreased horizontal wave force at the same time with the decrease of flow velocity more components of the incident wave are allowed to pass through the plate thus causing the increases in transmission coefficient and the decreases in reflection coefficient 4 2 effects of wave steepness fig 20 shows the effects of wave steepness on wave force the wave conditions being analyzed w5 and w14 17 with k d 1 30 are not influenced by the secondary reflection effects of tank tests and it can be seen that the numerical results agree well with experimental ones it can be learned from fig 20 that for the same porous plate with the increasing wave steepness the normalized wave force increases approximately linearly fig 21 shows the change in reflection and transmission coefficients against wave steepness it can be learned that for the same porous plate with the increasing wave steepness the reflection coefficient increases approximately linearly while the transmission coefficient changes in an opposite way the effects of wave steepness can be explained as follows for waves of the same wavelength the wave steepness reflects the characteristics of wave height according to potential flow theory the horizontal velocity of incident wave increases with the increasing of wave height and the pressure loss in porous plate thus becomes larger according to equation 17 causing the increase of wave force at the same time more components of the incident wave are reflected by the porous plate thus causing the increase of k r and decrease of k t 4 3 effects of porosity fig 22 shows the effects of porosity ε on horizontal wave force note that the numerical predicted wave force is in agreement with the measured values under the analyzed wave conditions and f x decreases with increasing ε figs 23 and 24 show the effects of porosity ε on the reflection and transmission coefficients it can be learned that with the enlarging porosity of porous plate the reflection coefficient gradually decreases while the transmission coefficient increases for the same wave condition the porous plate with large porosity will be applied on less wave force which is due to the smaller impact area from the larger porosity in the meantime more components of the incident wave are allowed to pass through the plate meaning that less wave components are reflected by the plate thus causing the increase in transmission coefficient and the decrease in reflection coefficient the pressure loss model has well simulated the macroscopic performance of the process above 5 conclusions for the investigation of wave interacting with a vertical porous plate this paper established a cfd numerical model which applied the macroscopic approach for modelling the porous plate by analysing the pressure loss of wave interacting with a vertical porous plate and adding it into the momentum equation as a source term the macroscopic simulation of the interaction between waves and a porous plate is implemented to validate the effectiveness of the numerical model a series of cfd simulations and corresponding tank tests are conducted by analysing the numerical and experimental results several conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the numerical results are consistent with experimental ones under high frequency wave conditions while large differences appear under low frequency waves it is believed that the tank tests under low frequency wave conditions are affected by the secondary reflection waves thus causing disagreement between the numerical and the experimental results the established cfd numerical model can fully avoid the such influence and therefore is believed to be reliable for engineering analysis purpose 2 by analysing the horizontal wave force and the reflection and transmission coefficients under different wave conditions general regularities of the variation of them with the normalized wave number and wave steepness are discussed for the same porous plate with the increase of k d the horizontal wave force decreases rapidly and then approaches to a constant value the reflection coefficient decreases gradually and approaches a constant value the transmission coefficient increases gradually and tends to be a constant value with the increase of k a from 0 05 to 0 20 the horizontal wave force increases the reflection coefficient increases and the transmission coefficient decreases all of which changes in an approximately linear fashion with k a 3 the porosity has great effects on the wave force and the reflection and transmission coefficients under the same wave condition larger the porosity leads to smaller horizontal wave force larger transmission coefficient and smaller reflection coefficient overall the established cfd numerical model is able to reliably simulate the wave interacting with a vertical porous plate it can accurately predict the wave force and reflection and transmission coefficients under different regular waves which is significant for

21301,porous structures have been widely applied in the coastal and ocean engineering in the cfd computational fluid dynamics simulations of interactions between waves and porous structures the microscopic model establishment approach usually requires huge amounts of fine grids around the model boundary thus causing a huge computational overhead this paper establishes a cfd numerical model using a macroscopic approach to simulate the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate by analysing the pressure loss of the interaction above and adding it into the momentum equation as a source term the macroscopic porosity simulation can be implemented without using huge amounts of fine grids around the perforations a series of cfd simulations of wave interacting with a vertical porous plate are performed based on the established numerical model and the corresponding tank tests are conducted the effects of wave characteristics and porosity of porous plate on horizontal wave force and the reflection and transmission coefficients are analyzed the results demonstrate that the established model is reliable for engineering analysis and thereby being of great significance for reference purpose in the cfd simulations of waves interacting with porous structures keywords porous plate wave structure interaction cfd simulation model tests pressure loss 1 introduction with the exploitation and utilization of ocean resources the construction of ocean engineering structures such as the offshore platform and offshore wind turbines has been greatly developed at the same time a major issue to consider is the complex interaction between various kinds of ocean environmental loads waves and ocean engineering structures which may potentially cause the destruction and instability of the structures therefore the investigations on reducing wave reflection and wave force of ocean engineering structures are of great importance the porous or perforated structures have been widely applied in the coastal and ocean engineering constructions due to their excellent ability of absorbing wave impact and protecting structures some examples of such porous structures are the fixed permeable caisson pile and slotted breakwaters huang et al 2011 slotted floating box type breakwaters huang et al 2014 submerged porous breakwaters liu et al 2012b and wave absorbing chambers of floating offshore base liu et al 2013 in the interaction between waves and porous structures two main aspects need to be considered impact of wave on the porous structures and vice versa on the one hand the impact of wave on a porous structure is measured by the wave force being applied on the structure in general a porous structure is connected or combined with other coastal or ocean engineering structures meaning that the wave force on the porous structure will eventually be transferred to the entire structure on the other hand the impact of porous structures on waves mainly includes the wave transmission reflection and dissipation which can be described by the transmission and reflection coefficients focusing on the two aspects above many investigations have been conducted in previous research work the wave tank test is a widely adopted method for investigating the interaction between wave and structures and many experimental investigations on various porous structures have been carried out by employing such method neelamani et al 2000 conducted an experiment on wave interacting with a vertical cylinder encircled by a perforated square caisson and found that the wave forces and moments on the cylinder are influenced by the porosity of the outer caisson tabet aoul and lambert 2003 conducted a series of tank tests and investigated the point pressure and total horizontal wave force on porous structures with different porous plates the effect of phase difference on horizontal wave force was analyzed and a formula to calculate the maximum wave force on porous plate and the rear solid plate was proposed lee et al 2014 conducted a three dimensional experiment to study the evolution of stem waves on partially perforated walls and found that the perforation can effectively reduce the wave height metallinos et al 2016 investigated the wave propagation of a submerged porous breakwater on a steep slope in a physical model test francis et al 2020 analyzed the effect of porosity on wave energy dissipation by conducting an experimental test on solitary wave interacting with vertical porous plates in addition there are also a number of investigations which are concentrated on developing analytical solutions of wave interacting with porous structures sollitt and cross 1972 solved the reflection and transmission coefficients of porous structures using characteristic function expansion method and gave a governing equation for fluid motion in the porous media li et al 2002 presented analytical results on the reflection of obliquely incident waves by breakwaters with a partially perforated wall and then further examined the wave absorbing performance of the breakwater with double partially perforated front walls suh et al 2006 and liu et al 2008 conducted analytical investigations on wave interacting with perforated wall caissons and validated the analytical models with experiments kaligatla and manisha 2017 2018 used the mild slope equations to investigate the effects of bottom topography on linear wave dissipation with vertical porous barriers geng et al 2018 analyzed the wave absorption efficiency of multi layer perforated plates in an ideal fluid based on the linear potential flow theory and then studied the influence of the thickness the porosity and the layout form of the plates on the wave absorptivity gutpta and gayen 2019 analyzed the effect of two submerged unequal permeable plates the permeability was considered as the variation along the submergence depth and the propagation of water waves were solved under the assumptions of linear water wave theory by using have lock s expansion of water wave potential to expand the velocity potential the interaction between incident surface water waves and two asymmetric curved porous plates which assume the shape of ellipse was investigated in a similar method by gayen and gupta 2020 mackay and johanning 2020 compared two analytical solutions of wave interacting with a vertical porous plate where both solutions assume that the evanescent modes in the wave field can be neglected by comparing the results from bem boundary element method modelling it was shown that the assumption is reasonable and the two analytical solutions can well predict the wave force on plate and the transmission and reflection coefficients zheng et al 2020a b established the semi analytical method using the linear potential flow theory and eigenfunction expansion to investigate the wave scattering of a floating porous elastic plate with arbitrary shape 2020 hydroelastic interaction between water waves and multiple circular floating porous elastic plates 2020 many numerical investigations on wave interacting with porous structures have been conducted liu et al 2012a used the semi analytical scaled boundary finite element method to deal with the short crested wave interaction with a concentric cylindrical structure with double layered perforated walls a sph smooth particle hydrodynamics method was adopted by meringolo et al 2015 and ren et al 2018 to simulate the interaction between wave and perforated breakwaters cfd method which numerically solves governing equations of fluid motion based on eular grids has been widely applied for simulating the interaction between fluid and solid structures ren and ma 2015 established a three dimensional numerical wave tank nwt using cfd method and simulated the nonlinear waves interaction with multiple perforated quasi ellipse caissons it was found that the wave forces on caissons would be reduced with the decreased incident wave period and a closer transverse distance between caissons can produce larger wave forces chen et al 2019 used the commercial cfd software ansys fluent to establish a two dimensional nwt and conducted investigation on wave interacting with a vertical perforated wall mounted in front of solid wall the influences of the perforation ratio and the gap width between the perforated and solid walls on wave force and reflection coefficient were analyzed the cfd investigations above both follow the approach of explicitly creating the geometric model of porous wall and generating high quality grids for the fluid field especially for the field around structure boundaries however for a porous wall the size of grids around the wall needs to be small enough to capture the complex geometric boundaries such requirement leads to a large number of mesh cells and poses a huge computational overhead thus these cfd simulations are usually performed on supercomputers gorobets 2016 elhanafi et al 2018 burmester et al 2020 koop 2020 in fact for engineering applications comparing to the microscopic processes of the interaction between waves and porous structures the macroscopic results or the macroscopic effects of the porous structure on incident waves are more worth to be concerned when an incident wave passes through a porous barrier the main macroscopic performance is its pressure loss mackay and johanning 2020 liu et al 1999 presented a numerical model for simulating wave interaction with porous structures where the flow in porous structures is described by the spatially averaged navier stokes equations and the drag forces caused by the presence of a solid skeleton are modeled by the empirical linear and nonlinear frictional forms the numerical model was validated by two cases of a flow passing through a porous dam and the breaking wave overtopping a caisson breakwater protected by porous armor units del jesus et al 2012 proposed a numerical model for heterogeneous media where porosity varies along the porous body such as multilayered rubble mound breakwaters the model integrates a new set of equations covered three terms that reflected the physical processes of flow interaction with porous structures by solving the proposed numerical model and comparing the simulated results with experiments the model was verified to be effective higuera et al 2014 analyzed the pressure loss of flows passing through porous structures and simulated the porous dam break and the interaction between waves and rubble breakwater using openfoam by means of adding the pressure loss term above into the momentum equation of the porous media region the numerical results were consistent with the experiments which indicated that this macroscopic approach is reasonable for simulating waves interacting with porous structures molines et al 2020 used a macroscopic approach to establish a cfd model for simulating wave attacking mound breakwaters with parapets on by openfoam and validated the established model with laboratory experiments a series of numerical experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of nine crown wall geometries with and without parapets a typical case for investigating the characteristics of wave interacting with thin vertical porous structures is a vertical porous plate occupying the full water column on a flat seabed which is simplified from caisson breakwaters with porous vertical wall since the present studies related to this case so far are mostly conducted through experiments and analytical methods there is a compelling need for numerically simulating the case while taking additional factors into considerations for example due to the importance of viscosity and turbulence in the wave structure interactions the fluid dynamic characteristics of the case also need further clarification in this paper a nwt is created in by ansys fluent the pressure loss of waves passing through a vertical porous plate is analyzed by adding the pressure loss term into momentum equation of porous plate region a numerical model of the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate is established a series of experiments of wave interacting with vertical porous plates and the corresponding numerical simulations are conducted the wave force on porous plate and the reflection and transmission coefficients are investigated this paper is organized as follows the setup of wave tank experiments is presented in section 2 the creation of nwt and pressure loss model is presented in section 3 together with the details of cfd simulations section 4 shows the numerical and experimental results and the discussion finally the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 experimental setup the tank tests were conducted at the nonlinear wave flume at dalian university of technology dut the length of flume is 60 m the width is 4 m and the working water depth is 0 2 m 2 0 m equipped with the hydraulic servo push plate wave making system the wave flume can produce regular and irregular waves with the wave period ranging 0 5s 5 0s in this experiment the flume is divided into two parts and the porous plate is arranged in a narrow water tank with a width of 1 010 m fig 1 shows the porous plates used in the tank tests which are made from aluminum the porous plates have circular holes arranged in a regular grid pattern with hole radius r and interval s as shown in fig 2 the porosity ε of the plate is defined as the ratio of the area of openings to the total area of plate which is calculated as 1 ε π r 2 s 2 a series of porous plates with width of 1 m height of 1 5 m thickness of 3 mm and the porosities ε 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 with a same interval s 25 mm are used in the tank tests the porous plates are and fixed on a rigid frame the horizontal wave force is measured by two load cells connected with the top and bottom sides of frame respectively fig 3 shows the load cells used in the tank tests and their installation the load cells are based on the principle of resistance strain and can measure the forces in three orthogonal directions and output measurements in the form of voltage signals to enable the porous plates being close enough to the tank floor the lower load cell is located in a small pit beneath the tank floor a temporary raised section of floor was installed in the section of the flume where the porous plate is installed a 5 mm gap is maintained between the frame and the side walls and the floor of the flume to avoid load transferring from the porous plate to the flume the layout of the flume including the raised section of the floor and wave probes are illustrated in fig 4 which is not drawn to scale for clarity there are 5 wave probes placed in front of and behind the plate for monitoring the wave surface elevations and the used wave probes are shown as fig 5 fig 6 shows the synchronous acquisition system the signals from load cells and wave probes are sent to their corresponding amplifiers and then collected by the data acquisition card controlled by a computer this allows for synchronization between wave surface elevations and wave force in monitoring fig 7 shows one of the porous plates installed in the tank the water depth at the porous plate is 1 m with a 0 5 m freeboard on the porous plate to ensure that no overtopping occurred a series of regular wave conditions are applied in the tests with the normalized wave number k d ranging 0 6 3 4 and the wave steepness k a ranging 0 05 0 20 where k is the wave number d is the water depth and a is the wave amplitude before the model tests empty water tank tests are conducted to correct the wave making system to ensure that the required wave conditions can be generated 3 cfd method 3 1 numerical wave tank 3 1 1 governing equations the wave flow in wave tank can be described by the general form of navier stokes equations 2 u x v y 0 3 u t

hirt and nichols 1981 5 f i t f i u x f i v y 0 6 i 1 2 f i 1 where f i is the volume fraction of the i th phase 3 1 2 wave generation and absorption the numerical wave tank is created by using ansys fluent a cfd software based on finite volume method fvm fig 8 shows the empty nwt which can generate expected waves on the left boundary and eliminate waves with the wave absorbing region at the end in this paper the waves in nwt are generated using pushing board method with regular linear wave conditions applied the motion equations of pushing board on the left boundary are 7 x b t s 0 2 sin ω t 8 u b t ω s 0 2 cos ω t where x b t and u b t are the displacement and velocity of pushing board respectively ω is the wave frequency s 0 is the stroke of pushing board which can be obtained from equation 9 and expressed as equation 10 zou 2005 li and teng 2015 9 η x t s 0 2 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d cos k x ω t h 2 cos k x ω t 10 s 0 2 k d sinh 2 k d 4 sinh 2 k d h where η is the wave surface elevation h is the wave height the pushing board is modeled as rigid body by using users define function udf in fluent the velocity of the pushing board can be set as according to equation 8 and then the wave in equation 9 can be generated to avoid the influence of the reflection wave at the end of tank a wave absorbing region is set by adding linearly increasing damping source terms into the momentum equations the momentum equations with added damping source terms can be expressed as madsen 1983 11 u t u u x v u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 μ x u 12 v t u v x v v y 1 ρ p y ν 2 v x 2 2

wave absorbing region and the length of wave absorbing region l e x 2 x 1 is usually taken 1 2 times of wave length α is an empirical coefficient which is usually taken as 3 0 12 0 s 1 and is set as 8 0 s 1 in this paper after comparing the wave elimination effect since the boundary layer effect at seabed is not important in this problem the bottom and the right boundary of the nwt are set as full slip walls and the top boundary is set with pressure out condition 3 1 3 mesh convergence validation for mesh convergence validation the mesh of nwt is refined as shown in fig 9 in x direction the side length of the mesh cells is refined to 1 10 of s 0 in the motion region of pushing board to δ x evenly in the wave transmission domain and becomes sparse gradually in the wave absorbing region in y direction the side length of the mesh cells is refined to δ y evenly in the region of one wave height above and below the free surface and the side length of mesh cells in the remaining region becomes sparse gradually as the cells are farther from the dense region in the middle table 1 shows four mesh characteristics of δ x and δ y the simulated wave surface elevations of a same wave condition wave period t 1 90s wave height h 0 0772 m water depth d 1 0 m and wave length λ 4 85 m under different mesh characteristics are compared besides after comparing the influences of different time step on the results the t 1000 time step is chosen in the numerical simulation fig 10 shows the time series of wave surface elevation under different mesh characteristics it can be seen that four curves differ slightly and are all in good agreement with the analytical solution the simulated wave heights under four mesh characteristics are shown in table 2 by comparing with simulated waves heights with the targeting value mesh 2 is selected due to its enough high simulation precision and a relatively smaller number of mesh cells fig 11 shows the instantaneous wave surface shape under mesh 2 at t 15s when the wave in tank is stable the wave shape indicates that the wave absorption in the end of tank is effective 3 2 porous plate implementation 3 2 1 pressure loss model as mentioned in section 1 the macroscopic method is considered reasonable and feasible when using cfd method to simulate the interaction between waves and porous structure as opposed to the microscopic approach that requires huge computational cost the macroscopic porosity effect is represented by an averaged pressure loss through the porous media where the detailed geometry does not need to be resolved explicitly the pressure loss of the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate will be analyzed in this subsection darcy 1956 onducted a study on water flowing through sand and found that the pressure loss across the structure can be assumed to be linearly proportional to the flow passing through as shown in equation 14 14 i 1 ρ g p y a p u where i is the hydraulic gradient a p is an empirical coefficient u is the averaged discharge velocity forcheimer 1901 added a quadratic term into the pressure loss for modelling more energetic flows as shown in equation 15 15 i 1 ρ g p y a p u b p u u where b p is an empirical coefficient polubarinova kochina 1962 considered the added mass effects of unsteady flows and added the transient term in the formulation as shown in equation 16 16 i 1 ρ g p y a p u b p u u c p u t where c p is an empirical coefficient sollitt and cross 1972 further proposed that when a wave passing through a vertical thin porous barrier the pressure loss δ p can be expressed as shown in equation 17 17 δ p ρ ν u l c f 2 u u c u t where l is a length scale which is related to geometry characteristics of porous structures c is an inertial coefficient u is the velocity normal to the plate c f is a dimensionless friction coefficient which can be obtained from equation 18 molin 2011 18 c f 1 ε ε 2 δ where δ is the discharge coefficient usually taken as 0 4 0 5 mackay and johanning 2020 and it is chosen as 0 5 in this paper the first term is a linear viscous friction term the second term is a quadratic turbulent dissipation term and the third term is a transient term sollitt and cross 1972 noted that the linear viscous friction term is dominant at low reynolds number while the quadratic turbulent dissipation term becomes dominant at high reynolds number the reynolds numbers for wave interaction with thin porous plates are usually sufficiently high so that the linear viscous friction term can be neglected in this paper the transient term accounts for added mass effects and transient interaction between wave and porous structures which has the same meaning like the imaginary part of porous effect parameter accounts for the inertial effect of the porous medium in yu 1995 mei et al 1974 and mciver 1998 calculated the inertial coefficient c of the transient term both by using the long wave approximation in acoustics they proposed different forms of expression of c as follows 19 c s 2 π log sin π ε 2 20 c s 0 3898 ε 0 03239 ε 1 2415 0 8862 ε however under the test conditions in this paper the value of c is so small that the transient term has very small contribution to the pressure loss compared to the quadratic turbulent dissipation term a comparison with c 0 and c 0 is conducted to confirm the assumption where c is calculated by equation 20 with ε 0 1 0 4 and the wave condition of wave period t 1 90s wave height h 0 0772 m water depth d 1 0 m wave length λ 4 85 m is applied fig 12 shows the time series of horizontal wave force on porous plate and the results show that the situations of c 0 have nearly no difference with those of c 0 meaning that the neglect of transient term is reasonable for the test conditions in this paper therefore the pressure loss can be well approximated solely by the turbulent dissipation term the pressure loss per unit length is added into the momentum equation of x direction as a source term in the geometric region of the porous plate by using the udf of fluent the nwt can then be utilized to simulate the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate according to equations 17 and 18 the added source term in the momentum equation of x direction can be expressed as 21 s p o r o u s 1 ρ δ p δ n c f 2 δ n u u 1 ε 2 ε 2 δ δ n u u where δ n is the thickness of plate 3 2 2 turbulence modelling a laminar flow model has been used for the entire computational domain the justification for this choice is as follows first the turbulent dissipation in the vicinity of the porous plate is already accounted by the turbulent sink term in the macroscopic porosity model hence the use of a turbulence model would result in an additional turbulent loss jensen et al 2014 second outside the porous region the tank floor is smooth enough to assume a slip condition 3 3 cfd simulation porous plates of different porosity are simulated by cfd method under regular wave conditions as shown in table 3 which are the same as the wave conditions conducted in the tank test shown in section 2 aiming to avoid the model test scale effect the suitable wave theory for w16 and w17 should be the third order stokes waves however the linear wave theory is also used like w1 w15 in the following analysis with the reason of that the difference of using the two theories are only around 5 for the averaged maximum wave force after comparison fig 13 shows the layout of the nwt with porous plate and the wave probes to avoid the effect of secondary reflection waves from wave making board the porous plate needs to be sufficiently far away from the wave making board the wave absorbing region also requires a reasonable length to eliminate waves therefore for different wave conditions the length of whole tank l ranges 30 60 m and the length of the wave absorbing region b ranges 10 20 m the porous plate is set as 5 m away from the wave absorbing region which maintains adequate length for monitoring transmission waves there are 5 wave probes in front of and behind the plate in total which are arranged in the same way as the tank tests fig 14 shows the generated mesh of the nwt with porous plate which is the same as empty nwt except for the mesh cells in and nearby the plate domain which are further refined appropriately 4 results and discussion fig 15 shows the results of a time series of horizontal wave force on porous plate for the convenience of comparing the results of cfd method and experiment the phase position of experimental results is adjusted to be consistent with cfd results and due to the space limitation only the results of ε 0 2 under partial wave conditions are listed it can be observed that for horizontal wave force the numerical results are nearly identical with experimental ones in period but in terms of amplitude large difference occurs in some wave conditions which will be further discussed and explained next fig 16 shows the wave surface elevations monitored by different wave probes under w5 the numerical results are nearly identical with experimental ones from the wave surface elevations in front of and behind the porous plate it can be learned that obvious transmission and reflection have occurred after the interaction between incident wave and porous plate for further analysis the transmission and reflection coefficients are introduced 22 k t h t h i 23 k r h r h i where k t and k r are transmission and reflection coefficients h t h r h i are transmission reflection and incident wave heights respectively for both cfd simulations and experiments the transmission wave heights can be obtained by the monitored wave surface elevations behind the plate in the meantime the wave surface elevations in front of the plate need to be decomposed for obtaining the incident and reflection wave heights a two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 is applied in this paper which requires the distance between two wave probes being the integer multiples of half wave length the three wave probes in front of the porous plate are 0 8 m 0 5 m and 1 3 m apart from each other which meets the requirement above for all wave conditions in this paper furthermore the analysis on three 2 probe combinations can help verify the decomposed wave components and make the results more reliable 4 1 effects of normalized wave number fig 17 shows the numerical and experimental amplitudes of horizontal wave force against normalized wave number k d with different porosity the numerical and experimental values are both normalized by the following equation 24 f x f x ρ g a b d k d tanh k d where f x is the amplitude values of horizontal wave force f x is the normalized values b 1 0 m is the width of porous plate it can be seen from fig 17 that the numerical values are in good agreement with experimental ones under high frequency waves with k d 1 30 whereas noticeable difference occurs under low frequency wave conditions with k d 1 30 the experimental values show obvious oscillations under low frequency waves which agrees with the difference observed in fig 15 under wave conditions w7 w9 and w11 and the oscillation degree decreases with the porosity increases as shown in fig 17 fig 18 shows the results of transmission and reflection coefficients against k d and similar difference between numerical and experimental values is observed as the results of wave force for further analyzing the difference above the results of mackay et al 2019 based on bem method are together compared as shown in figs 17 and 18 it can be obtained that the results of the cfd model established in this paper agree well with the results of mackay s model indicating that the cfd simulations are reliable and the experimental results may be not accuracy under low frequency wave conditions the possible reasons for the difference are discussed as follows first the experiments are not conducted on a flat seabed and the raised floor has effects on the incident waves of certain wave length which is not taken into consideration in the cfd simulations cfd simulations for comparison purpose are conducted under w9 and w11 which includes the raised floor shown in fig 4 and the results are presented in fig 19 it is found that the raised floor has an effect of decreasing the force amplitude which can be explained by the misalignment of the waves by the ramp such misalignment causes the vertical component of the force to increase and the horizontal one to decrease however the magnitude of the force decrease is very small so the raised floor cannot be mainly accounted for the difference between numerical and experimental results another explanation for the difference is that the experiment results under low frequency waves are affected by the secondary reflection waves the wave reflected by the porous plate will be reflected again by the wave making board which will be superimposed on the incident wave because of the phase difference between the secondary reflection wave and the incident wave the superimposed wave may be larger or smaller than the original incident wave thus causing the measured experimental values showing obvious oscillations and not agreeing with the true values for low frequency cases since the waves travel so fast and the distance between wave making board and porous plate is relatively short the secondary reflection waves would arrive at porous plate before the measured values become steady in the cfd simulations the influence of secondary reflected waves has been fully avoided by extending the length of nwt thus extending the wave propagation distance therefore the reason of oscillation under low frequency wave conditions of experimental results can be ensured as the secondary refection effect and the established numerical model is considered reliable for simulating the interaction between waves and a vertical porous plate it can be learned from fig 17 that for the same porous plate the horizontal wave force decreases gradually with the increasing normalized wave number k d and finally approaches a constant this indicates that for different k d values the sensitivities of wave force change are also different the wave force decreases rapidly when the normalized wave number increases at small values as the normalized wave number approaches larger values decreasing effect on wave force become minor it can also be observed that the range of k d in which the wave force decreases rapidly is also reduced with increased porosity the normalized wave numbers also have effects on reflection and transmission coefficients as can be learned from fig 17 for the same porous plate with increasing values of k d the reflection coefficient is on a decreasing trend and finally approaches a constant value while the transmission coefficient is on an opposite trend similar to the wave force at low normalized wave numbers and the changes become minor at high normalized wave numbers with the increased porosity the range of k d in which the reflection and transmission coefficients changing rapidly becomes smaller the porosity also has other impacts on the magnitudes of wave force and reflection and transmission coefficients which will be further discussed in section 4 3 the effects of normalized wave numbers can be explained as follows the horizontal wave force reflects the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces of porous plate as k d increases the flow velocity normal to the plate decreases which leads to the subsequent decrease in the pressure loss according to the pressure loss model hence the pressure difference decreases which results in a decreased horizontal wave force at the same time with the decrease of flow velocity more components of the incident wave are allowed to pass through the plate thus causing the increases in transmission coefficient and the decreases in reflection coefficient 4 2 effects of wave steepness fig 20 shows the effects of wave steepness on wave force the wave conditions being analyzed w5 and w14 17 with k d 1 30 are not influenced by the secondary reflection effects of tank tests and it can be seen that the numerical results agree well with experimental ones it can be learned from fig 20 that for the same porous plate with the increasing wave steepness the normalized wave force increases approximately linearly fig 21 shows the change in reflection and transmission coefficients against wave steepness it can be learned that for the same porous plate with the increasing wave steepness the reflection coefficient increases approximately linearly while the transmission coefficient changes in an opposite way the effects of wave steepness can be explained as follows for waves of the same wavelength the wave steepness reflects the characteristics of wave height according to potential flow theory the horizontal velocity of incident wave increases with the increasing of wave height and the pressure loss in porous plate thus becomes larger according to equation 17 causing the increase of wave force at the same time more components of the incident wave are reflected by the porous plate thus causing the increase of k r and decrease of k t 4 3 effects of porosity fig 22 shows the effects of porosity ε on horizontal wave force note that the numerical predicted wave force is in agreement with the measured values under the analyzed wave conditions and f x decreases with increasing ε figs 23 and 24 show the effects of porosity ε on the reflection and transmission coefficients it can be learned that with the enlarging porosity of porous plate the reflection coefficient gradually decreases while the transmission coefficient increases for the same wave condition the porous plate with large porosity will be applied on less wave force which is due to the smaller impact area from the larger porosity in the meantime more components of the incident wave are allowed to pass through the plate meaning that less wave components are reflected by the plate thus causing the increase in transmission coefficient and the decrease in reflection coefficient the pressure loss model has well simulated the macroscopic performance of the process above 5 conclusions for the investigation of wave interacting with a vertical porous plate this paper established a cfd numerical model which applied the macroscopic approach for modelling the porous plate by analysing the pressure loss of wave interacting with a vertical porous plate and adding it into the momentum equation as a source term the macroscopic simulation of the interaction between waves and a porous plate is implemented to validate the effectiveness of the numerical model a series of cfd simulations and corresponding tank tests are conducted by analysing the numerical and experimental results several conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the numerical results are consistent with experimental ones under high frequency wave conditions while large differences appear under low frequency waves it is believed that the tank tests under low frequency wave conditions are affected by the secondary reflection waves thus causing disagreement between the numerical and the experimental results the established cfd numerical model can fully avoid the such influence and therefore is believed to be reliable for engineering analysis purpose 2 by analysing the horizontal wave force and the reflection and transmission coefficients under different wave conditions general regularities of the variation of them with the normalized wave number and wave steepness are discussed for the same porous plate with the increase of k d the horizontal wave force decreases rapidly and then approaches to a constant value the reflection coefficient decreases gradually and approaches a constant value the transmission coefficient increases gradually and tends to be a constant value with the increase of k a from 0 05 to 0 20 the horizontal wave force increases the reflection coefficient increases and the transmission coefficient decreases all of which changes in an approximately linear fashion with k a 3 the porosity has great effects on the wave force and the reflection and transmission coefficients under the same wave condition larger the porosity leads to smaller horizontal wave force larger transmission coefficient and smaller reflection coefficient overall the established cfd numerical model is able to reliably simulate the wave interacting with a vertical porous plate it can accurately predict the wave force and reflection and transmission coefficients under different regular waves which is significant for

21302,the makran subduction located at the northwest of the indian ocean at the oman sea mouth has been and is the source of massive tsunamis that threatens the coasts of iran pakistan india and oman the initial tsunami wave produced by the magnitude and focal depth of makran submarine earthquake in 1945 is determined based on the okada algorithm 3d propagation of the generated mega wave in the indian ocean and oman sea is simulated by adopting openfoam open source cfd software in its global sense and verified vs the available data the wave characteristics are extracted from the global model

estimation of wave run up height and tsunami risk zone for practical engineering applications keywords tsunami makran subduction chabahar bay okada algorithm openfoam 1 introduction tsunamis mainly occur due to earthquakes at subduction zones and induce gigantic disturbances on ocean surface heidarzadeh et al 2011 after the tragic tsunamis of indian ocean near the coast of sumatra island indonesia in 2004 and pacific coast of tohoku japan in 2011 which took many lives about 250 000 dead and caused great economic damage many studies are run to advance knowledge of the experts of this field of science on the physics of the phenomena and improve the models to simulate the generation and propagation of the tsunami waves towards and the run up therein over coastlines okal et al 2008 grilli et al 2013 consequently it is crucial to improve the efficiency of the associated numerical models applied for predicting and estimating the tsunami run up and the resulting flooded zone makran subduction located at arabian sea the northwest of indian ocean at the mouth of oman sea and adjacent to the coasts of iran oman and pakistan is possibly the second source of massive tsunamis occurrence in indian ocean heidarzadeh et al 2009 the fault line is shaped by the impact of the arab and eurasian tectonic plates and extends approximately 900 km from the strait of hormuz to karachi port in pakistan the location of the main earthquakes originated from the makran subduction zone msz and the year of the occurrence are illustrated in fig 1 the major tsunami due to msz occurred in 1945 which left at least 4000 dead from pakistan india iran and oman the coordinate of subduction is 63 601 longitude and 24 927 latitude the tsunami occurred at 15 km focal depth and 8 1 richter magnitude ambraseys et al 1982 the threat of the tsunami due to msz to the iranian coast in the northern oman sea is quite perceptible particularly at the coasts of chabahar bay with high population concentration next to the port of chabahar located at the mouth of the bay has a strategic contribution in the regional economy development the location of the chabahar bay and the recorded major earthquakes in the region with magnitudes greater than 4 richter are shown in fig 2 the generation propagation and predicting the run up estimating the hazard zone and application of preventing measures of tsunami has been and is the theme of the recent studies this subject requires multi disciplinary approaches where seismologist and geologist to oceanographers and coastal engineers are involved in terms of tsunami wave generation by assuming a number of simplifying measures like a rectangular shape for the fault mansinha and smylie 1971 presented a numerical solution for the governing equations of the of the elastic homogeneous space deformation and sea bed shape deformation due to earthquake one of the most significant attempts made in predicting tsunami generation is made by okada 1985 where he presented an algorithm for calculating the 3d sea bed deformation due to earthquake with a specified magnitude and focal depth later in 1992 he presented an algorithm for calculating the internal displacements strains and tilts by solving the governing equations of elastic homogeneous space okada 1992 in his introduced algorithm the effect of equilibrium equations for motion of bed sheets on each other due to earthquake in the focal depth is of major concern and the displacement rate and motion angle of the plates on each other are specified wells and coppersmith 1994 collecting field data of many subductions and fitting the best mathematical relationship proposed equations to calculate the fault length width and displacement in terms of earthquake magnitude in terms of tsunami wave propagation solitary waves with infinite wavelength introduced by john scott russell 1834 is usually substituted with the tsunami wave there exist many numerical models calibrated and validated through experimental studies to simulate the solitary wave propagation and estimate run up synolakis 1987 hsiao et al 2010 zandi et al 2017 rafizadeh et al 2019 later the n wave was introduced as the better replication for tsunami tadepalli et al 1994 compared the solitary wave run up and corresponding n wave in an experimental and numerical manner where the maximum run up of some isosceles n wave and solitary wave with the same amplitude are measured and the results reveal that the maximum isosceles n wave run up is 1 4 times greater than solitary wave run up with the same amplitude recently many researches simulated real tsunamis heidarzadeh et al 2007 assessed the initial profile of the tsunami induced by 1945 makran subduction msz and the wave propagation in the indian ocean they simulated the tsunami propagation by adopting the tunami s w which solves the continuity and momentum equation by applying the shallow water approximations the results indicate that the tsunami generation risk from makran subduction zone can be of three main categories very little for earthquake with magnitudes up to 7 little to medium for earthquake with magnitudes within 7 and 7 5 and high for magnitudes greater than 7 5 okal and synolakis 2008 defined two worst case scenarios for the possible mega thrust earthquakes in the msz and assessed their far field effects across the indian ocean basin they simulated 3d propagation of tsunami wave in indian ocean for a number of scenarios of mega thrust earthquakes within probable to possible range ha et al 2009 simulated the tsunami propagation in the south china sea which potentially originated from a giant rupture along the manila trench tsunami run up height and arrival time of the major coasts are predicted through the tunami n2 nus model this model is improved version of the original tunami model where more phenomena like astronomic tide sea bottom friction dispersion coriolis force and spherical curvature are of concern the results indicate that the sunda shelf and the natuna islands may act as natural barriers sheltering southwest part of the south china sea and singapore strait grilli et al 2013 simulated generation and propagation of the near field and far field impact of the 2011 tohoku tsunami by applying the boussinesq type model the results indicate that dispersive effects are negligible in the near field due to the short propagation distances and coarse grid resolution while may account for 20 40 of tsunami amplitude in deep water thus the boussinesq model application is justified rasyif et al 2019 by applying comcot sed model simulated the tsunami wave propagation around banda aceh sumatra island indonesia where by coupling a hydrodynamic model with a sediment transport module the coastal morphological changes are assessed the cornell multigrid coupled tsunami model comcot which is based on the non linear shallow water equations nswe was coupled with the xbeach model to simulate the hydrodynamic processes and sediment transport in a simultaneously manner the coupled model is known as comcot sed the results of this study indicate that the results are consistent with the field data where the tsunami waves caused offshore erosion it is revealed that in these studies the physical phenomena are simplified either in the simulation of generated wave or in the applied assumptions for propagation the nswes which is the base of the conventional tsunami models are derived from the depth integrating navier stokes equations provided that the horizontal length scale is much greater than the vertical length scale under this circumstance mass conservation implies that the vertical velocity scale of the fluid is small compared to the horizontal velocity scale through the momentum equation it can be shown that the vertical pressure gradients are hydrostatic nswe is a good model for the propagation of tsunami throughout the open ocean away from shore when a vertical velocity term is not present in the shallow water equations this velocity is not necessarily zero close to the shore where the wave compresses horizontally and grows vertically and when waves experience abrupt depth change the 3d approach provides the advantage of taking into account the vertical velocity and the alteration of pressure from hydrostatic particularly for studies run on assessing the potential influences of introduced coastal barriers against tsunami wave run up the objective of this article is to adopt and couple the state of the art 3d models of tsunami wave generation and propagation for this purpose the msz is considered as the case study the initial tsunami wave is produced based on the okada algorithm in a 3d form the propagation of tsunami is simulated by the computational fluid dynamics package open field operation and manipulation openfoam the performance of openfoam s w in simulating free surface flow and the 3d propagation of a tsunami wave are already assessed and proved through comparison with extensive experimental data provided by higuera et al 2013 higuera et al 2014 honarmand et al 2018 in this study the precision of simulating the wave transmission is improved stage by stage begin from the global model indian ocean to the regional model chabahar bay town of teess and is applied in the engineering practices this article is structured as follows 3d numerical simulation of tsunami wave generation and propagation are described in secs 2 and 3 respectively the results and discussion are presented in sec 4 and the article findings are concluded in sec 5 2 3d numerical simulation of tsunami wave generation 2 1 okada algorithm the production and simulation of the wave generation are considered as the first attempts in the studies run on characteristics of a tsunami the most important cause of tsunami is earthquake at the ocean bed due to bed subduction and motion of the tectonic plates on each other because water is incompressible the deformation of the bed is transferred to the surface forming the tsunami wave which spreads in all directions from the generating zone the direction of the main energy propagation is generally orthogonal to the direction of the fault by applying okada s algorithm the deformation of each point at the ocean bed can be calculated in its 3d form the fault geometry and applied parameters in okada algorithm are shown in fig 3 where δ is the fault landslide angle θ is the angle between the fault displacement vector and the length of the fault failure plate and ϕ is the angle between the north and the fault direction based on the okada algorithm by specifying the earthquake magnitude m in richter scale and the focal depth c in kilometer length l width w fault deformation u and subsequently the vertical displacement of each point u z x y z on ocean bed is calculated wells and coppersmith 1994 the results of okada algorithm are verified through comparison with field data for a number of real ocean subductions the events applied in this study for the verification include portorico 1918 tsunami assessed by mercado and mccann 1998 mexico 1962 tsunami reported by ortiz et al 2000 mexico 1995 tsunami assessed by ortiz et al 2000 and the mega tsunami of 2004 in indonesia assessed by yalciner et al 2005 the results are tabulated in table 1 where the okada algorithm is promising method in estimating ocean bed uplift deformation with errors less than 9 2 2 modeling the initial wave shape of the 1945 makran tsunami to model the makran 1945 deformed seabed through okada algorithm the seismic parameters therein estimated by byrne et al 1992 as being the ocean bed is of 7 dip angle δ and 90 strike angle θ between the fault displacement vector and the failure plane length are applied the earthquake magnitude is 8 1 richter and the focal depth is 15 km by applying okada algorithm in mathematica s w the sea bed deformation is simulated which is considered as the initial tsunami wave profile the 3d seabed vertical deformation of 1945 makran subduction extracted from the model is presented in fig 4 page et al 1979 found that the maximum sea floor deformation of makran 1945 subduction was estimated at 2 m while according to this simulation the maximum positive vertical displacement is estimated at 1 714 m

x 34 6 m are shown in the figure the engineering practice on assessing teess inundation area and the affected flooded zone is further extended to the possible tsunami scenarios in terms of the possible lactation of subduction zone on makran fault line and the probable earthquake magnitude 5 conclusion historically more than 75 of worldwide tsunami events are generated by earthquakes the coastlines of oman sea at western indian ocean region are vulnerable to tsunami threats because they are located near active earthquake faults of makran subduction zone msz where the time of arrival for a tsunami can be very short in this study an advanced 3d numerical simulation package is proposed for predicting generation and propagation of tsunami the okada algorithm for generation of original n wave is combined with the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes solver ihfoam developed in openfoam s w for 3d propagation of the wave the approach is applied for 1945 makran tsunami at oman sea indian ocean this 3d simulation provides more accurate results than the conventional 2d models based on the shallow water assumptions and boussinesq type equations the extensive comparison with laboratory data and limited available field data indicates that the model is promising in predicting the run up to compromise between the accuracy and the time spent on 3d numerical modeling the simulation is run in three stages of global regional and local where coarse meshes of 1400 m 500 m size in global indian ocean and finer meshes of size of 25 m are applied in chabahr bay and very fine 2d mesh of 0 4 m is applied at and near the coastline the total simulation run time is recorded through a desktop computer cori7 is about 14 h which is quite reasonable the 16 difference of run up height at chabahar port between the results of the regional and global models indicates the sensitivity of the model to the bathymetry precision and the mesh size this 3d numerical package can be applied to the issues of tsunami propagation over different bottom geometries including the wave propagation over submerged obstacles because tsunamis originated from msz are the major threat for the southern coasts of iran pakistan india and northern coasts of oman further studies are required to assess the extent of hazard due to possible extreme scenarios in terms of location of subduction on the fault line and magnitude of earthquake and or on the effectiveness of artificial depleting structures credit authorship contribution statement masih honarmand simulation writing

21302,the makran subduction located at the northwest of the indian ocean at the oman sea mouth has been and is the source of massive tsunamis that threatens the coasts of iran pakistan india and oman the initial tsunami wave produced by the magnitude and focal depth of makran submarine earthquake in 1945 is determined based on the okada algorithm 3d propagation of the generated mega wave in the indian ocean and oman sea is simulated by adopting openfoam open source cfd software in its global sense and verified vs the available data the wave characteristics are extracted from the global model at the mouth of chabahar bay are inserted as the input in a regional model which consist of precise geometry and bathymetry of the bay and finer mesh size the wave run up is predicted at the main ports at the indian ocean and oman sea coastline the obtained results are implemented to assess the tsunami risk zone of teess beach town at chabahar bay coastline the advanced procedure applied in this research consists of the accurate production of the original tsunami and three stages of global and regional 3d and local 2d propagation simulation that provides reliable results in more accurate estimation of wave run up height and tsunami risk zone for practical engineering applications keywords tsunami makran subduction chabahar bay okada algorithm openfoam 1 introduction tsunamis mainly occur due to earthquakes at subduction zones and induce gigantic disturbances on ocean surface heidarzadeh et al 2011 after the tragic tsunamis of indian ocean near the coast of sumatra island indonesia in 2004 and pacific coast of tohoku japan in 2011 which took many lives about 250 000 dead and caused great economic damage many studies are run to advance knowledge of the experts of this field of science on the physics of the phenomena and improve the models to simulate the generation and propagation of the tsunami waves towards and the run up therein over coastlines okal et al 2008 grilli et al 2013 consequently it is crucial to improve the efficiency of the associated numerical models applied for predicting and estimating the tsunami run up and the resulting flooded zone makran subduction located at arabian sea the northwest of indian ocean at the mouth of oman sea and adjacent to the coasts of iran oman and pakistan is possibly the second source of massive tsunamis occurrence in indian ocean heidarzadeh et al 2009 the fault line is shaped by the impact of the arab and eurasian tectonic plates and extends approximately 900 km from the strait of hormuz to karachi port in pakistan the location of the main earthquakes originated from the makran subduction zone msz and the year of the occurrence are illustrated in fig 1 the major tsunami due to msz occurred in 1945 which left at least 4000 dead from pakistan india iran and oman the coordinate of subduction is 63 601 longitude and 24 927 latitude the tsunami occurred at 15 km focal depth and 8 1 richter magnitude ambraseys et al 1982 the threat of the tsunami due to msz to the iranian coast in the northern oman sea is quite perceptible particularly at the coasts of chabahar bay with high population concentration next to the port of chabahar located at the mouth of the bay has a strategic contribution in the regional economy development the location of the chabahar bay and the recorded major earthquakes in the region with magnitudes greater than 4 richter are shown in fig 2 the generation propagation and predicting the run up estimating the hazard zone and application of preventing measures of tsunami has been and is the theme of the recent studies this subject requires multi disciplinary approaches where seismologist and geologist to oceanographers and coastal engineers are involved in terms of tsunami wave generation by assuming a number of simplifying measures like a rectangular shape for the fault mansinha and smylie 1971 presented a numerical solution for the governing equations of the of the elastic homogeneous space deformation and sea bed shape deformation due to earthquake one of the most significant attempts made in predicting tsunami generation is made by okada 1985 where he presented an algorithm for calculating the 3d sea bed deformation due to earthquake with a specified magnitude and focal depth later in 1992 he presented an algorithm for calculating the internal displacements strains and tilts by solving the governing equations of elastic homogeneous space okada 1992 in his introduced algorithm the effect of equilibrium equations for motion of bed sheets on each other due to earthquake in the focal depth is of major concern and the displacement rate and motion angle of the plates on each other are specified wells and coppersmith 1994 collecting field data of many subductions and fitting the best mathematical relationship proposed equations to calculate the fault length width and displacement in terms of earthquake magnitude in terms of tsunami wave propagation solitary waves with infinite wavelength introduced by john scott russell 1834 is usually substituted with the tsunami wave there exist many numerical models calibrated and validated through experimental studies to simulate the solitary wave propagation and estimate run up synolakis 1987 hsiao et al 2010 zandi et al 2017 rafizadeh et al 2019 later the n wave was introduced as the better replication for tsunami tadepalli et al 1994 compared the solitary wave run up and corresponding n wave in an experimental and numerical manner where the maximum run up of some isosceles n wave and solitary wave with the same amplitude are measured and the results reveal that the maximum isosceles n wave run up is 1 4 times greater than solitary wave run up with the same amplitude recently many researches simulated real tsunamis heidarzadeh et al 2007 assessed the initial profile of the tsunami induced by 1945 makran subduction msz and the wave propagation in the indian ocean they simulated the tsunami propagation by adopting the tunami s w which solves the continuity and momentum equation by applying the shallow water approximations the results indicate that the tsunami generation risk from makran subduction zone can be of three main categories very little for earthquake with magnitudes up to 7 little to medium for earthquake with magnitudes within 7 and 7 5 and high for magnitudes greater than 7 5 okal and synolakis 2008 defined two worst case scenarios for the possible mega thrust earthquakes in the msz and assessed their far field effects across the indian ocean basin they simulated 3d propagation of tsunami wave in indian ocean for a number of scenarios of mega thrust earthquakes within probable to possible range ha et al 2009 simulated the tsunami propagation in the south china sea which potentially originated from a giant rupture along the manila trench tsunami run up height and arrival time of the major coasts are predicted through the tunami n2 nus model this model is improved version of the original tunami model where more phenomena like astronomic tide sea bottom friction dispersion coriolis force and spherical curvature are of concern the results indicate that the sunda shelf and the natuna islands may act as natural barriers sheltering southwest part of the south china sea and singapore strait grilli et al 2013 simulated generation and propagation of the near field and far field impact of the 2011 tohoku tsunami by applying the boussinesq type model the results indicate that dispersive effects are negligible in the near field due to the short propagation distances and coarse grid resolution while may account for 20 40 of tsunami amplitude in deep water thus the boussinesq model application is justified rasyif et al 2019 by applying comcot sed model simulated the tsunami wave propagation around banda aceh sumatra island indonesia where by coupling a hydrodynamic model with a sediment transport module the coastal morphological changes are assessed the cornell multigrid coupled tsunami model comcot which is based on the non linear shallow water equations nswe was coupled with the xbeach model to simulate the hydrodynamic processes and sediment transport in a simultaneously manner the coupled model is known as comcot sed the results of this study indicate that the results are consistent with the field data where the tsunami waves caused offshore erosion it is revealed that in these studies the physical phenomena are simplified either in the simulation of generated wave or in the applied assumptions for propagation the nswes which is the base of the conventional tsunami models are derived from the depth integrating navier stokes equations provided that the horizontal length scale is much greater than the vertical length scale under this circumstance mass conservation implies that the vertical velocity scale of the fluid is small compared to the horizontal velocity scale through the momentum equation it can be shown that the vertical pressure gradients are hydrostatic nswe is a good model for the propagation of tsunami throughout the open ocean away from shore when a vertical velocity term is not present in the shallow water equations this velocity is not necessarily zero close to the shore where the wave compresses horizontally and grows vertically and when waves experience abrupt depth change the 3d approach provides the advantage of taking into account the vertical velocity and the alteration of pressure from hydrostatic particularly for studies run on assessing the potential influences of introduced coastal barriers against tsunami wave run up the objective of this article is to adopt and couple the state of the art 3d models of tsunami wave generation and propagation for this purpose the msz is considered as the case study the initial tsunami wave is produced based on the okada algorithm in a 3d form the propagation of tsunami is simulated by the computational fluid dynamics package open field operation and manipulation openfoam the performance of openfoam s w in simulating free surface flow and the 3d propagation of a tsunami wave are already assessed and proved through comparison with extensive experimental data provided by higuera et al 2013 higuera et al 2014 honarmand et al 2018 in this study the precision of simulating the wave transmission is improved stage by stage begin from the global model indian ocean to the regional model chabahar bay town of teess and is applied in the engineering practices this article is structured as follows 3d numerical simulation of tsunami wave generation and propagation are described in secs 2 and 3 respectively the results and discussion are presented in sec 4 and the article findings are concluded in sec 5 2 3d numerical simulation of tsunami wave generation 2 1 okada algorithm the production and simulation of the wave generation are considered as the first attempts in the studies run on characteristics of a tsunami the most important cause of tsunami is earthquake at the ocean bed due to bed subduction and motion of the tectonic plates on each other because water is incompressible the deformation of the bed is transferred to the surface forming the tsunami wave which spreads in all directions from the generating zone the direction of the main energy propagation is generally orthogonal to the direction of the fault by applying okada s algorithm the deformation of each point at the ocean bed can be calculated in its 3d form the fault geometry and applied parameters in okada algorithm are shown in fig 3 where δ is the fault landslide angle θ is the angle between the fault displacement vector and the length of the fault failure plate and ϕ is the angle between the north and the fault direction based on the okada algorithm by specifying the earthquake magnitude m in richter scale and the focal depth c in kilometer length l width w fault deformation u and subsequently the vertical displacement of each point u z x y z on ocean bed is calculated wells and coppersmith 1994 the results of okada algorithm are verified through comparison with field data for a number of real ocean subductions the events applied in this study for the verification include portorico 1918 tsunami assessed by mercado and mccann 1998 mexico 1962 tsunami reported by ortiz et al 2000 mexico 1995 tsunami assessed by ortiz et al 2000 and the mega tsunami of 2004 in indonesia assessed by yalciner et al 2005 the results are tabulated in table 1 where the okada algorithm is promising method in estimating ocean bed uplift deformation with errors less than 9 2 2 modeling the initial wave shape of the 1945 makran tsunami to model the makran 1945 deformed seabed through okada algorithm the seismic parameters therein estimated by byrne et al 1992 as being the ocean bed is of 7 dip angle δ and 90 strike angle θ between the fault displacement vector and the failure plane length are applied the earthquake magnitude is 8 1 richter and the focal depth is 15 km by applying okada algorithm in mathematica s w the sea bed deformation is simulated which is considered as the initial tsunami wave profile the 3d seabed vertical deformation of 1945 makran subduction extracted from the model is presented in fig 4 page et al 1979 found that the maximum sea floor deformation of makran 1945 subduction was estimated at 2 m while according to this simulation the maximum positive vertical displacement is estimated at 1 714 m which is in reasonable agreement with the existing reports about the sea bed uplift of the 1945 event at 14 3 error the maximum negative vertical displacement is estimated at 1 453 m the maximum and minimum bed vertical deformation due to makran subduction along the fault line parallel and in orthogonal direction i e the direction of the propagation are shown in fig 5 in this study in simulating

town of teess at the northern coast of chabahar fig 14 the slope varies within 0 4 1 5 range from deep water to coastline and above respectively along section a a fig 14 to predict the probable effects of 1945 makran tsunami on teess coasts the 2d openfoam model with very fine mesh and accurate bathymetry is applied for this purpose the free surface oscillation time series η at 4 m depth is extracted from the 3d regional model fig 15 and inserted as the input in the 2d model for the 2d numerical simulation 2500 and 300 meshes are considered in x and z directions respectively the beach cross section at teess beach town and the result of the model in terms of the tsunami undulation is shown in fig 16 where the maximum wave run up r 0 72 m and the maximum horizontal incursion of flood x 34 6 m are shown in the figure the engineering practice on assessing teess inundation area and the affected flooded zone is further extended to the possible tsunami scenarios in terms of the possible lactation of subduction zone on makran fault line and the probable earthquake magnitude 5 conclusion historically more than 75 of worldwide tsunami events are generated by earthquakes the coastlines of oman sea at western indian ocean region are vulnerable to tsunami threats because they are located near active earthquake faults of makran subduction zone msz where the time of arrival for a tsunami can be very short in this study an advanced 3d numerical simulation package is proposed for predicting generation and propagation of tsunami the okada algorithm for generation of original n wave is combined with the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes solver ihfoam developed in openfoam s w for 3d propagation of the wave the approach is applied for 1945 makran tsunami at oman sea indian ocean this 3d simulation provides more accurate results than the conventional 2d models based on the shallow water assumptions and boussinesq type equations the extensive comparison with laboratory data and limited available field data indicates that the model is promising in predicting the run up to compromise between the accuracy and the time spent on 3d numerical modeling the simulation is run in three stages of global regional and local where coarse meshes of 1400 m 500 m size in global indian ocean and finer meshes of size of 25 m are applied in chabahr bay and very fine 2d mesh of 0 4 m is applied at and near the coastline the total simulation run time is recorded through a desktop computer cori7 is about 14 h which is quite reasonable the 16 difference of run up height at chabahar port between the results of the regional and global models indicates the sensitivity of the model to the bathymetry precision and the mesh size this 3d numerical package can be applied to the issues of tsunami propagation over different bottom geometries including the wave propagation over submerged obstacles because tsunamis originated from msz are the major threat for the southern coasts of iran pakistan india and northern coasts of oman further studies are required to assess the extent of hazard due to possible extreme scenarios in terms of location of subduction on the fault line and magnitude of earthquake and or on the effectiveness of artificial depleting structures credit authorship contribution statement masih honarmand simulation writing

21303,with the continuous development of nuclear power application the structural design and verification of pressure resistant cabin has become the key technology for nuclear powered ships or nuclear powered icebreakers through the design of reinforced pressure resistant structure the ultimate strength of the pressure resistant cabin was investigated by experimental analysis and nonlinear finite element analysis moreover the load displacement curve of the cabin structure and the progressive failure mode were obtained through the numerical analysis of the full scale model based on the similarity criterion the corresponding scale models were designed and tested compared with the numerical results of the scale model it is found that the failure mode in the tests are consistent with that in the numerical analysis for the cabin structure of nuclear powered ship especially the prismatic pressure vessel the corner is the key location for stress concentration in order to comprehensively improve the bearing capacity and weight reduction of the cabin structure the diagonally stiffened optimization model is proposed and further verified numerically keywords nuclear power ship pressure resistant structure ultimate strength scale model test nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction considering the upgrading of the marine economy and exploring ways to solve the energy problem floating nuclear power plants ofnp emerged at the historic moment chu et al 2012 shropshire et al 2012 hirdaris et al 2014 rowinskia et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 this small mobile nuclear power plant will install a scaled down version of the onshore nuclear power plant on a ship which can not only provide safe and effective energy supply for remote islands but also provide electricity heat and fresh water resources for offshore oil and gas exploration platforms operating in the ocean lee et al 2013 2015 the power station can be pulled over at any time when there is a demand for useful electricity and pulled away by boat when it is not needed by combining nuclear reactors with floating platforms floating nuclear power plants can realize the convenience and economy of nuclear energy export as early as 1963 u s martin marietta company designed a marine mh 1a nuclear power plant for the u s military to supply power to the power starved panama canal area mh 1a worked from 1968 to 1975 and was later retired due to high operating costs and the termination of the military reactor program in 2019 the russian atomic energy company built the floating nuclear power plant romanosov to supply power for the development of oil and gas fields in some remote areas in russia s far east or arctic region the designed platform was equipped with two klt 40 nuclear reactors which could provide 70 mw of electricity and 300 mw of thermal power thus ensuring the supply of electricity and hot water for a city with a population of 200 000 zhao et al 2019 however the leakage of nuclear energy will cause nuclear radiation to personnel and nuclear pollution to the surrounding environment if a floating nuclear power ship leaks out nuclear waste will flow into the sea with a wider spread therefore floating nuclear power vessels on the sea need safe and reliable protective cabins to protect nuclear reactors and effectively seal up nuclear energy in case of leakage when a nuclear reactor leaks high pressure gas will be generated the protection chamber should be able to resist sudden high pressure vapor so the protection chamber needs to have pressure bearing capacity pressure bearing cabin of nuclear reactor is one of the important cabins of nuclear power generation ship its structural integrity is very important for the safe operation of the whole nuclear power generation ship therefore it is necessary to study the bearing capacity of the pressure bearing cabin structure the pressure bearing cabin of a nuclear reactor mainly bears internal pressure and its characteristics are similar to those of them pressure vessel pressure bearing structures have been used in industry for a long time with the vigorous development of modern industry pressure vessels are widely used in chemical petroleum nuclear and other industrial production sectors considering the complex structure of the pressure vessel the research on the bearing capacity of the pressure vessel mainly focuses on numerical simulation and experimental research zeng et al 1990 1997 carried out stress analysis and formula revision on rectangular pressure vessels with thin walled stiffeners and compared with the recommended formula and numerical results of american society of mechanical engineers asme to verify the accuracy of the formula mukaimachi et al 2009 used nonlinear finite element method to study cylindrical pressure vessels with local thin areas caused by corrosion and proposed a modified method for evaluating plastic collapse of pressure vessels choi et al 2015 2020 took a prismatic fuel tank of a liquefied natural gas ship lng as the research object analyzed the strength of the fuel tank under design load and test steam load and carried out the ultimate strength dynamic acceleration buckling and thermal fatigue analysis lee et al 2017 based on the traditional cylindrical pressure vessel designed a non reinforced prismatic pressure vessel with plane as the main body and compared the carrying capacity with the traditional cylindrical structure sun et al 2018 studied the bearing capacity of the radial support key of the reactor and carried out static load test using a scale model to determine the bearing capacity of the reactor blachut et al 2017 studied the initial yield pressure and burst pressure of conical shell pressure vessel by combining numerical simulation with experimental method and put forward a standard for structural integrity damage nebe et al 2019 studied the structural deformation of type iv pressure vessel under internal pressure through experimental method according to the structural quality blasting pressure and failure type used the overall structural deformation was compared with the numerical simulation to verify the effectiveness of the simulation meanwhile the control of the manufacturing and fabrication process to maintain high fracture toughness remains a challenge for the pressure vessel industry cracking is one common case which occurs mainly in the weld joints of pressure vessels steels chen et al 2003 therefore for pressurized welded vessels weld failure is one of the inevitable failure forms in recent twenty years a number of cracking cases were reported on the in service pressure vessels based on field survey actual vessel inspection and failure analysis it is pointed out that the quality of the steels the problems existing in design and fabrication process and incompleteness of relevant standards are the major cause of cracking chen et al 2007 during the reported period between 2001 and 2008 the statistics show that the rate of accidents that were directly linked to pressure vessels is not yet on the decline ladokun et al 2010 therefore attention must be paid to the possibility of weld failure in the ultimate failure analysis of large welded structures lei et al 2014 at present there is little research on the bearing capacity of the pressure bearing cabin for nuclear powered ships especially the lack of relevant experimental research the reasonable design of pressure bearing cabin for nuclear powered ships has become a key index to ensure structural safety therefore this paper takes the nuclear reactor pressure bearing cabin of a small nuclear power generation ship as the research object carries out a series of structural design and ultimate strength tests of scale models and quantitatively analyzes the ultimate bearing capacity of the pressure bearing cabin in combination with numerical results the relevant evaluation will provide reference for the structural design of nuclear powered ships 2 numerical analysis 2 1 geometric model and material properties the pressure bearing cabin structure for nuclear reactors of power generation ships is mainly composed of shells and t shaped stiffeners as shown in fig 2 the net size of the cabin is 8000 mm 8000 mm 8000 mm the outer part of the cabin is provided with orthogonal t shaped reinforcements with a spacing of 1000 mm the design thickness of the shell plate is 30 mm and the dimension of stiffener is taken as t 600 22 200 24 inclined toggle plates with a width of 1414 2 mm are used for transition at the corner in fig 2 as shown in fig 3 in order to further study the material characteristics of the pressure resistant structure model the tensile tests of related welded structures and parent metal samples were carried out separately by drawing the stress strain curves in fig 4 it can be concluded that the change trend of tensile characteristic curve of welded specimen is almost consistent with the result of base metal structure in detail the curves of three welded specimens are almost identical in elastic stage yield stage and strengthening stage but slightly different in failure stage for the base material structures the tensile characteristic curves of the three samples almost coincide completely in order to reduce the evaluation error of subsequent numerical calculation the average value of yield strength and tensile limit of base metal was taken for calculation as shown in table 1 2 2 fe model s4r element was used for simulation of all the plates and stiffened plates s4r element is a four node curved shell element with good adaptability to thickness which can be used for accurate analysis of thin shell structures meanwhile a general purpose software hypermesh was used for mesh division as shown in fig 5 a and b the internal pressure load was applied to the inside of the shell with uniform pressure as shown in fig 5c according to the material characteristic curves in fig 4b the ideal elastic plastic model was used for numerical analysis and the large deformation effect will be considered in the calculation considering that the pressure bearing cabin is an independent structure the inertial release method was used as the boundary condition in the calculation inertial release is an advanced application in abaqus software which uses inertial force of structure to balance external force when the inertia release function is used for static analysis only six degrees of freedom are required for one node virtual support firstly taking the virtual support as the reference point the program calculates the acceleration of each node in each direction under the action of external force and then converts the acceleration into inertial force and applies it to each node in reverse thus constructing a balanced force system considering that the mesh size has great influence on the calculation results generally speaking the finer the mesh is the higher the accuracy is however the calculation time required by the very fine mesh model is too long resulting in low calculation efficiency in order to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the results it is necessary to consider both convergence and computational efficiency to obtain a reasonable mesh size convergence analysis was carried out in fig 6 taking the center of the top shell plate as the reference point the load displacement curves under different mesh sizes were drawn in fig 6 the load displacement curves of 5 mesh sizes are in good agreement in the elastic stage however in the yield stage with the decrease of mesh size the variation trend of nonlinear curve gradually tends to be stable in order to ensure the calculation accuracy the mesh size of calculation model is taken as 200 mm 2 3 static strength analysis in order to clarify the stress distribution characteristics of the pressure resistant structure and guide the model test later the related calculation and stress results of the actual model under working load were systematically compared in the first considering the design pressure of the pressure bearing cabin is 0 8 mpa the stress response results and deformation laws were analyzed at p 0 8 mpa as shown in fig 7 a and b the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are both located at the corner of the inclined plate and the maximum stress is 191 mpa and 151 mpa respectively the maximum von mises stress of t shaped stiffener is located at the center with the value of 252 mpa see fig 7c as to deformation the maximum deformation area of the model is located in the center of the plate frame and decreases to all sides the deformation trend of the external reinforcement is basically the same as that of the inner shell the maximum deformation of the shell is 10 9 mm and the value of the t shaped stiffener is 9 5 mm see fig 7d and e the external ribs play a better supporting role for the shell it can be seen that the maximum stress of the structure under design load p 0 8 mpa is less than the yield stress of the material in order to further analyze the stress distribution law on the shell and stiffeners a series of reference points on the medium longitudinal section were extracted for stress analysis in figs 8 11 due to the large difference between the internal and external nodal stresses of the shell 17 nodal stresses on the internal and external surfaces are plotted and compared respectively as shown in figs 8 and 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the von mises stress of bracket at the corner is greater than that in the middle part the stress distribution on the outer surface of the element at the joint between the stiffener and the shell plate is relatively average which is less than the stress at the center of the plate however there is obvious stress concentration at the junction of the ends for inner surface nodes similarly the stress extraction points and stress distribution of the reinforcement panel are compared in fig 10 generally speaking the von mises stress near the corners of both ends is relatively small and much smaller than the stress in the middle for the web of stiffener in fig 11 the stress of the top nodes are larger at both ends and smaller in mid span while the top nodes have the opposite change rule it can be seen that under the action of internal pressure load the top of the web plate of the mid span reinforcement will bear more tensile stress by understanding the change law of stress at key points the corresponding law can be used to guide the ultimate strength analysis and model test monitoring 2 4 local stress field analysis it can be seen from the above stress distribution in fig 9 that the local stress at the corner has obvious stress concentration phenomenon in order to discuss the influence of local mesh on stress distribution the mesh at the corner was further refined for relevant calculation and comparison in fig 12 as shown in fig 12a the mesh at the corner is further refined to 100 mm and the stress distribution results on the top shell reinforcement panel and reinforcement web are compared in figs 12b e respectively from the comparison results the refinement of the local corner will cause the local stress on the shell to increase further but it will not change the stress distribution in the middle see fig 12b and c moreover the local mesh has little influence on the stress on the stiffener see fig 12d and e considering that the key point of local instability is located at the middle point of top shell and the local mesh has little influence on the stress results in the middle of the shell in order to reduce the amount of calculation the following related calculations will be carried out according to the unified mesh of global convergence analysis in fig 6 3 model test through a series of comparison of stress distribution results above it is found that in the middle area with the greatest deformation the stiffened panel and web bear greater stress concentration which is the key position of structural ultimate failure in addition the corner position of the cabin is also the most concentrated position of stress the corresponding conclusions can be used to guide the arrangement of strain measuring points and the observation of test failure the ultimate strength of pressure resistant structures can be improved to the maximum extent by reasonably designing reinforcement forms and strengthening corner areas 3 1 scale model design in order to obtain the actual bearing capacity and mechanical characteristics of the pressure bearing cabin structure it is necessary to further carry out the ultimate bearing capacity test of the scale model according to the actual pressure bearing cabin structure the test model was designed according to the scale ratio of 1 10 according to the characteristics of internal pressure model similarity analysis was carried out by dimensional analysis method the general functional expression describing the deformation mechanism of the internal pressure model can be expressed as 1 f m f e μ a i σ l 0 where m is the representative quantity of bending moment or torque and its dimension is fl f represents the force with the dimension pl 2 e is the elasticity modulus with the dimension fl 2 a is the sectional area of the structure and its dimension is l 2 i represents the moment of inertia of the section with the dimension l 4 σ is the result of stress with the dimension fl 2 μ and l represent poisson s ratio and length separately if l n and l m are respectively expressed as the feature lengths of prototype and model when the geometry is similar 2 c l l n l m c a a n a m l n l m 2 c l 2 c v v n v m l n l m 3 c l 3 where c l c a and c v represent the length ratio area ratio and volume ratio of the prototype and model respectively similarly the load relationship needs to be satisfied 3 c f f n f m p n a n p m a m p n p m c l 2 c m m n m m f n l n f m l m p n p m c l 3 where c f and c m are the force ratio and bending moment ratio between the prototype and model respectively if the model pressure p n is equal to the actual structural pressure p m eq 3 can be simplified as 4 c f c l 2 c m c l 3 as for other relevant parameters 5 c w w n w m l n 3 l m 3 c l 3 c i i n i m l n 4 l m 4 c l 4 where c w and c i represent the ratio of section modulus and the ratio of moment of inertia between the prototype and model respectively for the basic physical quantities describing the characteristics of structural materials the ratios of elastic modulus c e shear modulus c g and poisson s ratio c μ are all taken as 1 6 c e e s e m 1 c g g s g m 1 c μ μ s μ m 1 after similar model design the dimensions of the test model are designed in table 2 the stiffener size of the scaled model is t 60 2 2 20 2 4 considering the inconvenience of processing the t shaped stiffener is changed to 60 3 according to the principle of equal cross sectional area meanwhile considering that it is difficult to realize the double sided welding process for all shell plates one side of the shell plates will adopt the single sided welding during assembly in order to make up for the shortage caused by single sided welding the thickness of the shell plate with single sided welding was adjusted to 5 mm the adjusted pressure bearing cabin model is shown in fig 13 a considering the actual welding process the scaled model was also designed and manufactured with q345 steel fig 13b after the model was processed the ultimate bearing capacity and failure mode of the model were tested by continuously applying water pressure 3 2 loading process water injection holes and exhaust holes were arranged on the shell plate and fixed by bolts to ensure firmness and sealing as shown in fig 14 the water pressure was driven by the water injection pipe see fig 15 a and the pipe was controlled and adjusted by setting a valve the working pressure of the electric pressure test pump is 60 mpa the flow rate is 1 l min and the motor power is 1 5 kw the applied load can be directly displayed by the pressure gauge see fig 15a the measuring range of the pressure gauge is 10 mpa with an accuracy of 0 4 before the test mark points were pasted on the surface of the model and the model was scanned by gscan handheld 3d scanner to obtain the displacement nephogram in the initial state of the model see fig 15b after the test the test model was scanned again to obtain the displacement nephogram after ultimate failure during the test the preloaded test shall be conducted first the water pressure slowly rises to 0 2 mpa after confirming that there is no leakage the water pressure rises to 0 5 mpa for 30 min during loading all welds and connection parts are inspected in real time to ensure the normal operation of the water pump pressure gauge pressure sensor control valve and acquisition instrument 3 3 arrangement of measuring points 3 3 1 strain measuring points strain measuring points were all arranged with tj120 4aa three dimensional strain rosettes suitable for underwater measurement according to the structural characteristics of the test model and the results of finite element stress analysis the layout of measuring points was formed as shown in fig 16 the k series measuring points are arranged at the key positions of the shell plate while the l series measuring points are arranged on the web plates of the reinforcing ribs 3 3 2 displacement measuring points hks a 100 qy10 high precision millisecond rope displacement sensor was adopted in the test with a measuring range of 1 m and an accuracy of 0 01 as shown in fig 17 a five points on dhae surface and hgef surface were selected as displacement monitoring points u2 and u4 are measuring points on the shell and u1 u3 and u5 are measuring points on the stiffeners see fig 17b and c 3 4 analysis of measurement results 3 4 1 experimental phenomenon in the process of measuring the ultimate bearing capacity of the square cabin test model the electric pressure test pump slowly increases the pressure by controlling the water pressure when the load was applied to 1 7 mpa the uplift deformation at the center of the model shell bulged and deformed gradually see fig 18 a and the stiffeners at the corners began to shift locally see fig 18b meanwhile some welds made noises due to stretching when the pressure reached 2 7 mpa the crack of the weld seam in the corner began to appear accompanied by the sound of grinning water spray mist the model began to relieve pressure as shown in fig 18c 3 4 2 load displacement curve the deformation value and pressure value of each measuring point were extracted to draw the corresponding load displacement curves as shown in fig 19 as can be seen from fig 19 when the pressure load is below 1 25 mpa the load displacement curve of each measuring point shows a linear relationship which indicates that the test model is in the elastic deformation stage at this time when the pressure exceeds 1 25 mpa the slope of the load displacement curve begins to decrease which indicates that the stiffness of the test model material gradually decreases and the structure enters the plastic deformation stage 3 4 3 stress results according to the stress results measured by strain rosettes von mises stress at each measuring point was calculated and compared in fig 20 as can be seen from fig 20 the load stress curve of each measuring point has good linearity which verifies the reliability of the test loading process from the comparison results it can be seen that the stress in the center area of the shell and the stiffeners is relatively large and shows a decreasing trend toward the periphery moreover there is obvious stress concentration at the corners and the corner regions will enter the plastic stage at the earliest 3 5 result comparison and analysis 3 5 1 comparison of stress results in order to further verify the reliability of the test model the results of numerical simulation were used for comparison in fig 21 as can be seen from the figure the error between the test value and the simulation value at each measuring point is small and the stress trend is basically consistent which verifies the reliability of numerical analysis above 3 5 2 comparison of deformation results the abaqus software was used to extract the deformation values of each measuring point under the internal pressure load of 0 8 mpa as shown in fig 22 under the action of internal pressure the surrounding shells and stiffeners took on the shape of protruding outward the deformation values measured by sensors on both sides of the model were also compared with the numerical simulation results in fig 23 and table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that the numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the test results as a whole the maximum displacement of the measuring point is only 1 3 mm under design load p 0 8 mpa with the further increase of water pressure the shelter structure gradually enters the yield stage accompanied by larger plastic deformation as shown in fig 24 when the pressure is 2 7 mpa in addition to the large deformation in the middle of the shell there is also a large local deformation in the stiffener web at the corner comparing the monitoring displacements of the shell plates on the left and right sides it is found that the deformation on the 5 mm side is slightly smaller than that on the 3 mm side but shows good symmetry see fig 25 compared with the numerical results in table 4 the maximum deformation error is 5 9 mm and the numerical results are consistent with the displacement curves obtained by experiments after the test a 3d scanner was used to scan the top of the model and the displacement obtained by scanning was compared with the finite element results in fig 26 the results show that the deformation mode obtained by numerical calculation is basically consistent with the scanning results 4 results and discussions the above analysis shows that the numerical model results are in good agreement with the model test results which verifies the feasibility of the numerical method in order to further compare the gradual failure process of the actual pressure vessel and the scaled model the ultimate strength calculation of the two models was further analyzed and compared 4 1 ultimate strength of actual structure the ultimate strength of the actual pressure bearing cabin was calculated and analyzed in fig 27 the center point o of the top shell plate is taken as the displacement monitoring point and the obtained load displacement curve is shown in fig 27 point a is the pressure at the point when the pressure bearing structure begins to enter plasticity and the pressure value is 1 2 mpa extrapolating the curves of elastic stage and plastic stage to get the initial yield point b see fig 27 ob segment belongs to the elastic stage the pressure in the pressure bearing square cabin is proportional to the displacement and the displacement is linear with the pressure load bc section belongs to plastic stage and the relationship between pressure load and displacement is nonlinear the pressure value corresponding to point b is 1 9 mpa which defined as the initial yield pressure as the internal pressure continues to increase the yield area of the structure gradually increases the pressure corresponding to point c is the maximum pressure that the pressure bearing cabin can bear which is called plastic collapse pressure 4 1 1 stress analysis at the stage a from the initial load to point a the load displacement curve changes linearly and both the whole structure and local components are in the elastic stage as shown in fig 28 the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are both located at the corner of the inclined plate and the maximum stress is 281 mpa and 227 mpa respectively however the maximum stress point of the reinforcement ribs reaches 345 mpa and begins to enter the yield stage 4 1 2 stress analysis at the stage b from stage a to stage b the yield area on the stiffeners gradually extends to the shell plate for the shell plates the earliest yielding position is located at the toggle plates near the corner and other areas have not yet yielded as shown in fig 29 the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are 345 mpa and 358 mpa respectively 4 1 3 stress analysis at the stage c with the further increase of pressure the yield area of the cabin structure gradually expands to the whole structure and the corresponding limit load is 4 4 mpa see figs 27 and 30 the maximum deformation under ultimate load is located at the center of the shell plate with a value of 770 1 mm 770 1 mm is the vertical displacement and 958 1 mm in fig 30b is the total displacement considering the possibility of welding failure at the corner the fracture judgment of the actual structure can be simply based on the plastic strain at the time of fracture in the material test the tensile test of q345 material shows that the plastic strain at fracture is 0 2 see fig 4b if the plastic strain is selected to be 0 2 as the strain when the material breaks the fracture type can be obtained in fig 31 a as shown in fig 31 it can be found that under the action of ultimate load the transition position between the toggle plate and the shell is torn at the earliest in addition the plastic strain in the middle part of the reinforcement is relatively large and the reinforcement panel is about to tear 4 2 ultimate strength of scale model similarly the ultimate strength of the test scale model was also calculated and analyzed in fig 32 with the center point o of the top shell plate as the displacement monitoring point the obtained load displacement curve is shown in fig 32 the value of pressure at point a is 1 0 mpa and the corresponding pressure at point b is 1 6 mpa the load value of limit point c reaches 4 1 mpa as shown in fig 33 the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are both located at the corner of the inclined plate and the maximum stress is 247 mpa and 219 mpa respectively similarly the local point stress on the stiffener exceeds 345 mpa and begins to enter the yield stage from stage a to stage b the yield area on the stiffeners gradually extends to the shell plate for the shell plates the earliest yielding position is located at the toggle plates near the corner and other areas have not yet yielded the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are 345 mpa and 374 mpa respectively in fig 34 with the further increase of pressure the yield area of the cabin structure gradually expands to the whole structure and the corresponding limit load is 4 1 mpa see figs 32 and 35 the maximum deformation under ultimate load is located at the center of the shell plate with a value of 86 1 mm considering the possibility of welding failure at the corner the strain results of the scaled model were extracted with the critical strain value of fracture 0 2 as shown in fig 36 it can be found that under the action of ultimate load the transition position between the toggle plate and the shell is torn at the earliest it is concluded that the corner position of the cabin is the most easily damaged position for ultimate strength which is consistent with the test results 4 3 comparison of ultimate bearing capacity taking the measuring point u2 at the center of the shell plate as the displacement monitoring point the numerical simulation load displacement curves of the actual scale structure and the test scale model were extracted and compared with the test results in fig 37 1 as far as the results of the numerical model are concerned the ultimate bearing capacity of the real scale model prototype is higher than that of the scale model of test it can be known that the results obtained by the scale model evaluation in the project are relatively safe which is beneficial to the safety evaluation of the project structure 2 the experimental initial yield strength of the cabin model is 1 5 mpa while the numerical simulation results of the actual structure and the experimental model are 1 9 mpa and 1 6 mpa respectively for the scale model the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results which verifies the effectiveness of the numerical model 3 the ultimate load obtained from the model test is 2 7 mpa in the test the weld crack appears at the stress concentration position at the corner resulting in strength failure however the ultimate strength obtained by the numerical model is as high as 4 1 mpa which indicates that the numerical model does not consider the influence of weld on the ultimate strength and the ultimate failure of the model is the buckling of the plate 5 optimization analysis considering that offshore nuclear power vessels need to be flexible the layout of pressure shelter should be designed with reasonable component distribution and weight control according to the results of model test and numerical simulation the pressure vessel made of q345 steel has high overall strength and has a large safety margin under the working load of 0 8 mpa while the inclined plate corners in the shelter structure are relatively weak in view of the characteristics of the original structure design the prototype of the pressure vessel was taken as the object and the structural rationality of the actual model was improved on the premise of keeping the external dimensions of the structural shell unchanged the stress size stress distribution displacement size and structural weight of the actual engineering structure were comprehensively considered to optimize the design of the actual model and the optistruct module of cae software altair hyperworks was used for topology optimization and size optimization design of pressure shelter 5 1 topology optimization of stiffener layout there are many ways to arrange the stiffeners on the outer surface of pressure vessels among which the most common ones are vertical and horizontal orthogonal distribution and oblique cross distribution in this paper the topology optimization of shell reinforcement layout was carried out by variable density method and the optimal reinforcement layout was sought according to the equivalent stiffness theory the bending stiffness of stiffened plate structure can be obtained by superimposing the bending stiffness of stiffeners and the bending stiffness of base plate see fig 38 a so that the equivalent stiffness plate structure with uniform thickness can be obtained therefore the optimization of stiffened plate layout can be regarded as the optimization of the layout of strong material and weak material of thin plate see fig 38b the variable density method was used to optimize the topology of the pressure vessel shell as shown in fig 39 inertial release was used to constrain the shell and the internal pressure load was 0 8 mpa the ratio of stiffener distribution area to the total area of shell plate and the strain energy of shell plate structure are taken as the optimization response and the constraint condition is to limit the stiffener distribution area to 5 15 of the total area of shell plate the optimal stiffener layout is found with the minimum strain energy i e the maximum stiffness as the optimization objective after optimization the density of stiffened element of shell plate is shown in fig 39a and the result of stiffened optimization is shown in fig 39b under the action of the internal pressure load of 0 8 mpa the stiffeners are distributed orthogonally on the whole and the density of stiffeners is high in the center of the shell plate and the middle of the inclined plate corner so it is necessary to arrange forced stiffeners in this area the optimized structure is defined as a diagonally stiffened model in fig 39b 5 2 component size optimization in the process of weight reduction this paper adopts the size optimization module of optistruct taking the thickness of shell and stiffener as optimization parameters and the allowable stress of structure as limiting condition so as to minimize the weight after the optimization results are obtained the structure design is further verified and improved to achieve the goal of lightweight design in order to compare the feasibility of the optimized structure comprehensively the prototype structure see fig 5a and the diagonally reinforced structure see fig 39b are optimized respectively in fig 40 comparing the static strength of the two size optimization schemes under design load p 0 8 mpa with the prototype the optimized component thickness and maximum stress calculation results of each scheme are shown in tables 5 and 6 according to the stress results in table 6 the two size optimization schemes are close to each other both of which are less than the allowable stress under the design load of 0 8 mpa the structure can operate safely on the premise of meeting the safety requirements the optimized total weight is reduced by 16 4 and 17 5 respectively which achieves the purpose of weight reduction from the point of view of deformation the maximum deformation of the shell in the diagonally stiffened optimization scheme is reduced from 10 9 mm to 8 2 mm which is 24 7 lower than that of the prototype indicating that the stiffness of the improved scheme is higher taking the center point of the top shell plate as the reference point the load displacement curves of the two optimization schemes are redrawn and compared with the prototype results as shown in fig 41 from the load displacement curves it can be found that the initial yield pressure of the prototype topology optimization model is 1 8 mpa and that of the diagonally stiffened scheme is 2 mpa and the ultimate bearing capacity of the two schemes is equivalent under the condition of weight reduction the ultimate bearing capacity is slightly lower than that of the prototype the ultimate bearing capacity of the two optimization models reached 3 7 mpa under the action of ultimate load the prototype topology optimization model tears at the corner joint between shell plate and inclined plate see fig 42 a which is similar to the failure mode of prototype however for the diagonally stiffened optimization model under the action of ultimate load the stiffeners on the four sides of the shell plates are broken and the corner of the shell plate is torn see fig 42b thus losing the bearing capacity comparing the two optimization schemes comprehensively the strength stiffness and initial yield strength of the diagonally stiffened optimization scheme are superior to those of prototype topology optimization scheme and their ultimate bearing capacity is equivalent this diagonally stiffened optimization scheme provides a reference for the design of pressure cabin for nuclear power ships in future 6 conclusions through the experimental study and numerical analysis of the ultimate bearing capacity of the pressure bearing cabin the failure process of the pressure bearing cabin under internal pressure load is presented the relevant failure rules are summarized and a more suitable diagonally stiffened optimization model is proposed 1 through the analysis of the ultimate failure process and stress field distribution of the pressure resistant structure in simulation it is found that the corner position and the stiffener at the maximum deformation of the cabin are the main places where stress concentration and ultimate strength fail the ultimate strength of pressure resistant structures can be improved to the maximum extent by reasonably designing reinforcement forms and strengthening corner areas 2 through the scale model design and ultimate strength test the failure process of the pressure bearing cabin under internal pressure load is obtained under the action of ultimate load the transition position between the inclined toggl plate and the shell plate are torn thus losing the bearing capacity the corresponding numerical analysis show that the test and the numerical simulation are in good agreement with each other in the key indexes such as initial stiffness deformation and stress field 3 it is worth emphasizing that the stress concentration at the corner position is aggravated by the crack initiation at the welding position which will weaken the ultimate strength of the pressure resistant structure meanwhile for an actual pressure vessel the internal pressure often generates a bi axial stress condition which often leads to a lower fracture resistance than the same material under uniaxial loading therefore the fracture failure of the cabin under complex stress state requires further investigation 4 after shape layout and component size optimization the diagonally stiffened optimization model presents higher stiffness and initial yield strength on the premise of meeting the safety requirements the optimized total weight is reduced by 17 5 which

21303,with the continuous development of nuclear power application the structural design and verification of pressure resistant cabin has become the key technology for nuclear powered ships or nuclear powered icebreakers through the design of reinforced pressure resistant structure the ultimate strength of the pressure resistant cabin was investigated by experimental analysis and nonlinear finite element analysis moreover the load displacement curve of the cabin structure and the progressive failure mode were obtained through the numerical analysis of the full scale model based on the similarity criterion the corresponding scale models were designed and tested compared with the numerical results of the scale model it is found that the failure mode in the tests are consistent with that in the numerical analysis for the cabin structure of nuclear powered ship especially the prismatic pressure vessel the corner is the key location for stress concentration in order to comprehensively improve the bearing capacity and weight reduction of the cabin structure the diagonally stiffened optimization model is proposed and further verified numerically keywords nuclear power ship pressure resistant structure ultimate strength scale model test nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction considering the upgrading of the marine economy and exploring ways to solve the energy problem floating nuclear power plants ofnp emerged at the historic moment chu et al 2012 shropshire et al 2012 hirdaris et al 2014 rowinskia et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 this small mobile nuclear power plant will install a scaled down version of the onshore nuclear power plant on a ship which can not only provide safe and effective energy supply for remote islands but also provide electricity heat and fresh water resources for offshore oil and gas exploration platforms operating in the ocean lee et al 2013 2015 the power station can be pulled over at any time when there is a demand for useful electricity and pulled away by boat when it is not needed by combining nuclear reactors with floating platforms floating nuclear power plants can realize the convenience and economy of nuclear energy export as early as 1963 u s martin marietta company designed a marine mh 1a nuclear power plant for the u s military to supply power to the power starved panama canal area mh 1a worked from 1968 to 1975 and was later retired due to high operating costs and the termination of the military reactor program in 2019 the russian atomic energy company built the floating nuclear power plant romanosov to supply power for the development of oil and gas fields in some remote areas in russia s far east or arctic region the designed platform was equipped with two klt 40 nuclear reactors which could provide 70 mw of electricity and 300 mw of thermal power thus ensuring the supply of electricity and hot water for a city with a population of 200 000 zhao et al 2019 however the leakage of nuclear energy will cause nuclear radiation to personnel and nuclear pollution to the surrounding environment if a floating nuclear power ship leaks out nuclear waste will flow into the sea with a wider spread therefore floating nuclear power vessels on the sea need safe and reliable protective cabins to protect nuclear reactors and effectively seal up nuclear energy in case of leakage when a nuclear reactor leaks high pressure gas will be generated the protection chamber should be able to resist sudden high pressure vapor so the protection chamber needs to have pressure bearing capacity pressure bearing cabin of nuclear reactor is one of the important cabins of nuclear power generation ship its structural integrity is very important for the safe operation of the whole nuclear power generation ship therefore it is necessary to study the bearing capacity of the pressure bearing cabin structure the pressure bearing cabin of a nuclear reactor mainly bears internal pressure and its characteristics are similar to those of them pressure vessel pressure bearing structures have been used in industry for a long time with the vigorous development of modern industry pressure vessels are widely used in chemical petroleum nuclear and other industrial production sectors considering the complex structure of the pressure vessel the research on the bearing capacity of the pressure vessel mainly focuses on numerical simulation and experimental research zeng et al 1990 1997 carried out stress analysis and formula revision on rectangular pressure vessels with thin walled stiffeners and compared with the recommended formula and numerical results of american society of mechanical engineers asme to verify the accuracy of the formula mukaimachi et al 2009 used nonlinear finite element method to study cylindrical pressure vessels with local thin areas caused by corrosion and proposed a modified method for evaluating plastic collapse of pressure vessels choi et al 2015 2020 took a prismatic fuel tank of a liquefied natural gas ship lng as the research object analyzed the strength of the fuel tank under design load and test steam load and carried out the ultimate strength dynamic acceleration buckling and thermal fatigue analysis lee et al 2017 based on the traditional cylindrical pressure vessel designed a non reinforced prismatic pressure vessel with plane as the main body and compared the carrying capacity with the traditional cylindrical structure sun et al 2018 studied the bearing capacity of the radial support key of the reactor and carried out static load test using a scale model to determine the bearing capacity of the reactor blachut et al 2017 studied the initial yield pressure and burst pressure of conical shell pressure vessel by combining numerical simulation with experimental method and put forward a standard for structural integrity damage nebe et al 2019 studied the structural deformation of type iv pressure vessel under internal pressure through experimental method according to the structural quality blasting pressure and failure type used the overall structural deformation was compared with the numerical simulation to verify the effectiveness of the simulation meanwhile the control of the manufacturing and fabrication process to maintain high fracture toughness remains a challenge for the pressure vessel industry cracking is one common case which occurs mainly in the weld joints of pressure vessels steels chen et al 2003 therefore for pressurized welded vessels weld failure is one of the inevitable failure forms in recent twenty years a number of cracking cases were reported on the in service pressure vessels based on field survey actual vessel inspection and failure analysis it is pointed out that the quality of the steels the problems existing in design and fabrication process and incompleteness of relevant standards are the major cause of cracking chen et al 2007 during the reported period between 2001 and 2008 the statistics show that the rate of accidents that were directly linked to pressure vessels is not yet on the decline ladokun et al 2010 therefore attention must be paid to the possibility of weld failure in the ultimate failure analysis of large welded structures lei et al 2014 at present there is little research on the bearing capacity of the pressure bearing cabin for nuclear powered ships especially the lack of relevant experimental research the reasonable design of pressure bearing cabin for nuclear powered ships has become a key index to ensure structural safety therefore this paper takes the nuclear reactor pressure bearing cabin of a small nuclear power generation ship as the research object carries out a series of structural design and ultimate strength tests of scale models and quantitatively analyzes the ultimate bearing capacity of the pressure bearing cabin in combination with numerical results the relevant evaluation will provide reference for the structural design of nuclear powered ships 2 numerical analysis 2 1 geometric model and material properties the pressure bearing cabin structure for nuclear reactors of power generation ships is mainly composed of shells and t shaped stiffeners as shown in fig 2 the net size of the cabin is 8000 mm 8000 mm 8000 mm the outer part of the cabin is provided with orthogonal t shaped reinforcements with a spacing of 1000 mm the design thickness of the shell plate is 30 mm and the dimension of stiffener is taken as t 600 22 200 24 inclined toggle plates with a width of 1414 2 mm are used for transition at the corner in fig 2 as shown in fig 3 in order to further study the material characteristics of the pressure resistant structure model the tensile tests of related welded structures and parent metal samples were carried out separately by drawing the stress strain curves in fig 4 it can be concluded that the change trend of tensile characteristic curve of welded specimen is almost consistent with the result of base metal structure in detail the curves of three welded specimens are almost identical in elastic stage yield stage and strengthening stage but slightly different in failure stage for the base material structures the tensile characteristic curves of the three samples almost coincide completely in order to reduce the evaluation error of subsequent numerical calculation the average value of yield strength and tensile limit of base metal was taken for calculation as shown in table 1 2 2 fe model s4r element was used for simulation of all the plates and stiffened plates s4r element is a four node curved shell element with good adaptability to thickness which can be used for accurate analysis of thin shell structures meanwhile a general purpose software hypermesh was used for mesh division as shown in fig 5 a and b the internal pressure load was applied to the inside of the shell with uniform pressure as shown in fig 5c according to the material characteristic curves in fig 4b the ideal elastic plastic model was used for numerical analysis and the large deformation effect will be considered in the calculation considering that the pressure bearing cabin is an independent structure the inertial release method was used as the boundary condition in the calculation inertial release is an advanced application in abaqus software which uses inertial force of structure to balance external force when the inertia release function is used for static analysis only six degrees of freedom are required for one node virtual support firstly taking the virtual support as the reference point the program calculates the acceleration of each node in each direction under the action of external force and then converts the acceleration into inertial force and applies it to each node in reverse thus constructing a balanced force system considering that the mesh size has great influence on the calculation results generally speaking the finer the mesh is the higher the accuracy is however the calculation time required by the very fine mesh model is too long resulting in low calculation efficiency in order to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the results it is necessary to consider both convergence and computational efficiency to obtain a reasonable mesh size convergence analysis was carried out in fig 6 taking the center of the top shell plate as the reference point the load displacement curves under different mesh sizes were drawn in fig 6 the load displacement curves of 5 mesh sizes are in good agreement in the elastic stage however in the yield stage with the decrease of mesh size the variation trend of nonlinear curve gradually tends to be stable in order to ensure the calculation accuracy the mesh size of calculation model is taken as 200 mm 2 3 static strength analysis in order to clarify the stress distribution characteristics of the pressure resistant structure and guide the model test later the related calculation and stress results of the actual model under working load were systematically compared in the first considering the design pressure of the pressure bearing cabin is 0 8 mpa the stress response results and deformation laws were analyzed at p 0 8 mpa as shown in fig 7 a and b the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are both located at the corner of the inclined plate and the maximum stress is 191 mpa and 151 mpa respectively the maximum von mises stress of t shaped stiffener is located at the center with the value of 252 mpa see fig 7c as to deformation the maximum deformation area of the model is located in the center of the plate frame and decreases to all sides the deformation trend of the external reinforcement is basically the same as that of the inner shell the maximum deformation of the shell is 10 9 mm and the value of the t shaped stiffener is 9 5 mm see fig 7d and e the external ribs play a better supporting role for the shell it can be seen that the maximum stress of the structure under design load p 0 8 mpa is less than the yield stress of the material in order to further analyze the stress distribution law on the shell and stiffeners a series of reference points on the medium longitudinal section were extracted for stress analysis in figs 8 11 due to the large difference between the internal and external nodal stresses of the shell 17 nodal stresses on the internal and external surfaces are plotted and compared respectively as shown in figs 8 and 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the von mises stress of bracket at the corner is greater than that in the middle part the stress distribution on the outer surface of the element at the joint between the stiffener and the shell plate is relatively average which is less than the stress at the center of the plate however there is obvious stress concentration at the junction of the ends for inner surface nodes similarly the stress extraction points and stress distribution of the reinforcement panel are compared in fig 10 generally speaking the von mises stress near the corners of both ends is relatively small and much smaller than the stress in the middle for the web of stiffener in fig 11 the stress of the top nodes are larger at both ends and smaller in mid span while the top nodes have the opposite change rule it can be seen that under the action of internal pressure load the top of the web plate of the mid span reinforcement will bear more tensile stress by understanding the change law of stress at key points the corresponding law can be used to guide the ultimate strength analysis and model test monitoring 2 4 local stress field analysis it can be seen from the above stress distribution in fig 9 that the local stress at the corner has obvious stress concentration phenomenon in order to discuss the influence of local mesh on stress distribution the mesh at the corner was further refined for relevant calculation and comparison in fig 12 as shown in fig 12a the mesh at the corner is further refined to 100 mm and the stress distribution results on the top shell reinforcement panel and reinforcement web are compared in figs 12b e respectively from the comparison results the refinement of the local corner will cause the local stress on the shell to increase further but it will not change the stress distribution in the middle see fig 12b and c moreover the local mesh has little influence on the stress on the stiffener see fig 12d and e considering that the key point of local instability is located at the middle point of top shell and the local mesh has little influence on the stress results in the middle of the shell in order to reduce the amount of calculation the following related calculations will be carried out according to the unified mesh of global convergence analysis in fig 6 3 model test through a series of comparison of stress distribution results above it is found that in the middle area with the greatest deformation the stiffened panel and web bear greater stress concentration which is the key position of structural ultimate failure in addition the corner position of the cabin is also the most concentrated position of stress the corresponding conclusions can be used to guide the arrangement of strain measuring points and the observation of test failure the ultimate strength of pressure resistant structures can be improved to the maximum extent by reasonably designing reinforcement forms and strengthening corner areas 3 1 scale model design in order to obtain the actual bearing capacity and mechanical characteristics of the pressure bearing cabin structure it is necessary to further carry out the ultimate bearing capacity test of the scale model according to the actual pressure bearing cabin structure the test model was designed according to the scale ratio of 1 10 according to the characteristics of internal pressure model similarity analysis was carried out by dimensional analysis method the general functional expression describing the deformation mechanism of the internal pressure model can be expressed as 1 f m f e μ a i σ l 0 where m is the representative quantity of bending moment or torque and its dimension is fl f represents the force with the dimension pl 2 e is the elasticity modulus with the dimension fl 2 a is the sectional area of the structure and its dimension is l 2 i represents the moment of inertia of the section with the dimension l 4 σ is the result of stress with the dimension fl 2 μ and l represent poisson s ratio and length separately if l n and l m are respectively expressed as the feature lengths of prototype and model when the geometry is similar 2 c l l n l m c a a n a m l n l m 2 c l 2 c v v n v m l n l m 3 c l 3 where c l c a and c v represent the length ratio area ratio and volume ratio of the prototype and model respectively similarly the load relationship needs to be satisfied 3 c f f n f m p n a n p m a m p n p m c l 2 c m m n m m f n l n f m l m p n p m c l 3 where c f and c m are the force ratio and bending moment ratio between the prototype and model respectively if the model pressure p n is equal to the actual structural pressure p m eq 3 can be simplified as 4 c f c l 2 c m c l 3 as for other relevant parameters 5 c w w n w m l n 3 l m 3 c l 3 c i i n i m l n 4 l m 4 c l 4 where c w and c i represent the ratio of section modulus and the ratio of moment of inertia between the prototype and model respectively for the basic physical quantities describing the characteristics of structural materials the ratios of elastic modulus c e shear modulus c g and poisson s ratio c μ are all taken as 1 6 c e e s e m 1 c g g s g m 1 c μ μ s μ m 1 after similar model design the dimensions of the test model are designed in table 2 the stiffener size of the scaled model is t 60 2 2 20 2 4 considering the inconvenience of processing the t shaped stiffener is changed to 60 3 according to the principle of equal cross sectional area meanwhile considering that it is difficult to realize the double sided welding process for all shell plates one side of the shell plates will adopt the single sided welding during assembly in order to make up for the shortage caused by single sided welding the thickness of the shell plate with single sided welding was adjusted to 5 mm the adjusted pressure bearing cabin model is shown in fig 13 a considering the actual welding process the scaled model was also designed and manufactured with q345 steel fig 13b after the model was processed the ultimate bearing capacity and failure mode of the model were tested by continuously applying water pressure 3 2 loading process water injection holes and exhaust holes were arranged on the shell plate and fixed by bolts to ensure firmness and sealing as shown in fig 14 the water pressure was driven by the water injection pipe see fig 15 a and the pipe was controlled and adjusted by setting a valve the working pressure of the electric pressure test pump is 60 mpa the flow rate is 1 l min and the motor power is 1 5 kw the applied load can be directly displayed by the pressure gauge see fig 15a the measuring range of the pressure gauge is 10 mpa with an accuracy of 0 4 before the test mark points were pasted on the surface of the model and the model was scanned by gscan handheld 3d scanner to obtain the displacement nephogram in the initial state of the model see fig 15b after the test the test model was scanned again to obtain the displacement nephogram after ultimate failure during the test the preloaded test shall be conducted first the water pressure slowly rises to 0 2 mpa after confirming that there is no leakage the water pressure rises to 0 5 mpa for 30 min during loading all welds and connection parts are inspected in real time to ensure the normal operation of the water pump pressure gauge pressure sensor control valve and acquisition instrument 3 3 arrangement of measuring points 3 3 1 strain measuring points strain measuring points were all arranged with tj120 4aa three dimensional strain rosettes suitable for underwater measurement according to the structural characteristics of the test model and the results of finite element stress analysis the layout of measuring points was formed as shown in fig 16 the k series measuring points are arranged at the key positions of the shell plate while the l series measuring points are arranged on the web plates of the reinforcing ribs 3 3 2 displacement measuring points hks a 100 qy10 high precision millisecond rope displacement sensor was adopted in the test with a measuring range of 1 m and an accuracy of 0 01 as shown in fig 17 a five points on dhae surface and hgef surface were selected as displacement monitoring points u2 and u4 are measuring points on the shell and u1 u3 and u5 are measuring points on the stiffeners see fig 17b and c 3 4 analysis of measurement results 3 4 1 experimental phenomenon in the process of measuring the ultimate bearing capacity of the square cabin test model the electric pressure test pump slowly increases the pressure by controlling the water pressure when the load was applied to 1 7 mpa the uplift deformation at the center of the model shell bulged and deformed gradually see fig 18 a and the stiffeners at the corners began to shift locally see fig 18b meanwhile some welds made noises due to stretching when the pressure reached 2 7 mpa the crack of the weld seam in the corner began to appear accompanied by the sound of grinning water spray mist the model began to relieve pressure as shown in fig 18c 3 4 2 load displacement curve the deformation value and pressure value of each measuring point were extracted to draw the corresponding load displacement curves as shown in fig 19 as can be seen from fig 19 when the pressure load is below 1 25 mpa the load displacement curve of each measuring point shows a linear relationship which indicates that the test model is in the elastic deformation stage at this time when the pressure exceeds 1 25 mpa the slope of the load displacement curve begins to decrease which indicates that the stiffness of the test model material gradually decreases and the structure enters the plastic deformation stage 3 4 3 stress results according to the stress results measured by strain rosettes von mises stress at each measuring point was calculated and compared in fig 20 as can be seen from fig 20 the load stress curve of each measuring point has good linearity which verifies the reliability of the test loading process from the comparison results it can be seen that the stress in the center area of the shell and the stiffeners is relatively large and shows a decreasing trend toward the periphery moreover there is obvious stress concentration at the corners and the corner regions will enter the plastic stage at the earliest 3 5 result comparison and analysis 3 5 1 comparison of stress results in order to further verify the reliability of the test model the results of numerical simulation were used for comparison in fig 21 as can be seen from the figure the error between the test value and the simulation value at each measuring point is small and the stress trend is basically consistent which verifies the reliability of numerical analysis above 3 5 2 comparison of deformation results the abaqus software was used to extract the deformation values of each measuring point under the internal pressure load of 0 8 mpa as shown in fig 22 under the action of internal pressure the surrounding shells and stiffeners took on the shape of protruding outward the deformation values measured by sensors on both sides of the model were also compared with the numerical simulation results in fig 23 and table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that the numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the test results as a whole the maximum displacement of the measuring point is only 1 3 mm under design load p 0 8 mpa with the further increase of water pressure the shelter structure gradually enters the yield stage accompanied by larger plastic deformation as shown in fig 24 when the pressure is 2 7 mpa in addition to the large deformation in the middle of the shell there is also a large local deformation in the stiffener web at the corner comparing the monitoring displacements of the shell plates on the left and right sides it is found that the deformation on the 5 mm side is slightly smaller than that on the 3 mm side but shows good symmetry see fig 25 compared with the numerical results in table 4 the maximum deformation error is 5 9 mm and the numerical results are consistent with the displacement curves obtained by experiments after the test a 3d scanner was used to scan the top of the model and the displacement obtained by scanning was compared with the finite element results in fig 26 the results show that the deformation mode obtained by numerical calculation is basically consistent with the scanning results 4 results and discussions the above analysis shows that the numerical model results are in good agreement with the model test results which verifies the feasibility of the numerical method in order to further compare the gradual failure process of the actual pressure vessel and the scaled model the ultimate strength calculation of the two models was further analyzed and compared 4 1 ultimate strength of actual structure the ultimate strength of the actual pressure bearing cabin was calculated and analyzed in fig 27 the center point o of the top shell plate is taken as the displacement monitoring point and the obtained load displacement curve is shown in fig 27 point a is the pressure at the point when the pressure bearing structure begins to enter plasticity and the pressure value is 1 2 mpa extrapolating the curves of elastic stage and plastic stage to get the initial yield point b see fig 27 ob segment belongs to the elastic stage the pressure in the pressure bearing square cabin is proportional to the displacement and the displacement is linear with the pressure load bc section belongs to plastic stage and the relationship between pressure load and displacement is nonlinear the pressure value corresponding to point b is 1 9 mpa which defined as the initial yield pressure as the internal pressure continues to increase the yield area of the structure gradually increases the pressure corresponding to point c is the maximum pressure that the pressure bearing cabin can bear which is called plastic collapse pressure 4 1 1 stress analysis at the stage a from the initial load to point a the load displacement curve changes linearly and both the whole structure and local components are in the elastic stage as shown in fig 28 the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are both located at the corner of the inclined plate and the maximum stress is 281 mpa and 227 mpa respectively however the maximum stress point of the reinforcement ribs reaches 345 mpa and begins to enter the yield stage 4 1 2 stress analysis at the stage b from stage a to stage b the yield area on the stiffeners gradually extends to the shell plate for the shell plates the earliest yielding position is located at the toggle plates near the corner and other areas have not yet yielded as shown in fig 29 the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are 345 mpa and 358 mpa respectively 4 1 3 stress analysis at the stage c with the further increase of pressure the yield area of the cabin structure gradually expands to the whole structure and the corresponding limit load is 4 4 mpa see figs 27 and 30 the maximum deformation under ultimate load is located at the center of the shell plate with a value of 770 1 mm 770 1 mm is the vertical displacement and 958 1 mm in fig 30b is the total displacement considering the possibility of welding failure at the corner the fracture judgment of the actual structure can be simply based on the plastic strain at the time of fracture in the material test the tensile test of q345 material shows that the plastic strain at fracture is 0 2 see fig 4b if the plastic strain is selected to be 0 2 as the strain when the material breaks the fracture type can be obtained in fig 31 a as shown in fig 31 it can be found that under the action of ultimate load the transition position between the toggle plate and the shell is torn at the earliest in addition the plastic strain in the middle part of the reinforcement is relatively large and the reinforcement panel is about to tear 4 2 ultimate strength of scale model similarly the ultimate strength of the test scale model was also calculated and analyzed in fig 32 with the center point o of the top shell plate as the displacement monitoring point the obtained load displacement curve is shown in fig 32 the value of pressure at point a is 1 0 mpa and the corresponding pressure at point b is 1 6 mpa the load value of limit point c reaches 4 1 mpa as shown in fig 33 the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are both located at the corner of the inclined plate and the maximum stress is 247 mpa and 219 mpa respectively similarly the local point stress on the stiffener exceeds 345 mpa and begins to enter the yield stage from stage a to stage b the yield area on the stiffeners gradually extends to the shell plate for the shell plates the earliest yielding position is located at the toggle plates near the corner and other areas have not yet yielded the maximum von mises stress and membrane stress of the shell are 345 mpa and 374 mpa respectively in fig 34 with the further increase of pressure the yield area of the cabin structure gradually expands to the whole structure and the corresponding limit load is 4 1 mpa see figs 32 and 35 the maximum deformation under ultimate load is located at the center of the shell plate with a value of 86 1 mm considering the possibility of welding failure at the corner the strain results of the scaled model were extracted with the critical strain value of fracture 0 2 as shown in fig 36 it can be found that under the action of ultimate load the transition position between the toggle plate and the shell is torn at the earliest it is concluded that the corner position of the cabin is the most easily damaged position for ultimate strength which is consistent with the test results 4 3 comparison of ultimate bearing capacity taking the measuring point u2 at the center of the shell plate as the displacement monitoring point the numerical simulation load displacement curves of the actual scale structure and the test scale model were extracted and compared with the test results in fig 37 1 as far as the results of the numerical model are concerned the ultimate bearing capacity of the real scale model prototype is higher than that of the scale model of test it can be known that the results obtained by the scale model evaluation in the project are relatively safe which is beneficial to the safety evaluation of the project structure 2 the experimental initial yield strength of the cabin model is 1 5 mpa while the numerical simulation results of the actual structure and the experimental model are 1 9 mpa and 1 6 mpa respectively for the scale model the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results which verifies the effectiveness of the numerical model 3 the ultimate load obtained from the model test is 2 7 mpa in the test the weld crack appears at the stress concentration position at the corner resulting in strength failure however the ultimate strength obtained by the numerical model is as high as 4 1 mpa which indicates that the numerical model does not consider the influence of weld on the ultimate strength and the ultimate failure of the model is the buckling of the plate 5 optimization analysis considering that offshore nuclear power vessels need to be flexible the layout of pressure shelter should be designed with reasonable component distribution and weight control according to the results of model test and numerical simulation the pressure vessel made of q345 steel has high overall strength and has a large safety margin under the working load of 0 8 mpa while the inclined plate corners in the shelter structure are relatively weak in view of the characteristics of the original structure design the prototype of the pressure vessel was taken as the object and the structural rationality of the actual model was improved on the premise of keeping the external dimensions of the structural shell unchanged the stress size stress distribution displacement size and structural weight of the actual engineering structure were comprehensively considered to optimize the design of the actual model and the optistruct module of cae software altair hyperworks was used for topology optimization and size optimization design of pressure shelter 5 1 topology optimization of stiffener layout there are many ways to arrange the stiffeners on the outer surface of pressure vessels among which the most common ones are vertical and horizontal orthogonal distribution and oblique cross distribution in this paper the topology optimization of shell reinforcement layout was carried out by variable density method and the optimal reinforcement layout was sought according to the equivalent stiffness theory the bending stiffness of stiffened plate structure can be obtained by superimposing the bending stiffness of stiffeners and the bending stiffness of base plate see fig 38 a so that the equivalent stiffness plate structure with uniform thickness can be obtained therefore the optimization of stiffened plate layout can be regarded as the optimization of the layout of strong material and weak material of thin plate see fig 38b the variable density method was used to optimize the topology of the pressure vessel shell as shown in fig 39 inertial release was used to constrain the shell and the internal pressure load was 0 8 mpa the ratio of stiffener distribution area to the total area of shell plate and the strain energy of shell plate structure are taken as the optimization response and the constraint condition is to limit the stiffener distribution area to 5 15 of the total area of shell plate the optimal stiffener layout is found with the minimum strain energy i e the maximum stiffness as the optimization objective after optimization the density of stiffened element of shell plate is shown in fig 39a and the result of stiffened optimization is shown in fig 39b under the action of the internal pressure load of 0 8 mpa the stiffeners are distributed orthogonally on the whole and the density of stiffeners is high in the center of the shell plate and the middle of the inclined plate corner so it is necessary to arrange forced stiffeners in this area the optimized structure is defined as a diagonally stiffened model in fig 39b 5 2 component size optimization in the process of weight reduction this paper adopts the size optimization module of optistruct taking the thickness of shell and stiffener as optimization parameters and the allowable stress of structure as limiting condition so as to minimize the weight after the optimization results are obtained the structure design is further verified and improved to achieve the goal of lightweight design in order to compare the feasibility of the optimized structure comprehensively the prototype structure see fig 5a and the diagonally reinforced structure see fig 39b are optimized respectively in fig 40 comparing the static strength of the two size optimization schemes under design load p 0 8 mpa with the prototype the optimized component thickness and maximum stress calculation results of each scheme are shown in tables 5 and 6 according to the stress results in table 6 the two size optimization schemes are close to each other both of which are less than the allowable stress under the design load of 0 8 mpa the structure can operate safely on the premise of meeting the safety requirements the optimized total weight is reduced by 16 4 and 17 5 respectively which achieves the purpose of weight reduction from the point of view of deformation the maximum deformation of the shell in the diagonally stiffened optimization scheme is reduced from 10 9 mm to 8 2 mm which is 24 7 lower than that of the prototype indicating that the stiffness of the improved scheme is higher taking the center point of the top shell plate as the reference point the load displacement curves of the two optimization schemes are redrawn and compared with the prototype results as shown in fig 41 from the load displacement curves it can be found that the initial yield pressure of the prototype topology optimization model is 1 8 mpa and that of the diagonally stiffened scheme is 2 mpa and the ultimate bearing capacity of the two schemes is equivalent under the condition of weight reduction the ultimate bearing capacity is slightly lower than that of the prototype the ultimate bearing capacity of the two optimization models reached 3 7 mpa under the action of ultimate load the prototype topology optimization model tears at the corner joint between shell plate and inclined plate see fig 42 a which is similar to the failure mode of prototype however for the diagonally stiffened optimization model under the action of ultimate load the stiffeners on the four sides of the shell plates are broken and the corner of the shell plate is torn see fig 42b thus losing the bearing capacity comparing the two optimization schemes comprehensively the strength stiffness and initial yield strength of the diagonally stiffened optimization scheme are superior to those of prototype topology optimization scheme and their ultimate bearing capacity is equivalent this diagonally stiffened optimization scheme provides a reference for the design of pressure cabin for nuclear power ships in future 6 conclusions through the experimental study and numerical analysis of the ultimate bearing capacity of the pressure bearing cabin the failure process of the pressure bearing cabin under internal pressure load is presented the relevant failure rules are summarized and a more suitable diagonally stiffened optimization model is proposed 1 through the analysis of the ultimate failure process and stress field distribution of the pressure resistant structure in simulation it is found that the corner position and the stiffener at the maximum deformation of the cabin are the main places where stress concentration and ultimate strength fail the ultimate strength of pressure resistant structures can be improved to the maximum extent by reasonably designing reinforcement forms and strengthening corner areas 2 through the scale model design and ultimate strength test the failure process of the pressure bearing cabin under internal pressure load is obtained under the action of ultimate load the transition position between the inclined toggl plate and the shell plate are torn thus losing the bearing capacity the corresponding numerical analysis show that the test and the numerical simulation are in good agreement with each other in the key indexes such as initial stiffness deformation and stress field 3 it is worth emphasizing that the stress concentration at the corner position is aggravated by the crack initiation at the welding position which will weaken the ultimate strength of the pressure resistant structure meanwhile for an actual pressure vessel the internal pressure often generates a bi axial stress condition which often leads to a lower fracture resistance than the same material under uniaxial loading therefore the fracture failure of the cabin under complex stress state requires further investigation 4 after shape layout and component size optimization the diagonally stiffened optimization model presents higher stiffness and initial yield strength on the premise of meeting the safety requirements the optimized total weight is reduced by 17 5 which provides a reference for the design of pressure cabin for nuclear power ships in future credit authorship contribution statement shuangxi xu prof ziwen gu conceptualization methodology investigation

21304,in this study we devised a new wec wave energy converter called sr wec surface riding wec the sr wec consists of two bodies the outer cylinder with an armature assembly body 1 and a magnet assembly body 2 sliding inside the armature for the sr wec the relative sliding displacement and velocity are caused by gravity acceleration and the outer cylinder s motions and they lead to electrical power generation to evaluate its performance a numerical simulation tool was developed which solves the fully coupled floater mooring generator dynamics during the developing stage the appropriate hydrodynamics model sliding mechanics model mooring dynamics model and leg linear electric generator electro magnetic model were independently developed and then fully coupled in time

parametric studies were conducted with several important design parameters under various wave conditions to enhance power generation after that the average output power was evaluated in enlarged operational wave conditions the present sr wec is particularly designed to be efficient at low sea states which is good since they cover the majority of typical annual sea states keywords wave energy converter surface riding linear electric generator mooring line floater mooring generator interaction time domain simulation 1 introduction renewable energy resources such as wind ocean wave and solar energy have been considered as an alternative and environmentally friendly option to replace conventional energy resources they are expected to account for 47 7 of the total energy consumption in 2040 based on a global renewable energy scenario kralova and sjöblom 2010 among them ocean waves are a promising energy resource because of its highest energy density 2 3 kw m2 continuous availability up to 90 of the time and minimal negative environmental impact drew et al 2009 the global gross resource of the ocean wave is estimated to be in a range of 1 10 tw gadonneix et al 2010 mork et al 2010 in this regard various wecs wave energy converters have been proposed among many technical aspects the proper selection of the pto power take off system is important in improving conversion efficiency hydraulic systems e g pelamis henderson 2006 turbines e g wave dragon kofoed et al 2006 and direct drive wecs e g powerbuoy edwards and mekhiche 2014 are popular pto systems various types of wec devices and their simulation methodologies were presented in ref babarit et al 2011 the hydraulic pto system requires additional energy conversion to operate the rotary generator which makes a device complex additional energy losses are inevitable in the process of double energy conversion also the complexity of the conversion process can lead to reliability and maintenance issues baker and mueller 2001 especially in harsh ocean environments on the other hand direct drive wecs with the leg linear electric generator produce power from the relative translational motions between the permanent magnet and coiled armature they do not require any intermediate step thus the design can be simpler drew et al 2009 in recent decades a number of experiments and numerical studies have been performed on the direct drive wecs for example prudell et al 2010 devised a freely floating dual buoy wec and conducted a laboratory experiment to estimate its performance kim et al 2017 designed a dual buoy wec which utilized three resonant motions of two bodies and moon pool and carried out a laboratory experiment under regular and random wave conditions their experimental results were also compared with the results of time domain dynamics simulations under the random wave excitation jin et al 2020 lejerskog et al 2015 conducted large scale sea tests of the point absorber that was mounted at the seabed of the lysekil research site in sweden they concluded that higher output power can be achieved in upward motions than downward motions stelzer and joshi 2012 also studied a similar point absorber under random wave excitations using numerical simulations zheng et al 2020 designed the variable aperture point absorber for enhancing survivability reducing cost and improving wave power absorption linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic models were compared for the two body wec ji et al 2020 and submerged point absorber schubert et al 2020 in addition various design optimization strategies have been adopted to improve the performance of the direct drive wec parametric studies were performed to find the proper generator and structural design hong et al 2016 amiri et al 2016 resonance of dual body wecs was adjusted to maximize the relative motion by using linear springs connected between two bodies park et al 2013 gao et al 2016 engström et al 2011 the tuned inertia mass was utilized in a point absorber to increase power absorption and broaden the effective wave frequency range haraguchi and asai 2020 control systems such as latching control kim et al 2019 and model predictive control son and yeung 2017 were adopted to improve the overall output power in this study we developed a hydro dynamics linear generator fully coupled simulation program to investigate the performance of an innovative sr wec surface riding wec devised by authors kang and kim 2019 it mainly consists of an outer cylinder equipped with a coiled armature assembly and a magnet assembly sliding along a center rod see fig 1 compared to other direct drive wecs that utilize relative heave motions sr wec uses the sliding motion inside a surface riding and pitching horizontal cylinder it is hard to find similar concepts and relevant simulations in publicly available literature blažauskas et al 2015 the sr wec is specially devised to generate appreciable electrical power even in low sea states which typically cover 90 of the annual sea state e g east coast in the u s 31 887 n 74 921 w it is possible since both wave heights and lengths are reduced in low sea states for wave slopes to remain about the same sr wec generates the sliding motion by the gravity acceleration while most existing leg based devices utilize inertial acceleration various optimization methods can be employed to enhance output power further to evaluate the sr wec s performance the present time domain simulation program was developed and used to solve the fully coupled floater mooring generator interaction several major considerations and algorithms were made to develop the numerical model first the outer cylinder interacts with waves and thus its hydrodynamic coefficients and wave excitation force were estimated based on potential theory in frequency domain lee 1995 and they were utilized in the subsequent time domain motion simulation program second the sliding mechanism of the magnet assembly with time varying contact and friction forces should be well understood and modeled third a reasonable collision model was developed at both ends of the outer cylinder to assess the impact induced velocity load and fatigue by the magnet assembly fourth the pto force between the coil on the outer cylinder and the sliding magnet assembly should be well estimated to correctly estimate the resisting force and generated power fifth a single point mooring system is installed and connected to the outer cylinder for a station keeping purpose and the floater mooring interaction should be solved the numerical modeling of sliding mechanism and collision at both ends was validated through comparisons with the physical system after mounting and pitching the sr wec on harmonic actuators with the pto off the numerical generator dynamics was also verified through comparisons with the laboratory experiments of prudell et al 2010 with pto on afterward a series of parametric studies were performed with the validated numerical model to better understand the system s sensitivity on the design parameters so that the results can be used as the improved design for given annual sea states 2 design and operation principle the design and operation principle of sr wec are presented in fig 1 the device mainly consists of the outer cylinder equipped with the armature assembly and the magnet assembly the magnet assembly is composed of neodymium ndfeb magnets supporting lamination steel and linear ball bearings in detail the linear ball bearings in the magnet assembly are in contact with a fixed center rod which allows single degree of freedom sdof motion in the sliding direction along the center rod the armature assembly composed of coil and lamination steel is installed to the outer cylinder and surrounds the magnet assembly the outer cylinder interacts with the surrounding ocean fluid the spring damper system which is referred to as the end damper is located at both ends of the outer cylinder to alleviate collision damage from the magnet assembly ring masses are also located at both ends to provide a large mass moment of inertia about the y axis m 55 so that pitch natural frequency 1 65 rad s can be close to peak frequency in low sea states as shown in fig 2 a single point mooring line is connected to the bottom center of the outer cylinder for position keeping and cylinder s longitudinal direction is parallel to the dominant wave direction table 1 summarizes important design parameters electric power is generated by relative motions between the magnet and armature assemblies as shown in fig 1 b the relative motion by sliding is mainly induced by the pitch motion of the outer cylinder as the inclination angle is larger than the minimum sliding angle the magnet assembly starts to slide by gravity the detailed formulations are given in section 3 3 coupled time domain simulation a hydrodynamics mechanics generator fully coupled time domain simulation program was developed to assess the performance of the sr wec i e floater mooring generator interactions were solved at each time step to evaluate their dynamic responses mooring tension and electric output power the time domain dynamic analysis allows non linear loads to be considered section 3 explains the theory and formulations of the time domain simulation and coupling methods among the floater i e outer cylinder magnet assembly and mooring line 3 1 floating body model in time domain the 6 dof dynamic responses of the outer cylinder can be evaluated by solving the cummins equation cummins 1962 as 1 m i j a i j ξ j t b i j e ξ j t k i j ξ j t f i w t f i c t f i m t f i g t f i s t i j 1 2 6 where m i j is the mass matrix a i j is the added mass matrix at the infinite frequency b i j e is the external damping matrix k i j is the system s stiffness matrix induced by hydrostatic and gravitational stiffness ξ j ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 t is the displacement vector i e surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw f i w f i c and f i m are respectively the first order wave excitation convolution and morison drag force vectors f i g is the pto force vector induced by the interaction between the magnet and armature assemblies and f i s is the spring force vector to couple the outer cylinder with the mooring line the upper dot in the equations represents the time derivative of a variable based on the assumption of linearity a i j f i c and f i w can be obtained from the equivalent relationship between the impulse response function based equations in time domain and the diffraction radiation based equations in frequency domain as follows 2 a i j a i j ω 0 r i j t sin ω t ω d t 3 f i c t 0 r i j τ ξ j t τ d τ 4 r i j t 2 π 0 b i j ω cos ω t d ω 5 f i w

and α j are wave amplitude the linear transfer function wavenumber and random phase angle respectively frequency dependent a i j b i j and l i were obtained by a 3d diffraction radiation program lee 1995 the morison equation is widely used for the estimation of wave forces on slender bodies at its instantaneous position which is composed of the linear inertia and non linear drag terms morison et al 1950 the morison equation is recommended for the wave force evaluation of slender structures when the ratio of outer diameter d to wavelength λ w is less than 0 2 d λ w 0 12 at natural period 3 81 s faltinsen 1993 since the inertia term was obtained from the diffraction radiation potential theory only the non linear drag term was added for the viscous drag force evaluation the morison drag force per unit length for the moving cylindrical body can be written as 6 f i m t 1 2 ρ c d d u i n ξ i n u i n ξ i n where ρ is the density of water c d is the drag coefficient and u i is the surrounding fluid s velocity superscript n is the normal direction of a variable for sr wec the mass of the magnet assembly was designed to be much lighter 1 9 than that of the outer cylinder in this regard we evaluated the dynamic responses of the outer cylinder based on the total mass of the sr wec including the mass of the magnet assembly instead of solving the two body fully coupled interaction between the outer cylinder and the magnet assembly 3 2 mooring line model and coupling with floating body as mentioned before a single point mooring line was employed to maintain sr wec s original position therefore the outer cylinder s motions are to be coupled with the mooring dynamics two governing equations were established to estimate the mooring dynamics and tension based on a rod theory garrett 1982 in which generalized coordinate was used and twisting motions and moments were neglected fig 3 presents the rod theory s coordinate system the generalized coordinate system is along the line and thus the geometric nonlinearity can be automatically considered kim et al 2005 in the generalized coordinate system r i s t represents the position vector in 3d which is a function of arc length s and time t to define space curve r i denotes the unit tangent vector to the space curve while r i and r i r i are the principal normal and bi normal vectors respectively the prime in the equations denotes the spatial derivative of a variable the equation of motion with the line s tension and bending effects can be described as follows 7 e i r i λ r i q i d m d r i i 1 2 3 where e is young s modulus i is the second moment of cross sectional area λ t e i κ 2 with effective tension t and local curvature κ while q i d and m d are the distributed force vector and mass per unit length in this case q i d is the sum of wet weight vector per unit length w i r w i r b i r where w i r and b i r are weight and buoyancy per unit length and the wave force vector per unit length f i d according to the morison equation f i d for the cylindrical body can be written as 8 f i d c a ρ a e r i n c m ρ a e u i n 1 2 c d ρ d u i n r i n u i n r i n where c a and c m are respectively the added mass and inertia coefficients a e is the external cross sectional area with w i r and f i d eq 7 can be rewritten as 9 m d r i c a ρ a e r i n e i r i λ r i w w i r c m ρ a e u u i n 1 2 c d ρ d u i n r r i n u i n r r i n the mooring tension can separately be estimated by the extensible condition assuming linear and small extension the mooring tension can be estimated by the following relationship 10 r i r i 1 t e a t 1 2 t e a t 1 2 λ e a t where a t a e a i with the internal cross sectional area a i t is the tension and λ t e i κ 2 is the lagrange multiplier the equation of motion and extensible condition in eqs 9 and 10 are therefore governing equations for mooring line analysis finally finite element fe formulations of the governing equations were further derived by using the galerkin method which is detailed by refs jin and kim 2020 ran 2000 in the fe method nonlinear behaviors can be captured by dividing a line into multiple high order elements a mooring line was coupled with the outer cylinder through translational and rotational springs which is a practical approach to connect several objects conveniently the interaction force is delivered to the outer cylinder as spring force and equal and opposite force is also transmitted to the top of the mooring line assuming the hinged connection zero rotational stiffness was implemented the spring force vector transmitted from the mooring line to the floating body can be expressed as ran et al 1999 11 f i s k i j t j k u k r u j c where k i j represents the coupling stiffness matrix t j k denotes the transformation matrix between the floater s origin and the connection position while u k r and u j c are respectively the displacement vectors of the rigid body and connection position 3 3 linear generator model leg was modeled to couple the two bodies and generate electric power in the proposed design the coiled armature assembly is attached to the outer cylinder whereas the magnet assembly freely slides along the center rod the relative velocity between the armature and magnet assemblies induces the emf electromotive force whose unit is voltage according to faraday s law of induction the induced emf e b proportionally increases with a change in flux linkage λ f l n c φ m and can be calculated as rhinefrank et al 2006 12 e b d λ f l d t d ξ 7 d t d λ f l d ξ 7 ξ 7 d λ f l d ξ 7 where n c is the number of turns φ m is magnetic flux and ξ 7 is the displacement of the magnet assembly relative to the armature assembly the emf is proportional to the relative velocity based on the rl resistor inductor circuit the following relationship can be used to compute the induced current rhinefrank et al 2006 13 e b r l r c i c l p d i c d t where r l and r c are load and phase resistances respectively i c is the induced electric current and l p is the phase inductance the first order ode ordinary differential equation should be solved to acquire the induced current and the fourth order runge kutta method was used after calculating the induced current the pto force can be estimated by using the lorentz force equation the electrons of electric current experience the magnetic force under the given magnetic field which can be regarded as an interaction force between the two bodies the pto force on the coiled armature assembly in the sliding direction can be written as 14 f g n i c d l b m b m l c i c where b m b f cos π ξ 7 τ with the magnitude of magnetic flux density b f and pole pitch τ is the magnetic flux density and l c is the length of the coil that receives influences by the magnetic field at each time according to newton s third law the equal and opposite force also acts on the magnet assembly since it acts in the sliding direction at each time step the pto force was decomposed to calculate f i g for the outer cylinder in general b f can be evaluated from electro magnetic filed simulation however in this study a parametric study was conducted to find the proper b f in the parametric study b f l c is defined as the magnitude of emf or pto force finally the generated electric output power can be expressed as 15 p o i c 2 r l i c v o where v o is the output voltage 3 4 magnet assembly dynamics relative displacement based sdof equation of motion for magnet assembly in sliding direction along the center rod can be written as 16 m b ξ 7 t f l t f g n t where m b is the mass of the magnet assembly and f l is the sliding force the working principle of the magnet assembly was previously described fig 1 b as the inclination angle of the outer cylinder ξ 5 i e pitch motion is higher than the minimum sliding angle associated with the given friction coefficient and lubrication condition the magnet assembly starts to slide by gravity along the center rod the sdof was defined in the body fixed coordinate system located to the center of gravity of the outer cylinder since the coordinate center of the magnet assembly continuously moves at each time step due to the dynamic motions of the outer cylinder the non inertia reference frame i e the accelerated coordinate system was introduced to always keep the magnet assembly s coordinate center with respect to the center of gravity of the outer cylinder the sdof motion is therefore that of the magnet assembly relative to the body fixed coordinate system of the outer cylinder in the sliding direction in this coordinate system the inertial forces which are also known as the fictitious forces should be added as external force terms the inertial force is the production of the mass of the magnet assembly and acceleration of the outer cylinder considering the head wave condition sway motion is generally small thus inertia force from sway motion was neglected therefore f l which includes inertial forces can be formulated as 17 f l t m b g sin ξ 5 ξ 3 sin ξ 5 ξ 1 cos ξ 5 sgn ξ 7 μ m b g cos ξ 5 ξ 3 cos ξ 5 ξ 1 sin ξ 5 where g is gravity acceleration and μ is friction coefficient the equation of motion given in eq 17 does not account for the contact mechanism between two bodies at both ends of the outer cylinder to realize the contact mechanism at both ends of the outer cylinder conservation of momentum with the partial elastic condition was used then the displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction after a collision can be evaluated the conservation of momentum and the coefficient of restitution can be expressed as 18 m a v a t n m b v b t n m a v a t n 1 m b v b t n 1 19 r e v b t n 1 v a t n 1 v a t n v b t n where v a and v b are the velocities of the objects 1 and 2 m a and m b are the masses of object 1 and 2 and r e is the coefficient of restitution by combining eqs 18 and 19 the velocity of object 1 after the collision can be derived as 20 v a t n 1 m a v a t n m b v b t n m b r e v b t n v a t n m a m b for sr wec the mass of the outer cylinder is designed to be much larger than that of the magnet assembly therefore the terms related to the mass of the magnet assembly in eq 20 can be neglected moreover for the same reason the contribution of a collision to the outer cylinder s motion is assumed to be small and the velocity of the outer cylinder is not influenced by the collision also the non inertia reference frame keeps the velocity of the outer cylinder zero from the view of the magnet assembly based on the above considerations eq 20 can be simplified with the current variables of sr wec as 21 ξ 7 t n 1 r e ξ 7 t n when the magnet assembly does not contact both ends eq 16 was used to solve the dynamic equation of motion after the contact eq 21 gave the instantaneous displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly 3 5 procedure of time domain simulation fig 4 presents a flowchart describing the procedure of the present fully coupled floater mooring generator time domain simulation first the frequency domain hydrodynamic computation was completed to obtain the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients and forces for the outer cylinder also the initial parameters of the two bodies outer cylinder and magnet assembly mooring line and generator were entered second the retardation function and the added mass at infinite frequency were calculated third at each time step forces on two bodies and a mooring line were evaluated which includes the wave pto spring and sliding forces fourth the coupled equations of motion were solved by the adams moulton implicit method combined with the adams bashforth explicit method in which iteration within a time step is not needed the third and fourth steps were repeated until the last time step 4 validation of numerical model two comparative studies between the numerical simulation and experiment were carried out to validate the proposed simulation program i the sliding mechanism of the magnet assembly without the leg was confirmed by comparing the numerical simulations with the heave pitch coupled actuator tests conducted by authors and ii leg dynamics by the present numerical simulation at different sea states was validated against laboratory tests conducted by prudell et al 2010 4 1 validation of sliding mechanism fig 5 shows the test setup of the heave pitch coupled actuator test table 2 presents the dimension and mass of cylinders an acrylic hollow tube was used for inner and outer cylinders while a center rod was made of stainless steel a linear ball bearing ssu20 by thomson was mounted to an inside of the inner cylinder to maximize the sliding performance with a low friction coefficient at both ends of the outer cylinder styrofoam dampers were located to mitigate the impact force there were two actuators a lst series by zaber technology vertically installed at both ends of the outer cylinder so that the heave pitch coupled motion of the outer cylinder can be emulated as the outer cylinder moves with the actuators the inner cylinder slides along the center rod for this test leg was not installed since the main objective of the test was to check the sliding mechanism first the minimum sliding angle of the inner cylinder was checked the inclination angle was increased from 0 2 with an interval of 0 05 which results in the observed minimum sliding angle of around 0 5 the corresponding static friction coefficient was estimated from the minimum sliding angle second the dynamic friction coefficient along the sliding and collision mechanism at the ends were identified at different inclination angles fig 6 shows the displacements of the inner cylinder in the sliding direction at inclination angles of 2 and 3 the dynamic friction coefficient is generally smaller than the static friction coefficient and the identified dynamic friction coefficient is 75 of the static friction coefficient to match the experimental results before a collision occurs also the coefficient of restitution was checked by comparing the transient response after the collision as shown in fig 6 the coefficient of restitution in the range of 0 36 0 39 best matches against the experiments those values were used in the ensuing simulation of sr wec third a heave pitch coupled actuator test was performed and the experimental results were compared with our simulation results fig 7 shows the measured time histories of the outer cylinder s pitch and heave motions and the corresponding displacements and velocities of the inner cylinder are presented in fig 8 the same condition was also inputted in the numerical simulation as shown in fig 8 with the coefficient of restitution of 0 38 the simulated magnitudes and trends of displacement and velocity coincide well against experimental values those well matched sliding responses with the experiments where the collision and those two coupled motions were involved validate the formulation of the sr wec mechanics as explained in the previous section 4 2 validation of generator dynamics the developed leg simulation model was validated with the experimental data given in prudell et al 2010 the present formulations related to generator dynamics were confirmed through this validation in the experiment two body heave type wec with leg was tested in the laboratory armature and magnet assemblies were installed at inner and outer buoys respectively 960 ndfeb magnets were used to construct magnet assembly and the three phase y connection was designed the major leg parameters are summarized in table 3 considering that the leg performance only depends on the relative displacement and velocity the difference in wec type is irrelevant as long as those two inputs are the same in their laboratory test the dynamics of two floating bodies in waves was actually not considered instead they assumed that the inner buoy is stationary while the outer buoy moves with wave elevation under this scenario the heave motion time series of the outer buoy is the same as wave elevation time series while the inner buoy is fixed therefore they actually utilized the measured time histories of wave elevation as the relative heave motion between the two buoys then they recorded the measured output power from the physical leg for 900 s for 8 different sea states in the present numerical simulation authors also generated the wave elevation time histories for 900 s for the same sea states and used them as the input relative displacement of the same numerical leg the wave elevation time series were generated by superposing 100 regular waves from the pm pierson moskowitz spectrum fig 9 shows the time history examples of wave elevation the emf the induced current and input and output powers obtained by our numerical simulation in the case of significant wave height h s 0 44 m zero crossing period t z 6 4 s and load resistance r l 3 9 ω the time histories are presented for the first 100 s the leg related frequencies are higher than those of wave elevation in other words the generator dynamics solver requires smaller time steps than the floating body dynamics solver the 120 degree phase difference of the three phase system was also confirmed in the time histories as summarized in table 4 the calculated average output powers are well matched with those from experiments i e their maximum difference is only 5 2 the results in table 4 demonstrate that the developed numerical leg solver can be utilized for the ensuing sr wec simulations 5 results and discussions 5 1 frequency domain simulation the frequency domain simulation was firstly conducted to compute the hydrodynamic coefficients and forces on the outer cylinder a 3d diffraction radiation program wamit lee 1995 was used to estimate the frequency dependent added mass the radiation damping coefficient and the first order wave excitation force these outputs were utilized in the time domain simulation sr wec is half submerged and the submerged surface panels were modeled as shown in fig 10 30 wave frequencies were selected from 0 1 rad s to 5 0 rad s and the wave direction was parallel to the longitudinal direction of sr wec the mass matrix is based on the entire sr wec see table 1 including the magnet assembly located at the center of gravity of sr wec fig 11 shows the resulting surge heave and pitch response amplitude operators raos after convergence test with different panel numbers as in the previous study jin et al 2019 the converged results are given in fig 11 the pitch natural frequency is 1 65 rad s 3 81 s and thus excellent sliding performance is expected at low sea states the computed added masses and radiation damping coefficients for the 3 dof motions are plotted in fig 12 5 2 time domain simulation the floater mooring leg coupled dynamics simulations were performed in time domain for the performance estimation of sr wec first the leg model was established through the initial parametric study with variable magnitudes of emf and load resistance a single phase winding was employed in this study other generator parameters were the same as the parameters given in prudell et al 2010 second the magnet assembly s travel length the coefficient of restitution at both ends and the mass of the magnet assembly were selected for enhancing sr wec s performance after each stage the selected parameters were used as fixed parameters for the next parametric study last the power generation performance was quantitatively evaluated with the selected parameters under various random wave excitations the time domain model accounts for the viscous drag force on the outer cylinder for the translational motions the morison equation was utilized with a drag coefficient of 0 5 acting at the outer cylinder s center of gravity taking advantage of reference value in the experimental study at the representative surface roughness and reynolds number thompson 1980 for the rotational motions a viscous damping ratio of 3 was assumed and inputted to the external damping matrix b i j e the time step in the time domain simulation was 0 005 s to accommodate the generator dynamics accurately 5 2 1 environmental condition the jonswap wave spectrum was used for generating the time history of random waves the range of significant wave heights was from 1 to 3 5 m while that of peak periods was from 4 to 11 s the time history of wave elevations was generated by the superposition of 100 regular waves and signal repetition was prevented by the adoption of randomly perturbed frequency intervals the total simulation time for each case was 1200 s for which the ramping time of 300 s was not included in the statistical assessment the enhancement parameter γ in the jonswap wave spectrum was estimated by the proposed equation in ref veritas 2000 22 γ 5 on t p h s 3 6 γ exp 5 75 1 15 t p h s on 3 6 t p h s 5 γ 1 on 5 t p h s 5 2 2 parametric study 1 magnitudes of emf and load resistance magnitudes of emf or magnitudes of pto force i e term b f l c and load resistance were first considered to design the pto system the pto force acting on both the magnet and armature assemblies is a function of the induced current as given in eq 14 and the induced current is also related to the magnitudes of emf phase and load resistances and phase inductance then it is important to observe the relationship between these parameters and output power in other words the proper selection of these parameters can provide excellent sliding performance and output power simultaneously considering that emf is a function of the relative velocity and the relative velocity also results from the pto force which is induced by the load resistance the following parametric study can help in clarifying the role of leg parameters to find improved output power in this parametric study load resistance and the magnitude of emf were in the range of 10 ω 200 ω 10 ω interval and 100 t m 500 t m 100 t m interval respectively during the parametric studies 3 wave conditions were selected as summarized in table 5 the sliding length the coefficient of restitution and the mass of the magnet assembly were fixed at 3 m 0 38 i e obtained in the actuator test and 400 kg respectively fig 13 shows the time histories of displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction emf induced current output power and pitch motion of the outer cylinder at various load resistances and for hs 2 m in fig 13 we show the simulation results for three representative load resistances of 20 50 and 80 ω to explain results better with time histories while the magnitude of emf was set to 300 t m the sliding performance varies with different load resistances as shown in fig 13 a and b both sliding displacements and velocities increase with the increasing load resistance the trend of emf is similar to that of relative velocity i e larger emf at larger load resistance as shown in fig 13 c however the current is inversely proportional to load resistance as represented in fig 13 d the smallest induced current in the circuit contributes to the reduction of the pto force as a result the highest output power is acquired at the load resistance of 80 ω as shown in fig 13 e time histories for other load resistance cases over 80 ω were also checked the results show that even if the sliding performance is better the higher output power is not observed owing to a large reduction in the current that is a source of output power moreover it is confirmed that the motion of the magnet assembly is highly influenced by the pitch motion of the outer cylinder when fig 13 a and b is compared with fig 13 f in comparison between fig 13 a and e it turns out that the given design has significant power generation when the reaction velocity occurs from the collision fig 14 shows the average output power and load resistance at different magnitudes of emf and wave conditions the average output power is obtained from the time histories measured for 900 s the observed load resistance with the highest output power at each magnitude of emf is the same regardless of wave conditions the larger the magnitude of emf the higher the load resistance besides when the magnitude of emf is higher than 300 t m there is no change in output power as the magnitude of emf increases and this phenomenon is observed regardless of the sea state the magnitude of emf and load resistance that produce the maximum average output power are 300 t m and 80 ω respectively these selected leg parameters were to be fixed for the next parametric study 5 2 3 parametric study 2 travel length the travel length of the magnet assembly defined as the length between two ends minus the length of the magnet assembly can improve the sliding performance various lengths of 2 m 6 m were selected with 1 m interval and the proper length was evaluated the coil is installed at the full length fig 15 shows the time histories of displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction output power and pitch motion of the outer cylinder at the different travel lengths the magnet assembly can slide until it reaches both ends in fig 15 a and b interestingly the magnet displacements and velocities become maximum when the travel length is 4 m when the travel length is 2 m the magnet assembly has to stop before it reaches the potentially maximum velocity when the travel length is 6 m the magnet does not slide the full length under the given wave condition as in fig 15 so there is no improvement in output power the magnet assembly gradually stops due to its inertial forces even after the pitch motion of the outer cylinder is switched in another direction in this case it can miss the best moment to slide in the other direction therefore for the given wave conditions the travel length at which average power becomes the highest is 4 m as presented in fig 15 c moreover the timely collisions at the ends are beneficial in increasing magnet sliding velocity as in the case of travel lengths of 2 m and 4 m furthermore significant variations between cases are observed after contacts at both ends occur under the large pitch motion of the outer cylinder 780 800 s when there is no contact under the small pitch motion 755 780 s there is a minor difference in velocity since other parameters and the pitch motions are the same among them fig 16 presents average output powers at different travel lengths and wave conditions in the case of h s 2 m t p 6 s and h s 3 m t p 7 s the output power does not increase even though the travel length is increased beyond 4 m instead the output power rather starts to decrease after travel length 4 m therefore travel length 4 m can be considered as the appropriate travel length after averaging the output powers of the 3 sea states the case is also benefited by timely end collision higher significant wave heights generate greater pitch motions which increases the sliding performance and output power however when the pitch motion is much larger than that of current environmental conditions the design with the travel length of 6 m may be able to generate higher output power which is discussed in section 5 2 6 if the travel length is too short the magnet assembly quickly reaches one end and remains almost stationary until it slides in the other direction so the corresponding power generation efficiency becomes relatively low the travel length was fixed to be 4 m for the next parametric study 5 2 4 parametric study 3 coefficient of restitution it was found in the previous parametric study that the timely elastic collision at both ends 2 m and 2 m helps the magnet assembly to better slide with rebounding velocities to confirm the improvement of the sliding performance due to the reactive velocity from the collision we analyzed the effect of the coefficient of restitution on the average output power in this regard three restitution coefficients 0 01 0 38 given by the actuator test and 0 8 were considered fig 17 shows the time histories of displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction output power and pitch motion of the outer cylinder with the three different coefficients of restitution again we observe the contact induced substantial variations under the different coefficients of restitution when there is a significant pitch motion of the outer cylinder 780 800 s there is no contact when pitch motion is small i e 750 780 s which leads to a minor difference in the sliding velocities since other parameters and the pitch motions are the same among them when the timely collisions happen at the last stage of re 0 38 and 0 8 cases 780 800 s the sliding velocities are increased due to the beneficial rebounding velocities after collisions the higher the coefficient of restitution the better the sliding performance and higher output power this implies that the sliding performance can further be enhanced by placing highly restitutive elastic springs at both ends fig 18 presents the average output power at different coefficients of restitution and wave conditions and the above trends can further be confirmed for the following parametric study the coefficient of restitution was to be fixed at 0 8 5 2 5 parametric study 4 mass of the magnet assembly since gravity is the primary source of power generation the mass of the magnet assembly can significantly affect the sliding performance in this regard the magnet assembly s mass was varied in the simulations from 200 kg to 400 kg whereas the previous best parameters including the coefficient of restitution of 0 8 were fixed fig 19 shows the time histories of displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction output power and pitch motion of the outer cylinder at different magnet masses as shown in fig 19 a c the heavier the mass of the magnet assembly the higher the sliding kinematics and output power moreover significant variations among the cases are noticeably detected when contacts at both ends take place under the substantial pitch motion 180 200 s the average output power is presented in fig 20 for various magnet masses and sea states and it also supports the previously mentioned trend thus the mass of magnet assembly 400 kg was used in the previous simulations of course much larger magnet mass beyond 400 kg will generate higher power but may cause larger structural impacts at both ends and also affect the pitch performance through the moment induced by the magnet mass and time varying pitch mass moment of inertia the center rod should also be strong enough to support a much larger magnet mass without bending 5 2 6 output power calculations in various random wave conditions the previous parametric studies demonstrate that adjustment of various system parameters can significantly improve the sliding performance and output power under 3 different wave conditions as shown in figs 14 16 18 and 20 much more time domain simulations with enlarged random wave conditions were additionally performed to check the corresponding output power by using the parameters selected from the previous sections the selected values of emf magnitude load resistance travel length coefficient of restitution and magnet mass were 300 t m 80 ω 4 m 0 8 and 400 kg respectively denoted as case 1 as summarized in table 6 we additionally simulated four more cases cases 2 5 to compare whether the chosen parameters can provide high output power fig 21 shows the average output powers and rms root mean square values of pitch motion of the outer cylinder at different significant wave heights from 1 m to 3 5 m and peak periods from 4 s to 11 s recall that the pitch natural frequency is 1 65 rad s 3 81 s in this case large pitch motions usually occur at low peak periods being closer to the pitch natural period as shown in fig 21 f larger wave height also causes larger pitch motion under the identical peak period combining these two facts it can be expected that the largest average output power occurs at the bottom right corner of fig 21 a e i e the lowest peak period and the highest wave height h s 3 5 m t p 4 s for case 1 the corresponding average output power under the wave condition is 2 66 kw however even with hs 3 5 m at t p 11 s right top corner the average output power is only 0 13 kw therefore the present sr wec is particularly designed to be efficient at low sea states which is good since they cover more than 90 of typical annual sea states in general case 1 shows the relatively high average output power compared with other cases there are several environmental conditions where case 2 has slightly higher output power than case 1 noticeably in some conditions with the significant pitch motion at high wave height and low peak period case 3 in which travel length is 6 m generates higher power than case 1 for example the maximum output power is 3 82 kw for case 3 at h s 3 5 m t p 4 s however case 1 still produces higher annual average power in that the occurrence of such wave condition is low these comparisons support the parametric studies role in finding a good combination of parameters to improve output power the metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm and harmony search can be applied to optimize parameters to enhance output power further and the results of the present parametric studies can be utilized to define the upper and lower boundaries of each parameter we calculated the capture width ratios for case 1 with the average wave power and generated output power under random wave excitations babarit 2015 which are 9 3 at h s 1 5 m and t p 4 s and 3 3 at h s 1 m and t p 5 s finally we also checked the safety of the mooring line for various sea states as presented in fig 22 in this case studlink r4 chain was used whose minimum breaking load mbl is 263 9 kn when the safety factor of 1 67 is applied as suggested by the api mooring design guideline the allowable maximum mooring tension is 158 kn in the present simulations the maximum mooring tension is 126 7 kn in the case of hs 3 5 m and t p 4 s for which the largest outer cylinder pitch motions and maximum power generation occur it proves that the given mooring design is acceptable in addition the rms value of mooring tension is large at high significant wave height and low peak period similar to output power and pitch motion 6 conclusions in this study the performance of sr wec was evaluated by the floater mooring leg coupled time domain simulations sr wec consists of two bodies the outer cylinder with an armature assembly body 1 and a magnet assembly body 2 sliding inside for sr wec the sliding displacement and velocity are mainly caused by gravity acceleration and the outer cylinder s motions and they lead to electrical power generation during the developing stage the proposed simulation tool was verified step by step by comparisons with laboratory tests first the numerically simulated sliding displacement and velocity were compared with those of heave pitch coupled actuator tests by authors which shows a good match second the present generator dynamics numerical solver was verified by the leg experiment of prudell et al 2010 and the overall comparison is also excellent after verifying the simulation program a series of parametric studies were carried out under different random wave conditions to find the appropriate design with increased output power the selected design parameters were the magnitude of emf load resistance travel length mass of the magnet assembly and restitution coefficient of end dampers the time histories of sliding displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly and output power show that the performance of sr wec depends appreciably on those design parameters after setting all the optimized parameters the average output power was evaluated under largely extended random wave conditions the best performance of the sr wec is observed when the wave peak period is close to its natural period with the highest wave height the resulting peak average output power is 2 66 kw at h s 3 5 m and t p 4 s by riding along the surface without much structural resistance mooring and structural designs can have benefits the sr wec performance can further be improved with semi active and or active control systems such as the movable ring type masses adjusting pitch natural frequency latching control and pto force control which will be the subject of next study credit authorship contribution statement chungkuk jin conceptualization methodology software

21304,in this study we devised a new wec wave energy converter called sr wec surface riding wec the sr wec consists of two bodies the outer cylinder with an armature assembly body 1 and a magnet assembly body 2 sliding inside the armature for the sr wec the relative sliding displacement and velocity are caused by gravity acceleration and the outer cylinder s motions and they lead to electrical power generation to evaluate its performance a numerical simulation tool was developed which solves the fully coupled floater mooring generator dynamics during the developing stage the appropriate hydrodynamics model sliding mechanics model mooring dynamics model and leg linear electric generator electro magnetic model were independently developed and then fully coupled in time

converter surface riding linear electric generator mooring line floater mooring generator interaction time domain simulation 1 introduction renewable energy resources such as wind ocean wave and solar energy have been considered as an alternative and environmentally friendly option to replace conventional energy resources they are expected to account for 47 7 of the total energy consumption in 2040 based on a global renewable energy scenario kralova and sjöblom 2010 among them ocean waves are a promising energy resource because of its highest energy density 2 3 kw m2 continuous availability up to 90 of the time and minimal negative environmental impact drew et al 2009 the global gross resource of the ocean wave is estimated to be in a range of 1 10 tw gadonneix et al 2010 mork et al 2010 in this regard various wecs wave energy converters have been proposed among many technical aspects the proper selection of the pto power take off system is important in improving conversion efficiency hydraulic systems e g pelamis henderson 2006 turbines e g wave dragon kofoed et al 2006 and direct drive wecs e g powerbuoy edwards and mekhiche 2014 are popular pto systems various types of wec devices and their simulation methodologies were presented in ref babarit et al 2011 the hydraulic pto system requires additional energy conversion to operate the rotary generator which makes a device complex additional energy losses are inevitable in the process of double energy conversion also the complexity of the conversion process can lead to reliability and maintenance issues baker and mueller 2001 especially in harsh ocean environments on the other hand direct drive wecs with the leg linear electric generator produce power from the relative translational motions between the permanent magnet and coiled armature they do not require any intermediate step thus the design can be simpler drew et al 2009 in recent decades a number of experiments and numerical studies have been performed on the direct drive wecs for example prudell et al 2010 devised a freely floating dual buoy wec and conducted a laboratory experiment to estimate its performance kim et al 2017 designed a dual buoy wec which utilized three resonant motions of two bodies and moon pool and carried out a laboratory experiment under regular and random wave conditions their experimental results were also compared with the results of time domain dynamics simulations under the random wave excitation jin et al 2020 lejerskog et al 2015 conducted large scale sea tests of the point absorber that was mounted at the seabed of the lysekil research site in sweden they concluded that higher output power can be achieved in upward motions than downward motions stelzer and joshi 2012 also studied a similar point absorber under random wave excitations using numerical simulations zheng et al 2020 designed the variable aperture point absorber for enhancing survivability reducing cost and improving wave power absorption linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic models were compared for the two body wec ji et al 2020 and submerged point absorber schubert et al 2020 in addition various design optimization strategies have been adopted to improve the performance of the direct drive wec parametric studies were performed to find the proper generator and structural design hong et al 2016 amiri et al 2016 resonance of dual body wecs was adjusted to maximize the relative motion by using linear springs connected between two bodies park et al 2013 gao et al 2016 engström et al 2011 the tuned inertia mass was utilized in a point absorber to increase power absorption and broaden the effective wave frequency range haraguchi and asai 2020 control systems such as latching control kim et al 2019 and model predictive control son and yeung 2017 were adopted to improve the overall output power in this study we developed a hydro dynamics linear generator fully coupled simulation program to investigate the performance of an innovative sr wec surface riding wec devised by authors kang and kim 2019 it mainly consists of an outer cylinder equipped with a coiled armature assembly and a magnet assembly sliding along a center rod see fig 1 compared to other direct drive wecs that utilize relative heave motions sr wec uses the sliding motion inside a surface riding and pitching horizontal cylinder it is hard to find similar concepts and relevant simulations in publicly available literature blažauskas et al 2015 the sr wec is specially devised to generate appreciable electrical power even in low sea states which typically cover 90 of the annual sea state e g east coast in the u s 31 887 n 74 921 w it is possible since both wave heights and lengths are reduced in low sea states for wave slopes to remain about the same sr wec generates the sliding motion by the gravity acceleration while most existing leg based devices utilize inertial acceleration various optimization methods can be employed to enhance output power further to evaluate the sr wec s performance the present time domain simulation program was developed and used to solve the fully coupled floater mooring generator interaction several major considerations and algorithms were made to develop the numerical model first the outer cylinder interacts with waves and thus its hydrodynamic coefficients and wave excitation force were estimated based on potential theory in frequency domain lee 1995 and they were utilized in the subsequent time domain motion simulation program second the sliding mechanism of the magnet assembly with time varying contact and friction forces should be well understood and modeled third a reasonable collision model was developed at both ends of the outer cylinder to assess the impact induced velocity load and fatigue by the magnet assembly fourth the pto force between the coil on the outer cylinder and the sliding magnet assembly should be well estimated to correctly estimate the resisting force and generated power fifth a single point mooring system is installed and connected to the outer cylinder for a station keeping purpose and the floater mooring interaction should be solved the numerical modeling of sliding mechanism and collision at both ends was validated through comparisons with the physical system after mounting and pitching the sr wec on harmonic actuators with the pto off the numerical generator dynamics was also verified through comparisons with the laboratory experiments of prudell et al 2010 with pto on afterward a series of parametric studies were performed with the validated numerical model to better understand the system s sensitivity on the design parameters so that the results can be used as the improved design for given annual sea states 2 design and operation principle the design and operation principle of sr wec are presented in fig 1 the device mainly consists of the outer cylinder equipped with the armature assembly and the magnet assembly the magnet assembly is composed of neodymium ndfeb magnets supporting lamination steel and linear ball bearings in detail the linear ball bearings in the magnet assembly are in contact with a fixed center rod which allows single degree of freedom sdof motion in the sliding direction along the center rod the armature assembly composed of coil and lamination steel is installed to the outer cylinder and surrounds the magnet assembly the outer cylinder interacts with the surrounding ocean fluid the spring damper system which is referred to as the end damper is located at both ends of the outer cylinder to alleviate collision damage from the magnet assembly ring masses are also located at both ends to provide a large mass moment of inertia about the y axis m 55 so that pitch natural frequency 1 65 rad s can be close to peak frequency in low sea states as shown in fig 2 a single point mooring line is connected to the bottom center of the outer cylinder for position keeping and cylinder s longitudinal direction is parallel to the dominant wave direction table 1 summarizes important design parameters electric power is generated by relative motions between the magnet and armature assemblies as shown in fig 1 b the relative motion by sliding is mainly induced by the pitch motion of the outer cylinder as the inclination angle is larger than the minimum sliding angle the magnet assembly starts to slide by gravity the detailed formulations are given in section 3 3 coupled time domain simulation a hydrodynamics mechanics generator fully coupled time domain simulation program was developed to assess the performance of the sr wec i e floater mooring generator interactions were solved at each time step to evaluate their dynamic responses mooring tension and electric output power the time domain dynamic analysis allows non linear loads to be considered section 3 explains the theory and formulations of the time domain simulation and coupling methods among the floater i e outer cylinder magnet assembly and mooring line 3 1 floating body model in time domain the 6 dof dynamic responses of the outer cylinder can be evaluated by solving the cummins equation cummins 1962 as 1 m i j a i j ξ j t b i j e ξ j t k i j ξ j t f i w t f i c t f i m t f i g t f i s t i j 1 2 6 where m i j is the mass matrix a i j is the added mass matrix at the

by the interaction between the magnet and armature assemblies and f i s is the spring force vector to couple the outer cylinder with the mooring line the upper dot in the equations represents the time derivative of a variable based on the assumption of linearity a i j f i c and f i w can be obtained from the equivalent relationship between the impulse response function based equations in time

1995 the morison equation is widely used for the estimation of wave forces on slender bodies at its instantaneous position which is composed of the linear inertia and non linear drag terms morison et al 1950 the morison equation is recommended for the wave force evaluation of slender structures when the ratio of outer diameter d to wavelength λ w is less than 0 2 d λ w 0 12 at natural period 3 81 s faltinsen 1993 since the inertia term was obtained from the diffraction radiation potential theory only the non linear drag term was added for the viscous drag force evaluation the morison drag force per unit length for the moving cylindrical body can be written as 6 f i m t 1 2 ρ c d d u i n ξ i n u i n ξ i n where ρ is the density of water c d is the drag coefficient and u i is the surrounding fluid s velocity superscript n is the normal direction of a variable for sr wec the mass of the magnet assembly was designed to be much lighter 1 9 than that of the outer cylinder in this regard we evaluated the dynamic responses of the outer cylinder based on the total mass of the sr wec including the mass of the magnet assembly instead of solving the two body fully coupled interaction between the outer cylinder and the magnet assembly 3 2 mooring line model and coupling with floating body as mentioned before a single point mooring line was employed to maintain sr wec s original position therefore the outer cylinder s motions are to be coupled with the mooring dynamics two governing equations were established to estimate the mooring dynamics and tension based on a rod theory garrett 1982 in which generalized coordinate was used and twisting motions and moments were neglected fig 3 presents the rod theory s coordinate system the generalized coordinate system is along the line and thus the geometric nonlinearity can be automatically considered kim et al 2005 in the generalized coordinate system r i s t represents the position vector in 3d which is a function of arc length s and time t to define space curve r i denotes the unit tangent vector to the space curve while r i and r i r i are the principal normal and bi normal vectors respectively the prime in the equations denotes the spatial derivative of a variable the equation of motion with the line s tension and bending effects can be described as follows 7 e i r i λ r i q i d m d r i i 1 2 3 where e is young s modulus i is the second moment of cross sectional area λ t e i κ 2 with effective tension t and local curvature κ while q i d and m d are the distributed force vector and mass per unit length in this case q i d is the sum of wet weight vector per unit length w i r w i r b i r where w i r and b i r are weight and buoyancy per unit length and the wave force vector per unit length f i d according to the morison equation f i d for the cylindrical body can be written as 8 f i d c a ρ a e r i n c m ρ a e u i n 1 2 c d ρ d u i n r i n u i n r i n where c a and c m are respectively the added mass and inertia coefficients a e is the external cross sectional area with w i r and f i d eq 7 can be rewritten as 9 m d r i c a ρ a e r i n e i r i λ r i w w i r c m ρ a e u u i n 1 2 c d ρ d u i n r r i n u i n r r i n the mooring tension can separately be estimated by the extensible condition assuming linear and small extension the mooring tension can be estimated by the following relationship 10 r i r i 1 t e a t 1 2 t e a t 1 2 λ e a t where a t a e a i with the internal cross sectional area a i t is the tension and λ t e i κ 2 is the lagrange multiplier the equation of motion and extensible condition in eqs 9 and 10 are therefore governing equations for mooring line analysis finally finite element fe formulations of the governing equations were further derived by using the galerkin method which is detailed by refs jin and kim 2020 ran 2000 in the fe method nonlinear behaviors can be captured by dividing a line into multiple high order elements a mooring line was coupled with the outer cylinder through translational and rotational springs which is a practical approach to connect several objects conveniently the interaction force is delivered to the outer cylinder as spring force and equal and opposite force is also transmitted to the top of the mooring line assuming the hinged connection zero rotational stiffness was implemented the spring force vector transmitted from the mooring line to the floating body can be expressed as ran et al 1999 11 f i s k i j t j k u k r u j c where k i j represents the coupling stiffness matrix t j k denotes the transformation matrix between the floater s origin and the connection position while u k r and u j c are respectively the displacement vectors of the rigid body and connection position 3 3 linear generator model leg was modeled to couple the two bodies and generate electric power in the proposed design the coiled armature assembly is attached to the outer cylinder whereas the magnet assembly freely slides along the center rod the relative velocity between the armature and magnet assemblies induces the emf electromotive force whose unit is voltage according to faraday s law of induction the induced emf e b proportionally increases with a change in flux linkage λ f l n c φ m and can be calculated as rhinefrank et al 2006 12 e b d λ f l d t d ξ 7 d t d λ f l d ξ 7 ξ 7 d λ f l d ξ 7 where n c is the number of turns φ m is magnetic flux and ξ 7 is the displacement of the magnet assembly relative to the armature assembly the emf is proportional to the relative velocity based on the rl resistor inductor circuit the following relationship can be used to compute the induced current rhinefrank et al 2006 13 e b r l r c i c l p d i c d t where r l and r c are load and phase resistances respectively i c is the induced electric current and l p is the phase inductance the first order ode ordinary differential equation should be solved to acquire the induced current and the fourth order runge kutta method was used after calculating the induced current the pto force can be estimated by using the lorentz force equation the electrons of electric current experience the magnetic force under the given magnetic field which can be regarded as an interaction force between the two bodies the pto force on the coiled armature assembly in the sliding direction can be written as 14 f g n i c d l b m b m l c i c where b m b f cos π ξ 7 τ with the magnitude of magnetic flux density b f and pole pitch τ is the magnetic flux density and l c is the length of the coil that receives influences by the magnetic field at each time according to newton s third law the equal and opposite force also acts on the magnet assembly since it acts in the sliding direction at each time step the pto force was decomposed to calculate f i g for the outer cylinder in general b f can be evaluated from electro magnetic filed simulation however in this study a parametric study was conducted to find the proper b f in the parametric study b f l c is defined as the magnitude of emf or pto force finally the generated electric output power can be expressed as 15 p o i c 2 r l i c v o where v o is the output voltage 3 4 magnet assembly dynamics relative displacement based sdof equation of motion for magnet assembly in sliding direction along the center rod can be written as 16 m b ξ 7 t f l t f g n t where m b is the mass of the magnet assembly and f l is the sliding force the working principle of the magnet assembly was previously described fig 1 b as the inclination angle of the outer cylinder ξ 5 i e pitch motion is higher than the minimum sliding angle associated with the given friction coefficient and lubrication condition the magnet assembly starts to slide by gravity along the center rod the sdof was defined in the body fixed coordinate system located to the center of gravity of the outer cylinder since the coordinate center of the magnet assembly continuously moves at each time step due to the dynamic motions of the outer cylinder the non inertia reference frame i e the accelerated coordinate system was introduced to always keep the magnet assembly s coordinate center with respect to the center of gravity of the outer cylinder the sdof motion is therefore that of the magnet assembly relative to the body fixed coordinate system of the outer cylinder in the sliding direction in this coordinate system the inertial forces which are also known as the fictitious forces should be added as external force terms the inertial force is the production of the mass of the magnet assembly and acceleration of the outer cylinder considering the head wave condition sway motion is generally small thus inertia force from sway motion was neglected therefore f l which includes inertial forces can be formulated as 17 f l t m b g sin ξ 5 ξ 3 sin ξ 5 ξ 1 cos ξ 5 sgn ξ 7 μ m b g cos ξ 5 ξ 3 cos ξ 5 ξ 1 sin ξ 5 where g is gravity acceleration and μ is friction coefficient the equation of motion given in eq 17 does not account for the contact mechanism between two bodies at both ends of the outer cylinder to realize the contact mechanism at both ends of the outer cylinder conservation of momentum with the partial elastic condition was used then the displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction after a collision can be evaluated the conservation of momentum and the coefficient of restitution can be expressed as 18 m a v a t n m b v b t n m a v a t n 1 m b v b t n 1 19 r e v b t n 1 v a t n 1 v a t n v b t n where v a and v b are the velocities of the objects 1 and 2 m a and m b are the masses of object 1 and 2 and r e is the coefficient of restitution by combining eqs 18 and 19 the velocity of object 1 after the collision can be derived as 20 v a t n 1 m a v a t n m b v b t n m b r e v b t n v a t n m a m b for sr wec the mass of the outer cylinder is designed to be much larger than that of the magnet assembly therefore the terms related to the mass of the magnet assembly in eq 20 can be neglected moreover for the same reason the contribution of a collision to the outer cylinder s motion is assumed to be small and the velocity of the outer cylinder is not influenced by the collision also the non inertia reference frame keeps the velocity of the outer cylinder zero from the view of the magnet assembly based on the above considerations eq 20 can be simplified with the current variables of sr wec as 21 ξ 7 t n 1 r e ξ 7 t n when the magnet assembly does not contact both ends eq 16 was used to solve the dynamic equation of motion after the contact eq 21 gave the instantaneous displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly 3 5 procedure of time domain simulation fig 4 presents a flowchart describing the procedure of the present fully coupled floater mooring generator time domain simulation first the frequency domain hydrodynamic computation was completed to obtain the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients and forces for the outer cylinder also the initial parameters of the two bodies outer cylinder and magnet assembly mooring line and generator were entered second the retardation function and the added mass at infinite frequency were calculated third at each time step forces on two bodies and a mooring line were evaluated which includes the wave pto spring and sliding forces fourth the coupled equations of motion were solved by the adams moulton implicit method combined with the adams bashforth explicit method in which iteration within a time step is not needed the third and fourth steps were repeated until the last time step 4 validation of numerical model two comparative studies between the numerical simulation and experiment were carried out to validate the proposed simulation program i the sliding mechanism of the magnet assembly without the leg was confirmed by comparing the numerical simulations with the heave pitch coupled actuator tests conducted by authors and ii leg dynamics by the present numerical simulation at different sea states was validated against laboratory tests conducted by prudell et al 2010 4 1 validation of sliding mechanism fig 5 shows the test setup of the heave pitch coupled actuator test table 2 presents the dimension and mass of cylinders an acrylic hollow tube was used for inner and outer cylinders while a center rod was made of stainless steel a linear ball bearing ssu20 by thomson was mounted to an inside of the inner cylinder to maximize the sliding performance with a low friction coefficient at both ends of the outer cylinder styrofoam dampers were located to mitigate the impact force there were two actuators a lst series by zaber technology vertically installed at both ends of the outer cylinder so that the heave pitch coupled motion of the outer cylinder can be emulated as the outer cylinder moves with the actuators the inner cylinder slides along the center rod for this test leg was not installed since the main objective of the test was to check the sliding mechanism first the minimum sliding angle of the inner cylinder was checked the inclination angle was increased from 0 2 with an interval of 0 05 which results in the observed minimum sliding angle of around 0 5 the corresponding static friction coefficient was estimated from the minimum sliding angle second the dynamic friction coefficient along the sliding and collision mechanism at the ends were identified at different inclination angles fig 6 shows the displacements of the inner cylinder in the sliding direction at inclination angles of 2 and 3 the dynamic friction coefficient is generally smaller than the static friction coefficient and the identified dynamic friction coefficient is 75 of the static friction coefficient to match the experimental results before a collision occurs also the coefficient of restitution was checked by comparing the transient response after the collision as shown in fig 6 the coefficient of restitution in the range of 0 36 0 39 best matches against the experiments those values were used in the ensuing simulation of sr wec third a heave pitch coupled actuator test was performed and the experimental results were compared with our simulation results fig 7 shows the measured time histories of the outer cylinder s pitch and heave motions and the corresponding displacements and velocities of the inner cylinder are presented in fig 8 the same condition was also inputted in the numerical simulation as shown in fig 8 with the coefficient of restitution of 0 38 the simulated magnitudes and trends of displacement and velocity coincide well against experimental values those well matched sliding responses with the experiments where the collision and those two coupled motions were involved validate the formulation of the sr wec mechanics as explained in the previous section 4 2 validation of generator dynamics the developed leg simulation model was validated with the experimental data given in prudell et al 2010 the present formulations related to generator dynamics were confirmed through this validation in the experiment two body heave type wec with leg was tested in the laboratory armature and magnet assemblies were installed at inner and outer buoys respectively 960 ndfeb magnets were used to construct magnet assembly and the three phase y connection was designed the major leg parameters are summarized in table 3 considering that the leg performance only depends on the relative displacement and velocity the difference in wec type is irrelevant as long as those two inputs are the same in their laboratory test the dynamics of two floating bodies in waves was actually not considered instead they assumed that the inner buoy is stationary while the outer buoy moves with wave elevation under this scenario the heave motion time series of the outer buoy is the same as wave elevation time series while the inner buoy is fixed therefore they actually utilized the measured time histories of wave elevation as the relative heave motion between the two buoys then they recorded the measured output power from the physical leg for 900 s for 8 different sea states in the present numerical simulation authors also generated the wave elevation time histories for 900 s for the same sea states and used them as the input relative displacement of the same numerical leg the wave elevation time series were generated by superposing 100 regular waves from the pm pierson moskowitz spectrum fig 9 shows the time history examples of wave elevation the emf the induced current and input and output powers obtained by our numerical simulation in the case of significant wave height h s 0 44 m zero crossing period t z 6 4 s and load resistance r l 3 9 ω the time histories are presented for the first 100 s the leg related frequencies are higher than those of wave elevation in other words the generator dynamics solver requires smaller time steps than the floating body dynamics solver the 120 degree phase difference of the three phase system was also confirmed in the time histories as summarized in table 4 the calculated average output powers are well matched with those from experiments i e their maximum difference is only 5 2 the results in table 4 demonstrate that the developed numerical leg solver can be utilized for the ensuing sr wec simulations 5 results and discussions 5 1 frequency domain simulation the frequency domain simulation was firstly conducted to compute the hydrodynamic coefficients and forces on the outer cylinder a 3d diffraction radiation program wamit lee 1995 was used to estimate the frequency dependent added mass the radiation damping coefficient and the first order wave excitation force these outputs were utilized in the time domain simulation sr wec is half submerged and the submerged surface panels were modeled as shown in fig 10 30 wave frequencies were selected from 0 1 rad s to 5 0 rad s and the wave direction was parallel to the longitudinal direction of sr wec the mass matrix is based on the entire sr wec see table 1 including the magnet assembly located at the center of gravity of sr wec fig 11 shows the resulting surge heave and pitch response amplitude operators raos after convergence test with different panel numbers as in the previous study jin et al 2019 the converged results are given in fig 11 the pitch natural frequency is 1 65 rad s 3 81 s and thus excellent sliding performance is expected at low sea states the computed added masses and radiation damping coefficients for the 3 dof motions are plotted in fig 12 5 2 time domain simulation the floater mooring leg coupled dynamics simulations were performed in time domain for the performance estimation of sr wec first the leg model was established through the initial parametric study with variable magnitudes of emf and load resistance a single phase winding was employed in this study other generator parameters were the same as the parameters given in prudell et al 2010 second the magnet assembly s travel length the coefficient of restitution at both ends and the mass of the magnet assembly were selected for enhancing sr wec s performance after each stage the selected parameters were used as fixed parameters for the next parametric study last the power generation performance was quantitatively evaluated with the selected parameters under various random wave excitations the time domain model accounts for the viscous drag force on the outer cylinder for the translational motions the morison equation was utilized with a drag coefficient of 0 5 acting at the outer cylinder s center of gravity taking advantage of reference value in the experimental study at the representative surface roughness and reynolds number thompson 1980 for the rotational motions a viscous damping ratio of 3 was assumed and inputted to the external damping matrix b i j e the time step in the time domain simulation was 0 005 s to accommodate the generator dynamics accurately 5 2 1 environmental condition the jonswap wave spectrum was used for generating the time history of random waves the range of significant wave heights was from 1 to 3 5 m while that of peak periods was from 4 to 11 s the time history of wave elevations was generated by the superposition of 100 regular waves and signal repetition was prevented by the adoption of randomly perturbed frequency intervals the total simulation time for each case was 1200 s for which the ramping time of 300 s was not included in the statistical assessment the enhancement parameter γ in the jonswap wave spectrum was estimated by the proposed equation in ref veritas 2000 22 γ 5 on t p h s 3 6 γ exp 5 75 1 15 t p h s on 3 6 t p h s 5 γ 1 on 5 t p h s 5 2 2 parametric study 1 magnitudes of emf and load resistance magnitudes of emf or magnitudes of pto force i e term b f l c and load resistance were first considered to design the pto system the pto force acting on both the magnet and armature assemblies is a function of the induced current as given in eq 14 and the induced current is also related to the magnitudes of emf phase and load resistances and phase inductance then it is important to observe the relationship between these parameters and output power in other words the proper selection of these parameters can provide excellent sliding performance and output power simultaneously considering that emf is a function of the relative velocity and the relative velocity also results from the pto force which is induced by the load resistance the following parametric study can help in clarifying the role of leg parameters to find improved output power in this parametric study load resistance and the magnitude of emf were in the range of 10 ω 200 ω 10 ω interval and 100 t m 500 t m 100 t m interval respectively during the parametric studies 3 wave conditions were selected as summarized in table 5 the sliding length the coefficient of restitution and the mass of the magnet assembly were fixed at 3 m 0 38 i e obtained in the actuator test and 400 kg respectively fig 13 shows the time histories of displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction emf induced current output power and pitch motion of the outer cylinder at various load resistances and for hs 2 m in fig 13 we show the simulation results for three representative load resistances of 20 50 and 80 ω to explain results better with time histories while the magnitude of emf was set to 300 t m the sliding performance varies with different load resistances as shown in fig 13 a and b both sliding displacements and velocities increase with the increasing load resistance the trend of emf is similar to that of relative velocity i e larger emf at larger load resistance as shown in fig 13 c however the current is inversely proportional to load resistance as represented in fig 13 d the smallest induced current in the circuit contributes to the reduction of the pto force as a result the highest output power is acquired at the load resistance of 80 ω as shown in fig 13 e time histories for other load resistance cases over 80 ω were also checked the results show that even if the sliding performance is better the higher output power is not observed owing to a large reduction in the current that is a source of output power moreover it is confirmed that the motion of the magnet assembly is highly influenced by the pitch motion of the outer cylinder when fig 13 a and b is compared with fig 13 f in comparison between fig 13 a and e it turns out that the given design has significant power generation when the reaction velocity occurs from the collision fig 14 shows the average output power and load resistance at different magnitudes of emf and wave conditions the average output power is obtained from the time histories measured for 900 s the observed load resistance with the highest output power at each magnitude of emf is the same regardless of wave conditions the larger the magnitude of emf the higher the load resistance besides when the magnitude of emf is higher than 300 t m there is no change in output power as the magnitude of emf increases and this phenomenon is observed regardless of the sea state the magnitude of emf and load resistance that produce the maximum average output power are 300 t m and 80 ω respectively these selected leg parameters were to be fixed for the next parametric study 5 2 3 parametric study 2 travel length the travel length of the magnet assembly defined as the length between two ends minus the length of the magnet assembly can improve the sliding performance various lengths of 2 m 6 m were selected with 1 m interval and the proper length was evaluated the coil is installed at the full length fig 15 shows the time histories of displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction output power and pitch motion of the outer cylinder at the different travel lengths the magnet assembly can slide until it reaches both ends in fig 15 a and b interestingly the magnet displacements and velocities become maximum when the travel length is 4 m when the travel length is 2 m the magnet assembly has to stop before it reaches the potentially maximum velocity when the travel length is 6 m the magnet does not slide the full length under the given wave condition as in fig 15 so there is no improvement in output power the magnet assembly gradually stops due to its inertial forces even after the pitch motion of the outer cylinder is switched in another direction in this case it can miss the best moment to slide in the other direction therefore for the given wave conditions the travel length at which average power becomes the highest is 4 m as presented in fig 15 c moreover the timely collisions at the ends are beneficial in increasing magnet sliding velocity as in the case of travel lengths of 2 m and 4 m furthermore significant variations between cases are observed after contacts at both ends occur under the large pitch motion of the outer cylinder 780 800 s when there is no contact under the small pitch motion 755 780 s there is a minor difference in velocity since other parameters and the pitch motions are the same among them fig 16 presents average output powers at different travel lengths and wave conditions in the case of h s 2 m t p 6 s and h s 3 m t p 7 s the output power does not increase even though the travel length is increased beyond 4 m instead the output power rather starts to decrease after travel length 4 m therefore travel length 4 m can be considered as the appropriate travel length after averaging the output powers of the 3 sea states the case is also benefited by timely end collision higher significant wave heights generate greater pitch motions which increases the sliding performance and output power however when the pitch motion is much larger than that of current environmental conditions the design with the travel length of 6 m may be able to generate higher output power which is discussed in section 5 2 6 if the travel length is too short the magnet assembly quickly reaches one end and remains almost stationary until it slides in the other direction so the corresponding power generation efficiency becomes relatively low the travel length was fixed to be 4 m for the next parametric study 5 2 4 parametric study 3 coefficient of restitution it was found in the previous parametric study that the timely elastic collision at both ends 2 m and 2 m helps the magnet assembly to better slide with rebounding velocities to confirm the improvement of the sliding performance due to the reactive velocity from the collision we analyzed the effect of the coefficient of restitution on the average output power in this regard three restitution coefficients 0 01 0 38 given by the actuator test and 0 8 were considered fig 17 shows the time histories of displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction output power and pitch motion of the outer cylinder with the three different coefficients of restitution again we observe the contact induced substantial variations under the different coefficients of restitution when there is a significant pitch motion of the outer cylinder 780 800 s there is no contact when pitch motion is small i e 750 780 s which leads to a minor difference in the sliding velocities since other parameters and the pitch motions are the same among them when the timely collisions happen at the last stage of re 0 38 and 0 8 cases 780 800 s the sliding velocities are increased due to the beneficial rebounding velocities after collisions the higher the coefficient of restitution the better the sliding performance and higher output power this implies that the sliding performance can further be enhanced by placing highly restitutive elastic springs at both ends fig 18 presents the average output power at different coefficients of restitution and wave conditions and the above trends can further be confirmed for the following parametric study the coefficient of restitution was to be fixed at 0 8 5 2 5 parametric study 4 mass of the magnet assembly since gravity is the primary source of power generation the mass of the magnet assembly can significantly affect the sliding performance in this regard the magnet assembly s mass was varied in the simulations from 200 kg to 400 kg whereas the previous best parameters including the coefficient of restitution of 0 8 were fixed fig 19 shows the time histories of displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly in the sliding direction output power and pitch motion of the outer cylinder at different magnet masses as shown in fig 19 a c the heavier the mass of the magnet assembly the higher the sliding kinematics and output power moreover significant variations among the cases are noticeably detected when contacts at both ends take place under the substantial pitch motion 180 200 s the average output power is presented in fig 20 for various magnet masses and sea states and it also supports the previously mentioned trend thus the mass of magnet assembly 400 kg was used in the previous simulations of course much larger magnet mass beyond 400 kg will generate higher power but may cause larger structural impacts at both ends and also affect the pitch performance through the moment induced by the magnet mass and time varying pitch mass moment of inertia the center rod should also be strong enough to support a much larger magnet mass without bending 5 2 6 output power calculations in various random wave conditions the previous parametric studies demonstrate that adjustment of various system parameters can significantly improve the sliding performance and output power under 3 different wave conditions as shown in figs 14 16 18 and 20 much more time domain simulations with enlarged random wave conditions were additionally performed to check the corresponding output power by using the parameters selected from the previous sections the selected values of emf magnitude load resistance travel length coefficient of restitution and magnet mass were 300 t m 80 ω 4 m 0 8 and 400 kg respectively denoted as case 1 as summarized in table 6 we additionally simulated four more cases cases 2 5 to compare whether the chosen parameters can provide high output power fig 21 shows the average output powers and rms root mean square values of pitch motion of the outer cylinder at different significant wave heights from 1 m to 3 5 m and peak periods from 4 s to 11 s recall that the pitch natural frequency is 1 65 rad s 3 81 s in this case large pitch motions usually occur at low peak periods being closer to the pitch natural period as shown in fig 21 f larger wave height also causes larger pitch motion under the identical peak period combining these two facts it can be expected that the largest average output power occurs at the bottom right corner of fig 21 a e i e the lowest peak period and the highest wave height h s 3 5 m t p 4 s for case 1 the corresponding average output power under the wave condition is 2 66 kw however even with hs 3 5 m at t p 11 s right top corner the average output power is only 0 13 kw therefore the present sr wec is particularly designed to be efficient at low sea states which is good since they cover more than 90 of typical annual sea states in general case 1 shows the relatively high average output power compared with other cases there are several environmental conditions where case 2 has slightly higher output power than case 1 noticeably in some conditions with the significant pitch motion at high wave height and low peak period case 3 in which travel length is 6 m generates higher power than case 1 for example the maximum output power is 3 82 kw for case 3 at h s 3 5 m t p 4 s however case 1 still produces higher annual average power in that the occurrence of such wave condition is low these comparisons support the parametric studies role in finding a good combination of parameters to improve output power the metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm and harmony search can be applied to optimize parameters to enhance output power further and the results of the present parametric studies can be utilized to define the upper and lower boundaries of each parameter we calculated the capture width ratios for case 1 with the average wave power and generated output power under random wave excitations babarit 2015 which are 9 3 at h s 1 5 m and t p 4 s and 3 3 at h s 1 m and t p 5 s finally we also checked the safety of the mooring line for various sea states as presented in fig 22 in this case studlink r4 chain was used whose minimum breaking load mbl is 263 9 kn when the safety factor of 1 67 is applied as suggested by the api mooring design guideline the allowable maximum mooring tension is 158 kn in the present simulations the maximum mooring tension is 126 7 kn in the case of hs 3 5 m and t p 4 s for which the largest outer cylinder pitch motions and maximum power generation occur it proves that the given mooring design is acceptable in addition the rms value of mooring tension is large at high significant wave height and low peak period similar to output power and pitch motion 6 conclusions in this study the performance of sr wec was evaluated by the floater mooring leg coupled time domain simulations sr wec consists of two bodies the outer cylinder with an armature assembly body 1 and a magnet assembly body 2 sliding inside for sr wec the sliding displacement and velocity are mainly caused by gravity acceleration and the outer cylinder s motions and they lead to electrical power generation during the developing stage the proposed simulation tool was verified step by step by comparisons with laboratory tests first the numerically simulated sliding displacement and velocity were compared with those of heave pitch coupled actuator tests by authors which shows a good match second the present generator dynamics numerical solver was verified by the leg experiment of prudell et al 2010 and the overall comparison is also excellent after verifying the simulation program a series of parametric studies were carried out under different random wave conditions to find the appropriate design with increased output power the selected design parameters were the magnitude of emf load resistance travel length mass of the magnet assembly and restitution coefficient of end dampers the time histories of sliding displacement and velocity of the magnet assembly and output power show that the performance of sr wec depends appreciably on those design parameters after setting all the optimized parameters the average output power was evaluated under largely extended random wave conditions the best performance of the sr wec is observed when the wave peak period is close to its natural period with the highest wave height the resulting peak average output power is 2 66 kw at h s 3 5 m and t p 4 s by riding along the surface without much structural resistance mooring and structural designs can have benefits the sr wec performance can further be improved with semi active and or active control systems such as the movable ring type masses adjusting pitch natural frequency latching control and pto force control which will be the subject of next study credit authorship contribution statement chungkuk jin conceptualization methodology software
