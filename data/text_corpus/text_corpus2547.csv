12735,the application of microalgae in bioremediation of urban and industrial effluents has shown excellent results both in terms of their ability to remove pollutants mainly nitrogen and phosphorus and in the way that this system operates which does not require large structures and is easy to handle microalgae are microscopic beings that have a high photosynthetic efficiency and are able to adapt to the most diverse types of effluents and environmental conditions due to mixotrophic characteristics the treatment performed by these microorganisms can be done in a variety of systems whether open closed or in a hybrid model so the choice is directly correlated with the desirable characteristics in terms of the design and configuration of the system the open system has several economic and operational advantages and for this reason it has been widely used for effluent treatment furthermore it is important to highlight that there is a mechanism of proto cooperation between microalgae and contaminating microorganisms of the open system mainly with bacteria filamentous fungi and yeasts in this work the mechanisms advantages and bottlenecks of the use of symbiotic systems in the bioremediation of urban and industrial effluents will be discussed mainly considering the feasibility and stability of open systems graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations c degree celsius

the demand for potable water and the issues concerning the contamination of water bodies are two of the greatest global challenges of the century several processes have been proposed for treating domestic industrial and agro industrial wastewaters such as bioremediation which uses either a single or a consortium of microorganisms bacteria microalgae fungi and protozoa such as aeration tanks anaerobic ponds aerobic and anaerobic bioreactors activated sludge and biological filters microalgae need a sufficient organic or inorganic carbon source other nutrients and light for photosynthesis nonetheless they can adjust their internal structure to ensure a more efficient use of the available resources in the environment 1 2 the advantages of exploring these photosynthetic organisms for industrial applications mainly in the environmental sector are relevant to ensure a more sustainable future these microorganisms can promote the carbon cycle and consequently its environmental renewal which is vital because carbon is the most prevalent component in this biomass representing approximately 50 of its dry weight 3 4 in the last decades researchers have focused on the use of microalgae and their consortia with other microorganisms other algae bacteria yeast and fungi in wastewater treatment as an alternative and low cost process for producing and recovery of microalgal biomass the use of polyculture for nutrient removal can be very advantageous as the combination of microorganisms with different metabolic activities and diverse adaptive capacity can result in higher rates of nutrient absorption and biomass production 5 this occurs because in most cases the formation of a consortium benefits both species involved mainly as a result of the gas exchange in which the microalgae through photosynthesis releases o2 that helps the growth of other microorganisms bacteria and fungi for example which by respiration can release co2 favouring the development of the microalgae or by the action of extracellular enzymes sometimes released by these microorganisms that act in the breakdown of macromolecules facilitating the absorption of certain nutrients by the microalgae 2 6 however there are still gaps that need to be further assessed to ensure a full understanding of metabolic interactions between these microorganisms as well as regarding the best cultivation systems in terms of the most suitable physical environmental and operational conditions to treat the wastewater microalgae cultivation in closed bioreactors is demonstrated to be the most efficient biomass production system given the possibility of a better control of the operational nutritional environmental parameters such as ph temperature mixing rate light intensity co2 and nutrient concentration among others in addition closed bioreactors facilitate aseptic conditions although installation and maintenance costs are high a more economical and sustainable alternative include open cultivation systems which are enable to use natural light ensuring easier control with lower costs and total aseptic conditions are not required nevertheless the main drawback of open cultivation systems is the contamination contamination can present beneficial results when the synergy between microorganisms promotes biomass growth and contaminant removal however the negative effect of contamination includes the considerable decrease of biomass production and consequently dead of desired species reducing the efficiency of the process in remove contaminants 7 9 this review provides an overview of current sustainable phycoremediation technologies for wastewater treatment focused on open cultivation systems for value added biomass production in this regard this work carries out a bibliographic prospection of articles and patents in order to gather the main sources of information to support the understanding of the subject proposed in this sense it reports on the nutritional needs of microalgae as well as the advantages and challenges of the processes using symbiotic relationships between microalgae and other microorganisms finally it presents the challenges and needs for intensifying research on this promising strategy 2 types of systems for wastewater treatment by microalgae microalgae based wastewater treatment has been the focus of several studies which seek to improve the efficiency of the process and demonstrate its viability in operational and economic terms nevertheless in practice its application is still limited thus treatment systems used in this type of bioremediation are usually found at a laboratory or pilot scale according to li et al 10 overall treatment systems can be divided in groups according to their design and configuration therefore they can be presented as traditional open systems enclosed photobioreactors pbrs or hybrid systems it is important to point out that the choice of reactor used in microalgae based wastewater treatment depends on an initial data assessment namely wastewater nutrient profile parameter adjustment requirements volumetric concentration likely microalgae species employed biomass development capacity among others these are important specifications as they directly influence the reactor design and the type of operation being crucial to ensure stability 11 the main bioreactor configurations are showed in fig 1 open microalgae cultivation systems are widely used for industrial purposes with studies proving the efficiency of this method for wastewater treatment applications open ponds raceway ponds and tanks are common examples of this type of treatment system for instance raceway ponds high rate algal ponds are an evolution of the open ponds usually installed with paddle wheels for mixing to ensure the circulation of microalgae preventing precipitation and improving the photosynthetic rate in terms of operating conditions open systems are more easily operated with a low energy consumption and lower associated costs however issues related to poor lighting distribution and the needed for larger areas in the treatment plants installation and if aeration is used high co2 is lost to the environment especially when used in high concentrations of co2 mixed with atmospheric air 10 12 it is worth mentioning that most effluents are unsterilised thus with a natural microbial load however the treatment of large volumes of wastewater makes unfeasible the sterilisation of the wastewater if the purpose is contaminant removal only on the other hand if high value products can be obtained it can be an option considering the economic return involved therefore open systems can be a more direct option and easily adaptable in addition the assessment of the microbial load either from microalgae or other microbial groups is essential to maintain a symbiotic relation 10 13 closed systems more specifically photobioreactors pbr have several designs with their horizontal tubular design being more commonly used at an industrial scale and for microalgae cultivation this configuration has many advantages such as greater control of parameters ph temperature co2 o2 and other nutrients minimising contamination by other microorganisms as well as ensuring high biomass productivity rates the use of this type of reactor is limited due to high operating and capital costs with its application being limited to processes with high value products nevertheless its use for wastewater treatment is seen as advantageous if a high quality product is desired purity in addition the use of microalgae in this reactor type can lead to drawbacks such as the formation of algae biofilm on the reactor surface thus limiting light penetration into the culture and possibility of cell structure damage as a result of high shear stresses resulted by the operational characteristic of this type of bioreactor 10 11 however some hybrid systems are being developed aimed at reducing the limitations associated to standard configurations for instance membrane photobioreactors are capable of promoting more efficient treatment and higher biomass production with much lower operating costs when compared to closed photobioreactors pbr thus the growth experienced by the membrane sector can lead to even lower costs with this reactor type being a promising alternative to traditional models 10 11 14 16 microalgae biofilm consists of a symbiotic association between microalgae and other microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi this type of biofilm is usually formed on solid surfaces or in the interior of materials its application in remediation processes has various advantages such as a greater production and easiness of microalgal biomass recovery making the process less costly some researchers have analysed the relationship between the cultivation system constantly submerged intermittently submerged and perfused and attachment growth system studies have shown that the use of materials such as nylon and stainless steel in microalgae attachment generate 2 8 times greater biomass production than the open pond systems nevertheless it is worth pointing out that the use of this wastewater treatment method depends on the wastewater s nutrient composition and on the surface area available for developing the biofilm 10 17 18 according to palma et al 19 the use of chlorella like microalgae biofilm in the treatment of mine tailing waters containing heavy metals promoted a considerable removal of pollutants allowing such system to be used for large scale remediation 3 desired wastewater properties microalgal nutrient requirements microalgae are microorganisms that can be found in various water environments ranging from freshwater to marine environments or even wastewaters similar to plants microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms capable of growing in growth media with reasonable nutrient availability namely carbon c either in its organic or inorganic form nitrogen n in its organic or inorganic form as ammonia nitrite and nitrate phosphorus p and other elements that are essential to certain species micronutrients and trace elements its use in bioremediation processes has been increasingly considered given their low costs easy operation as robust environments and complex cultivation systems are not required besides not making use of any fertilizer type as well the high growth rate and the possibility to use the biomass formed during the treatment process for noble purposes 10 20 21 in short for the microalgae development an adequate amount of light water nitrogen carbon phosphorus and other metal ions should be available in the medium wastewater it is important to stress the relevant presence of metal ions as they favour osmoregulation and osmoadaption thus contributing to the photosynthetic metabolic pathway regarding light availability studies show that both the intensity and the light dark relationship photoperiod can influence the microalgal development for instance assays developed under artificial light point out that continuous lighting 24 h promotes a much greater reduction in total phosphorus when compared with solar radiation which provides approximately 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness depending on the location and season of the year on the other hand in terms of light intensity some analyses show that the increase in this parameter can reduce microalgae phosphorus absorption it is necessary to evaluate the biological characteristics of the strains though increasing the uptake of other contaminants expressed for example as cod chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen tn for example 22 23 another factor of great importance concerns the c n and n p ratios not only in terms of nutrient absorption but also regarding the requirement of competitivity between the species found in the medium in urban wastewaters these ratios are often lower than what is recommended to ensure rapid microalgae growth studies which sought to understand the c n ratio and establish a confidence interval for this parameter to ensure efficient wastewater treatment have demonstrated that c n ratios between 5 and 10 lead to greater cod reduction in the medium while higher ratios close to 20 result in a reduction in microalgae biomass development this reduction implies a low pollutant removal rate probably inhibiting microalgae activity due to excess nutrients in addition it may lead to metabolic consequences such as the inability of proportionally absorbing carbon and nitrogen with the latter being the main structural component together with carbon or the formation of excess toxic metabolites as acids in the metabolization of organic matter 10 23 regarding the n p ratio data found in the literature show that both elements are crucial factors for microalgae development according to li et al 10 this ratio can vary between 6 8 and 10 to ensure good biomass development and efficient wastewater treatment moreover it is worth pointing out that the possible adjustments to nutrient conditions in the cultivation medium can favour biomass development and optimise wastewater treatment 10 22 leong and chang 24 analysed the use of microalgae in the bioremediation of heavy metals usually found in industrial effluents the study states that this type of microorganism presents various advantages ranging from its ability to adapt to the medium resistance to extreme environmental conditions besides its high photosynthetic efficiency the research showed that microalgae are capable of absorbing heavy metals such as boron cobalt iron and molybdenum as trace elements for enzymatic process of the cell metabolism nonetheless one of the drawbacks of its use lies on the fact that heavy metals often can be absorbed by other microorganisms that can compete for nutrients with microalgae in addition the variability of nutrients found in this type of effluent can hamper microalgae development due to excessive or deprivation of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and the high turbidity caused by the excess of these metals can limit light penetration hindering the photosynthetic process 10 li et al 10 discuss the viability of using microalgae in the treatment of municipal wastewaters which often present lower nutrient content than synthetic media used in laboratory as effluents contain metals wastewaters can also present variability in the nutrient composition either due to rainfall or due to the variability of their forming sources barsanti and gualtieri 25 state that previous studies have already proven that microalgae are capable of efficiently absorbing nutrients found in this type of effluent consequently reaching a good growth rate promoting wastewater treatment this is possible as microalgae development is linked with its metabolic functions thus these microorganisms require the absorption of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus as well as carbon dioxide co2 or some type of organic matter which is used as a carbon source during the synthesis of proteins nucleic acids phospholipids and other cellular structural components according to li et al 10 the ideal municipal wastewater treatment using microalgae depends on the presence of adequate levels of nitrogen n phosphorus p and chemical oxygen demand cod with values of approximately 130 200 and 2250 mg l 1 respectively de farias silva et al 26 point out that a cod of up to 5000 mg l 1 is possibly treatable depending on the microalgae species as well as on the availability of other nutrients cultivation system and possibility of symbiotic relationships with other microbial groups nonetheless values higher than these usually exhibit toxicity to this microbial group or causes high instability of the system for example significant changes in the ph needing constant control during the process moreover authors have discussed the benefits of co2 addition to the medium as some results have indicated that the addition of high co2 concentrations promoted an increase in microalgae biomass productivity consequently leading to an upsurge in pollutant removal rates especially when associated to greater light availability however it is important to assess the cost of this process as well as the advantages of its use in economic environmental and operating terms because artificial concentrated co2 injection in the system can increase up to 50 of cultivation costs for microalgae 27 28 4 bibliographic and patent prospection of microalgae and their consortia for wastewater treatment seeking new available technologies a technological prospection of scientific articles and patent databases was carried out aiming to verify the literature availability of the subject the prospection was based on the review of scientific articles using the databases science direct 29 capes journals 30 scielo 31 and scopus 32 for patent prospection the following databases were used the brazilian national institute of industrial property inpi 33 world intellectual property organization wipo 34 and the free version of patent inspiration 35 espacenet patent search 36 and derwent world patents index 37 table 1 presents the results of the analysis of the number of scientific articles published in specialised journals table 1 shows the great importance of the subject of wastewater treatment using microalgae which resulted in over 55 000 documents in the databases searched even though overlap can occur between the databases it is also possible to observe the high number of articles related to microalgae and bacteria consortia with a total of 5723 documents with the number of documents related to consortia using fungi and yeast being 3 times lower with a total of 1668 and 1990 respectively nonetheless most works available are mainly related to the application of microalgae in the removal of a specific pollutant such as in the treatment of industrial wastewaters 38 39 municipal wastewater 40 42 biorefineries 43 45 reduction of organic compounds in oil refinery wastewaters 46 wastewater treatment from meat processing and leather manufacturing 47 48 among others in addition these studies used microalgae bacteria consortia for effluent treatment 49 52 biodiesel production 53 dairy effluent 54 56 insecticide removal 57 biotreatment of landfill leachate 58 59 biogas sludge treatment 60 nitrification by microalga bacteria consortia for effluent treatment 61 62 in a consortium between yeast and microalgae for lipid production in wastewater 63 municipal wastewater treatment 64 and in a consortium between microalgae and fungi in piggery effluents 65 remediation of municipal wastewater 66 biogas treatment 67 68 treatment of pharmaceutical groups 69 treatment of wastewater contaminated with arsenic 7 revision on the consortium for effluent treatment 6 70 co cultivation for biomass harvesting 71 75 the change in the number of documents related to the use of consortia in several treatments published over the years 1980 and 2021 was verified in the scopus database 32 highlighting the increased of this research topic this analysis showed a significant increase on research regarding the topic over the last years having been observed that from 2009 that there was an increasing interest on the use of microalgae associated with bacteria mainly in the treatment of industrial effluents as shown in fig 2 similarly the period for collecting information regarding the patents available in the databases was between 1997 and 2022 some patents are protected by the secrecy period though they were included in the present research as showed in table 2 table 2 shows the great importance of effluent treatment using microalgae resulting in approximately 4760 documents in the databases searched nevertheless the patents related to consortia is low with 162 documents on microalga bacterium consortia 60 and 77 on microalga yeast and microalga fungus consortium respectively it is also important to highlight that only 10 documents directly report on effluent treatment such as the cultivation of microalgae in wastewaters 76 77 wastewater treatment using microalgae consortia 78 79 effluent treatment for biofuel production 80 microalgae cultivation in a wastewater dominated by carpet mill effluents 81 bioremediation in industrial effluents 82 development of a microalgae bacteria symbiotic system for pyridine biodegradation 83 5 microalga bacterium consortium the presence of toxic organic compounds and some heavy metals in wastewaters can be lethal for microalgae studies have shown that treatment processes of these effluents can be potentialized by microalgae bacteria consortia when compared to individual cultures of these species according to saravanan 84 this symbiotic relationship can take place in 3 different forms mutualism commensalism and parasitism the algae bacteria interaction mainly occurs through physical contact substrate exchange signal transduction or horizontal gene transfer modifying the physiology and metabolism of both therefore wastewater native bacteria interact directly or indirectly with the microalgae leading to an improvement or inhibition of the microorganisms present the microalgae photosynthetic microorganisms and heterotrophic bacteria consortia are a promising alternative for biological wastewater treatment in order to avoid the external supply of co2 and reduce co2 emissions ensuring a less costly and more ecologically sustainable treatment pathway the treatment is undertaken through a photosynthetic process in which microalgae use light and co2 and produce oxygen while bacteria use oxygen to remove nitrogen through nitrification denitrification and organic matter bio oxidation thus producing co2 allowing microalgae to carry out mixotrophy contributing to the removal of organic matter 5 85 as showed in fig 3 in addition to oxygen carbon dioxide exchange studies show that these mutual interactions are very complex and can be either cooperative or competitive some advantages of algae bacteria consortia include synergistic relationships between microorganisms resistance to adverse conditions oxygen that is released from algae photosynthesis which reduces costs through aeration for bacteria development co2 assimilation by algae reduces the environmental impact greater efficiency in the removal of nutrients and cod reduction of autonomous systems of algae and bacteria among others on the other hand some of the substances excreted by bacteria can hamper algae growth or some algae presenting an antibacterial effect in addition the increase in ph and temperature due to the association to algae metabolism can be prejudicial to the bacteria strains 5 50 this symbiotic relationship was successfully applied in the treatment of several wastewaters table 3 presents an overview of the cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp removal efficiency by the different microalgae cyanobacteria and bacteria consortia in different effluent types with these data in mind the use of microalgae bacteria polyculture for effluent bioremediation has proven to be an advantageous alternative resulting in greater contaminant removal rates as well as higher nutrient absorption and biomass production main microalgal strains used include the genera chlorella scenedesmus acutodemus tetradesmus and chamydomonas for cyanobacteria anabaena microcystis and oscillatoria are cited in terms of bacteria as the range is larger the use of natural microbiota from wastewater treatment plants or from the natural environment is more versatile it is important to point out that only the removal rate of the pollutants is not sufficient to consider the process efficient because it depends on the initial concentration of them so always should be evaluated both parameters as presented in table 3 6 microalga and yeast consortium microalgae are known by their oxygen production and their efficiency in removing nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewaters on the other hand organic matter removal is low in these microorganisms due to their slow growth requiring greater cultivation times to reach high biomass and lipids concentration in the context of biodiesel from microbial sources which microalgae is widely linked even though they can use heterotrophy mixotrophic beings nonetheless oleaginous yeasts are highly efficient options for organic matter removal and lipids production from wastewaters in this regard microalgae yeasts consortia prove to be a promising alternative for effluent treatment through oxygen from microalgae photosynthesis using yeast and carbon gas through yeast respiration for microalgae improving lipids and biomass production 98 in addition lipid rich biomass from the microalgae yeast consortia can be used for the production of added value products such as biodiesel as aforementioned and its recovery can be improved due to the flocculation properties of some yeasts besides the efficiency in holding microalgae which helps on its recovery decreasing the harvesting costs as displayed fig 4 yeasts have not been widely explored for effluent treatment probably due to their non sterile conditions and the needed to manage the fermentation respiration aspects because to improve biomass production and consequently the contaminants removal respiration should be favoured i e oxygen is necessary aerobic respiration aeration nevertheless their composition is indicative of a better nutrient removal capacity in wastewaters when compared to microalgae where 3 5 of its dry cell weight consists of phosphorus and 0 87 in the case of microalgae with nitrogen concentration being 10 higher when compared to the 6 in microalgae 64 even though these can change according to the environmental nutritional and operating parameters because they have a biochemical plasticity which can lead to much higher values than those previously mentioned 27 in this regard chlorella vulgaris presents the following composition 2 14 nitrogen and 0 5 4 phosphorus in dry weight adjusting itself to light nitrogen and phosphorus availability 99 yeasts are considered more efficient oleaginous microorganisms when compared to others algae bacteria and mould due to their capacity of accumulating more lipids in addition they present a high growth rate being easily cultivated at a large scale 100 the lipids rate in microalgae and its composition can be affected by environmental and chemical cultivation conditions namely by ph light intensity temperature stirring rate carbon sources and nutrient concentration phosphorus and nitrogen these lipids can be classified as neutral crude and total with neutral lipids being the most commonly used in biodiesel production through transesterification 101 researchers have suggested three types of microalgae yeast mutualistic symbiosis mechanisms such as the exchange of primary metabolites interchange of cofactors and hormones as well as the formation of particular physical microenvironments nonetheless such mechanisms are not entirely well known 102 the choice of combination of these microorganisms must take into account cultivation conditions as microalgae prefer higher ph values while oleaginous yeasts grow better in acid medium a buffer can be created in the cultivation if the conditions are managed adequately another restriction is related to organic carbon which should be provided to the system in suitable amounts to ensure high quality though non significant lipids production as excess primary metabolites such as acids and ethanol can hinder microalgae development 103 ling et al 63 analysed lipids production using the mixed chlorella pyrenoidosa microalgae and rhodosporidium toruloides yeast culture in rice wine distillery effluent with municipal wastewater at a ratio of 1 1 scod soluble cod of 17 150 mg l 1 tn total nitrogen of 720 mg l 1 tp total phosphorous of 349 mg l 1 ph 3 8 yeast microalgae co cultivation with an initial cell density of 2 10 7 5 10 6 cells ml 1 at 30 c and 2 93 w m 2 light dark photoperiod of 12 12 h light intensity of 265 μmol m 2 s 1 have reached lipids production of 4 60 0 36 g l 1 with scod tn and tp removal of 95 34 0 07 51 18 2 17 and 89 29 4 91 respectively after 5 days of cultivation without ph adjustment a buffer phenomenon walls et al 64 studied nutrient removal in non sterile municipal wastewaters enriched with 10 and 20 g l 1 glucose to increase cod initially with of 95 24 7 mg l 1 15 0 4 9 mg l 1 of nitrate 133 1 13 9 mg l 1 of total ammoniacal nitrogen and 67 5 19 5 mg l 1 of orthophosphate through the consortium consisting of scenedesmus obliquus microalgae and wild yeast with an initial biomass concentration of 0 2 g l 1 inoculum 94 in microalgae weight and 6 in yeast weight nutrient removal by the co culture was of 93 and 97 for nitrate 93 and 95 for total ammoniacal nitrogen 91 and 94 for orthophosphate in 3 days of cultivation and total biomass concentrations after cultivation were 1 85 0 26 to 2 74 0 43 g l 1 for cultures of 10 and 20 g l 1 respectively nonetheless the culture with the greatest glucose concentration favoured yeast and bacteria growth with the presence of microalgae being 18 lower in terms of the average number of cells suastes rivas et al 101 analysed the optimised distribution of fatty acid methyl esters fames under the individual and combined effect of micronutrients in the culture media with the experimental design considering a multi level 33 strategy the concentrations found were of 0 35 0 7 and 1 05 g l 1 of nano3 0 11 0 08 and 0 095 g l 1 of k2hpo4 and 0 0649 0 0949 and 0 1249 g l 1 of feso4 7h2o the microalgae yeast co culture was isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment station consisting of 68 scenedesmus obliquus 29 scenedesmus sp and 3 of some yeast species among them 43 candida pimensis cultivation took place in 1 l pbr with a photoperiod of 12 12 h light intensity of 400 μmol m 2 s 1 24 1 c and aired at a constant flow rate of 0 25 vvm the highest lipids contents 27 77 and 20 84 occurred in assays with n p ratios of 4 1 and 3 1 respectively high saturated fatty acids were obtained for high n p ratios 6 1 and 11 1 while unsaturated fatty acids under a n p ratio of 9 1 a lower iron concentration was observed to be the main factor to promote higher fame concentrations desired for the production of high quality biodiesel thus the effect of iron was more significant than the n p ratio despite the latter modifying lipids concentration and the fatty acid composition of the microorganisms ashtiani et al 102 analysed the influence of age of microalgae pre culture chlorella vulgaris and yeast rhodotorula glutinis on biomass and lipids content in the co culture the inoculum seed ages in the co culture were 7 days for microalgae logarithmic phase 0 88 g l 1 of biomass and 5 days for yeasts stationary phase 11 12 g l 1 of biomass the assays were carried out in 250 ml flasks at 26 c 90 rpm light intensity of 800 μmol m 2 s 1 for 11 days inoculated with ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 v v of yeast to microalgae as anticipated a higher lipids production was observed at a microalgae yeast ratio of 2 1 after 5 days with a lipids content of approximately 5 times higher than in pure cultures on the following days there was a decrease in lipids production due to the internal degradation of lipids stored in yeasts due to o2 deficiency in addition the synergistic impacts of the consortium were also analysed on enzyme expression for in vitro assays at a microalgae yeast ratio of 2 1 the co culture increased approximately 6 and 5 fold the concentration of nervonic acid c24 1 and behenic acid c22 0 respectively in the yeast residual cell free medium with a 2 1 ratio the microalgae resulted in an upsurge of 9 and 6 fold in nervonic acid c24 1 and behenic acid c22 0 respectively when compared to the monocultures based on the aforementioned studies it can be observed that the microalgae yeast consortium has proven to be promising in the bioremediation of wastewaters and in biomass production leading to a significant increase in the molecular compounds of microorganisms namely high quality added value lipids content nevertheless further research is necessary to better understand the mutualistic relationship between these microorganisms besides the optimisation of processes and considering different yeasts and microalgae strains 7 microalgae and filamentous fungus consortium one of the most self sufficient symbiotic associations are the lichens stable symbiosis between some filamentous fungi species mycobionts and green algae and or cyanobacteria photobionts this mutualistic relationship consumes oxygen and organic carbon such as sugars and nutrients provided by algae through photosynthesis in exchange algae have protection and access to nutrients through the action of extracellular fungal enzymes which convert microcellular organic matter into soluble and easily absorbable nutrients 65 67 70 104 the simultaneous metabolic exchange between species of these co cultivation systems can make them less dependent on external nutrient sources nitrogen and phosphorus as well as the transformation of external co2 and sunlight into bio sustainable products 105 several studies have shown that microalgae have a high potential in the bioremediation of different wastewater types in addition microalgae biomass has a high added value and can be used as raw material for several products namely biofuels biofertilizers biochemicals among others however the high operating costs of conventional physical and chemical biomass recovery methods have promoted the use of bio flocculation for microalgae harvesting such as the co culture between filamentous fungi and microalgae forming sustainable pellets by gravity being considered a cheaper and more sustainable system 71 72 74 75 the se interactions are visualized in fig 5 pellet formation is intimately related to agitating effects with a very low stirring rate preventing the aggregation of conidia or spores nonetheless under rapid rates they tend to break up or form smaller and smoother pellets the ideal agitation rate is not yet known though it is thought to be related to the needs of each microorganism in the demand for oxygen another factor which interferes in pellet formation is the ph acidic environments are favourable to fungi growth nevertheless microalgae grow better in alkaline conditions thus it is important to select fungi that adapt well to a wide ph range moreover fungi and microalgae present opposite electrical conditions and their co culture tend to be neutral a buffering phenomenon as occurs with yeast microalga 6 however chu et al 70 concluded that the ideal ph for pellet harvesting is specific to each microorganism species with further analysis being needed to optimise co cultivation conditions in future research in zhou et al 66 the co culture was formed by aspergillus sp fungus and chlorella vulgaris microalga being used in the remediation of municipal wastewaters cod 1660 40 1 mg l 1 tn 97 2 6 8 mg l 1 and tp 51 2 7 2 mg l 1 the process was carried out under 100 rpm agitation for 24 h having reached removal rates of 62 5 58 9 and 89 8 for cod tn and pt respectively wrede et al 65 used aspergillus fumigatus species and several microalgae species having verified a high efficiency of anaerobically digested piggery effluent reaching better results with co cultivation than with isolated fungi and microalgae species with nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates of approximately 90 initial nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the effluent were of 680 7 mg l 1 and 145 7 mg l 1 respectively zhao et al 67 used co pelletization of microalgae chlorella vulgaris and fungi ganoderma lucidum in the treatment of biogas slurry from an anaerobic digestion reactor in a pig farm wastewater treatment plant cod 1061 51 26 23 mg l 1 nt 182 64 11 68

were of 92 17 5 28 89 83 4 36 90 31 4 69 and 74 26 3 14 respectively under similar conditions microalgae chlorella vulgaris and fungi ganoderma lucidum were cultivated in medium supplemented with strigolactone 10 9 m of gr24 light intensity of 225 μmol m 2 s 1 red blue light of 5 5 light dark photoperiod of 12 12 h temperature of 25 2 c for 7 days for crude biogas and biogas slurry treatment cod 1671 28 44 39 mg l 1 tn 107 54 7 75 mg l 1 and tp 25 12 2 47 mg l 1 obtaining the maximum cod tn and tp efficiency of 76 35 6 87 78 77 7 13 and 79 49 7 43 respectively 68 li zhang and yang 7 assessed the effects of nitrogen glucose and phosphorus in the remediation of arsenic contaminated wastewaters using fungi algae pellets aspergillus oryzae and chlorella vulgaris 26 c 125 rpm 112 μmol m 2 s 1 photoperiod of 12 12 h for 7 days the pellets showed a high potential in the bioremediation of arsenic contaminated wastewaters due to the high tolerance and capacity of accumulating the contaminant bodin et al 69 used the consortium formed by chlorella vulgaris microalgae and aspergillus niger fungi for the treatment of pharmaceutical groups usually found in aquatic environments the results showed that the use of bio pellets was effective in the removal of the 7 types of substances analysed with initial concentration between 8 and 11 mg l 1 each especially ranitidine with a removal percentage of 50 19 shen and chirwa 106 studied the potential of live and lyophilized fungi algae pellets aspergillus niger and tetradesmus obliquus as biosorbents for remediating wastewaters containing gold 30 mg l 1 the lyophilized pellets showed greater storage and adsorption potential than live pellets absorbing approximately 97 7 gold from multi metallic wastewaters in the column reactor srinuanpan et al 107 used pellets formed by trichoderma reesei and scenedesmus sp fungi in the remediation of secondary non sterile effluents generated by the seafood processing industry ph 7 7 1239 mg l 1 of cod tn 144 mg l 1 and tp 18 6 mg l 1 this resulted in the removal rate of 74 44 and 93 for cod tn and tp respectively therefore based on these studies the microalga fungus consortium has shown to be more advantageous in the treatment of wastewaters when compared with the axenic cultures nonetheless there are still several gaps to be filled on this subject highlighting the need for optimising culture parameters in future researchers in order to reach even more efficient results and even how to apply the fungus alga biomass produced from a biotechnological point of view 8 feasibility of the open cultivation system for symbiotic association using microalgae and other microbiological groups as previously pointed out microalgae can be cultivated in different system types these range from litres to billion litres as well as unsophisticated systems individual cultures in the case of open tanks under natural light and temperature conditions with low or zero control or sophisticated system with closed photobioreactors where it is possible to control cultivation parameters 108 109 one of the main problems faced in open microalgae cultivation systems is contamination by other microorganisms biological contamination can reduce product synthesis or inhibit microalgae cell growth nonetheless research in metabolic engineering has invested in solutions to reduce or mitigate these adverse conditions 8 according to kim et al 108 approximately 95 of total microalgae production takes place in open systems with roughly 20 000 t of microalgae year reaching productions of almost 180 t ha year under natural interference of other microorganisms in the cultivation medium however biomass production in closed photobioreactors is higher than 1500 t ha year due to operating conditions optimisation open microalgae cultivation systems can be raceway ponds tanks or circular ponds though high rate algal ponds hrap are more commonly used hraps have a high microalgae biomass production with commercial applications mainly for biofuel production purposes 9 110 hraps are compared to a running track or an oval pond 15 to 80 cm deep allowing solar light to enter with the entire bubble column euphotic facilitating photosynthesis in the entire system one important variable is the quality of solar light incidence in the system thus it is important to ensure that the pond is well located to allow adequate light irradiation which also interferes on the choice of microalgae species to be used in the system these systems usually present paddle wheels ensuring the mixing of the liquid and biomass optimising nutrient distribution microalgae suspension in the bubble column and gas exchange 9 111 one of the main advantages of open pond systems include their large surface area optimising co2 sequestration besides of the liquid evaporation what can increase the temperature in the bioreactor these systems are usually applied in large scale microalgal cultivation due to their low cost and easy operation maintenance and cleaning after cultivation however these open systems are also exposed to climate variation which can affect light intensity temperature water evaporation resulting in significant volume losses and impacting on culture stability low mass transfer due to the inefficient mixture hampering biomass productivity and its quality quantity 112 in addition the needed of large land areas for implementing the ponds but these can be set up in unfertile lands avoiding competition with food production due to limitations in water evaporation at a similar rate to land crops photoautotrophic biomass production in open systems is limited to only some species with many being unable to be maintained for long periods of time due to risk of contamination 9 despite the need for more control in cultivation conditions in open systems these are successfully used at a commercial scale for spirulina platensis haematococcus sp dunaliella salina as well as for genera chlorella sp scenedesmus acutodesmus tetradesmus and nannochloropsis sp among others 112 open natural ponds for microalgae cultivation include circular ponds commonly used in japan taiwan and indonesia for cultivating the chlorella species raceway ponds used in the cultivation of the arthrospira species in the united states and dunaliella salina in israel natural dunaliella salina ponds in mexico and australia inclined systems used in bulgaria for genera arthrospira and scenedesmus and chlorella in australia in turn tanks are usually used for production at a lower scale for genera used in aquaculture namely nannochloroposis oculate 110 113 aimed at improving microalgae biomass productivity researchers have studied and developed co2 injection systems or injection systems using combustion gas fg flue gas applied in open systems 111 being advantageous for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for instance yadav dukey and sen 114 assessed the capacity of culture chlorella vulgaris in the sequestration of combustion gases and biomass growth in open air pond systems under different co2 concentrations 0 04 only air and 10 2 for batch and semi continuous cultures for batch experiments with and without fg the co2 fixation rate and maximum biomass production were of 8 92 0 28 mg l 1 d 1 and 0 11 0 08 g l 1 33 79 4 02 mg l 1 d 1 and 0 3 0 13 g l 1 respectively in turn for the semi continuous mode with fg addition mass density of 0 428 0 12 g l 1 and co2 fixation rate of 102 66 5 77 mg l 1 d 1 was obtained being higher some studies focused on the use of extremophilic species growing under extreme temperature ph and salinity conditions being successfully produced at a commercial scale being sustainable and reliable in an open air system for instance the dunaliella salina species has a high growth rate in saline waters due to its high intracell glycerol content contributing towards the protection against osmotic pressure spirulina platensis and spirulina maxima are capable of surviving and growing well at a high ph between 9 and 11 5 114 115 aimed at optimising microalgae cultivation conditions in open systems researchers also have focused on attempting to solve or minimise any environmental physical and even economic cultivation issues for instance baldev et al 116 cultivated chorella vulgaris microalgae in an open pond system 35 000 l 15 rpm cell density of 2 106 cells ml 1 with a low cost optimised medium urea superphosphate and potassium at 91 9 72 9 and 62 7 mg l 1 respectively and ph 8 03 for biomass production aimed at biodiesel production this ensured biomass productivity of 31 5 mg l 1 d 1 and lipids content of 25 5 ketheesan and nirmalakhandan 117 cultivated scenedesmus sp in an airlift driven raceway reactor 23 l air rate of 2400 ml min 1 circulation rate of 10 cm s 1 initial inoculum density of 0 15 g l 1 light intensity of 80 μmol m 2 s 1 for continuous mode and 110 μmol m 2 s 1 for batch mode maximum biomass productivity was of 0 085 g l 1 d 1 for the batch mode with co2 at 1 for 15 days for the continuous mode with 1 co2 for 18 days maximum biomass and lipids productivity were of 0 19 and 0 04 g l 1 d 1 respectively raeisossadati moheimani and parlevliet 118 analysed red and blue luminescent solar concentrators lscs to increase arthrospira platensis biomass and phycocyanin productivity in 21 cm deep outdoor raceway ponds at a mixing rate of 11 cm s 1 light intensity of 34 and 4 5 μmol photons s 1 for red and blue lscs respectively biomass and phycocyanin productivity increased by 26 and 44 respectively when using red lscs however blue lscs did not result in a significant increase in biomass productivity 9 contamination by protozoa in cultivation systems biological contaminants such as zooplankton bacteria fungi protozoa other algae and viruses can have either a positive or negative effect on microalgae cell growth in open cultivation systems contamination will eventually occur through gas exchange co2 and o2 between air and liquid culture through the contact with animals and insects or even through the water used as previously mentioned open systems have the greatest disadvantage of greater susceptibility to contamination by predator species these predators can drastically reduce production yields or in extreme cases leading to total cultivation loss once an important competitor has established residence in the pond it becomes extremely difficult to eradicate it 9 therefore it is necessary to develop ways of eliminating inhibiting the action of these contaminants without hindering the development of the desired species protozoa are natural bacteria and microalgae predators and have been used as bio indicators in community assays due to their short generation time and rapid responses to environmental changes the body size spectrum of protozoa communities was successfully employed to analyse the defence capacity of chlorella sp and nannochloropsis oceanica protozoa under protozoa herding protozoa communities were exposed to different concentrations of both microalgae 100 control 104 105 106 and 107 cells ml 1 for a period of 9 days each in sum both species showed a strong defense effect in the body size spectrum in which the body size distinction of protozoa communities showed a significant reduction in microalgae concentrations higher than 106 cells ml 1 119 under the same conditions gui et al 120 explored functional distinction measures based on biological characteristics to identify the effect of microalgae protection against protozoa in addition results showed that functional distinction measures present a downward trend of these microorganisms throughout the concentration gradient of both aforementioned microalgae according to zhu jiang and fa 115 biological contamination can occur in any cultivation phase nonetheless microalgae are capable of adapting to the environment tolerating extreme environmental conditions while biological contaminants require specific conditions to survive therefore environmental control is a way of inhibiting contamination such as by maintaining culture ph under alkaline conditions 10 11 as well as the rapid increase in light intensity to 30 000 lx salinity above 15 nacl and temperature increase can all have a positive influence on microalgae in terms of protozoa development zhao et al 121 state that extracellular microalgae excretion inhibits protozoa development in this regard the authors carried out a controlled laboratory assay to evaluate the inhibitory effect on ciliated euplotes vannus growth under different densities of marine microalgae nannochloropsis oceanica high moderate and low density respectively maximum population densities of n oceanica were of 210 350 and 300 ind ml 1 for cultivation with high moderate and low algae density respectively preliminary results confirmed that protozoa growth was inhibited in the medium with high microalgae density suggesting that extracellular excrements of n oceanica have the potential of controlling inhibiting protozoa contamination in large scale microalgae cultivation 10 conclusion and future works bioremediation in different wastewaters in open microalgae cultivation systems and their symbiotic relationship with other microorganisms have a great potential for solving environmental issues besides reducing demand for supplies such as clean water energy co2 and nutrient injection for microalgae cultivation also noteworthy are the advantages of co cultivation systems in wastewater when compared to axenic cultures especially in terms of the degradation of organic compounds phosphorus and nitrogen absorption and co2 sequestration these benefits are observed due to the synergistic relationship between these consortia such as metabolic and gas exchanges as well as the high ph adjustment in the medium in addition microalgae contribute to renewable energy production namely of biodiesel and biogas as well as valuable co products such as fertilizers animal feed cosmetics among others as it was possible to see in the entire manuscript bacteria are generally used with microalgae to treat wastewater probably because they are the main agent used in secondary wastewater treatment for organic matter removal mainly and microalgae have efficiency in remove nitrogen and phosphorous for yeast microalga consortium the main application today is regarding the production of lipids for high value products or biodiesel production but more research is needed in order to improve this application range on the other hand fungus microalga consortium is used mainly for effluent with recalcitrant pollutants or to improve the microalgal harvesting in the biological process but as the use of yeast this type of consortium should be more studied because the biotechnological plasticity of these microorganisms can help in the obtaining of better economic applications helping the sustainability and feasibility of the system in the past decades many studies have been successfully carried out at a laboratory scale nevertheless a lot still needs to be done to understand prevailing gaps of these mutualistic relationship and optimal cultivation conditions in large scale cultivation for industrial purposes ensuring high efficiency levels and finding promising alternatives for recovering the biomass produced economic analysis and life cycle assessment are needed in order to provide information regarding the feasibility of the process in large

12735,the application of microalgae in bioremediation of urban and industrial effluents has shown excellent results both in terms of their ability to remove pollutants mainly nitrogen and phosphorus and in the way that this system operates which does not require large structures and is easy to handle microalgae are microscopic beings that have a high photosynthetic efficiency and are able to adapt to the most diverse types of effluents and environmental conditions due to mixotrophic characteristics the treatment performed by these microorganisms can be done in a variety of systems whether open closed or in a hybrid model so the choice is directly correlated with the desirable characteristics in terms of the design and configuration of the system the open system has several economic and operational advantages and for this reason it has been widely used for effluent treatment furthermore it is important to highlight that there is a mechanism of proto cooperation between microalgae and contaminating microorganisms of the open system mainly with bacteria filamentous fungi and yeasts in this work the mechanisms advantages and bottlenecks of the use of symbiotic systems in the bioremediation of urban and industrial effluents will be discussed mainly considering the feasibility and stability of open systems graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations c degree celsius

the demand for potable water and the issues concerning the contamination of water bodies are two of the greatest global challenges of the century several processes have been proposed for treating domestic industrial and agro industrial wastewaters such as bioremediation which uses either a single or a consortium of microorganisms bacteria microalgae fungi and protozoa such as aeration tanks anaerobic ponds aerobic and anaerobic bioreactors activated sludge and biological filters microalgae need a sufficient organic or inorganic carbon source other nutrients and light for photosynthesis nonetheless they can adjust their internal structure to ensure a more efficient use of the available resources in the environment 1 2 the advantages of exploring these photosynthetic organisms for industrial applications mainly in the environmental sector are relevant to ensure a more sustainable future these microorganisms can promote the carbon cycle and consequently its environmental renewal which is vital because carbon is the most prevalent component in this biomass representing approximately 50 of its dry weight 3 4 in the last decades researchers have focused on the use of microalgae and their consortia with other microorganisms other algae bacteria yeast and fungi in wastewater treatment as an alternative and low cost process for producing and recovery of microalgal biomass the use of polyculture for nutrient removal can be very advantageous as the combination of microorganisms with different metabolic activities and diverse adaptive capacity can result in higher rates of nutrient absorption and biomass production 5 this occurs because in most cases the formation of a consortium benefits both species involved mainly as a result of the gas exchange in which the microalgae through photosynthesis releases o2 that helps the growth of other microorganisms bacteria and fungi for example which by respiration can release co2 favouring the development of the microalgae or by the action of extracellular enzymes sometimes released by these microorganisms that act in the breakdown of macromolecules facilitating the absorption of certain nutrients by the microalgae 2 6 however there are still gaps that need to be further assessed to ensure a full understanding of metabolic interactions between these microorganisms as well as regarding the best cultivation systems in terms of the most suitable physical environmental and operational conditions to treat the wastewater microalgae cultivation in closed bioreactors is demonstrated to be the most efficient biomass production system given the possibility of a better control of the operational nutritional environmental parameters such as ph temperature mixing rate light intensity co2 and nutrient concentration among others in addition closed bioreactors facilitate aseptic conditions although installation and maintenance costs are high a more economical and sustainable alternative include open cultivation systems which are enable to use natural light ensuring easier control with lower costs and total aseptic conditions are not required nevertheless the main drawback of open cultivation systems is the contamination contamination can present beneficial results when the synergy between microorganisms promotes biomass growth and contaminant removal however the negative effect of contamination includes the considerable decrease of biomass production and consequently dead of desired species reducing the efficiency of the process in remove contaminants 7 9 this review provides an overview of current sustainable phycoremediation technologies for wastewater treatment focused on open cultivation systems for value added biomass production in this regard this work carries out a bibliographic prospection of articles and patents in order to gather the main sources of information to support the understanding of the subject proposed in this sense it reports on the nutritional needs of microalgae as well as the advantages and challenges of the processes using symbiotic relationships between microalgae and other microorganisms finally it presents the challenges and needs for intensifying research on this promising strategy 2 types of systems for wastewater treatment by microalgae microalgae based wastewater treatment has been the focus of several studies which seek to improve the efficiency of the process and demonstrate its viability in operational and economic terms nevertheless in practice its application is still limited thus treatment systems used in this type of bioremediation are usually found at a laboratory or pilot scale according to li et al 10 overall treatment systems can be divided in groups according to their design and configuration therefore they can be presented as traditional open systems enclosed photobioreactors pbrs or hybrid systems it is important to point out that the choice of reactor used in microalgae based wastewater treatment depends on an initial data assessment namely wastewater nutrient profile parameter adjustment requirements volumetric concentration likely microalgae species employed biomass development capacity among others these are important specifications as they directly influence the reactor design and the type of operation being crucial to ensure stability 11 the main bioreactor configurations are showed in fig 1 open microalgae cultivation systems are widely used for industrial purposes with studies proving the efficiency of this method for wastewater treatment applications open ponds raceway ponds and tanks are common examples of this type of treatment system for instance raceway ponds high rate algal ponds are an evolution of the open ponds usually installed with paddle wheels for mixing to ensure the circulation of microalgae preventing precipitation and improving the photosynthetic rate in terms of operating conditions open systems are more easily operated with a low energy consumption and lower associated costs however issues related to poor lighting distribution and the needed for larger areas in the treatment plants installation and if aeration is used high co2 is lost to the environment especially when used in high concentrations of co2 mixed with atmospheric air 10 12 it is worth mentioning that most effluents are unsterilised thus with a natural microbial load however the treatment of large volumes of wastewater makes unfeasible the sterilisation of the wastewater if the purpose is contaminant removal only on the other hand if high value products can be obtained it can be an option considering the economic return involved therefore open systems can be a more direct option and easily adaptable in addition the assessment of the microbial load either from microalgae or other microbial groups is essential to maintain a symbiotic relation 10 13 closed systems more specifically photobioreactors pbr have several designs with their horizontal tubular design being more commonly used at an industrial scale and for microalgae cultivation this configuration has many advantages such as greater control of parameters ph temperature co2 o2 and other nutrients minimising contamination by other microorganisms as well as ensuring high biomass productivity rates the use of this type of reactor is limited due to high operating and capital costs with its application being limited to processes with high value products nevertheless its use for wastewater treatment is seen as advantageous if a high quality product is desired purity in addition the use of microalgae in this reactor type can lead to drawbacks such as the formation of algae biofilm on the reactor surface thus limiting light penetration into the culture and possibility of cell structure damage as a result of high shear stresses resulted by the operational characteristic of this type of bioreactor 10 11 however some hybrid systems are being developed aimed at reducing the limitations associated to standard configurations for instance membrane photobioreactors are capable of promoting more efficient treatment and higher biomass production with much lower operating costs when compared to closed photobioreactors pbr thus the growth experienced by the membrane sector can lead to even lower costs with this reactor type being a promising alternative to traditional models 10 11 14 16 microalgae biofilm consists of a symbiotic association between microalgae and other microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi this type of biofilm is usually formed on solid surfaces or in the interior of materials its application in remediation processes has various advantages such as a greater production and easiness of microalgal biomass recovery making the process less costly some researchers have analysed the relationship between the cultivation system constantly submerged intermittently submerged and perfused and attachment growth system studies have shown that the use of materials such as nylon and stainless steel in microalgae attachment generate 2 8 times greater biomass production than the open pond systems nevertheless it is worth pointing out that the use of this wastewater treatment method depends on the wastewater s nutrient composition and on the surface area available for developing the biofilm 10 17 18 according to palma et al 19 the use of chlorella like microalgae biofilm in the treatment of mine tailing waters containing heavy metals promoted a considerable removal of pollutants allowing such system to be used for large scale remediation 3 desired wastewater properties microalgal nutrient requirements microalgae are microorganisms that can be found in various water environments ranging from freshwater to marine environments or even wastewaters similar to plants microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms capable of growing in growth media with reasonable nutrient availability namely carbon c either in its organic or inorganic form nitrogen n in its organic or inorganic form as ammonia nitrite and nitrate phosphorus p and other elements that are essential to certain species micronutrients and trace elements its use in bioremediation processes has been increasingly considered given their low costs easy operation as robust environments and complex cultivation systems are not required besides not making use of any fertilizer type as well the high growth rate and the possibility to use the biomass formed during the treatment process for noble purposes 10 20 21 in short for the microalgae development an adequate amount of light water nitrogen carbon phosphorus and other metal ions should be available in the medium wastewater it is important to stress the relevant presence of metal ions as they favour osmoregulation and osmoadaption thus contributing to the photosynthetic metabolic pathway regarding light availability studies show that both the intensity and the light dark relationship photoperiod can influence the microalgal development for instance assays developed under artificial light point out that continuous lighting 24 h promotes a much greater reduction in total phosphorus when compared with solar radiation which provides approximately 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness depending on the location and season of the year on the other hand in terms of light intensity some analyses show that the increase in this parameter can reduce microalgae phosphorus absorption it is necessary to evaluate the biological characteristics of the strains though increasing the uptake of other contaminants expressed for example as cod chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen tn for example 22 23 another factor of great importance concerns the c n and n p ratios not only in terms of nutrient absorption but also regarding the requirement of competitivity between the species found in the medium in urban wastewaters these ratios are often lower than what is recommended to ensure rapid microalgae growth studies which sought to understand the c n ratio and establish a confidence interval for this parameter to ensure efficient wastewater treatment have demonstrated that c n ratios between 5 and 10 lead to greater cod reduction in the medium while higher ratios close to 20 result in a reduction in microalgae biomass development this reduction implies a low pollutant removal rate probably inhibiting microalgae activity due to excess nutrients in addition it may lead to metabolic consequences such as the inability of proportionally absorbing carbon and nitrogen with the latter being the main structural component together with carbon or the formation of excess toxic metabolites as acids in the metabolization of organic matter 10 23 regarding the n p ratio data found in the literature show that both elements are crucial factors for microalgae development according to li et al 10 this ratio can vary between 6 8 and 10 to ensure good biomass development and efficient wastewater treatment moreover it is worth pointing out that the possible adjustments to nutrient conditions in the cultivation medium can favour biomass development and optimise wastewater treatment 10 22 leong and chang 24 analysed the use of microalgae in the bioremediation of heavy metals usually found in industrial effluents the study states that this type of microorganism presents various advantages ranging from its ability to adapt to the medium resistance to extreme environmental conditions besides its high photosynthetic efficiency the research showed that microalgae are capable of absorbing heavy metals such as boron cobalt iron and molybdenum as trace elements for enzymatic process of the cell metabolism nonetheless one of the drawbacks of its use lies on the fact that heavy metals often can be absorbed by other microorganisms that can compete for nutrients with microalgae in addition the variability of nutrients found in this type of effluent can hamper microalgae development due to excessive or deprivation of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and the high turbidity caused by the excess of these metals can limit light penetration hindering the photosynthetic process 10 li et al 10 discuss the viability of using microalgae in the treatment of municipal wastewaters which often present lower nutrient content than synthetic media used in laboratory as effluents contain metals wastewaters can also present variability in the nutrient composition either due to rainfall or due to the variability of their forming sources barsanti and gualtieri 25 state that previous studies have already proven that microalgae are capable of efficiently absorbing nutrients found in this type of effluent consequently reaching a good growth rate promoting wastewater treatment this is possible as microalgae development is linked with its metabolic functions thus these microorganisms require the absorption of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus as well as carbon dioxide co2 or some type of organic matter which is used as a carbon source during the synthesis of proteins nucleic acids phospholipids and other cellular structural components according to li et al 10 the ideal municipal wastewater treatment using microalgae depends on the presence of adequate levels of nitrogen n phosphorus p and chemical oxygen demand cod with values of approximately 130 200 and 2250 mg l 1 respectively de farias silva et al 26 point out that a cod of up to 5000 mg l 1 is possibly treatable depending on the microalgae species as well as on the availability of other nutrients cultivation system and possibility of symbiotic relationships with other microbial groups nonetheless values higher than these usually exhibit toxicity to this microbial group or causes high instability of the system for example significant changes in the ph needing constant control during the process moreover authors have discussed the benefits of co2 addition to the medium as some results have indicated that the addition of high co2 concentrations promoted an increase in microalgae biomass productivity consequently leading to an upsurge in pollutant removal rates especially when associated to greater light availability however it is important to assess the cost of this process as well as the advantages of its use in economic environmental and operating terms because artificial concentrated co2 injection in the system can increase up to 50 of cultivation costs for microalgae 27 28 4 bibliographic and patent prospection of microalgae and their consortia for wastewater treatment seeking new available technologies a technological prospection of scientific articles and patent databases was carried out aiming to verify the literature availability of the subject the prospection was based on the review of scientific articles using the databases science direct 29 capes journals 30 scielo 31 and scopus 32 for patent prospection the following databases were used the brazilian national institute of industrial property inpi 33 world intellectual property organization wipo 34 and the free version of patent inspiration 35 espacenet patent search 36 and derwent world patents index 37 table 1 presents the results of the analysis of the number of scientific articles published in specialised journals table 1 shows the great importance of the subject of wastewater treatment using microalgae which resulted in over 55 000 documents in the databases searched even though overlap can occur between the databases it is also possible to observe the high number of articles related to microalgae and bacteria consortia with a total of 5723 documents with the number of documents related to consortia using fungi and yeast being 3 times lower with a total of 1668 and 1990 respectively nonetheless most works available are mainly related to the application of microalgae in the removal of a specific pollutant such as in the treatment of industrial wastewaters 38 39 municipal wastewater 40 42 biorefineries 43 45 reduction of organic compounds in oil refinery wastewaters 46 wastewater treatment from meat processing and leather manufacturing 47 48 among others in addition these studies used microalgae bacteria consortia for effluent treatment 49 52 biodiesel production 53 dairy effluent 54 56 insecticide removal 57 biotreatment of landfill leachate 58 59 biogas sludge treatment 60 nitrification by microalga bacteria consortia for effluent treatment 61 62 in a consortium between yeast and microalgae for lipid production in wastewater 63 municipal wastewater treatment 64 and in a consortium between microalgae and fungi in piggery effluents 65 remediation of municipal wastewater 66 biogas treatment 67 68 treatment of pharmaceutical groups 69 treatment of wastewater contaminated with arsenic 7 revision on the consortium for effluent treatment 6 70 co cultivation for biomass harvesting 71 75 the change in the number of documents related to the use of consortia in several treatments published over the years 1980 and 2021 was verified in the scopus database 32 highlighting the increased of this research topic this analysis showed a significant increase on research regarding the topic over the last years having been observed that from 2009 that there was an increasing interest on the use of microalgae associated with bacteria mainly in the treatment of industrial effluents as shown in fig 2 similarly the period for collecting information regarding the patents available in the databases was between 1997 and 2022 some patents are protected by the secrecy period though they were included in the present research as showed in table 2 table 2 shows the great importance of effluent treatment using microalgae resulting in approximately 4760 documents in the databases searched nevertheless the patents related to consortia is low with 162 documents on microalga bacterium consortia 60 and 77 on microalga yeast and microalga fungus consortium respectively it is also important to highlight that only 10 documents directly report on effluent treatment such as the cultivation of microalgae in wastewaters 76 77 wastewater treatment using microalgae consortia 78 79 effluent treatment for biofuel production 80 microalgae cultivation in a wastewater dominated by carpet mill effluents 81 bioremediation in industrial effluents 82 development of a microalgae bacteria symbiotic system for pyridine biodegradation 83 5 microalga bacterium consortium the presence of toxic organic compounds and some heavy metals in wastewaters can be lethal for microalgae studies have shown that treatment processes of these effluents can be potentialized by microalgae bacteria consortia when compared to individual cultures of these species according to saravanan 84 this symbiotic relationship can take place in 3 different forms mutualism commensalism and parasitism the algae bacteria interaction mainly occurs through physical contact substrate exchange signal transduction or horizontal gene transfer modifying the physiology and metabolism of both therefore wastewater native bacteria interact directly or indirectly with the microalgae leading to an improvement or inhibition of the microorganisms present the microalgae photosynthetic microorganisms and heterotrophic bacteria consortia are a promising alternative for biological wastewater treatment in order to avoid the external supply of co2 and reduce co2 emissions ensuring a less costly and more ecologically sustainable treatment pathway the treatment is undertaken through a photosynthetic process in which microalgae use light and co2 and produce oxygen while bacteria use oxygen to remove nitrogen through nitrification denitrification and organic matter bio oxidation thus producing co2 allowing microalgae to carry out mixotrophy contributing to the removal of organic matter 5 85 as showed in fig 3 in addition to oxygen carbon dioxide exchange studies show that these mutual interactions are very complex and can be either cooperative or competitive some advantages of algae bacteria consortia include synergistic relationships between microorganisms resistance to adverse conditions oxygen that is released from algae photosynthesis which reduces costs through aeration for bacteria development co2 assimilation by algae reduces the environmental impact greater efficiency in the removal of nutrients and cod reduction of autonomous systems of algae and bacteria among others on the other hand some of the substances excreted by bacteria can hamper algae growth or some algae presenting an antibacterial effect in addition the increase in ph and temperature due to the association to algae metabolism can be prejudicial to the bacteria strains 5 50 this symbiotic relationship was successfully applied in the treatment of several wastewaters table 3 presents an overview of the cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp removal efficiency by the different microalgae cyanobacteria and bacteria consortia in different effluent types with these data in mind the use of microalgae bacteria polyculture for effluent bioremediation has proven to be an advantageous alternative resulting in greater contaminant removal rates as well as higher nutrient absorption and biomass production main microalgal strains used include the genera chlorella scenedesmus acutodemus tetradesmus and chamydomonas for cyanobacteria anabaena microcystis and oscillatoria are cited in terms of bacteria as the range is larger the use of natural microbiota from wastewater treatment plants or from the natural environment is more versatile it is important to point out that only the removal rate of the pollutants is not sufficient to consider the process efficient because it depends on the initial concentration of them so always should be evaluated both parameters as presented in table 3 6 microalga and yeast consortium microalgae are known by their oxygen production and their efficiency in removing nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewaters on the other hand organic matter removal is low in these microorganisms due to their slow growth requiring greater cultivation times to reach high biomass and lipids concentration in the context of biodiesel from microbial sources which microalgae is widely linked even though they can use heterotrophy mixotrophic beings nonetheless oleaginous yeasts are highly efficient options for organic matter removal and lipids production from wastewaters in this regard microalgae yeasts consortia prove to be a promising alternative for effluent treatment through oxygen from microalgae photosynthesis using yeast and carbon gas through yeast respiration for microalgae improving lipids and biomass production 98 in addition lipid rich biomass from the microalgae yeast consortia can be used for the production of added value products such as biodiesel as aforementioned and its recovery can be improved due to the flocculation properties of some yeasts besides the efficiency in holding microalgae which helps on its recovery decreasing the harvesting costs as displayed fig 4 yeasts have not been widely explored for effluent treatment probably due to their non sterile conditions and the needed to manage the fermentation respiration aspects because to improve biomass production and consequently the contaminants removal respiration should be favoured i e oxygen is necessary aerobic respiration aeration nevertheless their composition is indicative of a better nutrient removal capacity in wastewaters when compared to microalgae where 3 5 of its dry cell weight consists of phosphorus and 0 87 in the case of microalgae with nitrogen concentration being 10 higher when compared to the 6 in microalgae 64 even though these can change according to the environmental nutritional and operating parameters because they have a biochemical plasticity which can lead to much higher values than those previously mentioned 27 in this regard chlorella vulgaris presents the following composition 2 14 nitrogen and 0 5 4 phosphorus in dry weight adjusting itself to light nitrogen and phosphorus availability 99 yeasts are considered more efficient oleaginous microorganisms when compared to others algae bacteria and mould due to their capacity of accumulating more lipids in addition they present a high growth rate being easily cultivated at a large scale 100 the lipids rate in microalgae and its composition can be affected by environmental and chemical cultivation conditions namely by ph light intensity temperature stirring rate carbon sources and nutrient concentration phosphorus and nitrogen these lipids can be classified as neutral crude and total with neutral lipids being the most commonly used in biodiesel production through transesterification 101 researchers have suggested three types of microalgae yeast mutualistic symbiosis mechanisms such as the exchange of primary metabolites interchange of cofactors and hormones as well as the formation of particular physical microenvironments nonetheless such mechanisms are not entirely well known 102 the choice of combination of these microorganisms must take into account cultivation conditions as microalgae prefer higher ph values while oleaginous yeasts grow better in acid medium a buffer can be created in the cultivation if the conditions are managed adequately another restriction is related to organic carbon which should be provided to the system in suitable amounts to ensure high quality though non significant lipids production as excess primary metabolites such as acids and ethanol can hinder microalgae development 103 ling et al 63 analysed lipids production using the mixed chlorella pyrenoidosa microalgae and rhodosporidium toruloides yeast culture in rice wine distillery effluent with municipal wastewater at a ratio of 1 1 scod soluble cod of 17 150 mg l 1 tn total nitrogen of 720 mg l 1 tp total phosphorous of 349 mg l 1 ph 3 8 yeast microalgae co cultivation with an initial cell density of 2 10 7 5 10 6 cells ml 1 at 30 c and 2 93 w m 2 light dark photoperiod of 12 12 h light intensity of 265 μmol m 2 s 1 have reached lipids production of 4 60 0 36 g l 1 with scod tn and tp removal of 95 34 0 07 51 18 2 17 and 89 29 4 91 respectively after 5 days of cultivation without ph adjustment a buffer phenomenon walls et al 64 studied nutrient removal in non sterile municipal wastewaters enriched with 10 and 20 g l 1 glucose to increase cod initially with of 95 24 7 mg l 1 15 0 4 9 mg l 1 of nitrate 133 1 13 9 mg l 1 of total ammoniacal nitrogen and 67 5 19 5 mg l 1 of orthophosphate through the consortium consisting of scenedesmus obliquus microalgae and wild yeast with an initial biomass concentration of 0 2 g l 1 inoculum 94 in microalgae weight and 6 in yeast weight nutrient removal by the co culture was of 93 and 97 for nitrate 93 and 95 for total ammoniacal nitrogen 91 and 94 for orthophosphate in 3 days of cultivation and total biomass concentrations after cultivation were 1 85 0 26 to 2 74 0 43 g l 1 for cultures of 10 and 20 g l 1 respectively nonetheless the culture with the greatest glucose concentration favoured yeast and bacteria growth with the presence of microalgae being 18 lower in terms of the average number of cells suastes rivas et al 101 analysed the optimised distribution of fatty acid methyl esters fames under the individual and combined effect of micronutrients in the culture media with the experimental design considering a multi level 33 strategy the concentrations found were of 0 35 0 7 and 1 05 g l 1 of nano3 0 11 0 08 and 0 095 g l 1 of k2hpo4 and 0 0649 0 0949 and 0 1249 g l 1 of feso4 7h2o the microalgae yeast co culture was isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment station consisting of 68 scenedesmus obliquus 29 scenedesmus sp and 3 of some yeast species among them 43 candida pimensis cultivation took place in 1 l pbr with a photoperiod of 12 12 h light intensity of 400 μmol m 2 s 1 24 1 c and aired at a constant flow rate of 0 25 vvm the highest lipids contents 27 77 and 20 84 occurred in assays with n p ratios of 4 1 and 3 1 respectively high saturated fatty acids were obtained for high n p ratios 6 1 and 11 1 while unsaturated fatty acids under a n p ratio of 9 1 a lower iron concentration was observed to be the main factor to promote higher fame concentrations desired for the production of high quality biodiesel thus the effect of iron was more significant than the n p ratio despite the latter modifying lipids concentration and the fatty acid composition of the microorganisms ashtiani et al 102 analysed the influence of age of microalgae pre culture chlorella vulgaris and yeast rhodotorula glutinis on biomass and lipids content in the co culture the inoculum seed ages in the co culture were 7 days for microalgae logarithmic phase 0 88 g l 1 of biomass and 5 days for yeasts stationary phase 11 12 g l 1 of biomass the assays were carried out in 250 ml flasks at 26 c 90 rpm light intensity of 800 μmol m 2 s 1 for 11 days inoculated with ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 v v of yeast to microalgae as anticipated a higher lipids production was observed at a microalgae yeast ratio of 2 1 after 5 days with a lipids content of approximately 5 times higher than in pure cultures on the following days there was a decrease in lipids production due to the internal degradation of lipids stored in yeasts due to o2 deficiency in addition the synergistic impacts of the consortium were also analysed on enzyme expression for in vitro assays at a microalgae yeast ratio of 2 1 the co culture increased approximately 6 and 5 fold the concentration of nervonic acid c24 1 and behenic acid c22 0 respectively in the yeast residual cell free medium with a 2 1 ratio the microalgae resulted in an upsurge of 9 and 6 fold in nervonic acid c24 1 and behenic acid c22 0 respectively when compared to the monocultures based on the aforementioned studies it can be observed that the microalgae yeast consortium has proven to be promising in the bioremediation of wastewaters and in biomass production leading to a significant increase in the molecular compounds of microorganisms namely high quality added value lipids content nevertheless further research is necessary to better understand the mutualistic relationship between these microorganisms besides the optimisation of processes and considering different yeasts and microalgae strains 7 microalgae and filamentous fungus consortium one of the most self sufficient symbiotic associations are the lichens stable symbiosis between some filamentous fungi species mycobionts and green algae and or cyanobacteria photobionts this mutualistic relationship consumes oxygen and organic carbon such as sugars and nutrients provided by algae through photosynthesis in exchange algae have protection and access to nutrients through the action of extracellular fungal enzymes which convert microcellular organic matter into soluble and easily absorbable nutrients 65 67 70 104 the simultaneous metabolic exchange between species of these co cultivation systems can make them less dependent on external nutrient sources nitrogen and phosphorus as well as the transformation of external co2 and sunlight into bio sustainable products 105 several studies have shown that microalgae have a high potential in the bioremediation of different wastewater types in addition microalgae biomass has a high added value and can be used as raw material for several products namely biofuels biofertilizers biochemicals among others however the high operating costs of conventional physical and chemical biomass recovery methods have promoted the use of bio flocculation for microalgae harvesting such as the co culture between filamentous fungi and microalgae forming sustainable pellets by gravity being considered a cheaper and more sustainable system 71 72 74 75 the se interactions are visualized in fig 5 pellet formation is intimately related to agitating effects with a very low stirring rate preventing the aggregation of conidia or spores nonetheless under rapid rates they tend to break up or form smaller and smoother pellets the ideal agitation rate is not yet known though it is thought to be related to the needs of each microorganism in the demand for oxygen another factor which interferes in pellet formation is the ph acidic environments are favourable to fungi growth nevertheless microalgae grow better in alkaline conditions thus it is important to select fungi that adapt well to a wide ph range moreover fungi and microalgae present opposite electrical conditions and their co culture tend to be neutral a buffering phenomenon as occurs with yeast microalga 6 however chu et al 70 concluded that the ideal ph for pellet harvesting is specific to each microorganism species with further analysis being needed to optimise co cultivation conditions in future research in zhou et al 66 the co culture was formed by aspergillus sp fungus and chlorella vulgaris microalga being used in the remediation of municipal wastewaters cod 1660 40 1 mg l 1 tn 97 2 6 8 mg l 1 and tp 51 2 7 2 mg l 1 the process was carried out under 100 rpm agitation for 24 h having reached removal rates of 62 5 58 9 and 89 8 for cod tn and pt respectively wrede et al 65 used aspergillus fumigatus species and several microalgae species having verified a high efficiency of anaerobically digested piggery effluent reaching better results with co cultivation than with isolated fungi and microalgae species with nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates of approximately 90 initial nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the effluent were of 680 7 mg l 1 and 145 7 mg l 1 respectively zhao et al 67 used co pelletization of microalgae chlorella vulgaris and fungi ganoderma lucidum in the treatment of biogas slurry from an anaerobic digestion reactor in a pig farm wastewater treatment plant cod 1061 51 26 23 mg l 1 nt 182 64 11 68 mg l 1 tp 17 96 1 93 mg l 1 and co2 36 17 1 97 v v the optimised experiment took place under the following conditions sludge mixed medium ratio of 3 7 fungus microalga ratio of 1 10 1 0 106 of g lucidum spores l 1 light intensity 200 μmol m 2 s 1 photoperiod of 12 12 h red blue light 5 5 temperature of 28 c magnetic stirring of 160 rpm for 8 days the cod tn tp and co2 removal efficiencies were of 92 17 5 28 89 83 4 36 90 31 4 69 and 74 26 3 14 respectively under similar conditions microalgae chlorella vulgaris and fungi ganoderma lucidum were cultivated in medium supplemented with strigolactone 10 9 m of gr24 light intensity of 225 μmol m 2 s 1 red blue light of 5 5 light dark photoperiod of 12 12 h temperature of 25 2 c for 7 days for crude biogas and biogas slurry treatment cod 1671 28 44 39 mg l 1 tn 107 54 7 75 mg l 1 and tp 25 12 2 47 mg l 1 obtaining the maximum cod tn and tp efficiency of 76 35 6 87 78 77 7 13 and 79 49 7 43 respectively 68 li zhang and yang 7 assessed the effects of nitrogen glucose and phosphorus in the remediation of arsenic contaminated wastewaters using fungi algae pellets aspergillus oryzae and chlorella vulgaris 26 c 125 rpm 112 μmol m 2 s 1 photoperiod of 12 12 h for 7 days the pellets showed a high potential in the bioremediation of arsenic contaminated wastewaters due to the high tolerance and capacity of accumulating the contaminant bodin et al 69 used the consortium formed by chlorella vulgaris microalgae and aspergillus niger fungi for the treatment of pharmaceutical groups usually found in aquatic environments the results showed that the use of bio pellets was effective in the removal of the 7 types of substances analysed with initial concentration between 8 and 11 mg l 1 each especially ranitidine with a removal percentage of 50 19 shen and chirwa 106 studied the potential of live and lyophilized fungi algae pellets aspergillus niger and tetradesmus obliquus as biosorbents for remediating wastewaters containing gold 30 mg l 1 the lyophilized pellets showed greater storage and adsorption potential than live pellets absorbing approximately 97 7 gold from multi metallic wastewaters in the column reactor srinuanpan et al 107 used pellets formed by trichoderma reesei and scenedesmus sp fungi in the remediation of secondary non sterile effluents generated by the seafood processing industry ph 7 7 1239 mg l 1 of cod tn 144 mg l 1 and tp 18 6 mg l 1 this resulted in the removal rate of 74 44 and 93 for cod tn and tp respectively therefore based on these studies the microalga fungus consortium has shown to be more advantageous in the treatment of wastewaters when compared with the axenic cultures nonetheless there are still several gaps to be filled on this subject highlighting the need for optimising culture parameters in future researchers in order to reach even more efficient results and even how to apply the fungus alga biomass produced from a biotechnological point of view 8 feasibility of the open cultivation system for symbiotic association using microalgae and other microbiological groups as previously pointed out microalgae can be cultivated in different system types these range from litres to billion litres as well as unsophisticated systems individual cultures in the case of open tanks under natural light and temperature conditions with low or zero control or sophisticated system with closed photobioreactors where it is possible to control cultivation parameters 108 109 one of the main problems faced in open microalgae cultivation systems is contamination by other microorganisms biological contamination can reduce product synthesis or inhibit microalgae cell growth nonetheless research in metabolic engineering has invested in solutions to reduce or mitigate these adverse conditions 8 according to kim et al 108 approximately 95 of total microalgae production takes place in open systems with roughly 20 000 t of microalgae year reaching productions of almost 180 t ha year under natural interference of other microorganisms in the cultivation medium however biomass production in closed photobioreactors is higher than 1500 t ha year due to operating conditions optimisation open microalgae cultivation systems can be raceway ponds tanks or circular ponds though high rate algal ponds hrap are more commonly used hraps have a high microalgae biomass production with commercial applications mainly for biofuel production purposes 9 110 hraps are compared to a running track or an oval pond 15 to 80 cm deep allowing solar light to enter with the entire bubble column euphotic facilitating photosynthesis in the entire system one important variable is the quality of solar light incidence in the system thus it is important to ensure that the pond is well located to allow adequate light irradiation which also interferes on the choice of microalgae species to be used in the system these systems usually present paddle wheels ensuring the mixing of the liquid and biomass optimising nutrient distribution microalgae suspension in the bubble column and gas exchange 9 111 one of the main advantages of open pond systems include their large surface area optimising co2 sequestration besides of the liquid evaporation what can increase the temperature in the bioreactor these systems are usually applied in large scale microalgal cultivation due to their low cost and easy operation maintenance and cleaning after cultivation however these open systems are also exposed to climate variation which can affect light intensity temperature water evaporation resulting in significant volume losses and impacting on culture stability low mass transfer due to the inefficient mixture hampering biomass productivity and its quality quantity 112 in addition the needed of large land areas for implementing the ponds but these can be set up in unfertile lands avoiding competition with food production due to limitations in water evaporation at a similar rate to land crops photoautotrophic biomass production in open systems is limited to only some species with many being unable to be maintained for long periods of time due to risk of contamination 9 despite the need for more control in cultivation conditions in open systems these are successfully used at a commercial scale for spirulina platensis haematococcus sp dunaliella salina as well as for genera chlorella sp scenedesmus acutodesmus tetradesmus and nannochloropsis sp among others 112 open natural ponds for microalgae cultivation include circular ponds commonly used in japan taiwan and indonesia for cultivating the chlorella species raceway ponds used in the cultivation of the arthrospira species in the united states and dunaliella salina in israel natural dunaliella salina ponds in mexico and australia inclined systems used in bulgaria for genera arthrospira and scenedesmus and chlorella in australia in turn tanks are usually used for production at a lower scale for genera used in aquaculture namely nannochloroposis oculate 110 113 aimed at improving microalgae biomass productivity researchers have studied and developed co2 injection systems or injection systems using combustion gas fg flue gas applied in open systems 111 being advantageous for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for instance yadav dukey and sen 114 assessed the capacity of culture chlorella vulgaris in the sequestration of combustion gases and biomass growth in open air pond systems under different co2 concentrations 0 04 only air and 10 2 for batch and semi continuous cultures for batch experiments with and without fg the co2 fixation rate and maximum biomass production were of 8 92 0 28 mg l 1 d 1 and 0 11 0 08 g l 1 33 79 4 02 mg l 1 d 1 and 0 3 0 13 g l 1 respectively in turn for the semi continuous mode with fg addition mass density of 0 428 0 12 g l 1 and co2 fixation rate of 102 66 5 77 mg l 1 d 1 was obtained being higher some studies focused on the use of extremophilic species growing under extreme temperature ph and salinity conditions being successfully produced at a commercial scale being sustainable and reliable in an open air system for instance the dunaliella salina species has a high growth rate in saline waters due to its high intracell glycerol content contributing towards the protection against osmotic pressure spirulina platensis and spirulina maxima are capable of surviving and growing well at a high ph between 9 and 11 5 114 115 aimed at optimising microalgae cultivation conditions in open systems researchers also have focused on attempting to solve or minimise any environmental physical and even economic cultivation issues for instance baldev et al 116 cultivated chorella vulgaris microalgae in an open pond system 35 000 l 15 rpm cell density of 2 106 cells ml 1 with a low cost optimised medium urea superphosphate and potassium at 91 9 72 9 and 62 7 mg l 1 respectively and ph 8 03 for biomass production aimed at biodiesel production this ensured biomass productivity of 31 5 mg l 1 d 1 and lipids content of 25 5 ketheesan and nirmalakhandan 117 cultivated scenedesmus sp in an airlift driven raceway reactor 23 l air rate of 2400 ml min 1 circulation rate of 10 cm s 1 initial inoculum density of 0 15 g l 1 light intensity of 80 μmol m 2 s 1 for continuous mode and 110 μmol m 2 s 1 for batch mode maximum biomass productivity was of 0 085 g l 1 d 1 for the batch mode with co2 at 1 for 15 days for the continuous mode with 1 co2 for 18 days maximum biomass and lipids productivity were of 0 19 and 0 04 g l 1 d 1 respectively raeisossadati moheimani and parlevliet 118 analysed red and blue luminescent solar concentrators lscs to increase arthrospira platensis biomass and phycocyanin productivity in 21 cm deep outdoor raceway ponds at a mixing rate of 11 cm s 1 light intensity of 34 and 4 5 μmol photons s 1 for red and blue lscs respectively biomass and phycocyanin productivity increased by 26 and 44 respectively when using red lscs however blue lscs did not result in a significant increase in biomass productivity 9 contamination by protozoa in cultivation systems biological contaminants such as zooplankton bacteria fungi protozoa other algae and viruses can have either a positive or negative effect on microalgae cell growth in open cultivation systems contamination will eventually occur through gas exchange co2 and o2 between air and liquid culture through the contact with animals and insects or even through the water used as previously mentioned open systems have the greatest disadvantage of greater susceptibility to contamination by predator species these predators can drastically reduce production yields or in extreme cases leading to total cultivation loss once an important competitor has established residence in the pond it becomes extremely difficult to eradicate it 9 therefore it is necessary to develop ways of eliminating inhibiting the action of these contaminants without hindering the development of the desired species protozoa are natural bacteria and microalgae predators and have been used as bio indicators in community assays due to their short generation time and rapid responses to environmental changes the body size spectrum of protozoa communities was successfully employed to analyse the defence capacity of chlorella sp and nannochloropsis oceanica protozoa under protozoa herding protozoa communities were exposed to different concentrations of both microalgae 100 control 104 105 106 and 107 cells ml 1 for a period of 9 days each in sum both species showed a strong defense effect in the body size spectrum in which the body size distinction of protozoa communities showed a significant reduction in microalgae concentrations higher than 106 cells ml 1 119 under the same conditions gui et al 120 explored functional distinction measures based on biological characteristics to identify the effect of microalgae protection against protozoa in addition results showed that functional distinction measures present a downward trend of these microorganisms throughout the concentration gradient of both aforementioned microalgae according to zhu jiang and fa 115 biological contamination can occur in any cultivation phase nonetheless microalgae are capable of adapting to the environment tolerating extreme environmental conditions while biological contaminants require specific conditions to survive therefore environmental control is a way of inhibiting contamination such as by maintaining culture ph under alkaline conditions 10 11 as well as the rapid increase in light intensity to 30 000 lx salinity above 15 nacl and temperature increase can all have a positive influence on microalgae in terms of protozoa development zhao et al 121 state that extracellular microalgae excretion inhibits protozoa development in this regard the authors carried out a controlled laboratory assay to evaluate the inhibitory effect on ciliated euplotes vannus growth under different densities of marine microalgae nannochloropsis oceanica high moderate and low density respectively maximum population densities of n oceanica were of 210 350 and 300 ind ml 1 for cultivation with high moderate and low algae density respectively preliminary results confirmed that protozoa growth was inhibited in the medium with high microalgae density suggesting that extracellular excrements of n oceanica have the potential of controlling inhibiting protozoa contamination in large scale microalgae cultivation 10 conclusion and future works bioremediation in different wastewaters in open microalgae cultivation systems and their symbiotic relationship with other microorganisms have a great potential for solving environmental issues besides reducing demand for supplies such as clean water energy co2 and nutrient injection for microalgae cultivation also noteworthy are the advantages of co cultivation systems in wastewater when compared to axenic cultures especially in terms of the degradation of organic compounds phosphorus and nitrogen absorption and co2 sequestration these benefits are observed due to the synergistic relationship between these consortia such as metabolic and gas exchanges as well as the high ph adjustment in the medium in addition microalgae contribute to renewable energy production namely of biodiesel and biogas as well as valuable co products such as fertilizers animal feed cosmetics among others as it was possible to see in the entire manuscript bacteria are generally used with microalgae to treat wastewater probably because they are the main agent used in secondary wastewater treatment for organic matter removal mainly and microalgae have efficiency in remove nitrogen and phosphorous for yeast microalga consortium the main application today is regarding the production of lipids for high value products or biodiesel production but more research is needed in order to improve this application range on the other hand fungus microalga consortium is used mainly for effluent with recalcitrant pollutants or to improve the microalgal harvesting in the biological process but as the use of yeast this type of consortium should be more studied because the biotechnological plasticity of these microorganisms can help in the obtaining of better economic applications helping the sustainability and feasibility of the system in the past decades many studies have been successfully carried out at a laboratory scale nevertheless a lot still needs to be done to understand prevailing gaps of these mutualistic relationship and optimal cultivation conditions in large scale cultivation for industrial purposes ensuring high efficiency levels and finding promising alternatives for recovering the biomass produced economic analysis and life cycle assessment are needed in order to provide information regarding the feasibility of the process in large

12736,this is a threefold study concerning a novel corrugated sheet mbr besides the optimization of the hydrodynamics and of air consumption to achieve excellent amelioration of fouling this study introduces a novel corrugated sheet cs membrane to the research community the cs membrane has a general plate configuration similar to a standard flat sheet fs membrane but at 1 6 mm thickness it is much thinner the rows of hemispherical hollow units on each side create corrugations and coupled with the thinness of the plate they give a surface area per unit volume value around that of hollow fiber systems the hydrodynamics and fouling of the cs membrane were compared with those of fs membrane through computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation and experiments based upon these results a large scale corrugated sheet membrane bioreactor cs mbr with four decks was designed the study included a consideration of three different designs of aerators the spacing between the decks and the aeration rate with the recommended partitioning design of aerator the optimized nozzle velocity was found to be 13 m s corresponding to a world leading specific aeration demand sadm aeration amount per unit membrane area per unit time of 0 074 nm3m 2 h 1 this corresponds to a 70 reduction with respect to a fsmbr operated with slug bubbling and is just one eighth of the traditional industrial usage of 0 3 to 0 58 nm3m 2 h 1 depending on format of the system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords corrugated sheet cs membrane large scale mbr cfd fouling control air consumption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbr are an efficient device which have replaced the secondary sedimentation process in wastewater treatment 1 however fouling remains a critical issue that reduces membrane performance 2 4 at present the main method to attenuate membrane fouling is the use of aeration to scour membrane surface 5 7 but consequently there is a corresponding high energy consumption 8 10 which impedes the wider adoption of mbrs 11 12 both flat sheet fs and hollow fiber hf mbrs have been commonly used in industry over the past two decades 8 13 16 it is well known that for fs mbr system is easy to maintain with only a small amount of sludge sedimentation but on the other hand the loading capacity is low and normally backwash cannot be conducted although the hf membrane module overcomes these two shortcomings there is the issue of hair twinning i e the binding together of filaments caused by constituents in the sewage and this causes dead zones poor hydraulic circulation and hence heavily fouling 17 thus in order to improve the normal membrane features some researches have recently focused on variations to the membrane format in order to reduce membrane fouling and improve filtration performance one approach has been to physically press pvdf flat sheet membranes to generate a corrugated surface structure 18 this was explored in the context of seawater desalination process and flux was higher and there was less salt deposition on the membrane surface whilst the corrugation of the membrane surface is expected to ameliorate fouling simply corrugating the membranes in a traditional system if this were possible would still lead to the retention of a major constraint namely the relatively small surface area per unit volume that is inherent in fsmbr systems compared with hollow fiber ones to address this issue a novel type of corrugated sheet cs membrane was recently proposed and is now produced and assembled as an mbr system for industrial application beijing origin water membrane technology co ltd beijing china as shown in fig 1 this new type of cs membrane consists of a very thin polyethylene terephthalate pet flat central sheet that is just 90 μm thick and hemispherical channels on either side the overall thickness is 1 6 mm which is similar to that of hollow fibers with these dimensions the loading capacity is improved and the cs mbr system can achieve surface area per unit volume values close to 400 m2 m3 which is superior to both the value of 256 m2 m3 19 and the value of 300 m2 m3 used by cranfield as a standard for hollow fiber mbr systems 20 the strength of the cs sheets enables them to be mounted so that the bubble flow is transverse to the corrugated surface thus the flow creates beneficial ripples it is well known that the combination of i unsteady flow or oscillatory flow with ii baffles or corrugations increases mass transfer at surfaces and inhibits fouling 21 23 and this is discussed further in section 3 4 moreover the arrangement of the cs sheets enables the permeate to be conveyed horizontally through the hemispherical hollow fibers so that the permeate collection can be on both sides this arrangement enables more and better mbr configurations such as multiple decks 4 6 decks are normal with a corrugated sheet membrane bioreactor cs mbr the multi decks are served by the same aeration pipe which significantly reduces the air consumption for mbrs this is the important operating cost and the level of consumption measured in units of nm3m 2h 1 i e volume per unit area per unit time has often been the most important issue faced in large scale mbr application in industry 24 currently this new cs mbr is applied into large scale water treatment in beijing taiyuan and shaanxi province of china the corrugation on membrane surface in the new cs mbr creates hydrodynamic flows that are at least as complex as the flow in normal fsmbr 25 28 moreover it has been unclear how hydrodynamics and fouling control effect varied in cs mbr comparing to those obtained in fsmbr 19 29 thus a fundamental study was undertaken to examine the fluid dynamics and fouling in cs mbr systems as cs mbr systems are relatively new they have yet to be studied in detail issues addressed in our study included the aeration system and the spacing between decks the spacing is known to influence the two phase flow in the upper part 30 moreover although there is a link between the hydrodynamics and fouling 31 34 it is important to assess if the new design created unexpected dead zones which might cause unexpected fouling thus our study included an experimental examination of fouling other components were cfd simulations and electro diffusion edm studies 35 finally the aeration usage was calculated and compared which could provide a reference for the practical application of cs mbr in industry 2 methods the corrugated membrane is made of pvdf material with an internal supporting pet plate as shown in fig 1 due to the special structure between the membrane and pet plate the corrugated hemispheres form independent permeate channels these channels are connected to the water collection system that is operated under suction as water is collected on both sides there is a reduced path length this together with the excellent water permeability permits operation at a reduced tmp the level is around two thirds of the value needed in traditional mbrs 2 1 experimental method 2 1 1 shear stress measurement shear stress was measured for nine positions using the electro diffusion method edm 7 36 in two plexiglass tanks of fs and cs respectively as shown in fig 2 with dimensions of 180 70 5 mm an air nozzle of diameter 3 mm at the base of the tank bottom provided aeration of 1 l min the fouling experiment was carried out in a larger rectangular bio reactor tank measuring 750 350 120 mm two membrane modules of fs and cs origin water co ltd china were immersed in the reactor with effective filtration area of 0 1 m2 the aeration conditions were same for both modules with 2 5 l min of aeration delivered with pulsing at 1 hz the pulsing of the air flow has previously been found to be beneficial 27 28 the solution was prepared with ultrapure water potassium ferrocyanide 0 01 m and sodium hydroxide 0 5 m the experimental schematic diagram is shown in fig 2 a 200 mv electricity was continuously supplied by a stabilized voltage supply current was recorded by ammeter and the rheostat resistance was set to be 100 ω electrodes of platinum and nickel were used for the anode and cathode respectively the latter were at nine positions on the walls in both tanks as shown in fig 2 b in section s1 1 of supplementary material experimental method details are presented 2 1 2 fouling experiments the experiment was carried out in a 750 350 120 mm rectangular bio reactor tank the operating liquid level was 700 mm controlled by a peristaltic pump as shown in fig 3 two membrane modules were immersed in the reactor one with fs membrane and the other with the cs one origin water co ltd china effective filtration areas were 0 1 m2 the aeration conditions were same for both modules aeration pipe was located 120 mm directly below the modules with 2 5 l min flow rate and 1 hz frequency during operation permeate flux and transmembrane pressure tmp were recorded the latter by digital pressure gauge the experiments were conducted at room temperature activated sludge details could be found in supplementary material s1 2 2 1 3 aeration experiments additionally new configurations of aeration pipe were initially designed and compared with the traditional one slug bubbling process could be achieved via solenoid valve air flow rate was fixed at 78 l min and bubble frequency at 1 hz detail information is shown in supplementary materials section s1 3 2 2 cfd simulation method the aeration device was designed as a cuboid box whose bottom had been removed as shown in fig s2 during aeration the air entered the aeration box and its pressure displaced some of the liquid causing a liquid level to form within the box the air flowed out from the nozzles the drop in liquid level is related to the pressure drop across the aeration holes in this design there were 14 nozzles on each side of the aeration box spaced as pairs with a gap of 12 mm other dimensions are shown in fig s2 a 2 2 1 governing equations gas liquid two phase flow was simulated in ansys fluent 14

mass transfer process and membrane water permeability were not considered in the simulation a second order upwind scheme was chosen for momentum and k ε equations discretization presto pressure staggering option scheme was adopted for pressure term calculation the aeration pipe outside wall is one of the wall boundary conditions and the gas inlet is set to be inlet whilst the outflow condition was set at the air nozzle boundary the boundaries for walls were all stationary and there was a no fluid slip condition at the membrane surface the important assumption is the membrane sheets were considered to be rigid walls in other words the membrane is assumed to be inflexible sheets which could not bend which is a little different from the actual situation additionally the influence of membrane permeation upon shear stress calculation is neglected a decision that is supported by order of magnitude calculation details for cfd simulation method was given in section s2 2 of supplementary materials consisting of numerical geometry mesh detail simulation models and equations fig s4 gives the typical mesh example 3 results and discussion before considering large scale design of cs mbr systems in section 3 2 and air consumption of the cs mbr with that of other mbrs in section 3 3 a two fold experimental comparison of cs and fs membranes is made after examining the shear stress generated on the membrane surfaces the experimental findings regarding the propensity of those surfaces to fouling are presented 3 1 experimental comparison of cs and fs membrane 3 1 1 shear stress comparison the fouling mitigation is closely related to shear stress which has been studied in multiple previous work 7 19 28 hence the shear stress induced by two phase flow was carefully studied for the cs membrane format generally there are two methods for cfd model validation one is to take photos by high speed camera for the bubbles as shown in our previous papers 39 41 and leslie et al 19 the other is to measure shear stress and compare 17 both validation methods are recommended and sufficient for the two phase flow cfd model although the gas liquid flow model has been validated by bubble photos in our previous studies 39 41 shear stress was measured in this study in order to have robust measures for the two types of membranes in particular the shear stress distribution on the fs and cs membranes were obtained from cfd simulation and compared with edm data as shown in fig 4 it is found that the error between simulation and edm results is 8 for both cs and fs membrane which indicated the cfd model is robust for hydrodynamics simulation a preliminary study of grid independence was performed an increase in the number of nodes was found to have essentially no effect also it was found that the results of simulations based on the mesh shown in this work were in accordance with experimental results moreover the comparison of simulation with experiment in fig 4 validates our simulation model fig 4 a shows that the bubble size is similar in both modules however there are differences for shear stress between the two surfaces especially in the bubble rim and nose areas the detail information of shear stress comparison is analyzed in fig 4 b it shows that the maximum shear stress at nine positions on fs is in the range of 1 3 2 3 pa which is similar with cfd prediction as clearly shown the shear stress on cs surface is higher than that on the fs surface the former has values in the range of 1 8 3 0 pa the highest difference of shear stress between two modules is around 1 pa at position 5 corresponding to the bubble nose part this is partially because the special ripple structure on the cs surface enhances the turbulence and hence the shear stress as also detected in previously mentioned research 37 one can conclude that the cs membrane is scoured more strongly than the fs one the effect of the more intense hydrodynamics is further studied in the next section addressing fouling performance 3 1 2 fouling performance the fouling experiments for both flat and corrugated membrane components were carried out for 360 h and fig 5 shows the performance data in terms of transmembrane pressure tmp and permeability in fig 5 a the initial tmps are relatively close both of which are around 2 kpa during the initial period from 0 to 50 h the flat membrane has a relatively rapid increase in tmp whilst that of cs increased at around half the rate in the following 150 h the rate of tmp increase is similar for both membranes the offset is about 7 5 kpa which is the same as what was set during the first 50 h of operation after 200 h the rate of increase in tmp for both membranes is reduced during this stage fluctuations in the tmp are noticeable particularly for fs and the difference in tmp widened slightly to around 10 kpa in general it indicates that cs membrane fouled less than the fs membrane particularly during the initial period of operation the evolution in permeability is displayed in fig 5 b the initial permeabilities are 700 and 920 l m2 h bar for fs and cs respectively during the first 150 h both specific fluxes experienced rapid decline and in the final phase the permeabilities tended towards 100 and 50 l m2 h bar for cs and fs respectively also it can be noted that beyond 250 h the rate of increase of tmp is distinctly lower for cs compared with fs clearly cs type in comparison with the fs one has features which generate improved hydrodynamics that ameliorate fouling as discussed in section 3 1 1 of shear stress is key to fouling control 38 3 2 large scale cs mbr design given the above very promising results a large scale corrugated sheet membrane bioreactor cs mbr with four decks was designed four decks are standard for most large scale application of the cs mbr but issues needing addressing were i the aeration section needs to be optimized to achieve control of fouling whilst avoiding excessive aeration ii the influence of the gap distance between different decks and iii the influence of aeration rates nozzle velocities these three areas form the subsections of this section and then section 3 3 compares the air consumption of the optimized cs mbr with that of other mbrs 3 2 1 aeration pipe design hydrodynamic behavior from three aeration pipe configurations was analyzed and compared through cfd and experiment assuming same velocity for each pair of nozzles the 14 nozzles can be represented by seven groups hence the nozzle group number was ranked 1 7 from left to right of aeration pipe as shown in the abscissa of fig s2 b inlet air flow rates were the same in all cases and two rates were applied here one was the traditional normal value used in industry of 10 l min m2 the other was around half of this value at approximately 5 l min m2 the air velocity of each nozzle from cfd simulation was plotted as function of nozzle number as shown in fig 6 in fig 6 a to c the nozzle velocity distributions from three aeration pipe configurations are presented whilst in fig 6 d the velocity standard variance was calculated for configuration 1 at both flow rates the velocity from nozzle 1 is much higher than from the others furthermore that from nozzles 3 and 4 are much smaller than any of the other five nozzles as shown in fig 6 d this configuration has the highest variance now when the aeration pipe is half partitioned or more fully partitioned the velocity variation between different nozzles is reduced the greater uniformity of flow is confirmed by the reduced variances in fig 6 d indicating as partitioning is increased the variance reduced thus in configuration 3 with fully partitioned nozzle velocity has less fluctuation and the most uniform as configuration 2 structure is a simple one both it and configuration 3 were tested in further bubbling experiments bubble behavior of two aeration devices configuration 2 and 3 was tested and the bubble size was measured due to symmetry only half of the aerator was required for the experiment the experimental results are shown in fig 7 wherein nozzle number was defined as 1 4 the bubble size was defined as horizontal width in x direction w x and vertical height in y direction w y measured values are tabulated in table 1 for configuration 2 the bubble size is always greater for nozzle 1 and 4 than it is for nozzles 2 and 3 the bubble size distribution is noticeably more uniform with configuration 3 which in agreement with cfd results in fig 6 inspection of the details in table 1 and in particular the significant reduction in variance with configuration 3 indicated that this is optimal in providing uniform bubbling 3 2 2 variation of gap distance between corrugated decks after determining the optimal aeration pipe design the variation of gap distance between the bottom two decks ground decks and the top two decks top decks of a cs mbr was studied in one of our previous studies it is shown that slug bubble could induce effective hydrodynamics for a fs membrane height of 1500 mm 30 now considering that the cs membrane height is 725 mm the ground two decks in a cs mbr were arranged together with no gap distance h 1 and the same was done for the upper two decks i e h 1 and h 3 in fig s3were set equal to zero thus the distance h 2 between the middle two decks i e space between the second and third deck in fig s3 was the key variable because the processes of bubble recombination and redistribution into the upper layer of membrane modules are strongly influenced by the height of this region 30 the distance h 2 was varied from 100 to 600 mm with nozzle air velocity fixed at 13 m s owing to the symmetric boundary the bubble distribution and shear stress for six channels were calculated in this simulation channel 1 is in the center of the system positioned over the central aeration pipe whilst channel 6 is far away from the center the bubble distribution and shear stress comparison are shown in fig 8 the results showed as one would expect that the gap h 2 had little influences on the hydrodynamics of the ground decks thus a representative set of cfd results at h 2 300 mm is shown in fig 8 a in all six channels a slug bubble with spherical cap is produced and several small bubbles are scattered in the wake region it shows that intense shear stress is mainly concentrated in the wake region due to the secondary turbulence high shear stress is also observed elsewhere the clear finding is that for the chosen conditions and range of h 2 there would be sufficiently intense hydrodynamic effects in ground decks independent of the h 2 value fig 8 b shows the bubble distribution in channels of the upper two decks for gap distance h 2 from 100 to 600 mm from case i h 2 100 mm it illustrates that large bubbles are generated in channel 3 whilst those in other channels are small especially channels 1 and 6 bubble size in all channels except channel 3 has increased as h 2 increased to be 200 mm in case ii but it is still small for channels 1 and 6 bubble distribution reaches an optimum in terms of uniformity as h 2 became 300 mm in case iii further the uniformity decreases as gap h 2 increases to be 400 600 mm so overall the bubble size and uniformity is found to vary with the gap distance h 2 and a value of 300 mm gave the greatest uniformity fig 8 c shows the magnitude and distribution of shear stress in different channels for each gap distance h 2 for 100 mm case i the shear stress in some regions of channel 3 reached 4 pa whilst there are few areas reaching 4 pa in channels 4 and 5 however for most areas in channels 1 2 and 6 shear stress is lower than 1 pa this is improved as h 2 increased to 200 mm with the shear stress in several parts of all six membrane surfaces reaching 4 pa but in most regions of channel 5 it is lower than 0 5 pa for cases iii and iv with h 2 300 to 400 mm the situation is optimal in terms of shear stress distribution with most parts of all six channels having values over 1 5 pa at h 2 500 mm the shear stress of channels 1 2 5 and 6 has decreased and for h 2 600 mm the non uniformity of shear stress is even more obviously these observations are confirmed in fig 8 d which presents the average shear stress of channels 1 to 6 in the ground and top decks under different gap distance h 2 it is presented that average shear stress of each channel in ground decks is not only 2 5 pa but there is little variation between channels as h 2 is 300 or 400 mm it is found that the average shear stress is over 2 pa on membrane surfaces in top decks for other gap distances it is lower than 1 5 pa in some channels which would be insufficient shear stress for fouling control not only is the gap of 300 to 400 mm optimal to achieve uniform and an enhanced hydrodynamic effect but based upon previous work the values of shear stress will give excellent amelioration of fouling 7 32 39 3 2 3 variation of aeration rate for industry air velocity is an important variable as it is directly related to the aeration cost and system operation 26 40 41 in this section hydrodynamic effect was studied at five nozzle flow velocities which were shown in figs 9 and 10 for ground and top decks respectively in fig 9 a clearly at a nozzle velocity 10 m s in case i the bubbles generated in the ground decks are not uniform and are especially small in channel 6 as the nozzle velocity increases from 11 5 to 16 m s the bubble size increases and the uniformity becomes better amongst different channels the magnitude of shear stresses on membrane walls are shown in fig 9 b clearly at velocities of 13 to 14 5 m s the shear stresses generated in most regions of all channels are uniform and could reach up to 4 pa at lower velocities the shear stresses in most regions of channels 1 and 6 are 1 pa also at higher velocities of 16 m s the uniformity of distribution becomes worse compared with the mid range velocities this is confirmed by fig 9 c clearly for the ground decks the optimal nozzle velocity is in the range 13 to 14 5 m s the results for these two velocities are shown with thicker lines in fig 9 c for top decks variation of bubble distribution and shear stress are shown in fig 10 as with the lower two decks a velocity of 13 m s has regions where shear stress 0 4 pa e g in channels 1 2 and 6 furthermore the average value of shear stress varies with channel number and is 1 5 pa in 4 channels as shown in fig 10 c it is more uniform at 13 16 m s nozzle velocity and the average values of shear stress are over 2 5 pa for six channels overall by reviewing distribution of bubbles and shear stress through both ground and top decks the most uniform and intense hydrodynamic effect is produced at nozzle velocities between 13 and 14 5 m s hence this is the optimal range beneficial for fouling control performance 3 3 air consumption based on those optimal design of mbr variables we can estimate aeration cost of a cs mbr operated so as to have an average shear stress 1 5 pa in all channels at the optimal operating conditions of h 2 300 mm and nozzle velocity 13 m s the membranes in 12 channels would have surface shear stress over 1 5 pa which indicates they could be all effectively covered by one aeration pipe based on these optimal design conditions air consumption for four and six deck cs mbrs were calculated as shown in table 2 the specific aeration demand per membrane area sadm for four deck cs mbr is 0 074 nm3m 2 h 1 whilst the estimate for a six deck cs mbr is 0 049 nm3m 2 h 1 the air flow rate per square meter is 0 91 1 37 l min m2 which is much lower than 10 l min m2 for fsmbr in industry and lower than the figure given for a hfmbr by verrecht et al 20 according to our previous research the optimized fsmbr could save 50 of air consumption compared to the traditional industrial air consumption whilst the four deck and six deck cs mbr could save 86 and 91 of the air consumption respectively this indicates that the cs mbr reduces around 70 air consumption than the fsmbr to achieve effective hydrodynamics for fouling control 3 4 discussion patterning or other modification of the shape of a membrane surface has been explored for 20 years the approach of most research is to make ripples on the flat membrane through different methods to induce intense turbulence and increase the membrane area 42 in most studies the ripples structure on membrane surface has been found to be beneficial for fouling control bringing benefits such as enhanced shear stress less filter cake larger filtration flux etc 37 the hydrodynamics induced by corrugations have also been found to be beneficial in limiting salt deposition in membrane distillation 42 43 our findings on fouling are consistent with these previous findings in the current work not only is the membrane surface improved but the membrane supporting pattern thickness and water conveyance has also been modified the new cs membrane has unique features combining some characteristics from both hf and fs membranes characteristics the unique features of cs membrane studied in this work are summarized and compared in table 3 for non flat membrane the surface area distinction was reported by barambu et al 44 in this work the area for corrugated sheet is taken as the actual area by considering the corrugated shape which is 1 1 times that of a flat sheet with the same projected area the greater area will give a lower local flux which according to critical flux theory 45 and threshold flux theory 46 will give less fouling decoupling this contribution from the hydrodynamics is difficult however from an engineering perspective the important parameters are a sadm and b productivity per unit volume i e amount of permeate per unit volume of the mbr the improvement in these two parameters is attributed to the two advantages offered by the corrugated membrane namely its relatively larger area and the stronger hydrodynamics the sadm value is based upon 4 decks and it will be recalled that in section 3 2 2 the height of 4 cs decks is equivalent to the height of two fs decks thus the comparison between flat and corrugated in table 3 is a fair one the features of the cs membrane assembly mentioned above are particularly beneficial for large scale application for example the small thickness of cs membrane could increase the loading capacity and solving the low capacity issue faced in fsmbr application moreover the general plane sheet configuration of the cs membrane provides a format that avoids any clogging such as that found when fibers bind hair twinning in hfmbrs furthermore the aspect ratio of the cs mbr creates the possibility of having multiple decks which significantly reduce the air consumption that are at a world leadingly low level for these multiple reasons the cs mbr format is an exciting new prospect in the industrial application of mbrs 4 conclusions a novel corrugated membrane format with a surface area per unit volume value equivalent to that of hollow fiber mbr systems has been evaluated and a design of a multi deck cs mbr elaborated specific conclusions arising from the experimental and simulation investigations are 1 from a comparison of the hydrodynamics and related fouling performance of the new cs membrane system with the fs membrane system it is established that the surface shear stress induced on the cs membrane could be 1 25 times larger than that of fs under the same experimental conditions the required tmp in a cs mbr is two thirds of that required in a fs mbr under comparable conditions the enhanced hydrodynamic effect of intense turbulence and shear stress is beneficial for membrane fouling control 2 for optimal performance a large scale cs mbr should have the following features a be designed with a fully partitioned aeration pipe so as to have as uniform an air velocity distribution as possible b be designed with at least four decks c for a four deck system have essential zero gap between the lower two and upper two decks and a gap of 300 mm in the middle of the system i e values of h 1 h 2 h 3 are 0 300 0 mm respectively and d have a design nozzle velocity of 13 m s which together with an fully partitioned aeration pipe will ensure a small variance of 1 4 m s overall an essentially uniform distributions of slug bubbles will generate sufficiently intense shear stress on membrane surfaces 3 the standardized aeration rate sadm for the large scale cs mbr system can be 0 074 nm3m 2 h 1 which corresponds to a 70 reduction with respect to an optimized fsmbr operated with slug bubbling the value of 0 074 nm3m 2 h 1 represents a massive reduction with respect to the traditional industrial usage of 0 58 nm3m 2 h 1 given these specific findings this new type of corrugated membrane has great potential to widen the application of flat sheet mbr systems achieving a good balance between i having a drastically reduced air consumption and ii excellent fouling control should be readily achievable because it has been found in our evaluation that the new corrugated membrane benefits both areas with more difficult to treat streams it may be necessary to take a smaller benefit with regard to air consumption in order to achieve good fouling control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12736,this is a threefold study concerning a novel corrugated sheet mbr besides the optimization of the hydrodynamics and of air consumption to achieve excellent amelioration of fouling this study introduces a novel corrugated sheet cs membrane to the research community the cs membrane has a general plate configuration similar to a standard flat sheet fs membrane but at 1 6 mm thickness it is much thinner the rows of hemispherical hollow units on each side create corrugations and coupled with the thinness of the plate they give a surface area per unit volume value around that of hollow fiber systems the hydrodynamics and fouling of the cs membrane were compared with those of fs membrane through computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation and experiments based upon these results a large scale corrugated sheet membrane bioreactor cs mbr with four decks was designed the study included a consideration of three different designs of aerators the spacing between the decks and the aeration rate with the recommended partitioning design of aerator the optimized nozzle velocity was found to be 13 m s corresponding to a world leading specific aeration demand sadm aeration amount per unit membrane area per unit time of 0 074 nm3m 2 h 1 this corresponds to a 70 reduction with respect to a fsmbr operated with slug bubbling and is just one eighth of the traditional industrial usage of 0 3 to 0 58 nm3m 2 h 1 depending on format of the system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords corrugated sheet cs membrane large scale mbr cfd fouling control air consumption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbr are an efficient device which have replaced the secondary sedimentation process in wastewater treatment 1 however fouling remains a critical issue that reduces membrane performance 2 4 at present the main method to attenuate membrane fouling is the use of aeration to scour membrane surface 5 7 but consequently there is a corresponding high energy consumption 8 10 which impedes the wider adoption of mbrs 11 12 both flat sheet fs and hollow fiber hf mbrs have been commonly used in industry over the past two decades 8 13 16 it is well known that for fs mbr system is easy to maintain with only a small amount of sludge sedimentation but on the other hand the loading capacity is low and normally backwash cannot be conducted although the hf membrane module overcomes these two shortcomings there is the issue of hair twinning i e the binding together of filaments caused by constituents in the sewage and this causes dead zones poor hydraulic circulation and hence heavily fouling 17 thus in order to improve the normal membrane features some researches have recently focused on variations to the membrane format in order to reduce membrane fouling and improve filtration performance one approach has been to physically press pvdf flat sheet membranes to generate a corrugated surface structure 18 this was explored in the context of seawater desalination process and flux was higher and there was less salt deposition on the membrane surface whilst the corrugation of the membrane surface is expected to ameliorate fouling simply corrugating the membranes in a traditional system if this were possible would still lead to the retention of a major constraint namely the relatively small surface area per unit volume that is inherent in fsmbr systems compared with hollow fiber ones to address this issue a novel type of corrugated sheet cs membrane was recently proposed and is now produced and assembled as an mbr system for industrial application beijing origin water membrane technology co ltd beijing china as shown in fig 1 this new type of cs membrane consists of a very thin polyethylene terephthalate pet flat central sheet that is just 90 μm thick and hemispherical channels on either side the overall thickness is 1 6 mm which is similar to that of hollow fibers with these dimensions the loading capacity is improved and the cs mbr system can achieve surface area per unit volume values close to 400 m2 m3 which is superior to both the value of 256 m2 m3 19 and the value of 300 m2 m3 used by cranfield as a standard for hollow fiber mbr systems 20 the strength of the cs sheets enables them to be mounted so that the bubble flow is transverse to the corrugated surface thus the flow creates beneficial ripples it is well known that the combination of i unsteady flow or oscillatory flow with ii baffles or corrugations increases mass transfer at surfaces and inhibits fouling 21 23 and this is discussed further in section 3 4 moreover the arrangement of the cs sheets enables the permeate to be conveyed horizontally through the hemispherical hollow fibers so that the permeate collection can be on both sides this arrangement enables more and better mbr configurations such as multiple decks 4 6 decks are normal with a corrugated sheet membrane bioreactor cs mbr the multi decks are served by the same aeration pipe which significantly reduces the air consumption for mbrs this is the important operating cost and the level of consumption measured in units of nm3m 2h 1 i e volume per unit area per unit time has often been the most important issue faced in large scale mbr application in industry 24 currently this new cs mbr is applied into large scale water treatment in beijing taiyuan and shaanxi province of china the corrugation on membrane surface in the new cs mbr creates hydrodynamic flows that are at least as complex as the flow in normal fsmbr 25 28 moreover it has been unclear how hydrodynamics and fouling control effect varied in cs mbr comparing to those obtained in fsmbr 19 29 thus a fundamental study was undertaken to examine the fluid dynamics and fouling in cs mbr systems as cs mbr systems are relatively new they have yet to be studied in detail issues addressed in our study included the aeration system and the spacing between decks the spacing is known to influence the two phase flow in the upper part 30 moreover although there is a link between the hydrodynamics and fouling 31 34 it is important to assess if the new design created unexpected dead zones which might cause unexpected fouling thus our study included an experimental examination of fouling other components were cfd simulations and electro diffusion edm studies 35 finally the aeration usage was calculated and compared which could provide a reference for the practical application of cs mbr in industry 2 methods the corrugated membrane is made of pvdf material with an internal supporting pet plate as shown in fig 1 due to the special structure between the membrane and pet plate the corrugated hemispheres form independent permeate channels these channels are connected to the water collection system that is operated under suction as water is collected on both sides there is a reduced path length this together with the excellent water permeability permits operation at a reduced tmp the level is around two thirds of the value needed in traditional mbrs 2 1 experimental method 2 1 1 shear stress measurement shear stress was measured for nine positions using the electro diffusion method edm 7 36 in two plexiglass tanks of fs and cs respectively as shown in fig 2 with dimensions of 180 70 5 mm an air nozzle of diameter 3 mm at the base of the tank bottom provided aeration of 1 l min the fouling experiment was carried out in a larger rectangular bio reactor tank measuring 750 350 120 mm two membrane modules of fs and cs origin water co ltd china were immersed in the reactor with effective filtration area of 0 1 m2 the aeration conditions were same for both modules with 2 5 l min of aeration delivered with pulsing at 1 hz the pulsing of the air flow has previously been found to be beneficial 27 28 the solution was prepared with ultrapure water potassium ferrocyanide 0 01 m and sodium hydroxide 0 5 m the experimental schematic diagram is shown in fig 2 a 200 mv electricity was continuously supplied by a stabilized voltage supply current was recorded by ammeter and the rheostat resistance was set to be 100 ω electrodes of platinum and nickel were used for the anode and cathode respectively the latter were at nine positions on the walls in both tanks as shown in fig 2 b in section s1 1 of supplementary material experimental method details are presented 2 1 2 fouling experiments the experiment was carried out in a 750 350 120 mm rectangular bio reactor tank the operating liquid level was 700 mm controlled by a peristaltic pump as shown in fig 3 two membrane modules were immersed in the reactor one with fs membrane and the other with the cs one origin water co ltd china effective filtration areas were 0 1 m2 the aeration conditions were same for both modules aeration pipe was located 120 mm directly below the modules with 2 5 l min flow rate and 1 hz frequency during operation permeate flux and transmembrane pressure tmp were recorded the latter by digital pressure gauge the experiments were conducted at room temperature activated sludge details could be found in supplementary material s1 2 2 1 3 aeration experiments additionally new configurations of aeration pipe were initially designed and compared with the traditional one slug bubbling process could be achieved via solenoid valve air flow rate was fixed at 78 l min and bubble frequency at 1 hz detail information is shown in supplementary materials section s1 3 2 2 cfd simulation method the aeration device was designed as a cuboid box whose bottom had been removed as shown in fig s2 during aeration the air entered the aeration box and its pressure displaced some of the liquid causing a liquid level to form within the box the air flowed out from the nozzles the drop in liquid level is related to the pressure drop across the aeration holes in this design there were 14

mass transfer process and membrane water permeability were not considered in the simulation a second order upwind scheme was chosen for momentum and k ε equations discretization presto pressure staggering option scheme was adopted for pressure term calculation the aeration pipe outside wall is one of the wall boundary conditions and the gas inlet is set to be inlet whilst the outflow condition was set at the air nozzle boundary the boundaries for walls were all stationary and there was a no fluid slip condition at the membrane surface the important assumption is the membrane sheets were considered to be rigid walls in other words the membrane is assumed to be inflexible sheets which could not bend which is a little different from the actual situation additionally the influence of membrane permeation upon shear stress calculation is neglected a decision that is supported by order of magnitude calculation details for cfd simulation method was given in section s2 2 of supplementary materials consisting of numerical geometry mesh detail simulation models and equations fig s4 gives the typical mesh example 3 results and discussion before considering large scale design of cs mbr systems in section 3 2 and air consumption of the cs mbr with that of other mbrs in section 3 3 a two fold experimental comparison of cs and fs membranes is made after examining the shear stress generated on the membrane surfaces the experimental findings regarding the propensity of those surfaces to fouling are presented 3 1 experimental comparison of cs and fs membrane 3 1 1 shear stress comparison the fouling mitigation is closely related to shear stress which has been studied in multiple previous work 7 19 28 hence the shear stress induced by two phase flow was carefully studied for the cs membrane format generally there are two methods for cfd model validation one is to take photos by high speed camera for the bubbles as shown in our previous papers 39 41 and leslie et al 19 the other is to measure shear stress and compare 17 both validation methods are recommended and sufficient for the two phase flow cfd model although the gas liquid flow model has been validated by bubble photos in our previous studies 39 41 shear stress was measured in this study in order to have robust measures for the two types of membranes in particular the shear stress distribution on the fs and cs membranes were obtained from cfd simulation and compared with edm data as shown in fig 4 it is found that the error between simulation and edm results is 8 for both cs and fs membrane which indicated the cfd model is robust for hydrodynamics simulation a preliminary study of grid independence was performed an increase in the number of nodes was found to have essentially no effect also it was found that the results of simulations based on the mesh shown in this work were in accordance with experimental results moreover the comparison of simulation with experiment in fig 4 validates our simulation model fig 4 a shows that the bubble size is similar in both modules however there are differences for shear stress between the two surfaces especially in the bubble rim and nose areas the detail information of shear stress comparison is analyzed in fig 4 b it shows that the maximum shear stress at nine positions on fs is in the range of 1 3 2 3 pa which is similar with cfd prediction as clearly shown the shear stress on cs surface is higher than that on the fs surface the former has values in the range of 1 8 3 0 pa the highest difference of shear stress between two modules is around 1 pa at position 5 corresponding to the bubble nose part this is partially because the special ripple structure on the cs surface enhances the turbulence and hence the shear stress as also detected in previously mentioned research 37 one can conclude that the cs membrane is scoured more strongly than the fs one the effect of the more intense hydrodynamics is further studied in the next section addressing fouling performance 3 1 2 fouling performance the fouling experiments for both flat and corrugated membrane components were carried out for 360 h and fig 5 shows the performance data in terms of transmembrane pressure tmp and permeability in fig 5 a the initial tmps are relatively close both of which are around 2 kpa during the initial period from 0 to 50 h the flat membrane has a relatively rapid increase in tmp whilst that of cs increased at around half the rate in the following 150 h the rate of tmp increase is similar for both membranes the offset is about 7 5 kpa which is the same as what was set during the first 50 h of operation after 200 h the rate of increase in tmp for both membranes is reduced during this stage fluctuations in the tmp are noticeable particularly for fs and the difference in tmp widened slightly to around 10 kpa in general it indicates that cs membrane fouled less than the fs membrane particularly during the initial period of operation the evolution in permeability is displayed in fig 5 b the initial permeabilities are 700 and 920 l m2 h bar for fs and cs respectively during the first 150 h both specific fluxes experienced rapid decline and in the final phase the permeabilities tended towards 100 and 50 l m2 h bar for cs and fs respectively also it can be noted that beyond 250 h the rate of increase of tmp is distinctly lower for cs compared with fs clearly cs type in comparison with the fs one has features which generate improved hydrodynamics that ameliorate fouling as discussed in section 3 1 1 of shear stress is key to fouling control 38 3 2 large scale cs mbr design given the above very promising results a large scale corrugated sheet membrane bioreactor cs mbr with four decks was designed four decks are standard for most large scale application of the cs mbr but issues needing addressing were i the aeration section needs to be optimized to achieve control of fouling whilst avoiding excessive aeration ii the influence of the gap distance between different decks and iii the influence of aeration rates nozzle velocities these three areas form the subsections of this section and then section 3 3 compares the air consumption of the optimized cs mbr with that of other mbrs 3 2 1 aeration pipe design hydrodynamic behavior from three aeration pipe configurations was analyzed and compared through cfd and experiment assuming same velocity for each pair of nozzles the 14 nozzles can be represented by seven groups hence the nozzle group number was ranked 1 7 from left to right of aeration pipe as shown in the abscissa of fig s2 b inlet air flow rates were the same in all cases and two rates were applied here one was the traditional normal value used in industry of 10 l min m2 the other was around half of this value at approximately 5 l min m2 the air velocity of each nozzle from cfd simulation was plotted as function of nozzle number as shown in fig 6 in fig 6 a to c the nozzle velocity distributions from three aeration pipe configurations are presented whilst in fig 6 d the velocity standard variance was calculated for configuration 1 at both flow rates the velocity from nozzle 1 is much higher than from the others furthermore that from nozzles 3 and 4 are much smaller than any of the other five nozzles as shown in fig 6 d this configuration has the highest variance now when the aeration pipe is half partitioned or more fully partitioned the velocity variation between different nozzles is reduced the greater uniformity of flow is confirmed by the reduced variances in fig 6 d indicating as partitioning is increased the variance reduced thus in configuration 3 with fully partitioned nozzle velocity has less fluctuation and the most uniform as configuration 2 structure is a simple one both it and configuration 3 were tested in further bubbling experiments bubble behavior of two aeration devices configuration 2 and 3 was tested and the bubble size was measured due to symmetry only half of the aerator was required for the experiment the experimental results are shown in fig 7 wherein nozzle number was defined as 1 4 the bubble size was defined as horizontal width in x direction w x and vertical height in y direction w y measured values are tabulated in table 1 for configuration 2 the bubble size is always greater for nozzle 1 and 4 than it is for nozzles 2 and 3 the bubble size distribution is noticeably more uniform with configuration 3 which in agreement with cfd results in fig 6 inspection of the details in table 1 and in particular the significant reduction in variance with configuration 3 indicated that this is optimal in providing uniform bubbling 3 2 2 variation of gap distance between corrugated decks after determining the optimal aeration pipe design the variation of gap distance between the bottom two decks ground decks and the top two decks top decks of a cs mbr was studied in one of our previous studies it is shown that slug bubble could induce effective hydrodynamics for a fs membrane height of 1500 mm 30 now considering that the cs membrane height is 725 mm the ground two decks in a cs mbr were arranged together with no gap distance h 1 and the same was done for the upper two decks i e h 1 and h 3 in fig s3were set equal to zero thus the distance h 2 between the middle two decks i e space between the second and third deck in fig s3 was the key variable because the processes of bubble recombination and redistribution into the upper layer of membrane modules are strongly influenced by the height of this region 30 the distance h 2 was varied from 100 to 600 mm with nozzle air velocity fixed at 13 m s owing to the symmetric boundary the bubble distribution and shear stress for six channels were calculated in this simulation channel 1 is in the center of the system positioned over the central aeration pipe whilst channel 6 is far away from the center the bubble distribution and shear stress comparison are shown in fig 8 the results showed as one would expect that the gap h 2 had little influences on the hydrodynamics of the ground decks thus a representative set of cfd results at h 2 300 mm is shown in fig 8 a in all six channels a slug bubble with spherical cap is produced and several small bubbles are scattered in the wake region it shows that intense shear stress is mainly concentrated in the wake region due to the secondary turbulence high shear stress is also observed elsewhere the clear finding is that for the chosen conditions and range of h 2 there would be sufficiently intense hydrodynamic effects in ground decks independent of the h 2 value fig 8 b shows the bubble distribution in channels of the upper two decks for gap distance h 2 from 100 to 600 mm from case i h 2 100 mm it illustrates that large bubbles are generated in channel 3 whilst those in other channels are small especially channels 1 and 6 bubble size in all channels except channel 3 has increased as h 2 increased to be 200 mm in case ii but it is still small for channels 1 and 6 bubble distribution reaches an optimum in terms of uniformity as h 2 became 300 mm in case iii further the uniformity decreases as gap h 2 increases to be 400 600 mm so overall the bubble size and uniformity is found to vary with the gap distance h 2 and a value of 300 mm gave the greatest uniformity fig 8 c shows the magnitude and distribution of shear stress in different channels for each gap distance h 2 for 100 mm case i the shear stress in some regions of channel 3 reached 4 pa whilst there are few areas reaching 4 pa in channels 4 and 5 however for most areas in channels 1 2 and 6 shear stress is lower than 1 pa this is improved as h 2 increased to 200 mm with the shear stress in several parts of all six membrane surfaces reaching 4 pa but in most regions of channel 5 it is lower than 0 5 pa for cases iii and iv with h 2 300 to 400 mm the situation is optimal in terms of shear stress distribution with most parts of all six channels having values over 1 5 pa at h 2 500 mm the shear stress of channels 1 2 5 and 6 has decreased and for h 2 600 mm the non uniformity of shear stress is even more obviously these observations are confirmed in fig 8 d which presents the average shear stress of channels 1 to 6 in the ground and top decks under different gap distance h 2 it is presented that average shear stress of each channel in ground decks is not only 2 5 pa but there is little variation between channels as h 2 is 300 or 400 mm it is found that the average shear stress is over 2 pa on membrane surfaces in top decks for other gap distances it is lower than 1 5 pa in some channels which would be insufficient shear stress for fouling control not only is the gap of 300 to 400 mm optimal to achieve uniform and an enhanced hydrodynamic effect but based upon previous work the values of shear stress will give excellent amelioration of fouling 7 32 39 3 2 3 variation of aeration rate for industry air velocity is an important variable as it is directly related to the aeration cost and system operation 26 40 41 in this section hydrodynamic effect was studied at five nozzle flow velocities which were shown in figs 9 and 10 for ground and top decks respectively in fig 9 a clearly at a nozzle velocity 10 m s in case i the bubbles generated in the ground decks are not uniform and are especially small in channel 6 as the nozzle velocity increases from 11 5 to 16 m s the bubble size increases and the uniformity becomes better amongst different channels the magnitude of shear stresses on membrane walls are shown in fig 9 b clearly at velocities of 13 to 14 5 m s the shear stresses generated in most regions of all channels are uniform and could reach up to 4 pa at lower velocities the shear stresses in most regions of channels 1 and 6 are 1 pa also at higher velocities of 16 m s the uniformity of distribution becomes worse compared with the mid range velocities this is confirmed by fig 9 c clearly for the ground decks the optimal nozzle velocity is in the range 13 to 14 5 m s the results for these two velocities are shown with thicker lines in fig 9 c for top decks variation of bubble distribution and shear stress are shown in fig 10 as with the lower two decks a velocity of 13 m s has regions where shear stress 0 4 pa e g in channels 1 2 and 6 furthermore the average value of shear stress varies with channel number and is 1 5 pa in 4 channels as shown in fig 10 c it is more uniform at 13 16 m s nozzle velocity and the average values of shear stress are over 2 5 pa for six channels overall by reviewing distribution of bubbles and shear stress through both ground and top decks the most uniform and intense hydrodynamic effect is produced at nozzle velocities between 13 and 14 5 m s hence this is the optimal range beneficial for fouling control performance 3 3 air consumption based on those optimal design of mbr variables we can estimate aeration cost of a cs mbr operated so as to have an average shear stress 1 5 pa in all channels at the optimal operating conditions of h 2 300 mm and nozzle velocity 13 m s the membranes in 12 channels would have surface shear stress over 1 5 pa which indicates they could be all effectively covered by one aeration pipe based on these optimal design conditions air consumption for four and six deck cs mbrs were calculated as shown in table 2 the specific aeration demand per membrane area sadm for four deck cs mbr is 0 074 nm3m 2 h 1 whilst the estimate for a six deck cs mbr is 0 049 nm3m 2 h 1 the air flow rate per square meter is 0 91 1 37 l min m2 which is much lower than 10 l min m2 for fsmbr in industry and lower than the figure given for a hfmbr by verrecht et al 20 according to our previous research the optimized fsmbr could save 50 of air consumption compared to the traditional industrial air consumption whilst the four deck and six deck cs mbr could save 86 and 91 of the air consumption respectively this indicates that the cs mbr reduces around 70 air consumption than the fsmbr to achieve effective hydrodynamics for fouling control 3 4 discussion patterning or other modification of the shape of a membrane surface has been explored for 20 years the approach of most research is to make ripples on the flat membrane through different methods to induce intense turbulence and increase the membrane area 42 in most studies the ripples structure on membrane surface has been found to be beneficial for fouling control bringing benefits such as enhanced shear stress less filter cake larger filtration flux etc 37 the hydrodynamics induced by corrugations have also been found to be beneficial in limiting salt deposition in membrane distillation 42 43 our findings on fouling are consistent with these previous findings in the current work not only is the membrane surface improved but the membrane supporting pattern thickness and water conveyance has also been modified the new cs membrane has unique features combining some characteristics from both hf and fs membranes characteristics the unique features of cs membrane studied in this work are summarized and compared in table 3 for non flat membrane the surface area distinction was reported by barambu et al 44 in this work the area for corrugated sheet is taken as the actual area by considering the corrugated shape which is 1 1 times that of a flat sheet with the same projected area the greater area will give a lower local flux which according to critical flux theory 45 and threshold flux theory 46 will give less fouling decoupling this contribution from the hydrodynamics is difficult however from an engineering perspective the important parameters are a sadm and b productivity per unit volume i e amount of permeate per unit volume of the mbr the improvement in these two parameters is attributed to the two advantages offered by the corrugated membrane namely its relatively larger area and the stronger hydrodynamics the sadm value is based upon 4 decks and it will be recalled that in section 3 2 2 the height of 4 cs decks is equivalent to the height of two fs decks thus the comparison between flat and corrugated in table 3 is a fair one the features of the cs membrane assembly mentioned above are particularly beneficial for large scale application for example the small thickness of cs membrane could increase the loading capacity and solving the low capacity issue faced in fsmbr application moreover the general plane sheet configuration of the cs membrane provides a format that avoids any clogging such as that found when fibers bind hair twinning in hfmbrs furthermore the aspect ratio of the cs mbr creates the possibility of having multiple decks which significantly reduce the air consumption that are at a world leadingly low level for these multiple reasons the cs mbr format is an exciting new prospect in the industrial application of mbrs 4 conclusions a novel corrugated membrane format with a surface area per unit volume value equivalent to that of hollow fiber mbr systems has been evaluated and a design of a multi deck cs mbr elaborated specific conclusions arising from the experimental and simulation investigations are 1 from a comparison of the hydrodynamics and related fouling performance of the new cs membrane system with the fs membrane system it is established that the surface shear stress induced on the cs membrane could be 1 25 times larger than that of fs under the same experimental conditions the required tmp in a cs mbr is two thirds of that required in a fs mbr under comparable conditions the enhanced hydrodynamic effect of intense turbulence and shear stress is beneficial for membrane fouling control 2 for optimal performance a large scale cs mbr should have the following features a be designed with a fully partitioned aeration pipe so as to have as uniform an air velocity distribution as possible b be designed with at least four decks c for a four deck system have essential zero gap between the lower two and upper two decks and a gap of 300 mm in the middle of the system i e values of h 1 h 2 h 3 are 0 300 0 mm respectively and d have a design nozzle velocity of 13 m s which together with an fully partitioned aeration pipe will ensure a small variance of 1 4 m s overall an essentially uniform distributions of slug bubbles will generate sufficiently intense shear stress on membrane surfaces 3 the standardized aeration rate sadm for the large scale cs mbr system can be 0 074 nm3m 2 h 1 which corresponds to a 70 reduction with respect to an optimized fsmbr operated with slug bubbling the value of 0 074 nm3m 2 h 1 represents a massive reduction with respect to the traditional industrial usage of 0 58 nm3m 2 h 1 given these specific findings this new type of corrugated membrane has great potential to widen the application of flat sheet mbr systems achieving a good balance between i having a drastically reduced air consumption and ii excellent fouling control should be readily achievable because it has been found in our evaluation that the new corrugated membrane benefits both areas with more difficult to treat streams it may be necessary to take a smaller benefit with regard to air consumption in order to achieve good fouling control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12737,looking for cheaper and more transportable alternative magnesium mg2 sources to envisage the full scale application of downstream transfer of p recovery through struvite precipitation sisal fibres were impregnated with bittern water b w ratio solutions 1 4 1 5 1 7 and 1 10 two methods were attempted the one step method with a simultaneous mg2 release and struvite precipitation and the two step method with release and precipitation made separately sisal1 5 showed the highest recovery yield regardless of the method applied the issue with the one step method is that part of the crystals formed directly on the fibre surface making their recovery harder the two step method using the sample impregnated with a 1 5 ratio resulted in highly pure struvite crystals which are larger than those obtained with mgcl2 6h2o moreover this method allows the retention of part of cl in the fibres instead of releasing it into the solution and crystals do not form over the fibres this work shows that the use of mg2 impregnated materials is a poor alternative for urine with a high concentration of p 600 mg p l 1 because it shows a poorer performance 50 p recovery when compared to the direct use of bittern 99 p recovery yield however the higher struvite purity and the retention of part of the cl make mg2 impregnated materials a potential solution to test in lower p concentrations 300 mg p l 1 this study also opens several research opportunities regarding the application of mg2 impregnated material in p recovery through struvite precipitation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords p recovery sisal precipitation urine fertilisers bittern data availability most relevant data for interpretation is already fully shared via figures if reviewers need extra useful information it can be uploaded as requested then 1 introduction from the perspective of a circular economy recovery of phosphorus p through struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation in source separated urine is an effective way to reduce p discharges to municipal wastewater treatment plants 1 and receiving waters 2 moreover this process will enable p recovery as a product known to be a slow release fertiliser with key macronutrients 3 with reduced faeces cross contamination 4 however the need for additional mg2 sources to increase the ratio of magnesium to phosphate ions hereby referred as mg po4 to the recommended level of 1 1 5 hinders downstream applicability 6 two of the most usual options for additional mg2 mgso4 7h2o or mgcl2 6h2o are considered too expensive 3 another common mg2 source is mgo which is cheaper but is difficult to solubilise needing either additional solubilisation steps or more reaction time to be effective therefore hindering the downstream transfer of struvite precipitation process into full scale operation 3 thus looking for a better external mg2 source several alternative options have been attempted such as sea salt 7 magnesite 8 seawater 9 and bittern the resulting solution after precipitation of nacl in salt pans 10 allowing 88 92 99 and 99 of p recovery respectively despite the good results these options have some undesired effects particularly the dilution factor when seawater is added 11 needing a nanofiltration step to become more effective 12 or the great amount of nacl introduced in the medium when sea salt is used in the case of bittern which is produced in coastal regions 13 the transport in its natural state that is a viscous liquid 14 from the salt pans to the treatment station is considered expensive especially when the treatment station is far from the coast 15 some studies report the possibility of using adsorbents such as zeolites loaded with mg2 and ca2 allowing the simultaneous adsorption of nh4 and the recovery of phosphates as precipitates this effect occurs when the adsorption of nh4 promotes the release of mg2 or ca2 into the solution these ions can then react with the phosphates to produce among others struvite 16 or hydroxyapatite ca5oh po4 3 17 if the release of mg2 from loaded materials can be controlled this could become an interesting alternative source of mg2 for struvite precipitation with hydrolysed urine being an excellent matrix to study this effect owing to its high nh4 content the production of mg2 impregnated materials like biochars that makes use of organic materials like ground coffee waste 18 or waste woody biomass 19 is well known the main novelty of this study resides in how the produced mg2 impregnated material is applied to recover p through struvite in this study instead of promoting the adsorption of p into the material we explored if the release of the impregnated mg could be controlled so it could be applied as an mg2 source for struvite precipitation another novelty aspect of the study was the use of a specific waste bittern as an mg source for the impregnation process instead of mg2 compounds like mgo or mgcl2 the objective of the present study was to understand if it was possible to control the release of mg2 ions from an mg impregnated material produced using sisal as support for bittern salts and to test the mg2 release from impregnated materials as an alternative mg2 source for struvite precipitation in high p concentrated urine and compare it to the good results obtained with the direct addition of bittern 20 to the best of our knowledge there is no study exploring the methodology herein proposed even the direct application of bittern to precipitate struvite from a synthetic urine solution was only fully reported in our recent study 21 and the study of bradford hartke et al 21 the sisal fibres the material chosen as support are obtained from sisal leaves agave sisalana which is a plant native to mexico but that now grows in other countries namely brazil tanzania and kenya the main world producers of sisal fibres accounting for at least 2 of the overall worldwide production of natural fibres sisal fibres are mainly composed of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin 22 as happens with bittern in salt pans the rope manufacturing industry also produces a large quantity of residues in the form of sisal fibre leftovers that are currently either reused to produce low quality ropes or end up being used as fuel however these sisal fibre leftovers from the rope industry have characteristics that make them attractive for several other applications that go beyond the referred ones the production of porous carbon materials and their successful usage as adsorbents is an example of possible applications for this leftover material 22 in the context of the present study the most important characteristics of sisal fibres are low price non toxicity 22 and resistance when applied in saltwater 23 moreover the elasticity and tensile strength of sisal fibres are also well documented 24 two different methods of mg2 release to promote struvite precipitation were assayed in the present study the first method hereby referred to as the one step method was inspired by the procedure reported by lin et al 17 using ca2 saturated zeolites the materials exchange the ca2 by the nh4 present in excess in the basic conditions under which the process occurs reaction 1 once in solution ca2 reacts with hpo4 2 to precipitate hydroxyapatite reaction 2 in our study we tried to verify if a similar process can be followed using mg2 impregnated sisal fibres 1 zeolite c a 2 2 n h 4 zeolite 2 n h 4 c a 2 2 5 c a 2 3 hp o 4 2 4 o h c a 5 oh p o 4 3 3 h 2 o the second possible strategy hereby referred as the two step method comprises separate steps for the release of impregnated mg2 and for the precipitation of struvite this two steps method was inspired by the process described by chung et al 25 that occurs in fallow soil at acid ph the authors reported that the decrease of the soil ph increased the selectivity for nh4 uptake resulting in the release of mg2 and ca2 this effect was later confirmed in a study where zeolites synthesised from red mud were tested for the recovery of nh4 from synthetic solutions the authors found that a ph below 4 was ideal for increasing affinity to nh4 and k so other cations could be released 26 to summarise we aimed to demonstrate if a process based on bittern impregnated sisal fibres can be used as an alternative mg2 source for struvite precipitation producing struvite crystals with ideal properties to be used as slow release fertiliser i e gather two residues to obtain an added value product 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sisal fibres discards were provided by a portuguese rope manufacturer cordex the fibres had been previously cut into small pieces 1 2 cm analytical grade chemicals kh2po4 nh4cl and mgcl2 6h2o from panreac were used to prepare a synthetic solution with concentrations of po4 3 0 021 mol l 1 and nh4 0 090 mol l 1 close to the content of urine solution after hydrolysation of urea to ammonium according to the values reported in a previous study 27 the ph corrections were made using 1 m naoh solution analytical grade naoh pellets from panreac and h2so4 0 1 m solution h2so4 96 98 from panreac seawater bittern hereby referred as bittern was courtesy of necton companhia portuguesa de culturas marinhas and presented the following main composition mg2 80 g l 1 na 27 g l 1 k 25 g l 1 and ca2 0 1 g l 1

impregnation the impregnation methodology follows what is commonly applied in the initial steps of activated carbon materials production using chemical activation 18 for the impregnation process 5 g of sisal fibres were introduced in a flask containing 250 ml of bittern aqueous solution because the objective was to obtain a fine cover of salt over the sisal fibres without the formation of large blocks of salt crystals over the fibres several bittern water b w volume ratios were tested allowing from uniform salt covering to sparse covering namely 1 4 1 5 1 7 and 1 10 and the corresponding impregnated sisal fibres were designated as sisal1 4 sisal1 5 sisal1 7 and sisal1 10 respectively it is worth mentioning that besides the b w ratios used to prepare the samples tested in the study a preliminary assay with sisal impregnation using a b w 1 1 was attempted but after drying it resulted in a block of salt making it unusable thus explaining why the higher b w ratio used was 1 4 the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h after which the sample was left to dry at 65 c in an oven for 48 h and finally stored for later use the drying temperature was chosen to prevent sisal burning 2 3 p recovery 2 3 1 one step method for the one step methodology 250 mg of the impregnated sisal was enclosed in paper bags to facilitate the separation at the end of the assay that were introduced into 200 ml of synthetic urine solution and kept under continuous stirring at 400 rpm for 24 h at ph 8 5 i e the ph value considered as ideal for struvite precipitation in a previous study 27 after 24 h the bags with sisal were removed and the stirring stopped allowing the crystals to settle for another 30 min the crystals were recovered by filtration and the filtrate stored for p quantification 2 3 2 two step method for the two step method the ph of the mg2 release phase first step was defined at 3 5 to account for a 0 5 increase after the 24 h which was detected in a preliminary assay guaranteeing in this way a ph value always around 4 0 in this protocol 250 mg of impregnated sisal fibres were enclosed in paper bags that were then introduced into the synthetic urine solution the system was kept under continuous stirring 400 rpm for 24 h at room temperature for the precipitation part second step the paper bags with the sisal were removed the ph was increased to 8 5 and the solution was stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min after which the crystals formed were allowed to settle for another 30 min the solid was then recovered by filtration and stored for further analysis the filtrate was stored for determination of p content to estimate the change in the nh4 concentration the n content present in the filtrates was determined by the kjedahl method assuming that all n present was in nh4 form at ph 3 5 the schematic representation of this method as well as of the one step method is shown in fig 1 2 3 3 precipitation using bittern directly results for this section were recovered from a previous study on the analysis of alternative mg2 sources for p recovery through struvite precipitation 20 2 4 p determination all the different experiments were performed in triplicate and an analysis of variance anova was performed using minitab 19 to determine whether the difference between p recovery yield values obtained with each mg2 source was statistically significant the determination of p was done colorimetrically using the vanadomolybdate method where ammonium vanadomolybdate is added to the sample containing p forming the yellow vanadomolybdophosphoric acid the procedure followed standard methods 28 using a hitachi u 2000 spectrophotometer 2 5 sem edx and xrd morphology and particle size of the original and mg2 impregnated

impregnated sisal fibres sisal1 4 sisal1 5 and sisal1 10 are presented in fig a1 supplementary data the naked eye observation reveals that sisal1 10 shows no other difference to the pristine sisal apart from a drier appearance that is a darker colouration samples prepared with the higher amounts of bittern b w ratios 1 4 and 1 5 show a layer of salt covering the fibres with a more uniform aspect in the case of sisal1 5 allied to some small salt blocks in the case of sisal1 4 the macroscopic images of sisal before impregnation and three impregnated sisal fibres sisal1 4 sisal1 5 and sisal1 10 are presented in fig a1 supplementary data the naked eye observation reveals that sisal1 10 shows no other difference to the pristine sisal apart from a drier appearance that is a darker colouration samples prepared with the higher amounts of bittern b w ratios 1 4 and 1 5 show a layer of salt covering the fibres with a more uniform aspect in the case of sisal1 5 allied to some small salt blocks in the case of sisal1 4 in fig 2 the sem images of the sisal fibres before and after impregnation at different b w ratios are reproduced like in the macroscopy observation sem images also show that the aspect of the pristine fibres and of sample sisal1 10 is not much different and as expected only small amounts of mg and cl were detected in the edx analysis of the impregnated sample that said if to the naked eye no significant difference was observed between samples sisal1 7 image not shown and sisal1 10 at a microscopic scale there are some differences because although the sisal fibres are still visible on both samples in the case of sisal1 7 crystal agglomerates are clearly observed and accordingly a significantly higher amount of mg and cl is detected in the edx spectrum sisal1 5 presents a homogenous layer of salt covering the sisal fibres which is not exactly the case for sisal1 4 where a less uniform salt layer seems to be present as is shown in fig 2 however contrary to what would be expected not much difference in the amount of mg and cl was detected in the edx analysis despite the different amounts of bittern used to prepare these two samples thus the more or less uniform salt layer over the sisal fibres seems to be the most important distinction between the samples in fact a closer look at the analysed zone of sisal1 5 shows that the fibre is quite uniformly covered with the salt whereas in the image of sample sisal1 4 several salt blocks are shown suggesting that zones without crystal blocks might have been caught in the analysis of this material 3 2 p recovery using bittern impregnated sisal fibres the p recovery yield was quantified considering the difference of p concentration between the original urine solution and the concentration of p remaining in filtrate after each of the methods the p recovery yield obtained with the four impregnated sisal samples for each of the methods is shown in fig 3 the results obtained show that regardless of the b w used in the impregnation the two step method always granted a higher p recovery with the one step method both sisal1 4 and sisal1 5 grant closer to 45 of p recovery which is significantly higher than the p recovery granted by sisal 1 7 and sisal1 10 however the difference between sisal1 4 and sisal1 5 was not significant p 0 395 and neither was the difference between sisal1 7 and sisal1 10 which was also not statistically significant p 0 358 when the two step method is used a higher p recovery yield is obtained for all b w ratios tested fig 3 allowing that even using sisal1 7 a recovery of 45 of p was achieved that is the same value obtained with the one step method using samples impregnated with higher bittern concentrations as mentioned earlier during the first step of this procedure a ph variation of 0 5 was found after 24 h data of the kjeldahl method proved that this ph variation results from the decrease of nh4 species in solution because all the experiments were conducted in containers covered with parafilm and assuming as such that no nh4 evolved as nh3 then this ph variation can only be ascribed to the nh4 being retained in the fibres contrary to the results of the one step method with the two step method the differences between the p recovery yield obtained with all samples were statistically significant the lower recovery yields achieved with samples sisal1 10 and sisal1 7 align with the sparse distribution of mg in the fibres as previously discussed granting a lower p recovery yield given that less mg can be delivered to the solution however the increase of bittern amount in the impregnation solution leads only to the increase of p recovery yield up to the ratio b w 1 5 because for higher amounts of bittern a slightly negative effect on the p recovery is observed this may result in less uniformity of the salt layer over the fibres in the case of sample sisal1 4 in fact as previously discussed the analysis of this sample revealed the presence of some dispersed salt blocks that make mg2 redissolution more difficult than in the case of sample sisal1 5 to rationalise the feasibility of the methodologies tested as alternatives to deliver external mg ions to promote p recovery the recovery yield is not the sole parameter to be taken into consideration given that the quality of the crystals formed i e size morphology and mineral phase composition and the changes undergone by the fibres used in each method are of great importance and not only for the crystal harvesting step because they may also affect possible application of the crystals 3 3 crystals analysis 3 3 1 one step method the diffractograms of the crystals obtained from sisal1 4 and sisal1 5 are shown in fig 4 and the corresponding sem images and edx data are displayed in fig 5 the xrd patterns confirm the presence of struvite as the main phase formed with only some phosphorroesslerite mghpo4 7h2o observed in the sample obtained with sisal1 5 in a previous study 27 the use of mgcl2 6h2o was reported to promote the formation of phosphates containing k and ca mainly formed over the struvite crystals being newberyite mghpo4 3h2o phases also easily detected by the presence of three consecutive peaks between 18 8 and 20 0 2θ and another specific peak at 28 9 2θ making the xrd pattern easily distinguishable from that of struvite in this study no signs of newberyite are detected in the diffractograms and the number of ca and k phases detected in edx is also reduced as well these results indicate that the struvite crystals have higher purity than those obtained using conventional mg2 sources such as mgcl2 6h2o despite the crystals showing characteristics allowing their fertiliser applicability with the presence of struvite and absence of problematic components such as na the microscopic images show a major drawback of this method the images of the sisal fibres show that some of the crystals formed inside of the bags over the fibres this is a relevant detail and even though a 45 of p recovered from solution can be achieved a fraction of this product cannot be properly harvested to be applied elsewhere because it is hard to separate from the fibres unless an application making use of the crystals in the fibres is envisaged this method is not the most suitable for p recovery as struvite 3 3 2 two steps method fig 6 shows the sem images and edx data of the samples sisal1 4 1 5 and 1 7 after being tested in the two step method that is the images are showing the final aspect of the samples that allowed the higher p recovery yield with this procedure compared with the one step the two step method shows two interesting features the first is that all the 50 p recovery yield represents harvestable crystals this is shown by the absence of crystals over the fibres in sem images which is only possible because the precipitation occurs after the fibres have been removed the second advantage is that cl remains in the fibres instead of being released into the solution fig 7 show the distribution of crystals dimension width and length obtained when using sisal1 4 sisal1 5 and sisal1 7 the sample prepared with b w 1 7 ratio generated crystals with a narrow distribution of dimensions as well as the smallest crystals with on average 11 1 2 0 μm width and 29 0 3 4 μm length the crystals recovered in the assays with the other two samples sisal1 4 and 1 5 present a wider distribution of crystals dimensions with width ranging from 4 9 to 30 9 μm and length ranging from 27 8 to 117 2 μm on average the crystal dimensions of sample sisal1 5 width 16 3 5 5 μm and length 63 9 21 2 μm are larger than those obtained from sisal1 4 width 11 9 4 4 μm and length 59 1 19 1 μm in general most of the crystals are also larger than those obtained from sisal1 7 the elemental and crystallographic composition of the crystals is given in figs 8 and 9 where sem edx data and xrd diffractograms are presented respectively sem images reveal the difference of the morphology of the crystals obtained with the sample prepared with the higher percentage of bittern regarding the other two samples in fact the crystal morphology changes from dendritic sisal1 4 to less elongated and more prismatic for the assays with sisal1 5 and sisal1 7 this evolution may be related to changes in the saturation index si promoted by more ions being added to solution with bittern the increase of crystal size along with dendritification with the si increase follows the same pattern presented by shaddel et al 31 in lower si the crystal growth is surface controlled and generates smoother faces but as si increases rougher surfaces are promoted with the formation of elongated phases another important aspect is that only the crystals obtained from sisal1 5 present residual ca2 or k levels in the edx data with bittern having quite a low amount of ca2 its low concentration or even absence is expected that said such a low concentration of k can be explained only by the competition of nh4 and k for the sites from which mg2 was released resulting in the incorporation of less k in the lattice of the crystals 32 the xrd diffractograms fig 9 suggest that the crystals obtained in the assay with sisal1 5 are almost pure struvite this is also the major phase present in the crystals obtained from sample sisal1 4 but in this case newberyite is still detected the diffractogram of the product resulting from the test with sisal1 7 shows that the crystals are a mixture of struvite and newberyite the poor crystallinity also suggest the formation of an amorphous phase alongside a mixture of struvite and newberyite the high purity of struvite is important because it increases the fertiliser s applicability especially if it means the absence of undesirable phases such as halite nacl however the residual amounts of ca2 and k for fertiliser application become another interesting point because these cations represent plant macronutrients 3 4 bittern impregnated materials vs direct use of bittern 3 4 1 p recovery yield and crystal properties to understand the impact of the use of impregnated materials a direct comparison was conducted between the crystals obtained using the two step method with sisal1 5 and crystals obtained using bittern directly in the solution obtained in a previous study 20 the direct use of bittern granted higher recovery yield 99 than the one obtained using impregnated materials 50 indicating that from this point of view bittern is a better option when working with urine containing high p concentrations in terms of crystal properties the crystals obtained using bittern directly in the solution are wider on average width 21 8 7 6 μm and length 60 2 15 4 μm than those obtained with sisal1 5 with the two step method width 16 3 5 5 μm and length 63 9 21 2 μm the x shaped crystals obtained directly with bittern also presented less struvite purity the presence of k in edx and more phases appearing in the diffractogram these results imply that because of the large difference in p recovery yield and promotion of wider crystals the direct use of bittern might be preferable in highly concentrated urine such as the one used in this study 4 conclusions alternative mg2 sources are needed to increase the downstream interest of p recovery through struvite precipitation mg2 impregnated sisal fibres obtained using different b w volumetric ratios were used as alternatives to introduce external mg2 into a solution and increase mg po4 for struvite precipitation for this two methods were attempted a one step method where the release of mg2 and subsequent reaction with po4 and nh4 to form struvite occur simultaneously in basic ph and a two step method where the mg2 release in acid ph step is separated from the precipitation in basic ph regarding the two methodologies tested on sample sisal1 5 the one step method despite granting 45 p recovery and producing crystals with high purity of struvite results in the formation of crystals over the fibres complicating the recovery of these deposited crystals as such unless another study is made on possible uses for these fibres this method is not indicated for this purpose the two step method showed an increased p recovery over 50 using sisal1 5 because the precipitation occurs in a later stage there are no crystals over the fibres surface the crystals are purer and larger than crystals formed using commercial mgcl2 6h2o salts the crystals formed with the two step method and sisal1 5 are narrower than those formed with bittern this method allows the formation of highly pure struvite crystals presenting ideal fertiliser applicability this process does not represent an improvement when applied to solutions with high p concentration 600 mg p l 1 where the recovery yield is poor 50 and the crystals are narrower however as part of future research the advantages provided by the presented methodology higher struvite purity and retention of cl from bittern make it worth being tested in lower p concentrations 300 mg p l 1 like those found in lakes and rivers where said benefits will add to what is expected to be a significant increase in recovery yield in this study the process making use of mg2 impregnated materials as mg2 source for p recovery through struvite precipitation was shown to work but still has a wide margin for optimisation this study also opens several research opportunities for example the possible reusability of the depleted fibres the exploration of less known mg2 or ca2 rich solutions or the use of a support material different from sisal namely a porous material the following is the supplementary data related to this article

12737,looking for cheaper and more transportable alternative magnesium mg2 sources to envisage the full scale application of downstream transfer of p recovery through struvite precipitation sisal fibres were impregnated with bittern water b w ratio solutions 1 4 1 5 1 7 and 1 10 two methods were attempted the one step method with a simultaneous mg2 release and struvite precipitation and the two step method with release and precipitation made separately sisal1 5 showed the highest recovery yield regardless of the method applied the issue with the one step method is that part of the crystals formed directly on the fibre surface making their recovery harder the two step method using the sample impregnated with a 1 5 ratio resulted in highly pure struvite crystals which are larger than those obtained with mgcl2 6h2o moreover this method allows the retention of part of cl in the fibres instead of releasing it into the solution and crystals do not form over the fibres this work shows that the use of mg2 impregnated materials is a poor alternative for urine with a high concentration of p 600 mg p l 1 because it shows a poorer performance 50 p recovery when compared to the direct use of bittern 99 p recovery yield however the higher struvite purity and the retention of part of the cl make mg2 impregnated materials a potential solution to test in lower p concentrations 300 mg p l 1 this study also opens several research opportunities regarding the application of mg2 impregnated material in p recovery through struvite precipitation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords p recovery sisal precipitation urine fertilisers bittern data availability most relevant data for interpretation is already fully shared via figures if reviewers need extra useful information it can be uploaded as requested then 1 introduction from the perspective of a circular economy recovery of phosphorus p through struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation in source separated urine is an effective way to reduce p discharges to municipal wastewater treatment plants 1 and receiving waters 2 moreover this process will enable p recovery as a product known to be a slow release fertiliser with key macronutrients 3 with reduced faeces cross contamination 4 however the need for additional mg2 sources to increase the ratio of magnesium to phosphate ions hereby referred as mg po4 to the recommended level of 1 1 5 hinders downstream applicability 6 two of the most usual options for additional mg2 mgso4 7h2o or mgcl2 6h2o are considered too expensive 3 another common mg2 source is mgo which is cheaper but is difficult to solubilise needing either additional solubilisation steps or more reaction time to be effective therefore hindering the downstream transfer of struvite precipitation process into full scale operation 3 thus looking for a better external mg2 source several alternative options have been attempted such as sea salt 7 magnesite 8 seawater 9 and bittern the resulting solution after precipitation of nacl in salt pans 10 allowing 88 92 99 and 99 of p recovery respectively despite the good results these options have some undesired effects particularly the dilution factor when seawater is added 11 needing a nanofiltration step to become more effective 12 or the great amount of nacl introduced in the medium when sea salt is used in the case of bittern which is produced in coastal regions 13 the transport in its natural state that is a viscous liquid 14 from the salt pans to the treatment station is considered expensive especially when the treatment station is far from the coast 15 some studies report the possibility of using adsorbents such as zeolites loaded with mg2 and ca2 allowing the simultaneous adsorption of nh4 and the recovery of phosphates as precipitates this effect occurs when the adsorption of nh4 promotes the release of mg2 or ca2 into the solution these ions can then react with the phosphates to produce among others struvite 16 or hydroxyapatite ca5oh po4 3 17 if the release of mg2 from loaded materials can be controlled this could become an interesting alternative source of mg2 for struvite precipitation with hydrolysed urine being an excellent matrix to study this effect owing to its high nh4 content the production of mg2 impregnated materials like biochars that makes use of organic materials like ground coffee waste 18 or waste woody biomass 19 is well known the main novelty of this study resides in how the produced mg2 impregnated material is applied to recover p through struvite in this study instead of promoting the adsorption of p into the material we explored if the release of the impregnated mg could be controlled so it could be applied as an mg2 source for struvite precipitation another novelty aspect of the study was the use of a specific waste bittern as an mg source for the impregnation process instead of mg2 compounds like mgo or mgcl2 the objective of the present study was to understand if it was possible to control the release of mg2 ions from an mg impregnated material produced using sisal as support for bittern salts and to test the mg2 release from impregnated materials as an alternative mg2 source for struvite precipitation in high p concentrated urine and compare it to the good results obtained with the direct addition of bittern 20 to the best of our knowledge there is no study exploring the methodology herein proposed even the direct application of bittern to precipitate struvite from a synthetic urine solution was only fully reported in our recent study 21 and the study of bradford hartke et al 21 the sisal fibres the material chosen as support are obtained from sisal leaves agave sisalana which is a plant native to mexico but that now grows in other countries namely brazil tanzania and kenya the main world producers of sisal fibres accounting for at least 2 of the overall worldwide production of natural fibres sisal fibres are mainly composed of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin 22 as happens with bittern in salt pans the rope manufacturing industry also produces a large quantity of residues in the form of sisal fibre leftovers that are currently either reused to produce low quality ropes or end up being used as fuel however these sisal fibre leftovers from the rope industry have characteristics that make them attractive for several other applications that go beyond the referred ones the production of porous carbon materials and their successful usage as adsorbents is an example of possible applications for this leftover material 22 in the context of the present study the most important characteristics of sisal fibres are low price non toxicity 22 and resistance when applied in saltwater 23 moreover the elasticity and tensile strength of sisal fibres are also well documented 24 two different methods of mg2 release to promote struvite precipitation were assayed in the present study the first method hereby referred to as the one step method was inspired by the procedure reported by lin et al 17 using ca2 saturated zeolites the materials exchange the ca2 by the nh4 present in excess in the basic conditions under which the process occurs reaction 1 once in solution ca2 reacts with hpo4 2 to precipitate hydroxyapatite reaction 2 in our study we tried to verify if a similar process can be followed using mg2 impregnated sisal fibres 1 zeolite c a 2 2 n h 4 zeolite 2 n h 4 c a 2 2 5 c a 2 3 hp o 4 2 4 o h c a 5 oh p o 4 3 3 h 2 o the second possible strategy hereby referred as the two step method comprises separate steps for the release of impregnated mg2 and for the precipitation of struvite this two steps method was inspired by the process described by chung et al 25 that occurs in fallow soil at acid ph the authors reported that the decrease of the soil ph increased the selectivity for nh4 uptake resulting in the release of mg2 and ca2 this effect was later confirmed in a study where zeolites synthesised from red mud were tested for the recovery of nh4 from synthetic solutions the authors found that a ph below 4 was ideal for increasing affinity to nh4 and k so other cations could be released 26 to summarise we aimed to demonstrate if a process based on bittern impregnated sisal fibres can be used as an alternative mg2 source for struvite precipitation producing struvite crystals with ideal properties to be used as slow release fertiliser i e gather two residues to obtain an added value product 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sisal fibres discards were provided by a portuguese rope manufacturer cordex the fibres had been previously cut into small pieces 1 2 cm analytical grade chemicals kh2po4 nh4cl and mgcl2 6h2o from panreac were used to prepare a synthetic solution with concentrations of po4 3 0 021 mol l 1 and nh4 0 090 mol l 1 close to the content of urine solution after hydrolysation of urea to ammonium according to the values reported in a previous study 27 the ph corrections were made using 1 m naoh solution analytical grade naoh pellets from panreac and h2so4 0 1 m solution h2so4 96 98 from panreac seawater

impregnation the impregnation methodology follows what is commonly applied in the initial steps of activated carbon materials production using chemical activation 18 for the impregnation process 5 g of sisal fibres were introduced in a flask containing 250 ml of bittern aqueous solution because the objective was to obtain a fine cover of salt over the sisal fibres without the formation of large blocks of salt crystals over the fibres several bittern water b w volume ratios were tested allowing from uniform salt covering to sparse covering namely 1 4 1 5 1 7 and 1 10 and the corresponding impregnated sisal fibres were designated as sisal1 4 sisal1 5 sisal1 7 and sisal1 10 respectively it is worth mentioning that besides the b w ratios used to prepare the samples tested in the study a preliminary assay with sisal impregnation using a b w 1 1 was attempted but after drying it resulted in a block of salt making it unusable thus explaining why the higher b w ratio used was 1 4 the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h after which the sample was left to dry at 65 c in an oven for 48 h and finally stored for later use the drying temperature was chosen to prevent sisal burning 2 3 p recovery 2 3 1 one step method for the one step methodology 250 mg of the impregnated sisal was enclosed in paper bags to facilitate the separation at the end of the assay that were introduced into 200 ml of synthetic urine solution and kept under continuous stirring at 400 rpm for 24 h at ph 8 5 i e the ph value considered as ideal for struvite precipitation in a previous study 27 after 24 h the bags with sisal were removed and the stirring stopped allowing the crystals to settle for another 30 min the crystals were recovered by filtration and the filtrate stored for p quantification 2 3 2 two step method for the two step method the ph of the mg2 release phase first step was defined at 3 5 to account for a 0 5 increase after the 24 h which was detected in a preliminary assay guaranteeing in this way a ph value always around 4 0 in this protocol 250 mg of impregnated sisal fibres were enclosed in paper bags that were then introduced into the synthetic urine solution the system was kept under continuous stirring 400 rpm for 24 h at room temperature for the precipitation part second step the paper bags with the sisal were removed the ph was increased to 8 5 and the solution was stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min after which the crystals formed were allowed to settle for another 30 min the solid was then recovered by filtration and stored for further analysis the filtrate was stored for determination of p content to estimate the change in the nh4 concentration the n content present in the filtrates was determined by the kjedahl method assuming that all n present was in nh4 form at ph 3 5 the schematic representation of this method as well as of the one step method is shown in fig 1 2 3 3 precipitation using bittern directly results for this section were recovered from a previous study on the analysis of alternative mg2 sources for p recovery through struvite precipitation 20 2 4 p determination all the different experiments were performed in triplicate and an analysis of variance anova was performed using minitab 19 to determine whether the difference between p recovery yield values obtained with each mg2 source was statistically significant the determination of p was done colorimetrically using the vanadomolybdate method where ammonium vanadomolybdate is added to the sample containing p forming the yellow vanadomolybdophosphoric acid the procedure followed standard methods 28 using a hitachi u 2000 spectrophotometer 2 5 sem edx and xrd morphology and particle size of the original and mg2 impregnated sisal fibres as well as chemical analysis were assessed by scanning electron microscopy sem with energy dispersive x ray analysis edx sem edx analysis was performed using an eg sem jeol 7001f with oxford light elements edx detector and an electron backscatter diffraction detector was used all samples were coated with a thin film of gold palladium to increase conductivity measurements of the sem

impregnated sisal fibres sisal1 4 sisal1 5 and sisal1 10 are presented in fig a1 supplementary data the naked eye observation reveals that sisal1 10 shows no other difference to the pristine sisal apart from a drier appearance that is a darker colouration samples prepared with the higher amounts of bittern b w ratios 1 4 and 1 5 show a layer of salt covering the fibres with a more uniform aspect in the case of sisal1 5 allied to some small salt blocks in the case of sisal1 4 the macroscopic images of sisal before impregnation and three impregnated sisal fibres sisal1 4 sisal1 5 and sisal1 10 are presented in fig a1 supplementary data the naked eye observation reveals that sisal1 10 shows no other difference to the pristine sisal apart from a drier appearance that is a darker colouration samples prepared with the higher amounts of bittern b w ratios 1 4 and 1 5 show a layer of salt covering the fibres with a more uniform aspect in the case of sisal1 5 allied to some small salt blocks in the case of sisal1 4 in fig 2 the sem images of the sisal fibres before and after impregnation at different b w ratios are reproduced like in the macroscopy observation sem images also show that the aspect of the pristine fibres and of sample sisal1 10 is not much different and as expected only small amounts of mg and cl were detected in the edx analysis of the impregnated sample that said if to the naked eye no significant difference was observed between samples sisal1 7 image not shown and sisal1 10 at a microscopic scale there are some differences because although the sisal fibres are still visible on both samples in the case of sisal1 7 crystal agglomerates are clearly observed and accordingly a significantly higher amount of mg and cl is detected in the edx spectrum sisal1 5 presents a homogenous layer of salt covering the sisal fibres which is not exactly the case for sisal1 4 where a less uniform salt layer seems to be present as is shown in fig 2 however contrary to what would be expected not much difference in the amount of mg and cl was detected in the edx analysis despite the different amounts of bittern used to prepare these two samples thus the more or less uniform salt layer over the sisal fibres seems to be the most important distinction between the samples in fact a closer look at the analysed zone of sisal1 5 shows that the fibre is quite uniformly covered with the salt whereas in the image of sample sisal1 4 several salt blocks are shown suggesting that zones without crystal blocks might have been caught in the analysis of this material 3 2 p recovery using bittern impregnated sisal fibres the p recovery yield was quantified considering the difference of p concentration between the original urine solution and the concentration of p remaining in filtrate after each of the methods the p recovery yield obtained with the four impregnated sisal samples for each of the methods is shown in fig 3 the results obtained show that regardless of the b w used in the impregnation the two step method always granted a higher p recovery with the one step method both sisal1 4 and sisal1 5 grant closer to 45 of p recovery which is significantly higher than the p recovery granted by sisal 1 7 and sisal1 10 however the difference between sisal1 4 and sisal1 5 was not significant p 0 395 and neither was the difference between sisal1 7 and sisal1 10 which was also not statistically significant p 0 358 when the two step method is used a higher p recovery yield is obtained for all b w ratios tested fig 3 allowing that even using sisal1 7 a recovery of 45 of p was achieved that is the same value obtained with the one step method using samples impregnated with higher bittern concentrations as mentioned earlier during the first step of this procedure a ph variation of 0 5 was found after 24 h data of the kjeldahl method proved that this ph variation results from the decrease of nh4 species in solution because all the experiments were conducted in containers covered with parafilm and assuming as such that no nh4 evolved as nh3 then this ph variation can only be ascribed to the nh4 being retained in the fibres contrary to the results of the one step method with the two step method the differences between the p recovery yield obtained with all samples were statistically significant the lower recovery yields achieved with samples sisal1 10 and sisal1 7 align with the sparse distribution of mg in the fibres as previously discussed granting a lower p recovery yield given that less mg can be delivered to the solution however the increase of bittern amount in the impregnation solution leads only to the increase of p recovery yield up to the ratio b w 1 5 because for higher amounts of bittern a slightly negative effect on the p recovery is observed this may result in less uniformity of the salt layer over the fibres in the case of sample sisal1 4 in fact as previously discussed the analysis of this sample revealed the presence of some dispersed salt blocks that make mg2 redissolution more difficult than in the case of sample sisal1 5 to rationalise the feasibility of the methodologies tested as alternatives to deliver external mg ions to promote p recovery the recovery yield is not the sole parameter to be taken into consideration given that the quality of the crystals formed i e size morphology and mineral phase composition and the changes undergone by the fibres used in each method are of great importance and not only for the crystal harvesting step because they may also affect possible application of the crystals 3 3 crystals analysis 3 3 1 one step method the diffractograms of the crystals obtained from sisal1 4 and sisal1 5 are shown in fig 4 and the corresponding sem images and edx data are displayed in fig 5 the xrd patterns confirm the presence of struvite as the main phase formed with only some phosphorroesslerite mghpo4 7h2o observed in the sample obtained with sisal1 5 in a previous study 27 the use of mgcl2 6h2o was reported to promote the formation of phosphates containing k and ca mainly formed over the struvite crystals being newberyite mghpo4 3h2o phases also easily detected by the presence of three consecutive peaks between 18 8 and 20 0 2θ and another specific peak at 28 9 2θ making the xrd pattern easily distinguishable from that of struvite in this study no signs of newberyite are detected in the diffractograms and the number of ca and k phases detected in edx is also reduced as well these results indicate that the struvite crystals have higher purity than those obtained using conventional mg2 sources such as mgcl2 6h2o despite the crystals showing characteristics allowing their fertiliser applicability with the presence of struvite and absence of problematic components such as na the microscopic images show a major drawback of this method the images of the sisal fibres show that some of the crystals formed inside of the bags over the fibres this is a relevant detail and even though a 45 of p recovered from solution can be achieved a fraction of this product cannot be properly harvested to be applied elsewhere because it is hard to separate from the fibres unless an application making use of the crystals in the fibres is envisaged this method is not the most suitable for p recovery as struvite 3 3 2 two steps method fig 6 shows the sem images and edx data of the samples sisal1 4 1 5 and 1 7 after being tested in the two step method that is the images are showing the final aspect of the samples that allowed the higher p recovery yield with this procedure compared with the one step the two step method shows two interesting features the first is that all the 50 p recovery yield represents harvestable crystals this is shown by the absence of crystals over the fibres in sem images which is only possible because the precipitation occurs after the fibres have been removed the second advantage is that cl remains in the fibres instead of being released into the solution fig 7 show the distribution of crystals dimension width and length obtained when using sisal1 4 sisal1 5 and sisal1 7 the sample prepared with b w 1 7 ratio generated crystals with a narrow distribution of dimensions as well as the smallest crystals with on average 11 1 2 0 μm width and 29 0 3 4 μm length the crystals recovered in the assays with the other two samples sisal1 4 and 1 5 present a wider distribution of crystals dimensions with width ranging from 4 9 to 30 9 μm and length ranging from 27 8 to 117 2 μm on average the crystal dimensions of sample sisal1 5 width 16 3 5 5 μm and length 63 9 21 2 μm are larger than those obtained from sisal1 4 width 11 9 4 4 μm and length 59 1 19 1 μm in general most of the crystals are also larger than those obtained from sisal1 7 the elemental and crystallographic composition of the crystals is given in figs 8 and 9 where sem edx data and xrd diffractograms are presented respectively sem images reveal the difference of the morphology of the crystals obtained with the sample prepared with the higher percentage of bittern regarding the other two samples in fact the crystal morphology changes from dendritic sisal1 4 to less elongated and more prismatic for the assays with sisal1 5 and sisal1 7 this evolution may be related to changes in the saturation index si promoted by more ions being added to solution with bittern the increase of crystal size along with dendritification with the si increase follows the same pattern presented by shaddel et al 31 in lower si the crystal growth is surface controlled and generates smoother faces but as si increases rougher surfaces are promoted with the formation of elongated phases another important aspect is that only the crystals obtained from sisal1 5 present residual ca2 or k levels in the edx data with bittern having quite a low amount of ca2 its low concentration or even absence is expected that said such a low concentration of k can be explained only by the competition of nh4 and k for the sites from which mg2 was released resulting in the incorporation of less k in the lattice of the crystals 32 the xrd diffractograms fig 9 suggest that the crystals obtained in the assay with sisal1 5 are almost pure struvite this is also the major phase present in the crystals obtained from sample sisal1 4 but in this case newberyite is still detected the diffractogram of the product resulting from the test with sisal1 7 shows that the crystals are a mixture of struvite and newberyite the poor crystallinity also suggest the formation of an amorphous phase alongside a mixture of struvite and newberyite the high purity of struvite is important because it increases the fertiliser s applicability especially if it means the absence of undesirable phases such as halite nacl however the residual amounts of ca2 and k for fertiliser application become another interesting point because these cations represent plant macronutrients 3 4 bittern impregnated materials vs direct use of bittern 3 4 1 p recovery yield and crystal properties to understand the impact of the use of impregnated materials a direct comparison was conducted between the crystals obtained using the two step method with sisal1 5 and crystals obtained using bittern directly in the solution obtained in a previous study 20 the direct use of bittern granted higher recovery yield 99 than the one obtained using impregnated materials 50 indicating that from this point of view bittern is a better option when working with urine containing high p concentrations in terms of crystal properties the crystals obtained using bittern directly in the solution are wider on average width 21 8 7 6 μm and length 60 2 15 4 μm than those obtained with sisal1 5 with the two step method width 16 3 5 5 μm and length 63 9 21 2 μm the x shaped crystals obtained directly with bittern also presented less struvite purity the presence of k in edx and more phases appearing in the diffractogram these results imply that because of the large difference in p recovery yield and promotion of wider crystals the direct use of bittern might be preferable in highly concentrated urine such as the one used in this study 4 conclusions alternative mg2 sources are needed to increase the downstream interest of p recovery through struvite precipitation mg2 impregnated sisal fibres obtained using different b w volumetric ratios were used as alternatives to introduce external mg2 into a solution and increase mg po4 for struvite precipitation for this two methods were attempted a one step method where the release of mg2 and subsequent reaction with po4 and nh4 to form struvite occur simultaneously in basic ph and a two step method where the mg2 release in acid ph step is separated from the precipitation in basic ph regarding the two methodologies tested on sample sisal1 5 the one step method despite granting 45 p recovery and producing crystals with high purity of struvite results in the formation of crystals over the fibres complicating the recovery of these deposited crystals as such unless another study is made on possible uses for these fibres this method is not indicated for this purpose the two step method showed an increased p recovery over 50 using sisal1 5 because the precipitation occurs in a later stage there are no crystals over the fibres surface the crystals are purer and larger than crystals formed using commercial mgcl2 6h2o salts the crystals formed with the two step method and sisal1 5 are narrower than those formed with bittern this method allows the formation of highly pure struvite crystals presenting ideal fertiliser applicability this process does not represent an improvement when applied to solutions with high p concentration 600 mg p l 1 where the recovery yield is poor 50 and the crystals are narrower however as part of future research the advantages provided by the presented methodology higher struvite purity and retention of cl from bittern make it worth being tested in lower p concentrations 300 mg p l 1 like those found in lakes and rivers where said benefits will add to what is expected to be a significant increase in recovery yield in this study the process making use of mg2 impregnated materials as mg2 source for p recovery through struvite precipitation was shown to work but still has a wide margin for optimisation this study also opens several research opportunities for example the possible reusability of the depleted fibres the exploration of less known mg2 or ca2 rich solutions or the use of a support material different from sisal namely a porous material the following is the supplementary data related to this article

12738,the main aim of this study was to develop a new biotreatment process for denitrification by using a small bioreactor platform sbp for macro encapsulation of a bacterial consortium equipped with a slow release organic matter core for ex situ and in situ treatment configurations the biotreatment system in the continuous ex situ mode achieved a maximal nitrate removal load of 38 9 g nitrate l day with a short hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 3 h the in situ configuration showed high performance for 50 days with 85 nitrate removal from an initial concentration of 110 mg l the capsules continuously removed nitrate at the same rate even when the organic matter level in the internal capsule was low after 30 days of in situ experiments the bacterial population composition set inside the sbp capsules presented dominant populations of well known heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria thus the encapsulated process not only demonstrated a short hrt necessary for high nitrate removal rates in ex and in situ configurations but also potentially lower operational costs and no secondary environmental contamination caused by excess organic matter keywords nitrate denitrification small bioreactor platform in situ treatment ex situ treatment groundwater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate no3 is a water contaminant present in groundwater in different parts of the world mainly due to large amounts of agricultural fertilizers and irrigation with effluent however it can also originate in compost applied to soil and or industrial waste spill nitrate in drinking water is considered toxic to newborns and infants and causes methemoglobinemia a phenomenon commonly known as blue baby syndrome according to world health organization standards the maximum nitrate concentration allowed in drinking water is 44 mg l 1 2 in israel nitrate is the main cause for shutting down pumping wells being responsible for about 46 of all well closures between 1997 and 2004 nowadays approximately 50 of the wells in the coastal aquifer have a nitrate concentration exceeding 50 mg l which is the maximum standard concentration in israel 3 other contaminants present in groundwater include chlorine and organic matter the second and third most common contaminants found in wells responsible for 16 and 12 of well closures respectively cross contamination of nitrate organic matter and salinity also occurs the effect of medium characteristics on denitrification rate has been investigated in detail salinity affects denitrification removal rates only at high salt concentration above 50 ms cm 4 seawater salinity depending on the carbon source and only for a short period of time salt spiking or short acclimatization time has a severe effect on denitrification rates in a study by dincer and kargi 5 a sudden increase in salinity from 0 7 to 25 ms cm caused the acetate fed denitrification rate to decrease by half and a further increase in salinity to 125 ms cm caused a decrease in the original denitrification rate by two thirds for more complex carbon sources such as domestic wastewater the acclimatization is longer for salinities below 17 ms cm acclimatization has been shown to take several weeks but still achieves the same initial activity however for salinity above 50 ms cm the acclimatization process hs been shown to be even slower 6 based on the above results a mathematical model was developed and the salt inhibition constant was identified to be 25 ms cm 5 nitrate can be removed from water and wastewater through different treatment methodologies the most common method is heterotrophic biological denitrification which uses organic matter as an electron donor and nitrate as an electron acceptor 7 this process produces carbon dioxide nitrogen gas and hydroxyl several studies investigating the effect of additional environmental conditions on denitrification efficiency showed that this microbial activity takes place in the range 2 50 c with denitrification rates increasing 10 fold with every 5 c increment and the highest denitrification rates observed in the range 15 35 c hence the optimal temperature for denitrification process was found to be 35 c 8 or 40 c 9 regarding ph it was observed that for most systems the denitrification rate is depressed below ph 6 0 and above ph 8 0 different studies indicate different ph values as the optima for denitrification but most studies show that the highest rates of denitrification occur within the range of ph 7 0 7 5 8 in addition denitrification is generally taken to be an anaerobic process since nitrate functions as the final electron acceptor when oxygen is absent in the past the presence of oxygen was thought to inhibit enzyme activity directly or indirectly or to repress enzyme synthesis however full denitrification of contaminated groundwater and domestic wastewater has been observed at low oxygen conditions of 3 mg l 10 this study did not examine temperature ph or oxygen concentration effects experiments were maintained at optimum ph 7 0 8 0 25 c and oxygen concentration below 2 mg l the carbon source plays a key role in denitrification several studies have investigated the effects of various carbon sources on nitrate removal for example osaka et al 4 observed that acetate fed denitrification attained high nitrate removal at a salinity of up to 130 ms cm whereas methanol was shown to be effective at a salinity of up to 46 ms cm in this study the microbial community was given 20 days to acclimatize to each 15 ms cm salinity increment in addition it was observed that the denitrification rate of ground water and wastewater is highly dependent on the carbon type added and its concentration must be higher than that required for stoichiometric nitrate removal this excess external organic matter may migrate into the water possibly causing secondary contamination by increasing the excess organic load and resulting in the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and other microorganisims including pathogens and parasites the highest denitrification process rates have been observed with simple carbon sources such as acetic acid ethanol and propionic acid constantin and fick 11 and holló and czakó 12 obtained rates of 50 and 93 g nitrate l day for a high nitrate concentration around 7 g l and excess carbon concentration respectively the denitrification rate also decreases as carbon complexity increases the main mechanism that explains the relation between denitrification rate and carbon complexity is the gibbs free energy value in the process the lower the free energy value for values lower than zero the higher the denitrification rate 12 at free energy values higher than zero the reaction is impossible nitrate reduction via denitrification to n2 gas has a free energy yield δg in kj 2 electrons of 224 1 kj 2 electrons organic matter oxidation has a positive free energy value with lower values for acetate a simple organic carbon 14 3 kj 2 electrons than for more complex organic carbon sources such as sucrose 226 kj 2 electrons in this study several different complex organic carbon sources were used see material and methods bernet et al 14 observed a denitrification rate of 9 54 g nitrate l day using wine distillery effluent with a 22 7 g cod l concentration even for a high nitrate concentration of 150 g l in intensive domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtp a denitrification rate of 0 5 g nitrate l day is generally observed 15 16 excess organic matter can promote the growth of different microorganisms including pathogens which exist in treated water if no removal process such as membrane filtration or chlorination is applied many wastewater treatment plants refer to these systems as a black box meaning they focus on influent parameters and optimizing the abiotic conditions to reduce contaminants in the effluent and pay less attention to the microbial populations that carry out the denitrification processes this approach is now changing as there is a deeper understanding regarding the effect of the denitrifying population composition on the rate of nitrate reduction although denitrification potentials are widely found in bacteria archaea and some eukaryotes e g fungi nitrate reduction in natural and engineered ecosystems is primarily conducted by bacteria 17 heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria are distributed across a large variety of physiological and taxonomic groups in both terrestrial and aquatic systems these groups include hyphomicrobium paracoccus pseudomonas comamonas azoarcus zoogloea comamonadaceae spp and more 18 this fact makes it difficult to link phylogenetic affiliations and denitrification abilities of bacteria for this reason functional biomarkers have been developed based on denitrification reductases however different microorganisms possess either complete or partial denitrification activities and the functional biomarkers cannot always predict the ability of a certain bacterium to perform full nitrate removal 17 moreover the abundances of dominant denitrifying populations also vary significantly in different treatment plants depending on the influent characteristics treatment configurations and operating conditions hence reactor configuration together with the microbial community is also an important factor affecting denitrification efficiency and rate table 1 summarizes nitrate biological removal techniques presenting their advantages and limitations currently it seems that biological treatment is the most cost effective treatment method also demonstrating greater sustainability in comparison to other treatments bioaugmentation treatment has great potential for improving biotreatment efficiency since it adds a large amount of complete denitrifiers that remove all the nitrate thus eliminating the need for long acclimatization time that enables dominance of native denitrifting communities however bioaugmentation presents many problems when the suspended culture is introduced into common wwtps since the short hrt hydraulic retention time causes dilution of the augmented culture and biomass washout from the bioreactor due to continuous inflows some protection and immobilization of the bioaugmented culture must therefore be provided in order to prevent loss of the added biomass encapsulation methods have been developed to promote the impelementation of bioaugmentation treatment encapsulation technology is a promising solution to meet new or proposed stricter regulations on nutrient discharges and to address the desire for more sustainable wastewater treatment processes important properties of encapsulation materials for wastewater treatment include stability permeability and sustainability similar to biofilm systems the use of encapsulation can create local micro environments and gradients of electron donors or acceptors within an encapsulant the most commonly used materials for encapsulation are naturally derived polysaccharides and chemically synthesized polyvinyl alcohol pva wojcieszy nska et al 19 presented several encapsulation immobilization methods that are used for biodegradation of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs including alginate cacl2 alginate cacl2 alpha cyclodextrin chitosan glutaraldehyde cellulose triacetate titania nanoparticles manae agarose acrylic beads ib ec 1 ceramic membrane polyamide polyethylenimine nanofibers and small bioreactor platform sbp technology zhiyue wang et al 20

pva waterborne polyurethane and polyethylene glycol encapsulation of specific denitrifying bacteria selected for their high nitrate removal rate with slow release organic matter may provide a solution for attaining a high denitrification rate thereby reducing secondary contamination by organic matter and pathogen growth in this study an sbp was used in this platform specific microorganisms were inserted into an average volume of 1 5 ml of capsules confined by a microfiltration membrane 0 2 μm average pore size fig 1 and the capsules were added to the water body the capsule membrane prevented external microbial contamination and undesired interactions such as competition and predation allowing the development of a sufficient biomass of the specific internal microorganisms which were highly concentrated hence external microorganisms could not penetrate the capsule and internal microorganisms could not leave the capsule thus preventing biomass loss due to continuous flow dilution the pore size allowed the free movement of contaminated water in and out of the capsules each sbp capsule in this study was equipped with its own source of organic matter by means of controlled release nutrient cores thereby eliminating or reducing the need for external nutrient supplements the nutrients provided by the capsules were available primarily to the encapsulated microorganisms rather than to external microorganisms consequently nutrient support was limited for heterotrophic biomass growth within the host aquatic medium outside of the capsules for the proposed nitrate contamination treatment the only operational activity related to biomass growth and control involves regular replacement of capsules to replenish microorganisms and renew organic matter the estimated life span of the capsules is 2 3 months encapsulation technology has been used for ex situ and in situ water and wastewater treatment 19 21 23 however encapsulated technology for the denitrification of groundwater contaminated with nitrate has not been investigated this study presents a new biological treatment method utilizing a unique encapsulation method that can increase denitrifying rates smaller reactor with no need for natural biomass production biomass persistence within the bioreactor or effluent post treatment removal of excess carbon and bacteria the current study aims to 1 develop a new biological treatment method that can be implemented in both ex situ and in situ treatment strategies for groundwater nitrate contamination 2 demonstrate the potential of using a biological treatment that does not require addition of external organic matter thus reducing secondary environmental contamination 3 present a nitrate bio treatment model with low operational and infrastructure costs our study hypothesis was that the required supplemental organic matter can be reduced as long as we can reduce the loss of excess carbon source downstream this can be achieved by coupling the bacteria with the organic matter as well having some control on the amount of carbon source released over time in order to elevate carbon source utilization efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 capsules and built in nutrient core the structure composition and validation of sbp capsules biocastle water technologies ltd israel including nutrient core preparation are presented in detail in the patent article number pct il2010 000256 and in menashe and kurzbaum 21 39 naticap de nitro type capsules that encased a commercial blend of specific denitrification microorganisms usa bio products usa phc

sucrose and glucose and nutrients e g iron magnesium and nitrogen nutrient cores were made of luria agar la containing 1 yeast extract 2 tryptone 1 nacl and 0 37 agar cast into 96 wells plates once the agar medium polymerized the agar cores were released from the plates onto petri dishes for drying in a biological hood for 72 h under aseptic conditions next the inner cores were sterilized for several hours within the biological hood using uv radiation the ca celloluse acetate micro filtration membrane was built on a water soluble gelatin scaffold by a spray coating method the ca polymer

rate across the membrane were characterized by menashe et al 40 sbp capsules were activated by short term exposure to an aquatic medium once the capsule was exposed to the aquatic medium the microbiota became activated and proliferated within 24 48 h 2 2 reactor design and operation 2 2 1 ex situ reactor a 50 ml up flow continuous reactor tube fed with contaminated synthetic groundwater which was introduced to the bottom of the reactor via a peristaltic pump the internal diameter and length of the reactor were 5 and 10 cm respectively the reactor was operated at constant 25 c under 1 5 m water column pressure to avoid nitrogen gas accumulation inside the capsule this pressure was necessary for nitrogen gas dissolution in the liquid phase nitrogen gas was produced during denitrification inside the capsules and could not leave the capsules in gaseous form therefore it needed to be dissolved in water to leave the capsules the reactor was filled with 10 capsules and operated under three different conditions a variable hydraulic retention time hrt 4 0 0 91 h with a constant influent nitrate concentration 110 mg l and salinity 0 7 ms cm b variable influent nitrate concentration 34 255 mg l at constant hrt 1 3 h and salinity 0 7 ms cm and c variable water salinity 0 7 14 5 ms com at constant hrt 1 3 h and influent nitrate concentration 110 mg l the nitrate concentration of 110 mg l was used since 65 of the contaminated wells in israel have this concentration 3 the synthetic groundwater was prepared daily with tap water and nitrate only 2 2 2 in situ model reactor a 1200 l aquifer model was constructed using a plastic container 110 cm 110 cm 110 cm filled with gradient aggregates of a sand layer in the upper part supported by another layer of larger aggregates 2 10 mm on a porous plastic mesh fig 2 the porous plastic mesh layer was approximately 20 cm above the bottom of the container to create a void allowing water flow i e saturated zone an inflow well was installed approximately 5 0 cm inside the aggregate layers to produce steady water flow into the bottom part of the container aquifer a 15 cm diameter demo pipe well close to the outflow drainage was inserted across the aggregate layers penetrating the void layer to mimic the use of a drilling port for bioreactor penetration at the opposite side of the container from the inflow well an outflow port was constructed at the bottom of the container wall connected to a polypropylene pipe with a straight angle and a height of approximately 20 cm outflow the aquifer model was operated for 75 days summertime average temperature 24 c in continuous mode with an inflow of 100 ml per minute and a nitrate concentration of 100 mg l synthetic solution no3 dissolved in tap water prepared daily into the inflow well via the peristaltic pump assuming that water flow was present only in the saturated zone the calculated hrt was 1 68 days from the inflow well to the outflow port based on 100 ml min flow and 242 l saturated zone volume with dimensions of 20 cm 110 cm 110 cm during the first 20 days of operation which was set as the control period the study model contained no capsules biomass the control period operation was performed to estimate the nitrate treatment or consumption level of natural biomass growth after the control period a 3 53 l reactor with 50 capsules was inserted inside the anterior port for 55 days which corresponded to the test period the reactor was a cylinder column perforated plastic cage with a diameter of 15 cm and a height of 20 cm 2 3 analysis in all experiments 150 ml inflow and outflow were collected at one hrt apart this volume was gently mixed triplicate samples were collected and their ph ec temperature chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 concentrations were analyzed on the same day in accordance with standard methods 41 the alkalinity was examined using gran titration 42 triplicate results should differ by no 5 when this was not the case a new triplicate sampling was performed from the original volume kept in a refrigerator at 5 c 2 4 characterization of the community composition of bacteria inhabiting the internal medium of sbp capsules at the end of the ex situ experiment two sbp capsules were randomly picked and the internal medium was taken using a sterile syringe the gdna of the two samples was extracted using a bacterial genomic dna isolation kit norgen biotek corp canada cat 17 900 and sent for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing at hylabs rhovot israel then 16 s rrna gene libraries for sequencing were prepared as follows in the first pcr the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primer set cs1 515f acactgacgacatggttctacagtgccagcmgccgcggt and cs2 806r tacggtagcagagacttggtctggactachvgggtwtct where the underlined sequences are the 16 s specific sequences and the non underlined sequences are tails used in the second pcr the pcr protocol consisted of 20 cycles of 98 c for 10 s annealing at 55 c for 10 s and extension at 72 c for 20 s finally one cycle of extension at 72 c for 1 min was performed in the second pcr access array primers for illumina fluidigm were used to add the adaptor and index sequences to the samples for illumina sequencing the pcr protocol consisted of 10 cycles of 98 c for 10 s annealing at 55 c for 10 s and extension at 72 c for 20 s finally one cycle of extension at 72 c for 1 min was performed the pcr products were cleaned using ampure xp beads beckham concentrations were measured with qubit life technologies and size was determined using tapestation agilent the samples were then loaded on miseq and sequenced using a miseq v2 500 cycle kit to generate paired end reads of 2 250 bases data were analyzed at hylabs using mothur software 11 3 results and discussion 3 1 ex situ configuration reactor the ex situ reactor was operated at continuous flow under three different conditions 1 constant influent nitrate concentration and water salinity with variable hrt 2 constant hrt and water salinity with variable influent nitrate concentrations and 3 constant hrt and influent nitrate concentration at different water salinity levels during the trials the observed nitrite concentration in the reactor effluent was low 0 1 mg l effluent ph increased from 8 1 to 8 2 to 8 4 8 7 in addition alkalinity concentration increased from 160 to 200 mg caco3 l to 350 420 mg caco3 l indicating the presence of biological denitrification a low nitrite concentration indicated that denitrification was completed without intermediary metabolite accumulation the column reactor was operated at variable hrt 4 0 0 9 h with constant influent nitrate concentration 110 mg l and water salinity 0 7 ms cm to determine the minimal hrt for sufficient nitrate removal 85 reduction from initial nitrate concentration the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations during the experiments are presented in fig 3 the influent nitrate concentration was constant during the whole experiment except during the first 8 days which were used for reactor flow pattern calibration and bio process stabilization in this period effluent nitrate concentration was not measured from days 10 to 40 the effluent nitrate concentration was low approximately 3 10 mg l from day 40 the effluent nitrate concentration increased to 40 mg l possibly because of the inadequate hrt applied and the decreasing nutrient concentration over time when hrt was reduced by 1 3 h nitrate removal significantly decreased indicating that the minimal hrt required for nitrate treatment was between 1 1 and 1 3 h the hrt used in this experiment was much shorter than the ones previously observed by others e g minimum hrt of 2 5 h 42 43 the shorter hrt could be attributed to a higher bacterial concentration obtained in the sbp fig 4 presents the calculated nitrate removal load at different influent loads based on the results shown in fig 3 to determine the minimum hrt necessary for maintaining constant nitrate removal the nitrate removal load steadily increased when the influent load increased from 13 3 g nitrate l day to 33 5 g nitrate l day this increase in influent load was achieved by decreasing the hrt from 4 0 h to 1 3 h while maintaining a constant influent nitrate concentration at these influent loads and hrt the nitrate removal load per capsule was constant at 89 however for higher influent loads hrt shorter than 1 3 h the nitrate removal load decreased indicating that the minimum hrt favoring 89 nitrate removal was between 1 3 and 1 1 h we can assume that nitrite only accumulates at short hrt for the microorganisms to convert nitrite to nitrogen gas or low concentration of microorganism that convert nitrite into nitrogen gas in encapsulation one has high concentration of the desire microorganism in this study case high concentration of nitrite reduction bacteria is present within the sbp capsules promoting low concentration of nitrite even at short hrt the second phase of the experiments fig 5 was conducted at constant hrt of 1 3 h with variable influent nitrate concentrations from 34 mg l to 255 mg l to determine the maximum nitrate removal load and the maximum influent nitrate concentration for this hrt to maintain 89 nitrate removal a constant nitrate removal percentage of 89 was observed with the increase in nitrate influent concentration from 34 mg l to 143 mg l for nitrate influent concentrations higher than 143 mg l the nitrate removal percentage decreased almost linearly indicating that at 1 3 h hrt the maximum nitrate influent concentration required to maintain 89 nitrate removal was 143 mg l for an influent concentration of 143 mg l the concentration of removed nitrate was ca 127 5 mg l leading to a calculated 40 3 and 38 9 g nitrate l day influent and removal load respectively this maximum nitrate removal load of 38 9 g l day is approximately half of that observed by constantin and fick 11 83 g nitrate l day which is the highest nitrate removal load observed so far in the literature however it was at the same order of magnitude as previously explained one of the parameters determining nitrate removal load is organic matter complexity lower complexity leads to higher loads the lower maximum nitrate removal load in this study can be explained by the more complex organic matter used in comparison to the simpler ethanol used previously 11 on the other hand the nitrate removal load observed in this study is two orders of magnitude higher that observed in studies utilizing very complex organic matter such as biogenic and chemical elementary sulfur 30 based on the minimum hrt 1 3 h and maximum nitrate removal load 38 9 g nitrate l day calculated in this study and the international standard for nitrate concentration in water 44 mg nitrate l a maximum influent concentration of 177 mg nitrate l could be applied to the reactor chemical oxygen demand from the dissolution of the organic matter inserted in the capsule core was measured daily in the reactor effluent during the first 15 days of the experiments the effluent cod concentration was ca 20 mg l which was higher than the international standard of 10 mg l 1 however after 15 days of reactor operation cod concentration decreased with time dropping to ca 8 mg l after 25 days of operation and remained constant until the end of the experiments these results indicate that the proposed reactor produced none or minimum secondary contaminants therefore the phase separation of biomass from potable water via a secondary clarifier or microfiltration membrane would be unnecessary consequently infrastructure costs could be remarkably reduced moreover in terms of operational costs effluent chlorination could be minimized because of the reduced cod concentration in the effluents salt intrusion from the sea is another common contaminant in groundwater in israel salinity is the second most common contaminant responsible for well closure for pumping many wells are contaminated with nitrate and salinity in this study the influence of water salinity on the nitrate removal ability of the reactor was investigated the reactor was operated at 1 3 h hrt 110 mg l influent nitrate concentration and different salinity levels 0 7 14 5 ms cm the concentration of removed nitrate at different salinity concentrations is shown in fig 6 the nitrate removal rate decreased linearly from 77 to 35 nitrate with the increase in water salinity from 0 75 ms cm to 14 5 ms cm fig 6 this decrease occurred due to the lack of acclimatization period in the experiments even though the maximum water salinity in the experiments was below the inhibition value of 25 ms cm salinity found previously 44 a similar decrease in denitrification rates with increasing salinity has been observed by others 5 probably a 10 day acclimatization period under each salinity level would result in denitrification rates similar to the original one as long as the salinity is below 25 ms cm 6 extrapolation of the results presented in fig 6 indicates that ca 22 7 ms cm water salinity which is ca 50 of sea salinity no denitrification activity is expected this salinity value is similar to the inhibition value of 25 ms cm observed by others 3 1 1 bacterial community composition fig 7 shows the phylogenetic classification of sequences at the phylum and genus level from the internal medium of the sbp capsules after 30 days of reactor operation at different nitrate influent concentrations with constant hrt 1 3 h and water salinity 0 7 ms cm the initial population inside the capsule was derived from a mixture of bacteria from a commercial blend naticap de nitro that contains several denitrifiers our basic assumption was that all bacteria found inside the sbp originated from naticap de nitro since the membrane pores are too small for bacteria to migrate in and out of the capsule hence even though the phylogenetic affiliation of a bacterium is not enough to determine denitrification ability 17 we assumed that all bacteria found in the sbp are able to perform denitrification because they were selected for the commercial blend for this reason since the influent and abiotic parameters affect the denitrifying bacterial community and acclimatization time enabled proliferation of populations best adapted to the conditions on the one hand and nitrate removal on the other the bacterial composition of the populations rthriving in the sbp capsule after 30 days of operation under such conditions was determined indeed all the dominate phyla found in the analysis proteobacteria 68 bacteroidetes 14 spirochaetes 9 and firmicutes 5 are known to contain denitrifying bacteria 18 moreover the five most dominant bacterial genera were azospira pseudomonas pseudoxanthomonas leptonema and sediminibacterium accounting for 87 of the total proteobacteria phylum these bacterial genera are usually found in water treatment facilities for nitrate removal 46 48 in general many denitrifying bacteria such as pseudomonas and acinetobacter belong to the class of γ proteobacteria and participate in biological nitrogen removal in water treatment facilities 49 similarly firmicutes which are resistant to dehydration and extreme environments such as salinity can be found in many wastewater treatment facilities and play an important role in the nitrogen cycle bacteroidetes is also known for its organic matter and nitrogen removal capabilities 50 according to the bacterial composition of the capsules the dominant population of the biomass adapts to and favors nitrate removal indicating the selective and successful encapsulated bioaugmentation treatment used in this study to make sure that all bacteria found in the sbp are performing denitrification and to fully understand the interactions between these bacteria in terms of nitrate removal further investigation is needed many studies have shown the effect of various environmental conditions on the heterotrophic denitrifying population as this information is needed for a more efficient treatment design previous studies have shown that temperature and c n ratio have the greatest influence on bacterial composition and their heterotrophic denitrification rates for example 9 studied the effect of temperature on denitrification efficiency and bacterial composition at various temperatures they found that tolumonas and bacillus were the most dominant genera in worm activated sludge facilities up to 40 c denitrification efficiency is known to depend on the type of carbon source supplemented to the treated water 51 similarly the c n ratio of the water determines the species composition of the denitrifying bacteria cydzik kwiatkowska et al 52 showed that the abundance of pseudomonas and flavobacterium increases with the c n ratio and both have well known denitrification abilities 3 2 in situ model reactor a groundwater treatment model was built fig 2 and fed with 100 mg l nitrate to assess system capability and adjustment for in situ nitrate removal the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations over time in the experiments are shown in fig 8 in the first 20 days of experiments the system was operated without capsules resulting in a negligible reduction in nitrate concentration and a nitrate effluent concentration of ca 95 5 mg l as nitrate concentration decreased alkalinity increased as indicated by an increase of 6 1 mg l caco3 these results suggested that some natural denitrifying bacteria existed in the aquifer model and removed approximately 5 of the nitrate concentration a 3 53 l reactor with 50 capsules was inserted in the well on day 20 and the nitrate effluent concentration decreased from 100 mg l to 17 6 mg l during the following days the effluent nitrate concentration remained constant at 17 6 mg l corresponding to 85 removal until the end of the experiments a removal level comparable with the previous experiments alkalinity formation increased considerably after the reactor was added with approximately 90 mg l caco3 indicating that nitrate removal fig 8 was due to biological denitrification the high alkalinity of 90 mg l caco3 was constant from day 20 to day 50 when alkalinity formation suddenly decreased with time the decrease was almost linear from 90 mg l caco3 to 22 mg l caco3 from day 50 to day 70 the alkalinity formation remained low and constant after day 70 of the experiments although nitrate removal remained constant at approximately 82 the decrease in alkalinity formation coupled with high nitrate removal was previously observed and is attributed to different organic matter complexity for denitrification during different periods 36 from day 20 to day 50 denitrification involved the simpler organic matter originally inserted into the capsules however depletion of this organic matter probably began on day 50 from day 50 to day 70 the organic matter originally inserted into the capsules was replaced by a more complex carbon source probably the biomass or the polymer of the inner capsule itself as the experiment progressed toward day 70 the shift to the more complex carbon source was more accentuated before the reactor was inserted into the well the nitrite concentration was null after the reactor was inserted the nitrite concentration was constant at ca 0 5 mg l for the 70 days of the experiment the cod concentration was ca 5 mg l in the influent and the same value was observed in the effluent before reactor insertion however after reactor insertion the cod concentration increased to 55 mg l and decreased linearly with time to 5 mg l after 5 days of operation the organic matter originally inserted into the capsules was probably released and spiked the liquid phase however the amount of organic matter released into the external medium decreased over time and completely stopped after 5 days of operation indicating that nitrate treatment did not cause secondary contamination therefore after a few days no excess organic load was emitted into the environment thereby reducing secondary environmental contamination the benefits of immobilized bacteria versus free culture bacteria in continuous treatment systems have been investigated extensively results have shown that immobilized bacteria are preferred since they are physically protected and cannot be washed out of reactors thus sponges membranes organic materials gel beads activated carbon and other platforms such as sbp are commonly used in bacterial immobilization and encapsulation 23 24 30 heterotrophic organisms have exhibited advantages for encapsulated bnr applications with high n conversion rates and simultaneous nitrification denitrification processes however their high biomass yield may result in excessive growth burst of the encapsulant and escape the sbp technology has already proved that it can induce selective biological treatment in various media such as sanitary effluents 53 54 this study is the first to use an encapsulated denitrifying biomass in a continuous configuration without requiring an external substrate for nitrate removal our study demonstrated 85 nitrate removal efficiency which is considered high and effective other nitrate treatment systems involving biomass attached to plastic carriers i e mbbr configuration or plastic filaments have slightly higher nitrate removal efficiency ca 80 99 in the presence of excess external substrate 35 45 48 47 55 since heterotrophic denitrification cultures require a carbon source it is important to have a nutrient core that can provide long term nutrient secretion miller et al 21 demonstrated the use of the sbp capsules implemented inside an in situ permeable biological barrier prbb for groundwater treatment of chlorophenol they used a slow release nutrient core coated with a mixture 1 1 of polylactic acid and polyglycol the coated nutrient core was able to provide long term nutrient secretion the study was conducted for 125 days and the sbp prbb system successfully biodegraded the chlorophenols no secondary contamination was observed over time in 2019 khera et al 16 modeled the costs of different steps for biological nitrate removal taking into consideration the following steps a denitrifying reactor electron donor system biomass generation treatment and post treatment and discharge of backwash the total infrastructure cost of a 2 5 m3 s flow system was 277 106 kwh m3 based on 13 01 us cents for 1 kwh m3 in 2019 where 55 was allocated for reactor construction 2 h hrt 11 for the effluent post treatment system and 2 for biomass generation treatment the remaining 38 was allocated to pump sensor and pipes costs a 30 year lifetime was assumed we note that besides the construction costs operational and maintenance costs are high ca 27 106 kwh m3 annually 10 of the infrastructure cost and electron donor purchase and waste management account for 50 of this total 56 57 based on this data the cost to treat 1m3 of water is 0 46 kwh m3 it can be assumed that the use of encapsulated denitrifying bacteria will reduce the total costs by around 50 to 0 23 kwh m3 based on the reduction in hrt from 2 to 1 3 h and no requirement for effluent and biomass post treatment electron donor purchase or waste management the encapsulation system carries its own costs however since the sbp technology for this application is still in the developmental phase and not fully commercialized it is expected that mass production of this innovative technology will significantly reduce capsule costs we note that the use of an external substrate is saved by using this system therefore the operational costs might be the same or even lower with sbp technology eliminating the need for water enrichment with external carbon sources for denitrification probably reduces secondary contamination of water thus it carries potential for infrastructure and operational cost reduction i e filtration membrane activated carbon filter and chemicals moreover the in situ and ex situ treatment configurations based on sbp encapsulation eliminate the need for phase separation of biomass from the treated water 58 these results indicated that the proposed reactor produced none or minimum secondary contaminants therefore the phase separation of biomass from potable water via a secondary clarifier or microfiltration membrane would be unnecessary 4 conclusions the proposed biological reactor based on encapsulation technology can remove nitrate from contaminated groundwater in in situ and ex situ experiments at high rates without the need for constant supplementation of external carbon sources and with a 50 reduction in infrastructure costs in the ex situ experiments the high bacterial concentration inside the capsules without competition with external microorganisms favored a maximum high nitrate removal rate of 38 9 g nitrate l day with a short retention time of 1 3 h even at a salinity level of 2 ms cm at higher salinity levels the kinetic rate of denitrification decreased linearly the in situ treatment experiments showed high performance for over 50 days and demonstrated 85 nitrate removal even when the soft degradable organic matter reservoir inside the capsule was diluted indicating utilization of complex degradable organic matter molecular analysis indicated that the sbp capsules encase denitrifying bacterial cultures offering a bioaugmentation treatment that also works effectively under a continuous flow configuration declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal

12738,the main aim of this study was to develop a new biotreatment process for denitrification by using a small bioreactor platform sbp for macro encapsulation of a bacterial consortium equipped with a slow release organic matter core for ex situ and in situ treatment configurations the biotreatment system in the continuous ex situ mode achieved a maximal nitrate removal load of 38 9 g nitrate l day with a short hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 3 h the in situ configuration showed high performance for 50 days with 85 nitrate removal from an initial concentration of 110 mg l the capsules continuously removed nitrate at the same rate even when the organic matter level in the internal capsule was low after 30 days of in situ experiments the bacterial population composition set inside the sbp capsules presented dominant populations of well known heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria thus the encapsulated process not only demonstrated a short hrt necessary for high nitrate removal rates in ex and in situ configurations but also potentially lower operational costs and no secondary environmental contamination caused by excess organic matter keywords nitrate denitrification small bioreactor platform in situ treatment ex situ treatment groundwater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate no3 is a water contaminant present in groundwater in different parts of the world mainly due to large amounts of agricultural fertilizers and irrigation with effluent however it can also originate in compost applied to soil and or industrial waste spill nitrate in drinking water is considered toxic to newborns and infants and causes methemoglobinemia a phenomenon commonly known as blue baby syndrome according to world health organization standards the maximum nitrate concentration allowed in drinking water is 44 mg l 1 2 in israel nitrate is the main cause for shutting down pumping wells being responsible for about 46 of all well closures between 1997 and 2004 nowadays approximately 50 of the wells in the coastal aquifer have a nitrate concentration exceeding 50 mg l which is the maximum standard concentration in israel 3 other contaminants present in groundwater include chlorine and organic matter the second and third most common contaminants found in wells responsible for 16 and 12 of well closures respectively cross contamination of nitrate organic matter and salinity also occurs the effect of medium characteristics on denitrification rate has been investigated in detail salinity affects denitrification removal rates only at high salt concentration above 50 ms cm 4 seawater salinity depending on the carbon source and only for a short period of time salt spiking or short acclimatization time has a severe effect on denitrification rates in a study by dincer and kargi 5 a sudden increase in salinity from 0 7 to 25 ms cm caused the acetate fed denitrification rate to decrease by half and a further increase in salinity to 125 ms cm caused a decrease in the original denitrification rate by two thirds for more complex carbon sources such as domestic wastewater the acclimatization is longer for salinities below 17 ms cm acclimatization has been shown to take several weeks but still achieves the same initial activity however for salinity above 50 ms cm the acclimatization process hs been shown to be even slower 6 based on the above results a mathematical model was developed and the salt inhibition constant was identified to be 25 ms cm 5 nitrate can be removed from water and wastewater through different treatment methodologies the most common method is heterotrophic biological denitrification which uses organic matter as an electron donor and nitrate as an electron acceptor 7 this process produces carbon dioxide nitrogen gas and hydroxyl several studies investigating the effect of additional environmental conditions on denitrification efficiency showed that this microbial activity takes place in the range 2 50 c with denitrification rates increasing 10 fold with every 5 c increment and the highest denitrification rates observed in the range 15 35 c hence the optimal temperature for denitrification process was found to be 35 c 8 or 40 c 9 regarding ph it was observed that for most systems the denitrification rate is depressed below ph 6 0 and above ph 8 0 different studies indicate different ph values as the optima for denitrification but most studies show that the highest rates of denitrification occur within the range of ph 7 0 7 5 8 in addition denitrification is generally taken to be an anaerobic process since nitrate functions as the final electron acceptor when oxygen is absent in the past the presence of oxygen was thought to inhibit enzyme activity directly or indirectly or to repress enzyme synthesis however full denitrification of contaminated groundwater and domestic wastewater has been observed at low oxygen conditions of 3 mg l 10 this study did not examine temperature ph or oxygen concentration effects experiments were maintained at optimum ph 7 0 8 0 25 c and oxygen concentration below 2 mg l the carbon source plays a key role in denitrification several studies have investigated the effects of various carbon sources on nitrate removal for example osaka et al 4 observed that acetate fed denitrification attained high nitrate removal at a salinity of up to 130 ms cm whereas methanol was shown to be effective at a salinity of up to 46 ms cm in this study the microbial community was given 20 days to acclimatize to each 15 ms cm salinity increment in addition it was observed that the denitrification rate of ground water and wastewater is highly dependent on the carbon type added and its concentration must be higher than that required for stoichiometric nitrate removal this excess external organic matter may migrate into the water possibly causing secondary contamination by increasing the excess organic load and resulting in the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and other microorganisims including pathogens and parasites the highest denitrification process rates have been observed with simple carbon sources such as acetic acid ethanol and propionic acid constantin and fick 11 and holló and czakó 12 obtained rates of 50 and 93 g nitrate l day for a high nitrate concentration around 7 g l and excess carbon concentration respectively the denitrification rate also decreases as carbon complexity increases the main mechanism that explains the relation between denitrification rate and carbon complexity is the gibbs free energy value in the process the lower the free energy value for values lower than zero the higher the denitrification rate 12 at free energy values higher than zero the reaction is impossible nitrate reduction via denitrification to n2 gas has a free energy yield δg in kj 2 electrons of 224 1 kj 2 electrons organic matter oxidation has a positive free energy value with lower values for acetate a simple organic carbon 14 3 kj 2 electrons than for more complex organic carbon sources such as sucrose 226 kj 2 electrons in this study several different complex organic carbon sources were used see material and methods bernet et al 14 observed a denitrification rate of 9 54 g nitrate l day using wine distillery effluent with a 22 7 g cod l concentration even for a high nitrate concentration of 150 g l in intensive domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtp a denitrification rate of 0 5 g nitrate l day is generally observed 15 16 excess organic matter can promote the growth of different microorganisms including pathogens which exist in treated water if no removal process such as membrane filtration or chlorination is applied many wastewater treatment plants refer to these systems as a black box meaning they focus on influent parameters and optimizing the abiotic conditions to reduce contaminants in the effluent and pay less attention to the microbial populations that carry out the denitrification processes this approach is now changing as there is a deeper understanding regarding the effect of the denitrifying population composition on the rate of nitrate reduction although denitrification potentials are widely found in bacteria archaea and some eukaryotes e g fungi nitrate reduction in natural and engineered ecosystems is primarily conducted by bacteria 17 heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria are distributed across a large variety of physiological and taxonomic groups in both terrestrial and aquatic systems these groups include hyphomicrobium paracoccus pseudomonas comamonas azoarcus zoogloea comamonadaceae spp and more 18 this fact makes it difficult to link phylogenetic affiliations and denitrification abilities of bacteria for this reason functional biomarkers have been developed based on denitrification reductases however different microorganisms possess either complete or partial denitrification activities and the functional biomarkers cannot always predict the ability of a certain bacterium to perform full nitrate removal 17 moreover the abundances of dominant denitrifying populations also vary significantly in different treatment plants depending on the influent characteristics treatment configurations and operating conditions hence reactor configuration together with the microbial community is also an important factor affecting denitrification efficiency and rate table 1 summarizes nitrate biological removal techniques presenting their advantages and limitations currently it seems that biological treatment is the most cost effective treatment method also demonstrating greater sustainability in comparison to other treatments bioaugmentation treatment has great potential for improving biotreatment efficiency since it adds a large amount of complete denitrifiers that remove all the nitrate thus eliminating the need for long acclimatization time that enables dominance of native denitrifting communities however bioaugmentation presents many problems when the suspended culture is introduced into common wwtps since the short hrt hydraulic retention time causes dilution of the augmented culture and biomass washout from the bioreactor due to continuous inflows some protection and immobilization of the bioaugmented culture must therefore be provided in order to prevent loss of the added biomass encapsulation methods have been developed to promote the impelementation of bioaugmentation treatment encapsulation technology is a promising solution to meet new or proposed stricter regulations on nutrient discharges and to address the desire for more sustainable wastewater treatment processes important properties of encapsulation materials for wastewater treatment include stability permeability and sustainability similar to biofilm systems the use of encapsulation can create local micro environments and gradients of electron donors or acceptors within an encapsulant the most commonly used materials for encapsulation are naturally derived polysaccharides and chemically synthesized polyvinyl alcohol pva wojcieszy nska et al 19 presented several encapsulation immobilization methods that are used for biodegradation of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs including alginate cacl2 alginate cacl2 alpha cyclodextrin chitosan glutaraldehyde

pva waterborne polyurethane and polyethylene glycol encapsulation of specific denitrifying bacteria selected for their high nitrate removal rate with slow release organic matter may provide a solution for attaining a high denitrification rate thereby reducing secondary contamination by organic matter and pathogen growth in this study an sbp was used in this platform specific microorganisms were inserted into an average volume of 1 5 ml of capsules confined by a microfiltration membrane 0 2 μm average pore size fig 1 and the capsules were added to the water body the capsule membrane prevented external microbial contamination and undesired interactions such as competition and predation allowing the development of a sufficient biomass of the specific internal microorganisms which were highly concentrated hence external microorganisms could not penetrate the capsule and internal microorganisms could not leave the capsule thus preventing biomass loss due to continuous flow dilution the pore size allowed the free movement of contaminated water in and out of the capsules each sbp capsule in this study was equipped with its own source of organic matter by means of controlled release nutrient cores thereby eliminating or reducing the need for external nutrient supplements the nutrients provided by the capsules were available primarily to the encapsulated microorganisms rather than to external microorganisms consequently nutrient support was limited for heterotrophic biomass growth within the host aquatic medium outside of the capsules for the proposed nitrate contamination treatment the only operational activity related to biomass growth and control involves regular replacement of capsules to replenish microorganisms and renew organic matter the estimated life span of the capsules is 2 3 months encapsulation technology has been used for ex situ and in situ water and wastewater treatment 19 21 23 however encapsulated technology for the denitrification of groundwater contaminated with nitrate has not been investigated this study presents a new biological treatment method utilizing a unique encapsulation method that can increase denitrifying rates smaller reactor with no need for natural biomass production biomass persistence within the bioreactor or effluent post treatment removal of excess carbon and bacteria the current study aims to 1 develop a new biological treatment method that can be implemented in both ex situ and in situ treatment strategies for groundwater nitrate contamination 2 demonstrate the potential of using a biological treatment that does not require addition of external organic matter thus reducing secondary environmental contamination 3 present a nitrate bio treatment model with low operational and infrastructure costs our study hypothesis was that the required supplemental organic matter can be reduced as long as we can reduce the loss of excess carbon source downstream this can be achieved by coupling the bacteria with the organic matter as well having some control on the amount of carbon source released over time in order to elevate carbon source utilization efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 capsules and built in nutrient core the structure composition and validation of sbp capsules biocastle water technologies ltd israel including nutrient core preparation are presented in detail in the patent article number pct il2010 000256 and in menashe and kurzbaum 21 39 naticap de nitro type capsules that encased a commercial blend of specific denitrification microorganisms usa bio products usa phc type 7 and a controlled released nutrient core were used each sbp capsule contained approximately 1 mg bacterial powder dry mass these capsules comprised different types of complex organic matter e g sucrose and glucose and nutrients e g iron magnesium and nitrogen nutrient cores were made of luria agar la containing 1 yeast extract 2 tryptone 1 nacl and 0 37 agar cast into 96 wells plates once the agar medium polymerized the agar cores were released from the plates onto petri dishes for drying in a biological hood for 72 h under aseptic conditions next the inner cores were sterilized for several hours within the biological hood using uv radiation the ca celloluse acetate micro filtration membrane was built on a water soluble gelatin scaffold by a spray coating method the ca polymer comprises a blend of ca sigma dissolved in an 80 acetone 20 methanol v v solution the solid fraction is 8 in total comprising 88 ca and 12 castor oil as a plasticizer membrane pore size and diffussion rate across the membrane were characterized by menashe et al 40 sbp capsules were activated by short term exposure to an aquatic medium once the capsule was exposed to the aquatic medium the microbiota became activated and proliferated within 24 48 h 2 2 reactor design and operation 2 2 1 ex situ reactor a 50 ml up flow continuous reactor tube fed with contaminated synthetic groundwater which was introduced to the bottom of the reactor via a peristaltic pump the internal diameter and length of the reactor were 5 and 10 cm respectively the reactor was operated at constant 25 c under 1 5 m water column pressure to avoid nitrogen gas accumulation inside the capsule this pressure was necessary for nitrogen gas dissolution in the liquid phase nitrogen gas was produced during denitrification inside the capsules and could not leave the capsules in gaseous form therefore it needed to be dissolved in water to leave the capsules the reactor was filled with 10 capsules and operated under three different conditions a variable hydraulic retention time hrt 4 0 0 91 h with a constant influent nitrate concentration 110 mg l and salinity 0 7 ms cm b variable influent nitrate concentration 34 255 mg l at constant hrt 1 3 h and salinity 0 7 ms cm and c variable water salinity 0 7 14 5 ms com at constant hrt 1 3 h and influent nitrate concentration 110 mg l the nitrate concentration of 110 mg l was used since 65 of the contaminated wells in israel have this concentration 3 the synthetic groundwater was prepared daily with tap water and nitrate only 2 2 2 in situ model reactor a 1200 l aquifer model was constructed using a plastic container 110 cm 110 cm 110 cm filled with gradient aggregates of a sand layer in the upper part supported by another layer of larger aggregates 2 10 mm on a porous plastic mesh fig 2 the porous plastic mesh layer was approximately 20 cm above the bottom of the container to create a void allowing water flow i e saturated zone an inflow well was installed approximately 5 0 cm inside the aggregate layers to produce steady water flow into the bottom part of the container aquifer a 15 cm diameter demo pipe well close to the outflow drainage was inserted across the aggregate layers penetrating the void layer to mimic the use of a drilling port for bioreactor penetration at the opposite side of the container from the inflow well an outflow port was constructed at the bottom of the container wall connected to a polypropylene pipe with a straight angle and a height of approximately 20 cm outflow the aquifer model was operated for 75 days summertime average temperature 24 c in continuous mode with an inflow of 100 ml per minute and a nitrate concentration of 100 mg l synthetic solution no3 dissolved in tap water prepared daily into the inflow well via the peristaltic pump assuming that water flow was present only in the saturated zone the calculated hrt was 1 68 days from the inflow well to the outflow port based on 100 ml min flow and 242 l saturated zone volume with dimensions of 20 cm 110 cm 110 cm during the first 20 days of operation which was set as the control period the study model contained no capsules biomass the control period operation was performed to estimate the nitrate treatment or consumption level of natural biomass growth after the control period a 3 53 l reactor with 50 capsules was inserted inside the anterior port for 55 days which corresponded to the test period the reactor was a cylinder column perforated plastic cage with a diameter of 15 cm and a height of 20 cm 2 3 analysis in all experiments 150 ml inflow and outflow were collected at one hrt apart this volume was gently mixed triplicate samples were collected and their ph ec temperature chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 concentrations were analyzed on the same day in accordance with standard methods 41 the alkalinity was examined using gran titration 42 triplicate results should differ by no 5 when this was not the case a new triplicate sampling was performed from the original volume kept in a refrigerator at 5 c 2 4 characterization of the community composition of bacteria inhabiting the internal medium of sbp capsules at the end of the ex situ experiment two sbp capsules were randomly picked and the internal medium was taken using a sterile syringe the gdna of the two samples was extracted using a bacterial genomic dna isolation kit norgen biotek corp canada cat 17 900 and sent for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing at hylabs rhovot israel then 16 s rrna gene libraries for sequencing were prepared as follows in the first pcr the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primer set cs1 515f acactgacgacatggttctacagtgccagcmgccgcggt and cs2 806r tacggtagcagagacttggtctggactachvgggtwtct where the underlined sequences are the 16 s specific sequences and the non underlined sequences are tails used in the second pcr the pcr protocol consisted of 20 cycles of 98 c for 10 s annealing at 55 c for 10 s and extension at 72 c for 20 s finally one cycle of extension at 72 c for 1 min was performed in the second pcr access array primers for illumina fluidigm were used to add the adaptor and index sequences to the samples for illumina sequencing the pcr protocol consisted of 10 cycles of 98 c for 10 s annealing at 55 c for 10 s and extension at 72 c for 20 s finally one cycle of extension at 72 c for 1 min was performed the pcr products were cleaned using ampure xp beads beckham concentrations were measured with qubit life technologies and size was determined using tapestation agilent the samples were then loaded on miseq and sequenced using a miseq v2 500 cycle kit to generate paired end reads of 2 250 bases data were analyzed at hylabs using mothur software 11 3 results and discussion 3 1 ex situ configuration reactor the ex situ reactor was operated at continuous flow under three different conditions 1 constant influent nitrate concentration and water salinity with variable hrt 2 constant hrt and water salinity with variable influent nitrate concentrations and 3 constant hrt and influent nitrate concentration at different water salinity levels during the trials the observed nitrite concentration in the reactor effluent was low 0 1 mg l effluent ph increased from 8 1 to 8 2 to 8 4 8 7 in addition alkalinity concentration increased from 160 to 200 mg caco3 l to 350 420 mg caco3 l indicating the presence of biological denitrification a low nitrite concentration indicated that denitrification was completed without intermediary metabolite accumulation the column reactor was operated at variable hrt 4 0 0 9 h with constant influent nitrate concentration 110 mg l and water salinity 0 7 ms cm to determine the minimal hrt for sufficient nitrate removal 85 reduction from initial nitrate concentration the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations during the experiments are presented in fig 3 the influent nitrate concentration was constant during the whole experiment except during the first 8 days which were used for reactor flow pattern calibration and bio process stabilization in this period effluent nitrate concentration was not measured from days 10 to 40 the effluent nitrate concentration was low approximately 3 10 mg l from day 40 the effluent nitrate concentration increased to 40 mg l possibly because of the inadequate hrt applied and the decreasing nutrient concentration over time when hrt was reduced by 1 3 h nitrate removal significantly decreased indicating that the minimal hrt required for nitrate treatment was between 1 1 and 1 3 h the hrt used in this experiment was much shorter than the ones previously observed by others e g minimum hrt of 2 5 h 42 43 the shorter hrt could be attributed to a higher bacterial concentration obtained in the sbp fig 4 presents the calculated nitrate removal load at different influent loads based on the results shown in fig 3 to determine the minimum hrt necessary for maintaining constant nitrate removal the nitrate removal load steadily increased when the influent load increased from 13 3 g nitrate l day to 33 5 g nitrate l day this increase in influent load was achieved by decreasing the hrt from 4 0 h to 1 3 h while maintaining a constant influent nitrate concentration at these influent loads and hrt the nitrate removal load per capsule was constant at 89 however for higher influent loads hrt shorter than 1 3 h the nitrate removal load decreased indicating that the minimum hrt favoring 89 nitrate removal was between 1 3 and 1 1 h we can assume that nitrite only accumulates at short hrt for the microorganisms to convert nitrite to nitrogen gas or low concentration of microorganism that convert nitrite into nitrogen gas in encapsulation one has high concentration of the desire microorganism in this study case high concentration of nitrite reduction bacteria is present within the sbp capsules promoting low concentration of nitrite even at short hrt the second phase of the experiments fig 5 was conducted at constant hrt of 1 3 h with variable influent nitrate concentrations from 34 mg l to 255 mg l to determine the maximum nitrate removal load and the maximum influent nitrate concentration for this hrt to maintain 89 nitrate removal a constant nitrate removal percentage of 89 was observed with the increase in nitrate influent concentration from 34 mg l to 143 mg l for nitrate influent concentrations higher than 143 mg l the nitrate removal percentage decreased almost linearly indicating that at 1 3 h hrt the maximum nitrate influent concentration required to maintain 89 nitrate removal was 143 mg l for an influent concentration of 143 mg l the concentration of removed nitrate was ca 127 5 mg l leading to a calculated 40 3 and 38 9 g nitrate l day influent and removal load respectively this maximum nitrate removal load of 38 9 g l day is approximately half of that observed by constantin and fick 11 83 g nitrate l day which is the highest nitrate removal load observed so far in the literature however it was at the same order of magnitude as previously explained one of the parameters determining nitrate removal load is organic matter complexity lower complexity leads to higher loads the lower maximum nitrate removal load in this study can be explained by the more complex organic matter used in comparison to the simpler ethanol used previously 11 on the other hand the nitrate removal load observed in this study is two orders of magnitude higher that observed in studies utilizing very complex organic matter such as biogenic and chemical elementary sulfur 30 based on the minimum hrt 1 3 h and maximum nitrate removal load 38 9 g nitrate l day calculated in this study and the international standard for nitrate concentration in water 44 mg nitrate l a maximum influent concentration of 177 mg nitrate l could be applied to the reactor chemical oxygen demand from the dissolution of the organic matter inserted in the capsule core was measured daily in the reactor effluent during the first 15 days of the experiments the effluent cod concentration was ca 20 mg l which was higher than the international standard of 10 mg l 1 however after 15 days of reactor operation cod concentration decreased with time dropping to ca 8 mg l after 25 days of operation and remained constant until the end of the experiments these results indicate that the proposed reactor produced none or minimum secondary contaminants therefore the phase separation of biomass from potable water via a secondary clarifier or microfiltration membrane would be unnecessary consequently infrastructure costs could be remarkably reduced moreover in terms of operational costs effluent chlorination could be minimized because of the reduced cod concentration in the effluents salt intrusion from the sea is another common contaminant in groundwater in israel salinity is the second most common contaminant responsible for well closure for pumping many wells are contaminated with nitrate and salinity in this study the influence of water salinity on the nitrate removal ability of the reactor was investigated the reactor was operated at 1 3 h hrt 110 mg l influent nitrate concentration and different salinity levels 0 7 14 5 ms cm the concentration of removed nitrate at different salinity concentrations is shown in fig 6 the nitrate removal rate decreased linearly from 77 to 35 nitrate with the increase in water salinity from 0 75 ms cm to 14 5 ms cm fig 6 this decrease occurred due to the lack of acclimatization period in the experiments even though the maximum water salinity in the experiments was below the inhibition value of 25 ms cm salinity found previously 44 a similar decrease in denitrification rates with increasing salinity has been observed by others 5 probably a 10 day acclimatization period under each salinity level would result in denitrification rates similar to the original one as long as the salinity is below 25 ms cm 6 extrapolation of the results presented in fig 6 indicates that ca 22 7 ms cm water salinity which is ca 50 of sea salinity no denitrification activity is expected this salinity value is similar to the inhibition value of 25 ms cm observed by others 3 1 1 bacterial community composition fig 7 shows the phylogenetic classification of sequences at the phylum and genus level from the internal medium of the sbp capsules after 30 days of reactor operation at different nitrate influent concentrations with constant hrt 1 3 h and water salinity 0 7 ms cm the initial population inside the capsule was derived from a mixture of bacteria from a commercial blend naticap de nitro that contains several denitrifiers our basic assumption was that all bacteria found inside the sbp originated from naticap de nitro since the membrane pores are too small for bacteria to migrate in and out of the capsule hence even though the phylogenetic affiliation of a bacterium is not enough to determine denitrification ability 17 we assumed that all bacteria found in the sbp are able to perform denitrification because they were selected for the commercial blend for this reason since the influent and abiotic parameters affect the denitrifying bacterial community and acclimatization time enabled proliferation of populations best adapted to the conditions on the one hand and nitrate removal on the other the bacterial composition of the populations rthriving in the sbp capsule after 30 days of operation under such conditions was determined indeed all the dominate phyla found in the analysis proteobacteria 68 bacteroidetes 14 spirochaetes 9 and firmicutes 5 are known to contain denitrifying bacteria 18 moreover the five most dominant bacterial genera were azospira pseudomonas pseudoxanthomonas leptonema and sediminibacterium accounting for 87 of the total proteobacteria phylum these bacterial genera are usually found in water treatment facilities for nitrate removal 46 48 in general many denitrifying bacteria such as pseudomonas and acinetobacter belong to the class of γ proteobacteria and participate in biological nitrogen removal in water treatment facilities 49 similarly firmicutes which are resistant to dehydration and extreme environments such as salinity can be found in many wastewater treatment facilities and play an important role in the nitrogen cycle bacteroidetes is also known for its organic matter and nitrogen removal capabilities 50 according to the bacterial composition of the capsules the dominant population of the biomass adapts to and favors nitrate removal indicating the selective and successful encapsulated bioaugmentation treatment used in this study to make sure that all bacteria found in the sbp are performing denitrification and to fully understand the interactions between these bacteria in terms of nitrate removal further investigation is needed many studies have shown the effect of various environmental conditions on the heterotrophic denitrifying population as this information is needed for a more efficient treatment design previous studies have shown that temperature and c n ratio have the greatest influence on bacterial composition and their heterotrophic denitrification rates for example 9 studied the effect of temperature on denitrification efficiency and bacterial composition at various temperatures they found that tolumonas and bacillus were the most dominant genera in worm activated sludge facilities up to 40 c denitrification efficiency is known to depend on the type of carbon source supplemented to the treated water 51 similarly the c n ratio of the water determines the species composition of the denitrifying bacteria cydzik kwiatkowska et al 52 showed that the abundance of pseudomonas and flavobacterium increases with the c n ratio and both have well known denitrification abilities 3 2 in situ model reactor a groundwater treatment model was built fig 2 and fed with 100 mg l nitrate to assess system capability and adjustment for in situ nitrate removal the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations over time in the experiments are shown in fig 8 in the first 20 days of experiments the system was operated without capsules resulting in a negligible reduction in nitrate concentration and a nitrate effluent concentration of ca 95 5 mg l as nitrate concentration decreased alkalinity increased as indicated by an increase of 6 1 mg l caco3 these results suggested that some natural denitrifying bacteria existed in the aquifer model and removed approximately 5 of the nitrate concentration a 3 53 l reactor with 50 capsules was inserted in the well on day 20 and the nitrate effluent concentration decreased from 100 mg l to 17 6 mg l during the following days the effluent nitrate concentration remained constant at 17 6 mg l corresponding to 85 removal until the end of the experiments a removal level comparable with the previous experiments alkalinity formation increased considerably after the reactor was added with approximately 90 mg l caco3 indicating that nitrate removal fig 8 was due to biological denitrification the high alkalinity of 90 mg l caco3 was constant from day 20 to day 50 when alkalinity formation suddenly decreased with time the decrease was almost linear from 90 mg l caco3 to 22 mg l caco3 from day 50 to day 70 the alkalinity formation remained low and constant after day 70 of the experiments although nitrate removal remained constant at approximately 82 the decrease in alkalinity formation coupled with high nitrate removal was previously observed and is attributed to different organic matter complexity for denitrification during different periods 36 from day 20 to day 50 denitrification involved the simpler organic matter originally inserted into the capsules however depletion of this organic matter probably began on day 50 from day 50 to day 70 the organic matter originally inserted into the capsules was replaced by a more complex carbon source probably the biomass or the polymer of the inner capsule itself as the experiment progressed toward day 70 the shift to the more complex carbon source was more accentuated before the reactor was inserted into the well the nitrite concentration was null after the reactor was inserted the nitrite concentration was constant at ca 0 5 mg l for the 70 days of the experiment the cod concentration was ca 5 mg l in the influent and the same value was observed in the effluent before reactor insertion however after reactor insertion the cod concentration increased to 55 mg l and decreased linearly with time to 5 mg l after 5 days of operation the organic matter originally inserted into the capsules was probably released and spiked the liquid phase however the amount of organic matter released into the external medium decreased over time and completely stopped after 5 days of operation indicating that nitrate treatment did not cause secondary contamination therefore after a few days no excess organic load was emitted into the environment thereby reducing secondary environmental contamination the benefits of immobilized bacteria versus free culture bacteria in continuous treatment systems have been investigated extensively results have shown that immobilized bacteria are preferred since they are physically protected and cannot be washed out of reactors thus sponges membranes organic materials gel beads activated carbon and other platforms such as sbp are commonly used in bacterial immobilization and encapsulation 23 24 30 heterotrophic organisms have exhibited advantages for encapsulated bnr applications with high n conversion rates and simultaneous nitrification denitrification processes however their high biomass yield may result in excessive growth burst of the encapsulant and escape the sbp technology has already proved that it can induce selective biological treatment in various media such as sanitary effluents 53 54 this study is the first to use an encapsulated denitrifying biomass in a continuous configuration without requiring an external substrate for nitrate removal our study demonstrated 85 nitrate removal efficiency which is considered high and effective other nitrate treatment systems involving biomass attached to plastic carriers i e mbbr configuration or plastic filaments have slightly higher nitrate removal efficiency ca 80 99 in the presence of excess external substrate 35 45 48 47 55 since heterotrophic denitrification cultures require a carbon source it is important to have a nutrient core that can provide long term nutrient secretion miller et al 21 demonstrated the use of the sbp capsules implemented inside an in situ permeable biological barrier prbb for groundwater treatment of chlorophenol they used a slow release nutrient core coated with a mixture 1 1 of polylactic acid and polyglycol the coated nutrient core was able to provide long term nutrient secretion the study was conducted for 125 days and the sbp prbb system successfully biodegraded the chlorophenols no secondary contamination was observed over time in 2019 khera et al 16 modeled the costs of different steps for biological nitrate removal taking into consideration the following steps a denitrifying reactor electron donor system biomass generation treatment and post treatment and discharge of backwash the total infrastructure cost of a 2 5 m3 s flow system was 277 106 kwh m3 based on 13 01 us cents for 1 kwh m3 in 2019 where 55 was allocated for reactor construction 2 h hrt 11 for the effluent post treatment system and 2 for biomass generation treatment the remaining 38 was allocated to pump sensor and pipes costs a 30 year lifetime was assumed we note that besides the construction costs operational and maintenance costs are high ca 27 106 kwh m3 annually 10 of the infrastructure cost and electron donor purchase and waste management account for 50 of this total 56 57 based on this data the cost to treat 1m3 of water is 0 46 kwh m3 it can be assumed that the use of encapsulated denitrifying bacteria will reduce the total costs by around 50 to 0 23 kwh m3 based on the reduction in hrt from 2 to 1 3 h and no requirement for effluent and biomass post treatment electron donor purchase or waste management the encapsulation system carries its own costs however since the sbp technology for this application is still in the developmental phase and not fully commercialized it is expected that mass production of this innovative technology will significantly reduce capsule costs we note that the use of an external substrate is saved by using this system therefore the operational costs might be the same or even lower with sbp technology eliminating the need for water enrichment with external carbon sources for denitrification probably reduces secondary contamination of water thus it carries potential for infrastructure and operational cost reduction i e filtration membrane activated carbon filter and chemicals moreover the in situ and ex situ treatment configurations based on sbp encapsulation eliminate the need for phase separation of biomass from the treated water 58 these results indicated that the proposed reactor produced none or minimum secondary contaminants therefore the phase separation of biomass from potable water via a secondary clarifier or microfiltration membrane would be unnecessary 4 conclusions the proposed biological reactor based on encapsulation technology can remove nitrate from contaminated groundwater in in situ and ex situ experiments at high rates without the need for constant supplementation of external carbon sources and with a 50 reduction in infrastructure costs in the ex situ experiments the high bacterial concentration inside the capsules without competition with external microorganisms favored a maximum high nitrate removal rate of 38 9 g nitrate l day with a short retention time of 1 3 h even at a salinity level of 2 ms cm at higher salinity levels the kinetic rate of denitrification decreased linearly the in situ treatment experiments showed high performance for over 50 days and demonstrated 85 nitrate removal even when the soft degradable organic matter reservoir inside the capsule was diluted indicating utilization of complex degradable organic matter molecular analysis indicated that the sbp capsules encase denitrifying bacterial cultures offering a

12739,the relatively low performance of fe ii regeneration is an important problem of the conventional fenton system novel smfeo3 ti3c2tx sfo tct catalysts were synthesized using a self assembly method to address this shortcoming xrd ft ir xps sem hr tem and bet bjh analyses confirmed the successful synthesis of the sfo tct 10 composite material the synthesized catalysts were used to degrade tetracycline tc under sonocatalytic and sono fenton catalytic processes the sfo tct 10 catalyst showed excellent efficiency 99 in 30 min for the degradation of tc compared to sfo and tct bare materials under the sono fenton process in fact tct acted as the electron trapper to boost the separation and transition of generated carriers in composite material and improved its catalytic activity the effects of different parameters on the degradation of tc with sfo tct 10 catalyst were studied and the catalytic mechanism was explained in addition the possible degradation pathways were proposed this study provides new insights into the synergy between sfo perovskite nanoparticles and tct mxene in the sono fenton catalytic system for the degradation of tc graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords smfeo3 ti3c2tx tetracycline degradation sono fenton data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid development of universal industrialization has produced huge amounts of wastewater 1 3 pharmaceuticals and personal care products are used extensively in medical treatment and cosmetics threatening human health 4 as emerging pollutants antibiotics have aroused worldwide concern because of their wide applications in human and animal medicine tetracycline tc is the most common synthetic antibiotic that is extensively used to treat infections in human raise animals and increase growth due to its wide activity against bacteria species and low cost of production 5 8 as organisms cannot metabolize tc completely it has been detected in soil surface water groundwater sediments and even drinking water which can lead to various adverse effects on human health and ecosystem 7 9 conventional wastewater treatment methods could not completely degrade tc because of its antibacterial properties and refractory nature 10 11 advanced oxidation processes aops are favorable chemical systems for wastewater remediation with the generation of reactive oxygen species 12 the most efficient aops include photocatalysis ultrasound oxidation sono fenton oxidation electro oxidation ozone based processes and catalytic activation 12 14 heterogeneous fenton reaction is a promising process with outstanding efficiency low metal leaching less energy requirement and capable catalyst recovery 14 17 recently the ultrasound based oxidation process has been used extensively for the degradation of organic pollutants because of its simplicity safety and good environmental properties however ultrasound alone cannot eliminate the pollutants completely combining ultrasound with photocatalysis and fenton catalysis can solve these problems by producing reactive free radicals among those the sono fenton catalytic process is environmentally safe technique that has recently attracted the attention of researchers 18 21 for these aims different materials were synthesized as catalyst and were used for the degradation of organic pollutants perovskites abo3 are widely used materials in industrial catalysis and environmental treatment owing to their easy synthesis low cost a wide variety of size and morphology high stability and catalytic activity 22 25 these materials are used extensively for degrading organic pollutants in wastewater under different aops particularly photocatalysis 23 24 on the other hand these nanoparticles have disadvantages such as low surface area and high charge recombination which limit their usage for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater different methods such as doping surface modification and regulating perovskite composition have been used to solve these problems these methods produce more active sites broaden perovskite light adsorption and suppress electron hole pairs recombination 18 24 26 furthermore coupling perovskite photocatalysts with other aops such as fenton ultrasound and electrochemical processes can increase their catalytic activities under synergistic effects 24 different nanomaterials such as c3n4 reduced graphene oxide metal oxides metal dichalcogenide quantum dots and polymers have been used to synthesize perovskite based composites for wastewater remediation 26 27 the synthesis of composite materials improves their physicochemical property and catalytic efficiency for the degradation of pollutants 26 27 mxenes a new class of two dimensional materials have attracted enormous attention owing to their excellent metal conductivity hydrophilic surface non toxic nature high stability and unique optical properties 28 29 mxenes can serve as the electron trapper to boost the separation and transition of photo generated carriers in heterojunctions and improve photocatalytic activity mxene can also be used as a supporting material for synthesizing composite materials to reduce particle size and prevent aggregation 30 recently mxene based materials have been employed as novel materials for hydrogen storage water splitting and wastewater remediation 28 ti3c2tx tct is the most commonly used mxene for the synthesis of composite materials with tio2 ceo2 fe2o3 ag3po4 g c3n4 31 cu2o 32 bioi 33 bifeo3 34 and basno3 35 for photodegradation of organic pollutants in wastewater there have been few studies on ti3c2tx based composite materials for wastewater remediation under ultrasound irradiation ding et al 36 synthesized n tio2 ti3c2 composite as an effective sono photocatalyst for the removal of methylene blue recently our team reported the synthesis of cotio3 ti3c2tx as sonocatalyst for the degradation of bisphenol a 37 to keep on research in this field and to increase the efficiency of mxene based composite materials for degradation of organic pollutants herein we introduced a sono fenton catalytic system based on smfeo3 ti3c2tx composite materials the synthesized materials were characterized and used for the degradation of tc under sono fenton conditions also the results of sono fenton catalytic degradation were compared with sonocatalytic degradation of tc the effect of the catalyst dosage initial tc and hydrogen peroxide concentrations and the initial ph value on tc degradation with optimized catalyst were explored in detail moreover a possible catalytic mechanism was suggested based on the determination of reactive radicals 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of smfeo3 nanoparticles smfeo3 sfo nanoparticles were synthesized using the conventional citrate gel process 38 samarium nitrate 2 5 mmol 1 11 g and ferric nitrate 2 5 mmol 1 01 g were dissolved separately in deionized water 20 ml the solutions were mixed and stirred at 80 c then dissolved citric acid 2 5 mmol 0 48 g in deionized water 20 ml was added to the above solution and stirred at 150 c for 1 h the solution was turned into a viscous gel and dried at the oven with temperature of 120 c for 12 h the dried gel was powdered and calcined at 700 c for 3 h the obtained brown smfeo3 nanoparticles were used to synthesize the composite materials 2 2 synthesis of composite materials the preparation of tct is reported in our previous study 39 the composite materials sfo tct were synthesized using a simple self assembly method with different weight ratios of tct 33 39 41 fig 1 presents a schematic diagram for the synthesis of composite materials for these syntheses 90 mg of sfo nanoparticles were dispersed in 100 ml of deionized water and 10 mg of tct was dispersed in 30 ml of deionized water the solutions were added dropwise and stirred for 4 h at 50 c the resulting dark brown precipitate was separated with a centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 min washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven overnight to obtain the composite material with tct content of 10 labeled as sfo tct 10 other composite materials with weight ratios of 25 and 50 of tct were prepared using the same method and are named sfo tct 25 and sfo tct 50 respectively 2 3 sono fenton heterogeneous catalytic process the efficiency of the synthesized materials for the degradation of tc was evaluated under sono fenton condition the physicochemical properties of tc are inserted in table s1 25 mg of catalyst was added to the tc solution 50 ml 10 mg l 1 and placed inside a temperature controlled mechanical shaker for 30 min to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium the experiments were conducted with an ultrasound system comprising a water circulation chiller and a circulation pump ultech 970 khz 300 w korea in addition hydrogen peroxide 2 mm was added to the reactions as a hydroxyl radical promoter the efficiency of catalysts for degradation of tc under sono and sono fenton processes was studied with high performance liquid chromatography hplc effects of different parameters such as the catalyst dosage initial concentration of tc solution and hydrogen peroxide on the sono fenton degradation of tc with the sfo tct 10 were studied also the efficiency of the sfo tct 10 was studied for the degradation of other organic pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole smx as an antibiotic and ibuprofen ibp and naproxen npx as anti inflammatory drugs under the sono fenton process the structures of studied organic pollutants are inserted in fig s1 the effects of the initial ph of the pollutant solution were evaluated using tc solution with an initial ph of 2 10 which was prepared by adding naoh or hcl 0 1 m and used for the degradation process with sfo tct 10 composite under the same reaction condition the active species in the degradation of tc were evaluated by performing trapping experiments using different scavengers such as tert butyl alcohol tba benzoquinone bq and sodium azide nan3 capturing oh o2 and 1o2 respectively the experimental process was identical to the synergistic catalytic degradation reaction except for adding the scavengers the recyclability of the sfo tct 10 catalyst was evaluated for degradation of tc solution in 3 cycles every cycle the catalyst was collected after the sono fenton degradation process washed several times with ethanol and water dried and reused for a new degradation process the removal efficiency r of the catalyst was calculated using eq 1 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 the rate constant of degradation of tc with catalysts was calculated using the pseudo first order kinetic model as eq 2 42 43 2 ln c t c 0 kt where c0 and ct denote the initial and final concentration of tc k is the rate constant min 1 and t is the reaction time min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized materials the structures of sfo tct and sfo tct composite materials were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and compared with the jcpds patterns of bare materials in fig 2a comparing the xrd pattern of tct with ti3alc2 with the elimination of interlayer al after etching the diffraction peak at 39 for 104 plane of ti3alc2 disappeared and the diffraction peak at 9 8 for 002 plane shifted to lower angle 19 44 46 for tct the diffraction peaks at 8 93 18 24 27 88 46 00 and 60 80 are assigned to the 002 004 006 105 and 110 reflections of ti3c2tx respectively for the sfo nanoparticles the sharp diffraction peaks at 22 97 25 75 32 11 32 80 33 29 38 95 39 93 46 93 48 48 53 52 59 18 and 68 77 were assigned to the lattice planes of 101 111 200 121 002 112 220 202 212 311 123 and 242 respectively which matched the standard pattern of sfo nanoparticles jcpds card no 15 3320 the sfo nanoparticles were single phase perovskite oxide with an orthorhombic structure and the pnma space group 47 49 according to the xrd patterns of three composite materials both sfo and tct dominating phases were present confirming the successful synthesis of composite materials in addition a comparison of the xrd patterns of three composite materials showed that the intensity of the peaks related to tct increased significantly with increasing the weight ratio of tct fig 2b shows the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of the tct sfo and composite materials for the tct the main bands were observed at 3325 oh 1610 c o 1348 cc 1073 cti and 593 cm 1 tio 19 41 for the sfo nanoparticles the bands at 411 and 540 cm 1 were ascribed to the ofeo bending vibration and feo stretching vibrations respectively resulting from the feo6 octahedral unit of sfo in addition smo stretching vibration was originated from the smo6 octahedral unit of sfo and observed at the same positions as these bands the mentioned bands were characteristics of the feo6 groups in the perovskite compounds 50 for the composite materials the bands related to smfeo3 and tct were observed with some shifts confirming the successful synthesis of composite materials x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was introduced to determine the surface chemical composition of sfo tct 10 based on the xps survey spectra fig 3a the composite material mainly contained sm fe o c and ti demonstrating its successful synthesis fig 3b f show the high resolution xps spectra of sm 3d fe 2p o 1s c 1s and ti 2p respectively the two peaks at 1082 6 and 1109 9 ev were assigned to sm3 3d5 2 and 3d3 2 of the sfo nanoparticles respectively 51 52 in fig 3c the major peaks at 710 1 and 723 0 ev were assigned to fe3 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively as well as the satellite peaks at 716 3 and 730 0 ev 51 52 the o 1s peak could be fitted to three characteristic peaks at 528 4 530 2 and 531 7 ev corresponding to the mo hydroxyl bonding and adsorbed h2o respectively 53 the c 1s spectrum of the sfo tct 10 showed four peaks at 282 8 284 4 286 2 and 288 7 which were assigned to cti cc and co and o c o respectively in addition the binding energies at 455 3 458 4 460 2 and 464 1 ev were corresponded to tic 2p3 2 tio 2p3 2 tic 2p1 2 and tio 2p1 2 respectively the morphology of the sfo tct and sfo tct composite materials was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem as shown in fig 4 sem image revealed small size rod like particles with some aggregation for sfo 54 the pure tct is a lamellar material stacked by nanosheets with a thickness of 60 80 nm 19 55 sem images of sfo tct 10 demonstrated that the sfo nanoparticles were loaded uniformly on the tct layers and interlayers also sem images of sfo tct 10 confirmed the sfo nanoparticles maintained their morphology after coupling with tct but their size decreased significantly furthermore sfo tct 25 and sfo tct 50 showed similar morphology to sfo tct 10 revealing the loading of sfo nanoparticles on the tct layers and interlayers fig s2 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds mapping of sfo nanoparticles and sfo tct 10 were performed to analyze the elemental compositions fig s3 and fig 4 for sfo nanoparticles sm fe and o signals were found without any impurity fig s4 while for sfo tct 10 sm fe o ti and c signals were observed which confirmed the successful synthesis of materials according to reported results the signals for sm fe and o were spread homogeneously over the tct layers transmission electron microscopy tem high resolution tem hr tem and selected area electron diffraction saed were conducted to study the crystal structure and morphology of sfo tct 10 as shown in fig 5a c the small size sfo nanoparticles 6 9 nm were loaded on the tct layers sem and tem confirmed the successful synthesis of sfo tct 10 and the size of sfo nanoparticles decreased significantly furthermore hr tem fig 5d e showed d spacing fringes of 0 38 and 0 27 nm corresponding to the lattice fringes of the 101 and 121 crystal planes of sfo 22 respectively in addition the d spacing fringes of 0 22 nm were observed which are related to the lattice fringes of the 002 plane of tct 19 fig 5d these results confirm the successful synthesis of composite material the saed pattern of the composite material was also obtained during hr tem analysis fig 5f the polymorphic discrete rings showed that the crystals were oriented in several directions and the composite was polycrystalline the weight ratio of sfo and tct in the composite materials was analyzed using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the analysis data are presented in table s2 according to results the weight ratio of tct in sfo tct 10 sfo tct 25 and sfo tct 50 was 8 20 27 8 and 45 0 respectively the surface area and porosity of materials play a significant role in their catalytic activities fig 6a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of tct sfo and sfo tct 10 composite material all samples revealed a type iv isotherm with an h3 hysteresis loop which indicated the mesoporous structure of all samples compared to sfo and tct the composite material showed higher porosity table s3 lists the specific surface area average pore size and pore volume of the samples the specific surface area of the samples was calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method as 4 6 7 6 and 11 6 m2 g 1 for sfo tct and sfo tct 10 respectively the surface area and mesoporous features of the composite material were significantly higher than the bare materials which increased the active sites on the composite material 3 2 evaluation of the catalytic performance 3 2 1 degradation of organic pollutants over the different catalysts the catalytic performance of the synthesized materials for degrading tc under the sono fenton process was investigated before the degradation reactions adsorption experiments were also operated under dark conditions for 30 min to achieve an equilibrium between the surface of the catalyst and the tc solution the adsorption data fig 7a showed that compared to pure sfo the sfo tct composite materials showed better adsorption efficiency towards tc in addition the adsorption efficiency of catalysts was improved by increasing the amount of tct 56 indeed the introduction of tct increased the specific surface area and active sites of the composite material compared to sfo nanoparticles according to fig 7a and b the composite materials showed high efficiency in degrading tc compared to the bare tct and sfo nanoparticles among the composite materials sfo tct 10 showed the excellent performance by degrading 99 of the tc solution within 30 min according to fig 7a the degradation efficiency of the composite materials was decreased by increasing the amount of tct sfo tct 50 showed the lowest efficiency 70 for the degradation of tc in composite materials based on mxene the introduction of the mxene could markedly increase the absorption of light and increase the photo sonocatalytic performance of the composite materials by assisting the charge transfer and restrain the recombination of h e pairs and lengthen the carrier lifetime noticeably an excess of ti3c2tx nanosheets could cause negative influence on these catalytic reactions which should be due to the light shielding effect the agglomeration of sfo nanoparticles and the complete encasing of tct layers with sfo nanoparticles which hinder the formation of heterojunctions and decrease the generation of reactive oxygen species thus the control over the ratio of tct to metal oxide is vital to attain optimal catalytic activity of these composite materials 19 35 36 39 44 46 furthermore the catalytic performance of the synthesized materials was evaluated for degrading tc under the sonocatalytic process the results revealed the efficiency of 54 58 67 59 and 64 for sfo tct sfo tct 10 sfo tct 25 and sfo tct 50 respectively within 30 min similar to the sono fenton process the composite materials showed higher efficiency for the sonodegradation of tc compared to the bare tct and sfo nanoparticles on the other hand all materials showed lower efficiency than the sono fenton catalytic process in general sfo tct composite materials contain surface fe iii fe ii that undergoes a reversible redox reaction and catalyzes the transformation of h2o2 to free radicals 43 in these systems the generation of hydroxyl radicals can be accelerated indicating that the thermal decomposition of h2o2 in the cavitation bubbles increases the formation of reactive radicals 15 57 the kinetics of degradation of tc with all the catalysts under the sono and sono fenton processes was studied using a pseudo first order model and the data was inserted in table s4 interestingly sfo tct 10 showed the highest rate constant 0 096 min 1 under the sono fenton process which was enhanced significantly compared to the tct 0 012 min 1 and sfo nanoparticles 0 013 min 1 similarly cheng et al 43 reported sono fenton degradation of mb by mnfe2o4 biochar with a rate constant of 0 09 min 1 and efficiency of 100 within 20 min yang et al 58 reported photo fenton degradation of tc by feni ldh ti3c2 with the efficiency of 94 7 and a rate constant of 0 015 min 1 within 90 min tan et al 2021 reported the photodegradation of tc by boc ti3c2 1 composite material with a rate constant of 0 052 mg 1 l min 1 and degradation efficiency of 81 in 120 min ha et al 59 assessed ag ag2s bioi composite material with a rate constant of 0 062 min 1 and an efficiency of 99 for the photodegradation of tc in 60 min considering that degradation of pollutants especially tc with sono fenton was rarely studied the efficiency of sfo tct 10 catalyst was compared with recently reported similar studies the details of degradation process is inserted in table 1 7 15 58 60 63 according to table 1 the sfo tct 10 showed excellent efficiency for the degradation of tc in a short time and using low concentration of hydrogen peroxide compared to reported catalysts 3 2 2 effect of different parameters several concentrations of h2o2 0 5 1 2 or 3 mm were used to determine its effect on the degradation of tc by the sfo tct 10 catalyst in the sono fenton process the hydrogen peroxide concentration directly affects the generation of active radicals especially hydroxyl radicals as shown in fig 8a the mineralization efficiency was improved from 89 to 99 by increasing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide from 0 5 to 2 mm on the other hand the degradation efficiency of the system showed no further improvement at higher h2o2 concentrations 3 mm an excessive amount of hydrogen peroxide will quench the already generated oh to produce hydroperoxyl radicals ooh which can consume oh and decrease the system efficiency 47 58 the catalyst dosage is an essential factor with a positive effect of increasing the number of active sites available for catalytic reactions different amounts of sfo tct 10 catalyst 0 3 0 5 0 7 or 0 9 mg l 1 were used to investigate the effect of the catalyst dosage on the degradation of tc in the sono fenton process as shown in fig 8b the degradation efficiency increased from 63 to 99 with the increasing amount of catalyst from 0 3 to 0 5 g l 1 owing to more significant amount of catalyst and higher surface area on the other hand an increase in the amount of catalyst from 0 5 to 0 7 and 0 9 g l 1 decreased the degradation efficiency from 99 to 77 and 71 respectively at a higher catalyst dosage the agglomeration and sedimentation of the catalyst occurred which decreased the interfacial area between the catalyst and reaction solution reduced the number of active sites and ultrasound scattering inhibiting the transfer of ultrasound waves 65 66 the initial concentration of pollutants is an essential factor affecting the degradation efficiency of a catalyst this study examined the efficiency of sfo tct 10 for the degradation of tc solution with an initial concentration of 1 5 7 and 10 mg l 1 under the sono fenton process the catalyst degraded completely the tc solution with concentration of 1 mg l 1 in 10 min and with concentration of 5 and 7 mg l 1 in 20 min according to the results the catalyst degraded the tc solution with low concentrations in a short time fig 8c the catalytic efficiency of the sfo tct 10 composite material for degradation of tc was compared with the degradation of other organic pollutants such as smx as an antibiotic ibp and npx as anti inflammatory drugs under the sono fenton process under the same catalytic conditions the catalyst revealed lower efficiency of 20 17 and 10 for degradation of smx ibp and npx respectively fig 8d the physicochemical properties of pollutants significantly affect their degradation with catalyst under sono fenton catalytic process 67 previous reports demonstrated that the solution ph plays a vital role in the catalyst performance for degrading organic pollutants tc is often detected in the final effluents from wastewater treatment plants it can undergo protonation deprotonation reactions and present different ionic species based on the solution ph it is strongly polar and has three active groups with different pka values fig 9a the majority of tc presents as a positively charged state as tch3 at ph 3 30 while the noncharged state tch2 0 and the negatively charged form tch or tc2 are present at neutral and ph 7 68 respectively 57 68 69 over the ph range of 3 30 to 7 68 tc appears in a non biodegradable form 15 the synthesized catalyst must be efficient for the degradation of tc particularly in the ph range of 3 30 to 7 68 fig 9b shows the zeta potential result of sfo tct 10 at the ph range of 2 10 the point of zero charges for the catalyst was approximately 6 5 indicating it has a positive surface at ph 6 5 and a negative surface at ph 6 5 the sfo tct 10 was used to degrade tc solution with an initial ph of 2 10 under the sono fenton catalytic process the results are inserted in fig 9c the catalyst had good efficiency at ph 2 10 the best result was observed at ph 6 according to fig 8a and b at ph 3 30 the tc species were in form of tch3 and the catalyst was in a positively charged form because of repulsion between the same charge units the catalyst showed an efficiency of 73 which is the lowest amount at ph 6 the best interaction between the catalyst surface and tc molecules was observed which led to a degradation efficiency of 99 while for basic ph both the sfo tct 10 and the tc species were in the anionic forms and the degradation efficiency decreased significantly due to repulsion between units generally the catalyst showed good efficiency in wide ph range 3 2 3 proposed catalytic degradation mechanism the main active species during the sono fenton catalytic process was determined by radical trapping tests to examine the mechanism tba bq and nan3 were used as scavengers of oh o2 and 1o2 respectively according to the results in fig s4 in the presence of tba bq and nan3 the efficiency of sfo tct 10 decreased to 42 78 and 84 respectively showing that the oh played a critical role in degrading tc in this system 70 71 based on the obtained results fig 10 shows the possible catalytic mechanism for tc degradation few reports on combining ultrasound with fenton on tc degradation have been found 15 similar to reported results on mxene based composite materials the bare materials had different fermi energy ef but after their combination in sfo tct composite material a schottky junction was formed 19 56 72 sono fenton process is similar to the fenton reaction but also introduces ultrasound irradiation to improve the degradation of pollutant the ultrasound in heterogeneous fenton systems enhances the transformation of fe3 to fe2 with the decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of sfo tct to produce the oh and ho2 15 16 67 in fact ultrasonic cavitation forms light and hot spots the high wavelength light can excite the sfo tct catalyst to produce electron hole pairs on surface of sfo nps according to the sonoluminescence mechanism 39 73 75 in addition collapsing cavity bubbles in the solution generate high temperature hot spots that accelerate the pyrolysis of h2o2 to the production of oh on the surface of the catalyst 74 for degradation of tc with sfo tct under sono fenton process the following mechanism is suggested fig 10 the first pathway is heterogeneous fenton like catalytic mechanism in a typical fenton like reaction the commonly accepted mechanism is summarized as eqs 3 5 76 the second pathway follows sonocatalytic mechanism in which sfo tct absorbed ultrasound and then underwent charge separation eq 6 schottky junction could effectively promote the transfer of electrons on sfo to the tct surface in sfo tct catalyst eq 7 then the electrons captured by tct could not flow back into the conduction band of sfo thereby reducing carrier recombination in sfo tct catalyst 19 56 subsequently the transferred electrons on the tct surface reacted with h2o2 and dissolved o2 to produce oh and o2 eqs 8 and 9 according to eq 10 the active radical species ultimately degraded tc into co2 and h2o the mainly possible reactions for the degradation of tc with sfo tct were shown as following a fenton process 3 fe iii sfo tct h 2 o 2 fe ii sfo tct ho 2 h 4 fe iii sfo tct ho 2 h fe ii sfo tct o 2 2h 5 fe ii sfo tct h 2 o 2 fe iii sfo tct oh oh b ultrasound irradiation process 6 sfo tct under ultrasound irradiation sfo h e tct 7 sfo h e tct sfo h tct e 8 sfo h tct e h 2 o 2 sfo tct e oh oh 9 sfo h tct e o 2 sfo h tct o 2 10 oh o 2 tc degradation intermediates h 2 o co 2 3 2 4 mineralization efficiency and tc degradation pathway total organic carbon toc was applied to assess the mineralization of the tc while the degradation efficiency of sfo tct composite under sono fenton condition for tc was 99 after 30 min the toc removal in the same condition was 46 these results confirmed that the tc is degraded to intermediates during the degradation process liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms was used to identify by products of tc in this process the mass spectra of tc solution before and after sono fenton degradation are inserted in fig s5 the tc solution displays a main peak with m z 445 the peak became weaker during the ongoing catalytic degradation process while several new peaks appeared this confirms that tc was gradually degraded into smaller molecular intermediates based on the detected intermediate products and previous studies the pathways for tc degradation are proposed in fig 11 for pathway i tc molecules were demethylated to produce p1 m z 403 which was converted to simpler intermediates p3 m z 208 and p4 m z 102 by losing functional groups and ring opening reactions 77 for pathway ii intermediate product p5 m z 461 was formed through the hydroxylation reaction 77 79 subsequently p5 could be converted to p6 m z 375 by the demethylation reaction then further degradation leads to the dislodging of the functional groups opening rings and the generation of the simpler intermediates p7 m z 244 and p8 m z 122 in pathway iii at first intermediate p9 m z 427 was formed by losing hydroxyl group 77 78 80 then with demethylation and ring opening reactions it was converted to simple intermediate p12 m z 143 and finally the simple intermediate was decomposed to co2 and h2o and etc 3 2 5 stability and recyclability of catalyst stability and recyclability are the main factors of the environmental and economical application of the synthesized catalysts 59 consecutive recycling experiments for degradation of tc with sfo tct 10 catalyst under the sono fenton process were carried out the efficiency of the catalyst decreased from 99 to 93 with a negligible decrease after three consecutive cycles fig s6a similar to the literature 32 63 the xrd pattern and tem image of the recycled catalyst are inserted in fig s6b and c the xrd pattern of the recycled catalyst sfo tct 10 matched well with the xrd pattern of the fresh catalyst according to tem image of recycled catalyst sfo nanoparticles were loaded on tct layers similar to the fresh composite material and this confirmed the stability of catalyst during degradation process furthermore the tc solution after degradation with catalyst was analyzed with icp oes to check the leaching of fe and ti elements of catalyst during sono fenton degradation process the results revealed little amount of leaching as 0 13 mg l 1 and 0 73 mg l 1 for ti and fe respectively which confirmed the stability of the catalyst 4 conclusion novel smfeo3 ti3c2tx sfo tct composite materials were synthesized using sfo nanoparticles and tct mxene fe sem and tem showed that rod like sfo nanoparticles were loaded uniformly on the tct layers and interlayers the introduction of tct prevented the aggregation of sfo nanoparticles and increased the surface area in the composite materials the efficiency of composite materials was investigated in sonocatalytic and sono fenton catalytic systems and their performance was compared with sfo nanoparticles and tct the optimal catalyst sfo tct 10 revealed an excellent efficiency of 99 in 30 min under sono fenton process for tc degradation the degradation process followed pseudo first order kinetic recording a relatively high reaction rate 0 096 min 1 compared with sonocatalytic process 0 015 min 1 the excellent catalytic activity should be attributed to the synergistic effect of sono fenton reactions also the schottky junction formed by sfo and tct in addition to the excellent catalytic activity sfo tct 10 showed high stability and reusability for the degradation of tc this work provides new insights into the development of mxene based materials as efficient sono fenton catalysts for the degradation of tc credit authorship contribution statement farzaneh mahmoudi conceptualization preparation methodology data curation writing

keywords smfeo3 ti3c2tx tetracycline degradation sono fenton data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid development of universal industrialization has produced huge amounts of wastewater 1 3 pharmaceuticals and personal care products are used extensively in medical treatment and cosmetics threatening human health 4 as emerging pollutants antibiotics have aroused worldwide concern because of their wide applications in human and animal medicine tetracycline tc is the most common synthetic antibiotic that is extensively used to treat infections in human raise animals and increase growth due to its wide activity against bacteria species and low cost of production 5 8 as organisms cannot metabolize tc completely it has been detected in soil surface water groundwater sediments and even drinking water which can lead to various adverse effects on human health and ecosystem 7 9 conventional wastewater treatment methods could not completely degrade tc because of its antibacterial properties and refractory nature 10 11 advanced oxidation processes aops are favorable chemical systems for wastewater remediation with the generation of reactive oxygen species 12 the most efficient aops include photocatalysis ultrasound oxidation sono fenton oxidation electro oxidation ozone based processes and catalytic activation 12 14 heterogeneous fenton reaction is a promising process with outstanding efficiency low metal leaching less energy requirement and capable catalyst recovery 14 17 recently the ultrasound based oxidation process has been used extensively for the degradation of organic pollutants because of its simplicity safety and good environmental properties however ultrasound alone cannot eliminate the pollutants completely combining ultrasound with photocatalysis and fenton catalysis can solve these problems by producing reactive free radicals among those the sono fenton catalytic process is environmentally safe technique that has recently attracted the attention of researchers 18 21 for these aims different materials were synthesized as catalyst and were used for the degradation of organic pollutants perovskites abo3 are widely used materials in industrial catalysis and environmental treatment owing to their easy synthesis low cost a wide variety of size and morphology high stability and catalytic activity 22 25 these materials are used extensively for degrading organic pollutants in wastewater under different aops particularly photocatalysis 23 24 on the other hand these nanoparticles have disadvantages such as low surface area and high charge recombination which limit their usage for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater different methods such as doping surface modification and regulating perovskite composition have been used to solve these problems these methods produce more active sites broaden perovskite light adsorption and suppress electron hole pairs recombination 18 24 26 furthermore coupling perovskite photocatalysts with other aops such as fenton ultrasound and electrochemical processes can increase their catalytic activities under synergistic effects 24 different nanomaterials such as c3n4 reduced graphene oxide metal oxides metal dichalcogenide quantum dots and polymers have been used to synthesize perovskite based composites for wastewater remediation 26 27 the synthesis of composite materials improves their physicochemical property and catalytic efficiency for the degradation of pollutants 26 27 mxenes a new class of two dimensional materials have attracted enormous attention owing to their excellent metal conductivity hydrophilic surface non toxic nature high stability and unique optical properties 28 29 mxenes can serve as the electron trapper to boost the separation and transition of photo generated carriers in heterojunctions and improve photocatalytic activity mxene can also be used as a supporting material for synthesizing composite materials to reduce particle size and prevent aggregation 30 recently mxene based materials have been employed as novel materials for hydrogen storage water splitting and wastewater remediation 28 ti3c2tx tct is the most commonly used mxene for the synthesis of composite materials with tio2 ceo2 fe2o3 ag3po4 g c3n4 31 cu2o 32 bioi 33 bifeo3 34 and basno3 35 for photodegradation of organic pollutants in wastewater there have been few studies on ti3c2tx based composite materials for wastewater remediation under ultrasound irradiation ding et al 36 synthesized n tio2 ti3c2 composite as an effective sono photocatalyst for the removal of methylene blue recently our team reported the synthesis of cotio3 ti3c2tx as sonocatalyst for the degradation of bisphenol a 37 to keep on research in this field and to increase the efficiency of mxene based composite materials for degradation of organic pollutants herein we introduced a sono fenton catalytic system based on smfeo3 ti3c2tx composite materials the synthesized materials were characterized and used for the degradation of tc under sono fenton conditions also the results of sono fenton catalytic degradation were compared with sonocatalytic degradation of tc the effect of the catalyst dosage initial tc and hydrogen peroxide concentrations and the initial ph value on tc degradation with optimized catalyst were explored in detail moreover a possible catalytic mechanism was suggested based on the determination of reactive radicals 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of smfeo3 nanoparticles smfeo3 sfo nanoparticles were synthesized using the conventional citrate gel process 38 samarium nitrate 2 5 mmol 1 11 g and ferric nitrate 2 5 mmol 1 01 g were dissolved separately in deionized water 20 ml the solutions were mixed and stirred at 80 c then dissolved citric acid 2 5 mmol 0 48 g in deionized water 20 ml was added to the above solution and stirred at 150 c for 1 h the solution was turned into a viscous gel and dried at the oven with temperature of 120 c for 12 h the dried gel was powdered and calcined at 700 c for 3 h the obtained brown smfeo3 nanoparticles were used to synthesize the composite materials 2 2 synthesis of composite materials the preparation of tct is reported in our previous study 39 the composite materials sfo tct were synthesized using a simple self assembly method with different weight ratios of tct 33 39 41 fig 1 presents a schematic diagram for the synthesis of composite materials for these syntheses 90 mg of sfo nanoparticles were dispersed in 100 ml of deionized water and 10 mg of tct was dispersed in 30 ml of deionized water the solutions were added dropwise and stirred for 4 h at 50 c the resulting dark brown precipitate was separated with a centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 min washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven overnight to obtain the composite material with tct content of 10 labeled as sfo tct 10 other composite materials with weight ratios of 25 and 50 of tct were prepared using the same method and are named sfo tct 25 and sfo tct 50 respectively 2 3 sono fenton heterogeneous catalytic process the efficiency of the synthesized materials for the degradation of tc was evaluated under sono fenton condition the physicochemical properties of tc are inserted in table s1 25 mg of catalyst was added to the tc solution 50 ml 10 mg l 1 and placed inside a temperature controlled mechanical shaker for 30 min to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium the experiments were conducted with an ultrasound system comprising a water circulation chiller and a circulation pump ultech 970 khz 300 w korea in addition hydrogen peroxide 2 mm was added to the reactions as a hydroxyl radical promoter the efficiency of catalysts for degradation of tc under sono and sono fenton processes was studied with high performance liquid chromatography hplc effects of different parameters such as the catalyst dosage initial concentration of tc solution and hydrogen peroxide on the sono fenton degradation of tc with the sfo tct 10 were studied also the efficiency of the sfo tct 10 was studied for the degradation of other organic pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole smx as an antibiotic and ibuprofen ibp and naproxen npx as anti inflammatory drugs under the sono fenton process the structures of studied organic pollutants are inserted in fig s1 the effects of the initial ph of the pollutant solution were evaluated using tc solution with an initial ph of 2 10 which was prepared by adding naoh or hcl 0 1 m and used for the degradation process with sfo tct 10 composite under the same reaction condition the active species in the degradation of tc were evaluated by performing trapping experiments using different scavengers such as tert butyl alcohol tba benzoquinone bq and sodium azide nan3 capturing oh o2 and 1o2 respectively the experimental process was identical to the synergistic catalytic degradation reaction except for adding the scavengers the recyclability of the sfo tct 10 catalyst was evaluated for degradation of tc solution in 3 cycles every cycle the catalyst was collected after the sono fenton degradation process washed several times with ethanol and water dried and reused for a new degradation process the removal efficiency r of the catalyst was calculated using eq 1 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 the rate constant of degradation of tc with catalysts was calculated using the pseudo first order kinetic model as eq 2 42 43 2 ln c t c 0 kt where c0 and ct denote the initial and final concentration of tc k is the rate constant min 1 and t is the reaction time min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized materials the structures of sfo tct and sfo tct composite materials were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and compared with the jcpds patterns of bare materials in fig 2a comparing the xrd pattern of tct with ti3alc2 with the elimination of interlayer al after etching the diffraction peak at 39 for 104 plane of ti3alc2 disappeared and the diffraction peak at 9 8 for 002 plane shifted to lower angle 19 44 46 for tct the diffraction peaks at 8 93 18 24 27 88 46 00 and 60 80 are assigned to the 002 004 006 105 and 110 reflections of ti3c2tx respectively for the sfo nanoparticles the sharp diffraction peaks at 22 97 25 75 32 11 32 80 33 29 38 95 39 93 46 93 48 48 53 52 59 18 and 68 77 were assigned to the lattice planes of 101 111 200 121 002 112 220 202 212 311 123 and 242 respectively which matched the standard pattern of sfo nanoparticles jcpds card no 15 3320 the sfo nanoparticles were single phase perovskite oxide with an orthorhombic structure and the pnma space group 47 49 according to the xrd patterns of three composite materials both sfo and tct dominating phases were present confirming the successful synthesis of composite materials in addition a comparison of the xrd patterns of three composite materials showed that the intensity of the peaks related to tct increased significantly with increasing the weight ratio of tct fig 2b shows the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of the tct sfo and composite materials for the tct the main bands were observed at 3325 oh 1610 c o 1348 cc 1073 cti and 593 cm 1 tio 19 41 for the sfo nanoparticles the bands at 411 and 540 cm 1 were ascribed to the ofeo bending vibration and feo stretching vibrations respectively resulting from the feo6 octahedral unit of sfo in addition smo stretching vibration was originated from the smo6 octahedral unit of sfo and observed at the same positions as these bands the mentioned bands were characteristics of the feo6 groups in the perovskite compounds 50 for the composite materials the bands related to smfeo3 and tct were observed with some shifts confirming the successful synthesis of composite materials x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was introduced to determine the surface chemical composition of sfo tct 10 based on the xps survey spectra fig 3a the composite material mainly contained sm fe o c and ti demonstrating its successful synthesis fig 3b f show the high resolution xps spectra of sm 3d fe 2p o 1s c 1s and ti 2p respectively the two peaks at 1082 6 and 1109 9 ev were assigned to sm3 3d5 2 and 3d3 2 of the sfo nanoparticles respectively 51 52 in fig 3c the major peaks at 710 1 and 723 0 ev were assigned to fe3 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively as well as the satellite peaks at 716 3 and 730 0 ev 51 52 the o 1s peak could be fitted to three characteristic peaks at 528 4 530 2 and 531 7 ev corresponding to the mo hydroxyl bonding and adsorbed h2o respectively 53 the c 1s spectrum of the sfo tct 10 showed four peaks at 282 8 284 4 286 2 and 288 7 which were assigned to cti cc and co and o c o respectively in addition the binding energies at 455 3 458 4 460 2 and 464 1 ev were corresponded to tic 2p3 2 tio 2p3 2 tic 2p1 2 and tio 2p1 2 respectively the morphology of the sfo tct and sfo tct composite materials was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem as shown in fig 4 sem image revealed small size rod like particles with some aggregation for sfo 54 the pure tct is a lamellar material stacked by nanosheets with a thickness of 60 80 nm 19 55 sem images of sfo tct 10 demonstrated that the sfo nanoparticles were loaded uniformly on the tct layers and interlayers also sem images of sfo tct 10 confirmed the sfo nanoparticles maintained their morphology after coupling with tct but their size decreased significantly furthermore sfo tct 25 and sfo tct 50 showed similar morphology to sfo tct 10 revealing the loading of sfo nanoparticles on the tct layers and interlayers fig s2 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds mapping of sfo nanoparticles and sfo tct 10 were performed to analyze the elemental compositions fig s3 and fig 4 for sfo nanoparticles sm fe and o signals were found without any impurity fig s4 while for sfo tct 10 sm fe o ti and c signals were observed which confirmed the successful synthesis of materials according to reported results the signals for sm fe and o were spread homogeneously over the tct layers transmission electron microscopy tem high resolution tem hr tem and selected area electron diffraction saed were conducted to study the crystal structure and morphology of sfo tct 10 as shown in fig 5a c the small size sfo nanoparticles 6 9 nm were loaded on the tct layers sem and tem confirmed the successful synthesis of sfo tct 10 and the size of sfo nanoparticles decreased significantly furthermore hr tem fig 5d e showed d spacing fringes of 0 38 and 0 27 nm corresponding to the lattice fringes of the 101 and 121 crystal planes of sfo 22 respectively in addition the d spacing fringes of 0 22 nm were observed which are related to the lattice fringes of the 002 plane of tct 19 fig 5d these results confirm the successful synthesis of composite material the saed pattern of the composite material was also obtained during hr tem analysis fig 5f the polymorphic discrete rings showed that the crystals were oriented in several directions and the composite was polycrystalline the weight ratio of sfo and tct in the composite materials was analyzed using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the analysis data are presented in table s2 according to results the weight ratio of tct in sfo tct 10 sfo tct 25 and sfo tct 50 was 8 20 27 8 and 45 0 respectively the surface area and porosity of materials play a significant role in their catalytic activities fig 6a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of tct sfo and sfo tct 10 composite material all samples revealed a type iv isotherm with an h3 hysteresis loop which indicated the mesoporous structure of all samples compared to sfo and tct the composite material showed higher porosity table s3 lists the specific surface area average pore size and pore volume of the samples the specific surface area of the samples was calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method as 4 6 7 6 and 11 6 m2 g 1 for sfo tct and sfo tct 10 respectively the surface area and mesoporous features of the composite material were significantly higher than the bare materials which increased the active sites on the composite material 3 2 evaluation of the catalytic performance 3 2 1 degradation of organic pollutants over the different catalysts the catalytic performance of the synthesized materials for degrading tc under the sono fenton process was investigated before the degradation reactions adsorption experiments were also operated under dark conditions for 30 min to achieve an equilibrium between the surface of the catalyst and the tc solution the adsorption data fig 7a showed that compared to pure sfo the sfo tct composite materials showed better adsorption efficiency towards tc in addition the adsorption efficiency of catalysts was improved by increasing the amount of tct 56 indeed the introduction of tct increased the specific surface area and active sites of the composite material compared to sfo nanoparticles according to fig 7a and b the composite materials showed high efficiency in degrading tc compared to the bare tct and sfo nanoparticles among the composite materials sfo tct 10 showed the excellent performance by degrading 99 of the tc solution within 30 min according to fig 7a the degradation efficiency of the composite materials was decreased by increasing the amount of tct sfo tct 50 showed the lowest efficiency 70 for the degradation of tc in composite materials based on mxene the introduction of the mxene could markedly increase the absorption of light and increase the photo sonocatalytic performance of the composite materials by assisting the charge transfer and restrain the recombination of h e pairs and lengthen the carrier lifetime noticeably an excess of ti3c2tx nanosheets could cause negative influence on these catalytic reactions which should be due to the light shielding effect the agglomeration of sfo nanoparticles and the complete encasing of tct layers with sfo nanoparticles which hinder the formation of heterojunctions and decrease the generation of reactive oxygen species thus the control over the ratio of tct to metal oxide is vital to attain optimal catalytic activity of these composite materials 19 35 36 39 44 46 furthermore the catalytic performance of the synthesized materials was evaluated for degrading tc under the sonocatalytic process the results revealed the efficiency of 54 58 67 59 and 64 for sfo tct sfo tct 10 sfo tct 25 and sfo tct 50 respectively within 30 min similar to the sono fenton process the composite materials showed higher efficiency for the sonodegradation of tc compared to the bare tct and sfo nanoparticles on the other hand all materials showed lower efficiency than the sono fenton catalytic process in general sfo tct composite materials contain surface fe iii fe ii that undergoes a reversible redox reaction and catalyzes the transformation of h2o2 to free radicals 43 in these systems the generation of hydroxyl radicals can be accelerated indicating that the thermal decomposition of h2o2 in the cavitation bubbles increases the formation of reactive radicals 15 57 the kinetics of degradation of tc with all the catalysts under the sono and sono fenton processes was studied using a pseudo first order model and the data was inserted in table s4 interestingly sfo tct 10 showed the highest rate constant 0 096 min 1 under the sono fenton process which was enhanced significantly compared to the tct 0 012 min 1 and sfo nanoparticles 0 013 min 1 similarly cheng et al 43 reported sono fenton degradation of mb by mnfe2o4 biochar with a rate constant of 0 09 min 1 and efficiency of 100 within 20 min yang et al 58 reported photo fenton degradation of tc by feni ldh ti3c2 with the efficiency of 94 7 and a rate constant of 0 015 min 1 within 90 min tan et al 2021 reported the photodegradation of tc by boc ti3c2 1 composite material with a rate constant of 0 052 mg 1 l min 1 and degradation efficiency of 81 in 120 min ha et al 59 assessed ag ag2s bioi composite material with a rate constant of 0 062 min 1 and an efficiency of 99 for the photodegradation of tc in 60 min considering that degradation of pollutants especially tc with sono fenton was rarely studied the efficiency of sfo tct 10 catalyst was compared with recently reported similar studies the details of degradation process is inserted in table 1 7 15 58 60 63 according to table 1 the sfo tct 10 showed excellent efficiency for the degradation of tc in a short time and using low concentration of hydrogen peroxide compared to reported catalysts 3 2 2 effect of different parameters several concentrations of h2o2 0 5 1 2 or 3 mm were used to determine its effect on the degradation of tc by the sfo tct 10 catalyst in the sono fenton process the hydrogen peroxide concentration directly affects the generation of active radicals especially hydroxyl radicals as shown in fig 8a the mineralization efficiency was improved from 89 to 99 by increasing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide from 0 5 to 2 mm on the other hand the degradation efficiency of the system showed no further improvement at higher h2o2 concentrations 3 mm an excessive amount of hydrogen peroxide will quench the already generated oh to produce hydroperoxyl radicals ooh which can consume oh and decrease the system efficiency 47 58 the catalyst dosage is an essential factor with a positive effect of increasing the number of active sites available for catalytic reactions different amounts of sfo tct 10 catalyst 0 3 0 5 0 7 or 0 9 mg l 1 were used to investigate the effect of the catalyst dosage on the degradation of tc in the sono fenton process as shown in fig 8b the degradation efficiency increased from 63 to 99 with the increasing amount of catalyst from 0 3 to 0 5 g l 1 owing to more significant amount of catalyst and higher surface area on the other hand an increase in the amount of catalyst from 0 5 to 0 7 and 0 9 g l 1 decreased the degradation efficiency from 99 to 77 and 71 respectively at a higher catalyst dosage the agglomeration and sedimentation of the catalyst occurred which decreased the interfacial area between the catalyst and reaction solution reduced the number of active sites and ultrasound scattering inhibiting the transfer of ultrasound waves 65 66 the initial concentration of pollutants is an essential factor affecting the degradation efficiency of a catalyst this study examined the efficiency of sfo tct 10 for the degradation of tc solution with an initial concentration of 1 5 7 and 10 mg l 1 under the sono fenton process the catalyst degraded completely the tc solution with concentration of 1 mg l 1 in 10 min and with concentration of 5 and 7 mg l 1 in 20 min according to the results the catalyst degraded the tc solution with low concentrations in a short time fig 8c the catalytic efficiency of the sfo tct 10 composite material for degradation of tc was compared with the degradation of other organic pollutants such as smx as an antibiotic ibp and npx as anti inflammatory drugs under the sono fenton process under the same catalytic conditions the catalyst revealed lower efficiency of 20 17 and 10 for degradation of smx ibp and npx respectively fig 8d the physicochemical properties of pollutants significantly affect their degradation with catalyst under sono fenton catalytic process 67 previous reports demonstrated that the solution ph plays a vital role in the catalyst performance for degrading organic pollutants tc is often detected in the final effluents from wastewater treatment plants it can undergo protonation deprotonation reactions and present different ionic species based on the solution ph it is strongly polar and has three active groups with different pka values fig 9a the majority of tc presents as a positively charged state as tch3 at ph 3 30 while the noncharged state tch2 0 and the negatively charged form tch or tc2 are present at neutral and ph 7 68 respectively 57 68 69 over the ph range of 3 30 to 7 68 tc appears in a non biodegradable form 15 the synthesized catalyst must be efficient for the degradation of tc particularly in the ph range of 3 30 to 7 68 fig 9b shows the zeta potential result of sfo tct 10 at the ph range of 2 10 the point of zero charges for the catalyst was approximately 6 5 indicating it has a positive surface at ph 6 5 and a negative surface at ph 6 5 the sfo tct 10 was used to degrade tc solution with an initial ph of 2 10 under the sono fenton catalytic process the results are inserted in fig 9c the catalyst had good efficiency at ph 2 10 the best result was observed at ph 6 according to fig 8a and b at ph 3 30 the tc species were in form of tch3 and the catalyst was in a positively charged form because of repulsion between the same charge units the catalyst showed an efficiency of 73 which is the lowest amount at ph 6 the best interaction between the catalyst surface and tc molecules was observed which led to a degradation efficiency of 99 while for basic ph both the sfo tct 10 and the tc species were in the anionic forms and the degradation efficiency decreased significantly due to repulsion between units generally the catalyst showed good efficiency in wide ph range 3 2 3 proposed catalytic degradation mechanism the main active species during the sono fenton catalytic process was determined by radical trapping tests to examine the mechanism tba bq and nan3 were used as scavengers of oh o2 and 1o2 respectively according to the results in fig s4 in the presence of tba bq and nan3 the efficiency of sfo tct 10 decreased to 42 78 and 84 respectively showing that the oh played a critical role in degrading tc in this system 70 71 based on the obtained results fig 10 shows the possible catalytic mechanism for tc degradation few reports on combining ultrasound with fenton on tc degradation have been found 15 similar to reported results on mxene based composite materials the bare materials had different fermi energy ef but after their combination in sfo tct composite material a schottky junction was formed 19 56 72 sono fenton process is similar to the fenton reaction but also introduces ultrasound irradiation to improve the degradation of pollutant the ultrasound in heterogeneous fenton systems enhances the transformation of fe3 to fe2 with the decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of sfo tct to produce the oh and ho2 15 16 67 in fact ultrasonic cavitation forms light and hot spots the high wavelength light can excite the sfo tct catalyst to produce electron hole pairs on surface of sfo nps according to the sonoluminescence mechanism 39 73 75 in addition collapsing cavity bubbles in the solution generate high temperature hot spots that accelerate the pyrolysis of h2o2 to the production of oh on the surface of the catalyst 74 for degradation of tc with sfo tct under sono fenton process the following mechanism is suggested fig 10 the first pathway is heterogeneous fenton like catalytic mechanism in a typical fenton like reaction the commonly accepted mechanism is summarized as eqs 3 5 76 the second pathway follows sonocatalytic mechanism in which sfo tct absorbed ultrasound and then underwent charge separation eq 6 schottky junction could effectively promote the transfer of electrons on sfo to the tct surface in sfo tct catalyst eq 7 then the electrons captured by tct could not flow back into the conduction band of sfo thereby reducing carrier recombination in sfo tct catalyst 19 56 subsequently the transferred electrons on the tct surface reacted with h2o2 and dissolved o2 to produce oh and o2 eqs 8 and 9 according to eq 10 the active radical species ultimately degraded tc into co2 and h2o the mainly possible reactions for the degradation of tc with sfo tct were shown as following a fenton process 3 fe iii sfo tct h 2 o 2 fe ii sfo tct ho 2 h 4 fe iii sfo tct ho 2 h fe ii sfo tct o 2 2h 5 fe ii sfo tct h 2 o 2 fe iii sfo tct oh oh b ultrasound irradiation process 6 sfo tct under ultrasound irradiation sfo h e tct 7 sfo h e tct sfo h tct e 8 sfo h tct e h 2 o 2 sfo tct e oh oh 9 sfo h tct e o 2 sfo h tct o 2 10 oh o 2 tc degradation intermediates h 2 o co 2 3 2 4 mineralization efficiency and tc degradation pathway total organic carbon toc was applied to assess the mineralization of the tc while the degradation efficiency of sfo tct composite under sono fenton condition for tc was 99 after 30 min the toc removal in the same condition was 46 these results confirmed that the tc is degraded to intermediates during the degradation process liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms was used to identify by products of tc in this process the mass spectra of tc solution before and after sono fenton degradation are inserted in fig s5 the tc solution displays a main peak with m z 445 the peak became weaker during the ongoing catalytic degradation process while several new peaks appeared this confirms that tc was gradually degraded into smaller molecular intermediates based on the detected intermediate products and previous studies the pathways for tc degradation are proposed in fig 11 for pathway i tc molecules were demethylated to produce p1 m z 403 which was converted to simpler intermediates p3 m z 208 and p4 m z 102 by losing functional groups and ring opening reactions 77 for pathway ii intermediate product p5 m z 461 was formed through the hydroxylation reaction 77 79 subsequently p5 could be converted to p6 m z 375 by the demethylation reaction then further degradation leads to the dislodging of the functional groups opening rings and the generation of the simpler intermediates p7 m z 244 and p8 m z 122 in pathway iii at first intermediate p9 m z 427 was formed by losing hydroxyl group 77 78 80 then with demethylation and ring opening reactions it was converted to simple intermediate p12 m z 143 and finally the simple intermediate was decomposed to co2 and h2o and etc 3 2 5 stability and recyclability of catalyst stability and recyclability are the main factors of the environmental and economical application of the synthesized catalysts 59 consecutive recycling experiments for degradation of tc with sfo tct 10 catalyst under the sono fenton process were carried out the efficiency of the catalyst decreased from 99 to 93 with a negligible decrease after three consecutive cycles fig s6a similar to the literature 32 63 the xrd pattern and tem image of the recycled catalyst are inserted in fig s6b and c the xrd pattern of the recycled catalyst sfo tct 10 matched well with the xrd pattern of the fresh catalyst according to tem image of recycled catalyst sfo nanoparticles were loaded on tct layers similar to the fresh composite material and this confirmed the stability of catalyst during degradation process furthermore the tc solution after degradation with catalyst was analyzed with icp oes to check the leaching of fe and ti elements of catalyst during sono fenton degradation process the results revealed little amount of leaching as 0 13 mg l 1 and 0 73 mg l 1 for ti and fe respectively which confirmed the stability of the catalyst 4 conclusion novel smfeo3 ti3c2tx sfo tct composite materials were synthesized using sfo nanoparticles and tct mxene fe sem and tem showed that rod like sfo nanoparticles were loaded uniformly on the tct layers and interlayers the introduction of tct prevented the aggregation of sfo nanoparticles and increased the surface area in the composite materials the efficiency of composite materials was investigated in sonocatalytic and sono fenton catalytic systems and their performance was compared with sfo nanoparticles and tct the optimal catalyst sfo tct 10 revealed an excellent efficiency of 99 in 30 min under sono fenton process for tc degradation the degradation process followed pseudo first order kinetic recording a relatively high reaction rate 0 096 min 1 compared with sonocatalytic process 0 015 min 1 the excellent catalytic activity should be attributed to the synergistic effect of sono fenton reactions also the schottky junction formed by sfo and tct in addition to the excellent catalytic activity sfo tct 10 showed high stability and reusability for the degradation of tc this work provides new insights into the development of mxene based materials as efficient sono fenton catalysts for the degradation of tc credit authorship contribution statement farzaneh mahmoudi conceptualization preparation methodology data curation writing
