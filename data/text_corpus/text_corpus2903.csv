14515,a novel and magnetic hierarchical porous adsorbent functionalized by coating α fe2o3 fe3o4 on bamboo biochar hpa fe c b is prepared and tested for the removal of phosphorus from aqueous solutions the effect of phosphorus p concentration temperature ph adsorbent grain size adsorbent dosage and contact time on phosphorus adsorption is investigated results show that by increasing the initial concentration from 2 to 10 mg p l the phosphorus adsorption capacity of hpa fe c b d g 0 11 mm and contact time 12 h increases from 0 20 to 2 46 2 64 and 2 81 mg p g and the phosphorus removal is reduced from 99 2 to 49 2 wt 99 4 52 8 wt and 98 8 55 4 wt at temperature of 25 35 and 45 c respectively the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the unpulverized hpa fe c b d g 1 59 mm is from 0 18 to 0 66 mg p g in the concentration range of 2 10 mg p l respectively which is in the same order of magnitude as that of pulverized hpa fe c b or nano size iron adsorbents reported in the literature kinetic and equilibrium adsorption results fitted well by the intra particle diffusion and the langmuir adsorption isotherm respectively keywords bamboo biochar hierarchical porous structure adsorption phosphorus nano iron oxides 1 introduction phosphorus is an essential primary macronutrient in the water environment soluble phosphor in water exists mainly in three forms i e ortho poly and organic phosphate ortho phosphate includes mainly h3po4 h2po4 2 hpo4 and po4 3 which is responsible for stimulating the growth of aquatic macro and microorganisms and leads to eutrophication 1 2 the phosphate could be easily adsorbed by many plants including algae and react with specific chemicals such as ferric lime and alum salts commonly used in wastewater treatment systems 3 the phosphate concentration in municipal sewage is in the range of 4 15 mg p l and exceeds 10 mg p l in industrial wastewaters 4 therefore it is necessary to reduce phosphate in wastewater prior to discharge to natural water bodies chemical precipitation and biological wastewater treatment are the two traditional phosphorus removal practices but problems such as costs and availability of carbon source remain adsorption is one of the most widely accepted method for phosphorus removal from dilute aqueous solutions due to high efficiency low cost simple operation and flexibility in application 4 6 since the early publication on phosphate adsorption onto hydrous solids by huang 7 there have been many studies on the synthesis and testing of different adsorbents for phosphate removal loganathan et al have conducted a comprehensive review on phosphate removal from water wastewater by different methods including adsorption 8 most of the adsorbents studied are classified into ones with or without hematite and those single or multiple multivalent valent metal oxides hydroxides composites 9 12 in recent years iron oxides such as fe2o3 fe3o4 feooh and granular ferric hydroxide gfh have been applied intensively to environmental pollution remediation the magnetic property of material such as fe3o4 enables the separation of sorbent by magnet 13 14 however the separation of such nanomaterials from solution after water treatment is difficult and extremely expensive magnetic separation of nanoparticle size 15 nm might be ineffective in that the residual nanoparticles in the effluent might impose ecotoxicity on the receiving water 3 14 15 hence much effort has been made to seek best performing adsorbents for the removal of phosphorus from wastewater the presence of pit membranes in the hierarchical porous structure of bamboo wood increases the three dimensional network connectivity substantially pre treatment by immersion in boiled agent can improve post impregnation performance and network connectivity of bamboo biochar in the present work a novel adsorbent with magnetic hierarchical porous structure functionalized by coating α fe2o3 fe3o4 onto bamboo biochar hpa fe c b is synthesized and applied to phosphorus removal from water factors such as contact time initial phosphorus concentration solution ph temperature and dosage and grain size of hpa fe c b that may affect phosphate removal are studied the kinetics and equilibrium adsorption are characterized 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization 2 1 1 adsorbent preparation dried bamboo wood

structural feature and chemical composition of hpa fe c b before and after phosphorus adsorption are observed and assessed using fe sem and eds jem 6380lv jeol japan respectively 2 2 batch sorption experiments 2 2 1 experiments on parameters affecting phosphorus adsorption the batch phosphorus adsorption experiments are conducted as follows a given amount of hpa fe c b adsorbent is weighted and dispersed in a series of 100 ml plastic centrifuge tubes containing 50 ml of phosphate solution at concentration of 2 50 mg p l all suspension samples are shaken 25 35 or 45 c to reach adsorption equilibrium at a speed of 150 strokes per min for two days after centrifugation at a speed of 4000 rpm for 5 min and filtration with 0 22 μm micro pore membrane the filtrate is collected and residual phosphorus concentration measured by the molybdenum blue method using a lambda 25 uv vis spectrophotometer at a detecting wavelength of 700 nm the effect of ph 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 and 10 0 on phosphate adsorption is studied at initial phosphate concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l at 25 c to study the effect of initial phosphate concentration on adsorption 9 solutions containing initial phosphate concentrations of 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 mg p l are prepared in the presence of 10 g l hpa fe c b at ph 3 and 25 c the magnetization intensity of hpa fe c b was measured as a function of magnetic field strength by using vibrating sample magnetometer versalab quantum design usa results show marked magnetic characteristics of the adsorbent fig s6 note that 10 g l of adsorbent only occupied 10 of the total reactor volume fig s7 after 5 min of magnetic separation operation the adsorbent material was effectively separated fig s7 experiment on the effect of adsorbent dosage is conducted with adsorbent dosage from 0 1 to 1 0 g 50 ml or 2 10 g l in 10 increments of 0 1 g 50 ml or 2 g l and constant phosphorus concentration of 5 mg l at 25 c experiment to study the effect of grain size is carried out in five adsorbent samples namely unpulverized chip 1 59 mm pulverized powder with different size of 0 58 0 33 0 21 0 16 and 0 11 mm at 25 c and initial phosphate concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l respectively 2 2 2 kinetics phosphorus adsorption experiments the adsorption kinetics is studied with a series of 100 ml plastic centrifuge tubes containing 0 5 g of hpa fe c b in 50 ml of phosphorus solution at initial concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l individually and constant ph 3 the centrifuge tubes are vigorously mixed at speed of 150 rpm at different time intervals 5 10 15 20 30 60 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 540 720 1080 1440 and 2880 min samples are taken and filtered and the filtrates are collected for the analysis of residual phosphorus concentration 2 2 3 equilibrium phosphorus adsorption experiments a series of phosphorus solutions containing initial concentration of 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 mg p l are employed for equilibrium adsorption experiments all solutions contain 10 g l hpa fe c b with ph being adjusted to 3 all solid solution mixtures are mixed over a shaker at constant temperature of 25 35 and 45 c respectively procedures for the measurement of residual phosphorus concentration follow that of kinetics experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the weight percent of c h o n and s is 25 18 25 85 1 02 1 49 25 61 26 08 0 85 0 99 and 0 18 0 24 respectively the fe content is 45 51 47 02 and the bet surface area is 198 1 m2 g x ray diffraction xrd technique is employed to characterize the crystalline structure of hpa fe c b adsorbent before and after phosphorus removal experiments results show that magnetite hematite and carbon are present on the hpa fe c b surface fig 1 the location and intensity of xrd peaks match perfectly three reference peaks the peaks at 2θ of 30 22 35 61 57 50 and 62 42 correspond to fe3o4 magnetite reference code 01 089 0688 the peaks at 2θ of 24 11 33 13 35 61 40 85 49 44 54 04 62 42 and 63 98 belong to α fe2o3 hematite reference code 00 005 0637 and the peaks at 2θ of 42 82 44 60 50 38 and 54 23 are identified as carbon graphite reference code 00 001 0646 according to fig 1 the carbonized bamboo hpa fe c b before and after phosphorus adsorption are indistinguishable results of quantitative phase analysis of xrd diffraction profile by the rietveld method show that hpa fe c b consists of 59 78 fe3o4 and 40 22 α fe2o3 fig 2 shows the ft ir pattern of hpa fe c b before and after phosphorus adsorption which reveals a fe o peak at 469 47 cm 1 after phosphorus adsorption the po4 3 peaks due to o p o vibration band appear around 869 92 812 71 and 767 76 cm 1 and due to the p o stretching are seen around 447 40 474 27 cm 1 the fe sem pattern of hpa fe c b clearly shows the presence of the original hierarchical porous framework of bamboo wood with three distinct pores a macropores formed on the vessels at diameter around 50 75 μm b mesopores formed on parenchyma cells at diameter around 10 30 μm and fibres at diameter around 1 15 μm c micropores originated from the capillary walls and parenchyma cells that provide plentiful pits at 2 0 289 0 nm fig 3 the total pore volume 0 12 cm3 g is similar to that of biochar prepared from soybeans 0 19 cm3 g and larger than biochars produced from corn stalks 0 09 cm3 g rice stalks 0 05 cm3 g poultry manure 0 09 cm3 g cattle manure 0 08 cm3 g and pig manure 0 05 cm3 g respectively 13 the eds spectrum fig 4 is obtained for the unpulverized hpa fe c b exposed to high phosphate concentration 100 mg p l the eds spectrum of hpa fe c b shows that the characteristic peak of phosphorus appears at 2 01 kev after phosphorus adsorption the phosphorus adsorption capacity is estimated at 0 82 wt based on the sem eds peak area ratio it also confirms that the phosphorus ion 0 82 wt is associated with the hpa fe c b surface 3 2 effect of adsorption variables 3 2 1 initial phosphorus concentration and temperature fig 5 shows the phosphorus adsorption a and the percent removal b as a function of equilibrium and initial phosphorus concentration respectively at different temperature temperature has an insignificant effect on phosphorus adsorption with increasing phosphorus concentration from 2 to 50 mg p l the maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity increases from 0 20 to 2 46 to 2 62 and to 2 81 mg p g at 25 35 and 45 c respectively on the contrary the percent removal reduces from 99 2 to 49 2 from 99 4 to 52 8 and 98 8 56 2 wt at 25 35 and 45 c respectively results clearly indicate the exothermal nature of phosphorus adsorption onto hpa fe c b adsorbent 3 2 2 solution ph fig 6 shows the effect of final ph on phosphorus adsorption the ph has significant effect on phosphorus adsorption due mostly to the ph dependent phosphate speciation and the surface charge of the hpa fe c b 11 the phosphorus adsorption capacity and percent removal increases with increase in ph to a maximum level at ph 3 then slightly decreases with further increase in ph the maximum adsorption capacity and the corresponding percent removal are 0 20 mg g 99 21 0 49 mg g 97 50 and 0 84 mg g 84 44 at initial phosphorus concentration of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively this pattern is the same as that reported for other adsorbents 16 17 dihydrogen phosphate h2po4 monohydrogen phosphate hpo4 2 and phosphate po4 3 are major inorganic phosphorus species in aqueous solution surface charge can affect the adsorption of phosphate species which again is influenced by solution ph the phpzc of hpa fe c b bamboo biochar α fe2o3 and fe3o4 are 3 1 2 3 5 2 and 5 7 respectively the phpzc of hpa fe c b is close to literature data 17 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle prepared via carbodiimide activation has a phpzc of 6 7 18 20 the phpzc ca 3 1 of hpa fe c b is between that of fe3o4 and fe2o3 at ph phpzc ca 3 1 h2po4 is the predominant species and hpa fe c b is positively charged which favours electrostatic attraction of anions such as h2po4 17 18 although it must be mentioned that electrostatic interaction may play a role on ion adsorption other process such as formation of specific chemical bonds between anions and similarly charged surface can occur huang 7 studied phosphate adsorption on γ al2o3 surface and reported significant adsorption of anionic phosphate ions onto negatively charge hydrous solid surface the surface acidity of biochar can be visualized as derived from the protonation deprotonation equilibrium of surface hydroxy groups that is upon hydration the surface is occupied by oh functional group which undergoes protonation and deprotonation reaction eqs 1 2 7 25 1 soh h soh2 1 kint a1 2 soh so h kint a2 wheresoh2 soh and so are positively neutral and negatively charged surface hydroxy species respectively kint a1 and kint a2 are the intrinsic surface acidity constants based on zeta potential measurement as a function of ph it is possible to calculate the acidity constant of hpa fe c b 7 25 result shows that the intrinsic acidity constants are 1 5 and 4 7 for pkint a1 and pkint a2 respectively thus at ph 1 5 the dominant surface functional group of hpa fe c b is soh2 at 1 5 ph 4 7 soh is the dominant hydroxy species of hpa fe c b at ph 4 7 so dominates the active surface site on hpa fe c b in the ph range of significant phosphate adsorption h2po4 is the major species therefore one can expect the following reactions take place between the biochar surface and the phosphate species eqs 3 4 3 soh2 h2po4 spo4h2 h2o 4 soh h2po4 spo4h h2o significant phosphate adsorption on soh2 or soh site takes place at 1 0 ph 3 1 eq 3 or 1 5 ph 4 7 eq 4 which results in the formation of mono dentate hpa fe c b h2po4 surface complex intuitively the negatively charged site s o will repel anionic phosphate species at high ph i e 4 7 ph 7 0 eq 5 5 so h2po4 spo4 2 h2o not run in the present study nonetheless the regeneration of phosphate laden hpa fe c b adsorbent can be readily achieved by acid ph 1 5 or alkaline ph 8 5 stripping as shown in fig 7 the durability of the hpa fe c b adsorbent is not assessed specifically in the present study ultimately the individual material such as magnetite might be lost in multiple phosphate adsorption cycles at acidic ph however hematite nanoparticles are formed at high temperature of 600 c and might be anodized under acidic condition which should enhance its stability in lieu of dissolution 3 2 3 adsorbent dose the phosphorus adsorption onto the hpa fe c b adsorbent is studied by varying adsorbent dose 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 g in 50 ml phosphorus solution or 2 4 6 7 8 10 12 14 16 18 and 20 g l and 3 initial phosphorus concentrations 2 5 and 10 mg p l while keeping constant the initial ph sorbent grain size and temperature fig 7 results show that the phosphorus adsorption capacity decreases from 0 87 to 0 10 mg p g from 1 66 to 0 25 mg p g and from 1 84 to 0 44 mg p g at initial phosphate concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l respectively the corresponding phosphorus removal percent average of three independent runs increases from 86 6 to 99 8 wt 66 5 99 9 wt and 36 8 88 8 wt at adsorbent dose of 2 10 and 20 g l respectively increase in phosphate adsorption with increase in adsorbent dosage can be attributed to increase in adsorbent surface adsorption site the phosphorus capacity reaches a plateau at adsorbent dosage of 10 g l obviously due to the depletion of phosphate species in the solution 13 3 2 4 adsorbent grain size six adsorbent grain sizes 1 59 0 58 0 33 0 21 0 16 and 0 11 mm three types of adsorbent carbonized bamboo wood the saw dust of bamboo wood and α fe2o3 powder three initial phosphorus concentrations 2 5 10 mg l at initial ph 3 and 25 c are studied fig 8 summarizes the phosphorus adsorption capacity as a function of grain size generally the smaller grain size the greater specific surface area therefore it is possible to increase the adsorption capacity and percent removal by manipulating the grain size however smaller particles tend to clump together during adsorption process which renders it difficult for solid water separation after application obviously adsorbents with large grain size but have high total surface area are ideal for achieving high adsorption efficiency and enhancing application potential in our study pulverizing hpa fe c b only results in slight increase in bet surface area the hierarchical porous microstructure of unpulverized hpa fe c b is composed of macropores 65 1 mesopores 31 7 and micropores 3 2 with pore size in the range of 0 8 87 000 nm macropores and mesopores are the major structures of the hierarchical porous microstructure of hpa fe c b further grinding of hpa fe c b does not increase the specific surface area fig 8 shows that the phosphorus adsorption capacity is related to the specific surface areas but not the grain size especially at high initial phosphorus concentration i e 5 and 10 mg p l the phosphorus adsorption capacity and removal percentage of unpulverized hpa fe c b d g 1 59 mm are 0 18 mg p g 87 9 0 36 mg p g 71 8 and 0 66 mg p g 66 0 at initial phosphorus concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg l respectively for pulverized hpa fe c b the smaller grain size the greater the bet specific surface area and thus the greater absorption capacity for pulverized hpa fe c b with geometric mean adsorbent grain size of 0 11 mm the maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity percent removal is 0 20 mg p g 97 7 0 48 mg p g 96 9 0 85 mg p g 85 1 at the initial phosphorus concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l respectively which is close to that of unpulverized adsorbents the result also indicates that the unpulverized hpa fe c b with intrinsic hierarchical porous microstructure has higher phosphorus adsorption capacity and removal percentage than charcoal made of bamboo wood d g 0 11 mm sawdust of bamboo wood d g 1 59 mm and α fe2o3 powder at selected initial total phosphorus concentrations obviously the unique hierarchical porous microstructure of hpa fe c b endowed from the intrinsic template of bamboo wood has vast macropores and mesopores that contribute to fast phosphorus adsorption hence hpa fe c b can still have favourable phosphorus adsorption capacity without further grinding table 1 lists the phosphorus adsorption capacity of hpa fe c b and other iron fe2 fe3 oxides adsorbents reported in the literature the result indicates that hpa fe c b is among the best adsorbent for phosphorus adsorption from aqueous solution zhu et al 16 have reported phosphorus adsorption capacity of pbgc fe c at 0 18 and 0 66 mg g at initial phosphorus concentration of 2 and 10 mg l respectively barber 21 study the phosphorus adsorption capacity of natural and synthetic magnetite under static conditions the naturally occurring magnetite bet asf 0 13 m2 g particle size 0 25 mm is obtained from the stanford university research mineral collection and the synthetic magnetite bet asf 1 74 m2 g particle size 0 25 mm is purchased from aldrich chemical company the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the natural and synthetic magnetite at ph 7 and initial phosphorus concentration of 0 31 46 46 mg l are 0 42 and 1 06 mg g respectively 21 choi et al 22 study phosphorus adsorption by synthetic magnetite mio at ph 4 and the initial phosphorus concentration of 200 mg l and report adsorption capacity of 2 18 mg g colombo et al 23 reported phosphate adsorption capacity of hematite in the range of 0 66 1 13 mg g and attribute the variation in adsorption capacity to crystal size and morphology specific surface area 16 23 m2 g grain size from 70 130 nm to 45 220 nm daou et al 27 and pan et al 28 reported phosphorus adsorption capacity of 0 5 3 5 and 3 2 mg g for nano and micro sized magnetite at ph 3 and ph 7 respectively table 1 also shows that the unpulverized hpa fe c b adsorbent has average phosphorus adsorption capacity similar to those of fine particles or nanoparticles of iron oxides reported in the literature 21 28 3 3 adsorption kinetics fig 9 shows the effect of the contact time on phosphate adsorption capacity and surface coverage of hpa fe c b the phosphorus adsorption capacity mg p g and the surface coverage θ increase rapidly with contact time until gradually approaching the equilibrium state which is due to the continuous decease in the driving force i e difference between equilibrium and temporal adsorption density q e q t the phosphorus adsorption capacity remains almost constant after 1 12 and 18 h at 25 c ph 3 and initial concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l respectively phosphorus adsorption takes place rapidly at the onset of adsorption experiment due to adsorption onto macropores and mesoporoes ionic radius of phosphate 5 3 å 29 further adsorption onto mesopores and micropores needs more energy and contact time result clearly confirms strong and rapid interactions between phosphate and hpa fe c b especially at low phosphorus concentrations kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments provide information necessary for the design and operation of phosphate removal process in water wastewater treatment different kinetic model may yield different parameter estimations 30 in this study four different classical kinetic models namely the pseudo first order fig s1 the modified pseudo first order fig s2 the pseudo second order fig s3 the elovich fig s4 and the intra particle diffusion model fig 10 are used to fit the experimental data results show that the intra particle diffusion model fits best the kinetic data according to the intra particle diffusion model a plot of q t against t 1 2 should give a straight line with slope k d and intercept c 31 32 2 that is eq 6 6 q t k d t 1 2 c where k d is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min1 2 and c is a constant the c value is related to the thickness of adsorption boundary layer therefore the larger the c the greater boundary layer effect as seen in table 2 the correlation coefficients r 2 r pearson correlation coefficient for phosphorus adsorption onto the hpa fe c b is 0 9453 0 9971 0 9788 0 9987 the results show that the intra particle diffusion kinetic model describes the experimental data well results table 2 fig 10 show three distinct adsorption stages the first stage is a rapid adsorption process occurring at t 5 4 5 min1 2 or t 20 min in which phosphate adsorbs on the macropores surface readily adsorption on the mesopores surface takes place next at t 5 of 4 5 26 8 min1 2 or t 20 722 min finally adsorption proceeds to occupy the micropores surface at t 5 26 8 min1 2 or t 722 min table 2 gives k d c r 2 and r of data fitting according to the intra particle diffusion model table s1 summarizes the variables of kinetic models i e k 1 k 2 a e b e and q e at different initial phosphorus concentrations 3 4 adsorption isotherm to optimize the design of an adsorption system for the adsorption of phosphorus from water wastewater using hpa fe c b adsorbent it is important to establish the most appropriate adsorption isotherm in this study the equilibrium adsorption data are fitted with langmuir and fruendlich adsorption isotherms at temperature 25 35 and 45 c respectively fig s5 and table s2 results show langmuir adsorption isotherm has larger r 2 and r than that of the fruendlich adsorption isotherm the langmuir adsorption isotherm has the following linearized equation eq 7 7 ce q e 1 q m k l c e q m where ce is the equilibrium phosphorus concentration mg l q m is the monolayer adsorption capacity mg g and kl is the adsorption constant l mol a plot of c e q e versus c e fig 11 yields q m and k l from the slope and intercept of the linear plot table 3 the standard free energy δg kj mol enthalpy δh kj mol and entropy δs kj mol k of the adsorption process can be calculated from kl and temperature by the following equation eq 8 8 δg rtlnk l δh tδs where r is the gas constant 8 3145 j mol k or 1 9863 cal mol k k l is the langmuir adsorption constant m 1 l mol fig 11 shows the linearized plot of langmuir adsorption isotherm at 25 35 and 45 c respectively it is interesting to note that the adsorption isotherm is best fitted with the linearized langmuir adsorption isotherm in three distinct regions with respect to equilibrium phosphorous concentrations i e region 1 from 0 to 15 mg p l region 2 from 15 to 30 mg p l and region 3 from 30 to 50 mg p l conformation of the experimental data with langmuir adsorption isotherm model with high r 2 r value indicates the homogeneous nature of the adsorbent surface raising the temperature improves the adsorption capacity from 2 85 mg g at 25 c to 2 89 mg g at 35 c and to 3 08 mg g at 45 c k l value in region 1 2 and 3 indicates that the higher phosphorus concentration the larger adsorption energy the calculated δg value is 29 9 23 6 and 22 3 kj mol or 7 1 5 6 and 5 3 kcal mol for region 1 adsorption 30 5 24 0 and 23 7 kj mol or 7 5 5 9 and 5 8 kcal mol for region 2 adsorption and 31 0 24 3 and 23 9 kj mol or 7 9 6 2 and 6 1 kcal mol for region 3 adsorption at 25 35 and 45 c respectively negative δg value indicates spontaneous nature of adsorption the δh value calculated is 26 0 20 6 and 18 4 kj mol or 6 2 4 9 and 4 4 kcal mol for the adsorption region 1 2 and 3 respectively the δs value calculated is 158 117 and 163 j mol k or 37 8 28 0 and 39 0 cal mol k for the adsorption region 1 2 and 3 respectively results of the thermodynamic analysis of equilibrium adsorption data are consistent with the kinetic aspects adsorption domain is consisted of three distinct regions namely region 1 2 and 3 with respect to filling the macropores the mesopores and the micropores respectively the change of enthalpy for all three regions are negative meaning the exothermic nature of the adsorption process the change of enthalpy negative value follows the order δh1 δh2 δh3 and the change of entropy also follows the same order δs1 δs3 δs2 respectively intuitively less energy is involved in phosphate ions adsorption onto the macropores and microspores greater entropy for phosphate ion adsorption onto the macroscpores and microposres indicate increase in the degree of organization of adsorbed anions i e phosphate ions are more disorganized in microposres than in macropores a dimensionless parameter r l that reflects the nature of adsorption is defined by the following equation eq 9 9 r l 1 1 k l c o where k l is the langmuir adsorption constant and c o is the initial phosphorus concentration mg l r l value reflects the trend of adsorption i e unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 favourable 0 r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 table 3 also shows r l value to be near zero which confirms favourable uptake of phosphorus 33 4 conclusions the hpa fe c b adsorbent can effectively remove phosphorus from aqueous solution the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the pulverized hpa fe c b adsorbent d g 0 11 mm at 25 c and ph 3 reaches equilibrium at 60 720 and 1080 min and initial phosphorus concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg l respectively the phosphorus adsorption capacity increases from 0 20 to 2 46 mg g to 2 62 mg g and then to 2 81 mg g at 25 c 35 c and 45 c respectively in the initial phosphorus concentration range of 2 50 mg l the optimal adsorption ph is 3 0 the maximal phosphorus removal is 99 2 97 5 and 84 4 at the initial phosphorus concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg l respectively the adsorption capacity of unpulverized hpa fe c b adsorbent d g 1 59 mm is 0 18 0 36 and 0 66 mg g at initial phosphorus concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg l respectively the phosphorus adsorption capacity of hpa fe c b is greater than nano and micro sized of iron oxides

14515,a novel and magnetic hierarchical porous adsorbent functionalized by coating α fe2o3 fe3o4 on bamboo biochar hpa fe c b is prepared and tested for the removal of phosphorus from aqueous solutions the effect of phosphorus p concentration temperature ph adsorbent grain size adsorbent dosage and contact time on phosphorus adsorption is investigated results show that by increasing the initial concentration from 2 to 10 mg p l the phosphorus adsorption capacity of hpa fe c b d g 0 11 mm and contact time 12 h increases from 0 20 to 2 46 2 64 and 2 81 mg p g and the phosphorus removal is reduced from 99 2 to 49 2 wt 99 4 52 8 wt and 98 8 55 4 wt at temperature of 25 35 and 45 c respectively the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the unpulverized hpa fe c b d g 1 59 mm is from 0 18 to 0 66 mg p g in the concentration range of 2 10 mg p l respectively which is in the same order of magnitude as that of pulverized hpa fe c b or nano size iron adsorbents reported in the literature kinetic and equilibrium adsorption results fitted well by the intra particle diffusion and the langmuir adsorption isotherm respectively keywords bamboo biochar hierarchical porous structure adsorption phosphorus nano iron oxides 1 introduction phosphorus is an essential primary macronutrient in the water environment soluble phosphor in water exists mainly in three forms i e ortho poly and organic phosphate ortho phosphate includes mainly h3po4 h2po4 2 hpo4 and po4 3 which is responsible for stimulating the growth of aquatic macro and microorganisms and leads to eutrophication 1 2 the phosphate could be easily adsorbed by many plants including algae and react with specific chemicals such as ferric lime and alum salts commonly used in wastewater treatment systems 3 the phosphate concentration in municipal sewage is in the range of 4 15 mg p l and exceeds 10 mg p l in industrial wastewaters 4 therefore it is necessary to reduce phosphate in wastewater prior to discharge to natural water bodies chemical precipitation and biological wastewater treatment are the two traditional phosphorus removal practices but problems such as costs and availability of carbon source remain adsorption is one of the most widely accepted method for phosphorus removal from dilute aqueous solutions due to high efficiency low cost simple operation and flexibility in application 4 6 since the early publication on phosphate adsorption onto hydrous solids by huang 7 there have been many studies on the synthesis and testing of different adsorbents for phosphate removal loganathan et al have conducted a comprehensive review on phosphate removal from water wastewater by different methods including adsorption 8 most of the adsorbents studied are classified into ones with or without hematite and those single or multiple multivalent valent metal oxides hydroxides composites 9 12 in recent years iron oxides such as fe2o3 fe3o4 feooh and granular ferric hydroxide gfh have been applied intensively to environmental pollution remediation the magnetic property of material such as fe3o4 enables the separation of sorbent by magnet 13 14 however the separation of such nanomaterials from solution after water treatment is difficult and extremely expensive magnetic separation of nanoparticle size 15 nm might be ineffective in that the residual nanoparticles in the effluent might impose ecotoxicity on the receiving water 3 14 15 hence much effort has been made to seek best performing adsorbents for the removal of phosphorus from wastewater the presence of pit membranes in the hierarchical porous structure of bamboo wood increases the three dimensional network connectivity substantially pre treatment by immersion in boiled agent can improve post impregnation performance and network connectivity of bamboo biochar in the present work a novel adsorbent with magnetic hierarchical porous structure functionalized by coating α fe2o3 fe3o4 onto bamboo biochar hpa fe c b is synthesized and applied to phosphorus removal from water factors such as contact time initial phosphorus concentration solution ph temperature and dosage and grain size of hpa fe c b that may affect phosphate removal are studied the kinetics and equilibrium adsorption are characterized 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization 2 1 1 adsorbent preparation dried bamboo wood

diffractometer using copper kα radiation at 40 kv and 40 ma phase identification of the hpa fe c b is identified based on hematite α fe2o3 reference code 00 005 0637 magnetite fe3o4 reference code 01 089 0688 and carbon graphite reference code 00 001 0646 ft ir spectra are obtained in kbr pellets with a thermo nicolet nexus 470 fourier transform spectrometer over wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 the structural feature and chemical composition of hpa fe c b before and after phosphorus adsorption are observed and assessed using fe sem and eds jem 6380lv jeol japan respectively 2 2 batch sorption experiments 2 2 1 experiments on parameters affecting phosphorus adsorption the batch phosphorus adsorption experiments are conducted as follows a given amount of hpa fe c b adsorbent is weighted and dispersed in a series of 100 ml plastic centrifuge tubes containing 50 ml of phosphate solution at concentration of 2 50 mg p l all suspension samples are shaken 25 35 or 45 c to reach adsorption equilibrium at a speed of 150 strokes per min for two days after centrifugation at a speed of 4000 rpm for 5 min and filtration with 0 22 μm micro pore membrane the filtrate is collected and residual phosphorus concentration measured by the molybdenum blue method using a lambda 25 uv vis spectrophotometer at a detecting wavelength of 700 nm the effect of ph 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 and 10 0 on phosphate adsorption is studied at initial phosphate concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l at 25 c to study the effect of initial phosphate concentration on adsorption 9 solutions containing initial phosphate concentrations of 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 mg p l are prepared in the presence of 10 g l hpa fe c b at ph 3 and 25 c the magnetization intensity of hpa fe c b was measured as a function of magnetic field strength by using vibrating sample magnetometer versalab quantum design usa results show marked magnetic characteristics of the adsorbent fig s6 note that 10 g l of adsorbent only occupied 10 of the total reactor volume fig s7 after 5 min of magnetic separation operation the adsorbent material was effectively separated fig s7 experiment on the effect of adsorbent dosage is conducted with adsorbent dosage from 0 1 to 1 0 g 50 ml or 2 10 g l in 10 increments of 0 1 g 50 ml or 2 g l and constant phosphorus concentration of 5 mg l at 25 c experiment to study the effect of grain size is carried out in five adsorbent samples namely unpulverized chip 1 59 mm pulverized powder with different size of 0 58 0 33 0 21 0 16 and 0 11 mm at 25 c and initial phosphate concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l respectively 2 2 2 kinetics phosphorus adsorption experiments the adsorption kinetics is studied with a series of 100 ml plastic centrifuge tubes containing 0 5 g of hpa fe c b in 50 ml of phosphorus solution at initial concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l individually and constant ph 3 the centrifuge tubes are vigorously mixed at speed of 150 rpm at different time intervals 5 10 15 20 30 60 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 540 720 1080 1440 and 2880 min samples are taken and filtered and the filtrates are collected for the analysis of residual phosphorus concentration 2 2 3 equilibrium phosphorus adsorption experiments a series of phosphorus solutions containing initial concentration of 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 mg p l are employed for equilibrium adsorption experiments all solutions contain 10 g l hpa fe c b with ph being adjusted to 3 all solid solution mixtures are mixed over a shaker at constant temperature of 25 35 and 45 c respectively procedures for the measurement of residual phosphorus concentration follow that of kinetics experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the weight percent of c h o n and s is 25 18 25 85 1 02 1 49 25 61 26 08 0 85 0 99 and 0 18 0 24 respectively the fe content is 45 51 47 02 and the bet surface area is 198 1 m2 g x ray diffraction xrd technique is employed to characterize the crystalline structure of hpa fe c b adsorbent before and after phosphorus removal experiments results show that magnetite hematite and carbon are present on the hpa fe c b surface fig 1 the location and intensity of xrd peaks match perfectly three reference peaks the peaks at 2θ of 30 22 35 61 57 50 and 62 42 correspond to fe3o4 magnetite reference code 01 089 0688 the peaks at 2θ of 24 11 33 13 35 61 40 85 49 44 54 04 62 42 and 63 98 belong to α fe2o3 hematite reference code 00 005 0637 and the peaks at 2θ of 42 82 44 60 50 38 and 54 23 are identified as carbon graphite reference code 00 001 0646 according to fig 1 the carbonized bamboo hpa fe c b before and after phosphorus adsorption are indistinguishable results of quantitative phase analysis of xrd diffraction profile by the rietveld method show that hpa fe c b consists of 59 78 fe3o4 and 40 22 α fe2o3 fig 2 shows the ft ir pattern of hpa fe c b before and after phosphorus adsorption which reveals a fe o peak at 469 47 cm 1 after phosphorus adsorption the po4 3 peaks due to o p o vibration band appear around 869 92 812 71 and 767 76 cm 1 and due to the p o stretching are seen around 447 40 474 27 cm 1 the fe sem pattern of hpa fe c b clearly shows the presence of the original hierarchical porous framework of bamboo wood with three distinct pores a macropores formed on the vessels at diameter around 50 75 μm b mesopores formed on parenchyma cells at diameter around 10 30 μm and fibres at diameter around 1 15 μm c micropores originated from the capillary walls and parenchyma cells that provide plentiful pits at 2 0 289 0 nm fig 3 the total pore volume 0 12 cm3 g is similar to that of biochar prepared from soybeans 0 19 cm3 g and larger than biochars produced from corn stalks 0 09 cm3 g rice stalks 0 05 cm3 g poultry manure 0 09 cm3 g cattle manure 0 08 cm3 g and pig manure 0 05 cm3 g respectively 13 the eds spectrum fig 4 is obtained for the unpulverized hpa fe c b exposed to high phosphate concentration 100 mg p l the eds spectrum of hpa fe c b shows that the characteristic peak of phosphorus appears at 2 01 kev after phosphorus adsorption the phosphorus adsorption capacity is estimated at 0 82 wt based on the sem eds peak area ratio it also confirms that the phosphorus ion 0 82 wt is associated with the hpa fe c b surface 3 2 effect of adsorption variables 3 2 1 initial phosphorus concentration and temperature fig 5 shows the phosphorus adsorption a and the percent removal b as a function of equilibrium and initial phosphorus concentration respectively at different temperature temperature has an insignificant effect on phosphorus adsorption with increasing phosphorus concentration from 2 to 50 mg p l the maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity increases from 0 20 to 2 46 to 2 62 and to 2 81 mg p g at 25 35 and 45 c respectively on the contrary the percent removal reduces from 99 2 to 49 2 from 99 4 to 52 8 and 98 8 56 2 wt at 25 35 and 45 c respectively results clearly indicate the exothermal nature of phosphorus adsorption onto hpa fe c b adsorbent 3 2 2 solution ph fig 6 shows the effect of final ph on phosphorus adsorption the ph has significant effect on phosphorus adsorption due mostly to the ph dependent phosphate speciation and the surface charge of the hpa fe c b 11 the phosphorus adsorption capacity and percent removal increases with increase in ph to a maximum level at ph 3 then slightly decreases with further increase in ph the maximum adsorption capacity and the corresponding percent removal are 0 20 mg g 99 21 0 49 mg g 97 50 and 0 84 mg g 84 44 at initial phosphorus concentration of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively this pattern is the same as that reported for other adsorbents 16 17 dihydrogen phosphate h2po4 monohydrogen phosphate hpo4 2 and phosphate po4 3 are major inorganic phosphorus species in aqueous solution surface charge can affect the adsorption of phosphate species which again is influenced by solution ph the phpzc of hpa fe c b bamboo biochar α fe2o3 and fe3o4 are 3 1 2 3 5 2 and 5 7 respectively the phpzc of hpa fe c b is close to literature data 17 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle prepared via carbodiimide activation has a phpzc of 6 7 18 20 the phpzc ca 3 1 of hpa fe c b is between that of fe3o4 and fe2o3 at ph phpzc ca 3 1 h2po4 is the predominant species and hpa fe c b is positively charged which favours electrostatic attraction of anions such as h2po4 17 18 although it must be mentioned that electrostatic interaction may play a role on ion adsorption other process such as formation of specific chemical bonds between anions and similarly charged surface can occur huang 7 studied phosphate adsorption on γ al2o3 surface and reported significant adsorption of anionic phosphate ions onto negatively charge hydrous solid surface the surface acidity of biochar can be visualized as derived from the protonation deprotonation equilibrium of surface hydroxy groups that is upon hydration the surface is occupied by oh functional group which undergoes protonation and deprotonation reaction eqs 1 2 7 25 1 soh h soh2 1 kint a1 2 soh so h kint a2 wheresoh2 soh and so are positively neutral and negatively charged surface hydroxy species respectively kint a1 and kint a2 are the intrinsic surface acidity constants based on zeta potential measurement as a function of ph it is possible to calculate the acidity constant of hpa fe c b 7 25 result shows that the intrinsic acidity constants are 1 5 and 4 7 for pkint a1 and pkint a2 respectively thus at ph 1 5 the dominant surface functional group of hpa fe c b is soh2 at 1 5 ph 4 7 soh is the dominant hydroxy species of hpa fe c b at ph 4 7 so dominates the active surface site on hpa fe c b in the ph range of significant phosphate adsorption h2po4 is the major species therefore one can expect the following reactions take place between the biochar surface and the phosphate species eqs 3 4 3 soh2 h2po4 spo4h2 h2o 4 soh h2po4 spo4h h2o significant phosphate adsorption on soh2 or soh site takes place at 1 0 ph 3 1 eq 3 or 1 5 ph 4 7 eq 4 which results in the formation of mono dentate hpa fe c b h2po4 surface complex intuitively the negatively charged site s o will repel anionic phosphate species at high ph i e 4 7 ph 7 0 eq 5 5 so h2po4 spo4 2 h2o not run in the present study nonetheless the regeneration of phosphate laden hpa fe c b adsorbent can be readily achieved by acid ph 1 5 or alkaline ph 8 5 stripping as shown in fig 7 the durability of the hpa fe c b adsorbent is not assessed specifically in the present study ultimately the individual material such as magnetite might be lost in multiple phosphate adsorption cycles at acidic ph however hematite nanoparticles are formed at high temperature of 600 c and might be anodized under acidic condition which should enhance its stability in lieu of dissolution 3 2 3 adsorbent dose the phosphorus adsorption onto the hpa fe c b adsorbent is studied by varying adsorbent dose 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 g in 50 ml phosphorus solution or 2 4 6 7 8 10 12 14 16 18 and 20 g l and 3 initial phosphorus concentrations 2 5 and 10 mg p l while keeping constant the initial ph sorbent grain size and temperature fig 7 results show that the phosphorus adsorption capacity decreases from 0 87 to 0 10 mg p g from 1 66 to 0 25 mg p g and from 1 84 to 0 44 mg p g at initial phosphate concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l respectively the corresponding phosphorus removal percent average of three independent runs increases from 86 6 to 99 8 wt 66 5 99 9 wt and 36 8 88 8 wt at adsorbent dose of 2 10 and 20 g l respectively increase in phosphate adsorption with increase in adsorbent dosage can be attributed to increase in adsorbent surface adsorption site the phosphorus capacity reaches a plateau at adsorbent dosage of 10 g l obviously due to the depletion of phosphate species in the solution 13 3 2 4 adsorbent grain size six adsorbent grain sizes 1 59 0 58 0 33 0 21 0 16 and 0 11 mm three types of adsorbent carbonized bamboo wood the saw dust of bamboo wood and α fe2o3 powder three initial phosphorus concentrations 2 5 10 mg l at initial ph 3 and 25 c are studied fig 8 summarizes the phosphorus adsorption capacity as a function of grain size generally the smaller grain size the greater specific surface area therefore it is possible to increase the adsorption capacity and percent removal by manipulating the grain size however smaller particles tend to clump together during adsorption process which renders it difficult for solid water separation after application obviously adsorbents with large grain size but have high total surface area are ideal for achieving high adsorption efficiency and enhancing application potential in our study pulverizing hpa fe c b only results in slight increase in bet surface area the hierarchical porous microstructure of unpulverized hpa fe c b is composed of macropores 65 1 mesopores 31 7 and micropores 3 2 with pore size in the range of 0 8 87 000 nm macropores and mesopores are the major structures of the hierarchical porous microstructure of hpa fe c b further grinding of hpa fe c b does not increase the specific surface area fig 8 shows that the phosphorus adsorption capacity is related to the specific surface areas but not the grain size especially at high initial phosphorus concentration i e 5 and 10 mg p l the phosphorus adsorption capacity and removal percentage of unpulverized hpa fe c b d g 1 59 mm are 0 18 mg p g 87 9 0 36 mg p g 71 8 and 0 66 mg p g 66 0 at initial phosphorus concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg l respectively for pulverized hpa fe c b the smaller grain size the greater the bet specific surface area and thus the greater absorption capacity for pulverized hpa fe c b with geometric mean adsorbent grain size of 0 11 mm the maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity percent removal is 0 20 mg p g 97 7 0 48 mg p g 96 9 0 85 mg p g 85 1 at the initial phosphorus concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l respectively which is close to that of unpulverized adsorbents the result also indicates that the unpulverized hpa fe c b with intrinsic hierarchical porous microstructure has higher phosphorus adsorption capacity and removal percentage than charcoal made of bamboo wood d g 0 11 mm sawdust of bamboo wood d g 1 59 mm and α fe2o3 powder at selected initial total phosphorus concentrations obviously the unique hierarchical porous microstructure of hpa fe c b endowed from the intrinsic template of bamboo wood has vast macropores and mesopores that contribute to fast phosphorus adsorption hence hpa fe c b can still have favourable phosphorus adsorption capacity without further grinding table 1 lists the phosphorus adsorption capacity of hpa fe c b and other iron fe2 fe3 oxides adsorbents reported in the literature the result indicates that hpa fe c b is among the best adsorbent for phosphorus adsorption from aqueous solution zhu et al 16 have reported phosphorus adsorption capacity of pbgc fe c at 0 18 and 0 66 mg g at initial phosphorus concentration of 2 and 10 mg l respectively barber 21 study the phosphorus adsorption capacity of natural and synthetic magnetite under static conditions the naturally occurring magnetite bet asf 0 13 m2 g particle size 0 25 mm is obtained from the stanford university research mineral collection and the synthetic magnetite bet asf 1 74 m2 g particle size 0 25 mm is purchased from aldrich chemical company the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the natural and synthetic magnetite at ph 7 and initial phosphorus concentration of 0 31 46 46 mg l are 0 42 and 1 06 mg g respectively 21 choi et al 22 study phosphorus adsorption by synthetic magnetite mio at ph 4 and the initial phosphorus concentration of 200 mg l and report adsorption capacity of 2 18 mg g colombo et al 23 reported phosphate adsorption capacity of hematite in the range of 0 66 1 13 mg g and attribute the variation in adsorption capacity to crystal size and morphology specific surface area 16 23 m2 g grain size from 70 130 nm to 45 220 nm daou et al 27 and pan et al 28 reported phosphorus adsorption capacity of 0 5 3 5 and 3 2 mg g for nano and micro sized magnetite at ph 3 and ph 7 respectively table 1 also shows that the unpulverized hpa fe c b adsorbent has average phosphorus adsorption capacity similar to those of fine particles or nanoparticles of iron oxides reported in the literature 21 28 3 3 adsorption kinetics fig 9 shows the effect of the contact time on phosphate adsorption capacity and surface coverage of hpa fe c b the phosphorus adsorption capacity mg p g and the surface coverage θ increase rapidly with contact time until gradually approaching the equilibrium state which is due to the continuous decease in the driving force i e difference between equilibrium and temporal adsorption density q e q t the phosphorus adsorption capacity remains almost constant after 1 12 and 18 h at 25 c ph 3 and initial concentration of 2 5 and 10 mg p l respectively phosphorus adsorption takes place rapidly at the onset of adsorption experiment due to adsorption onto macropores and mesoporoes ionic radius of phosphate 5 3 å 29 further adsorption onto mesopores and micropores needs more energy and contact time result clearly confirms strong and rapid interactions between phosphate and hpa fe c b especially at low phosphorus concentrations kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments provide information necessary for the design and operation of phosphate removal process in water wastewater treatment different kinetic model may yield different parameter estimations 30 in this study four different classical kinetic models namely the pseudo first order fig s1 the modified pseudo first order fig s2 the pseudo second order fig s3 the elovich fig s4 and the intra particle diffusion model fig 10 are used to fit the experimental data results show that the intra particle diffusion model fits best the kinetic data according to the intra particle diffusion model a plot of q t against t 1 2 should give a straight line with slope k d and intercept c 31 32 2 that is eq 6 6 q t k d t 1 2 c where k d is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min1 2 and c is a constant the c value is related to the thickness of adsorption boundary layer therefore the larger the c the greater boundary layer effect as seen in table 2 the correlation coefficients r 2 r pearson correlation coefficient for phosphorus adsorption onto the hpa fe c b is 0 9453 0 9971 0 9788 0 9987 the results show that the intra particle diffusion kinetic model describes the experimental data well results table 2 fig 10 show three distinct adsorption stages the first stage is a rapid adsorption process occurring at t 5 4 5 min1 2 or t 20 min in which phosphate adsorbs on the macropores surface readily adsorption on the mesopores surface takes place next at t 5 of 4 5 26 8 min1 2 or t 20 722 min finally adsorption proceeds to occupy the micropores surface at t 5 26 8 min1 2 or t 722 min table 2 gives k d c r 2 and r of data fitting according to the intra particle diffusion model table s1 summarizes the variables of kinetic models i e k 1 k 2 a e b e and q e at different initial phosphorus concentrations 3 4 adsorption isotherm to optimize the design of an adsorption system for the adsorption of phosphorus from water wastewater using hpa fe c b adsorbent it is important to establish the most appropriate adsorption isotherm in this study the equilibrium adsorption data are fitted with langmuir and fruendlich adsorption isotherms at temperature 25 35 and 45 c respectively fig s5 and table s2 results show langmuir adsorption isotherm has larger r 2 and r than that of the fruendlich adsorption isotherm the langmuir adsorption isotherm has the following linearized equation eq 7 7 ce q e 1 q m k l c e q m where ce is the equilibrium phosphorus concentration mg l q m is the monolayer adsorption capacity mg g and kl is the adsorption constant l mol a plot of c e q e versus c e fig 11 yields q m and k l from the slope and intercept of the linear plot table 3 the standard free energy δg kj mol enthalpy δh kj mol and entropy δs kj mol k of the adsorption process can be calculated from kl and temperature by the following equation eq 8 8 δg rtlnk l δh tδs where r is the gas constant 8 3145 j mol k or 1 9863 cal mol k k l is the langmuir adsorption constant m 1 l mol fig 11 shows the linearized plot of langmuir adsorption isotherm at 25 35 and 45 c respectively it is interesting to note that the adsorption isotherm is best fitted with the linearized langmuir adsorption isotherm in three distinct regions with respect to equilibrium phosphorous concentrations i e region 1 from 0 to 15 mg p l region 2 from 15 to 30 mg p l and region 3 from 30 to 50 mg p l conformation of the experimental data with langmuir adsorption isotherm model with high r 2 r value indicates the homogeneous nature of the adsorbent surface raising the temperature improves the adsorption capacity from 2 85 mg g at 25 c to 2 89 mg g at 35 c and to 3 08 mg g at 45 c k l value in region 1 2 and 3 indicates that the higher phosphorus concentration the larger adsorption energy the calculated δg value is 29 9 23 6 and 22 3 kj mol or 7 1 5 6 and 5 3 kcal mol for region 1 adsorption 30 5 24 0 and 23 7 kj mol or 7 5 5 9 and 5 8 kcal mol for region 2 adsorption and 31 0 24 3 and 23 9 kj mol or 7 9 6 2 and 6 1 kcal mol for region 3 adsorption at 25 35 and 45 c respectively negative δg value indicates spontaneous nature of adsorption the δh value calculated is 26 0 20 6 and 18 4 kj mol or 6 2 4 9 and 4 4 kcal mol for the adsorption region 1 2 and 3 respectively the δs value calculated is 158 117 and 163 j mol k or 37 8 28 0 and 39 0 cal mol k for the adsorption region 1 2 and 3 respectively results of the thermodynamic analysis of equilibrium adsorption data are consistent with the kinetic aspects adsorption domain is consisted of three distinct regions namely region 1 2 and 3 with respect to filling the macropores the mesopores and the micropores respectively the change of enthalpy for all three regions are negative meaning the exothermic nature of the adsorption process the change of enthalpy negative value follows the order δh1 δh2 δh3 and the change of entropy also follows the same order δs1 δs3 δs2 respectively intuitively less energy is involved in phosphate ions adsorption onto the macropores and microspores greater entropy for phosphate ion adsorption onto the macroscpores and microposres indicate increase in the degree of organization of adsorbed anions i e phosphate ions are more disorganized in microposres

14516,electric arc furnace slag eaf and argon oxygen decarburization slag aod were investigated in column experiments to determine the effect of mineralogical composition on their p removal performance and lifespan polyethylene glycol peg and naoh solutions were used for pretreatment of the slags to adjust their dissolution properties the modified slags exhibited better p removal performance at the beginning of the experiment but had shorter lifespan than the unmodified slags aod and eaf modified with peg and naoh achieved 100 p removal during the first 84 and 60 pore volumes respectively which were 20 pore volumes longer than virgin aod and eaf however virgin eaf and aod both had a p removal efficiency above 90 during the first 280 pore volumes possibly soluble minerals such as free lime are lost during the modification step causing a decreased long term p removal capacity the xrd results showed that the high p removal ability of aod and eaf was attributed to the dissolution of beta dicalcium silicate β c2 and gamma dicalcium silicate γ c2s which were dominant mineral phases in the slags results from sem eds analysis revealed significant p accumulation on the slag surface cracks on the eaf slag surface contributed to its longer lifespan analysis with p k edge xanes spectroscopy showed that the p retained on the slag surface was dominated by amorphous calcium phosphate with a substantial amount of carbonate apatite around 30 amorphous calcium phosphate was transformed to crystalline apatite as the slag aged with column operating time keywords slag mineralogy dicalcium silicate calcium phosphate apatite p speciation 1 introduction implementation of more strict phosphorus p removal regulations for wastewater discharge could help to alleviate the

systems struvite precipitation has been implemented 2 and in small scale purification systems different filter materials have been investigated e g 3 slags a high volume by product from the steel making industry have been shown to be economic and efficient p removal filter materials 4 9 the p removal performance of a slag is significantly affected by its dissolution properties 7 10 crystalline blast furnace slag bfs was tested by immersing 1 g of slag in 50 ml leaching solution with 500 mg po4 l the p removal was found to be attributed to the ca2 and oh released by the dissolution of first bredigite ca14mg2 sio4 8 and then gehlenite ca2al2sio7 as the ph decreased from 11 7 to around 7 according to the xrd results 4 claveau mallet et al 7 reported that the dissolution of electric arc furnace slag eaf can be approximated by the dissolution of cao which results in high levels of dissolved calcium ca effluent ca concentration 200 mg l when ph 11 and in proper levels of ph needed for hydroxyapatite precipitation in basic oxygen furnace slag bof the dominant dissolving mineral phase is portlandite ca oh 2 which determines the lifespan of bof as a p removal material 11 the p removal efficiency of bof decreases to below 10 after the complete dissolution of portlandite 11 in melter slag and eaf slag other magnesium mg iron fe and aluminum al rich minerals such as lizardite mg6 oh 8si4o10 and fe al hydr oxides could contribute to p removal through both precipitation and adsorption as the ph decreases towards the influent ph 5 12 in the steel making process materials added to a furnace include iron ore scrap metal fluxing agents such as lime etc the impurities form a liquid with the lowest specific gravity and float on the molten steel liquid when a complete fusion state is reached slag is produced during separation of the impurities liquid from the molten steel liquid 13 the mineralogy of a particular slag type is not always the same because of differences in the ore and the nature and amount of scrap variations in the grade of the steel products differences in the furnaces of steel producing plants cooling procedures and so on 13 for instance the composition of eaf can change from one production batch to another depending on the nature and amount of scrap metal recycled 14 however different types of slag may contain some common mineral phases beta dicalcium silicate β c2s can be found in eaf bof bfs and in argon oxygen decarburization slag aod 15 17 other common mineral phases in slags include gamma dicalcium silicate ca2sio4 γ c2s gehlenite ca2al alsi

dicalcium silicate a mineral that exists in both eaf and aod was found to increase when ph decreased from 10 to 7 by addition of 0 1 m hno3 19 our previous research showed that aod slag had its p removal capacity enhanced after hydrothermal treatment with polyethylene glycol peg 9 as polyethylene glycol solution is acidic the hypothesis was that a peg coated slag surface could accelerate the dissolution of the active minerals and bring about a rougher surface with higher specific surface area for p precipitation and adsorption ladle slag coated with sodium hydroxide naoh 20 has a higher ph due to the naoh coating therefore naoh coated slag had higher p removal and longer lifespan than uncoated ladle slag 21 in the current study peg and naoh solutions were used to modify the ph and dissolution properties of two other slags aod and eaf aiming at achieving better p removal performance even though eaf and aod have very different mineral composition both are efficient p removal materials 7 9 18 in this study these two types of slag were examined in column experiments to investigate the effect of mineralogical composition on their p removal performance and lifespan x ray powder diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry sem eds were used to determine the mineralogy and morphology of the slags before and after the experiment the release of calcium and silicon from the slags was analyzed to unravel their dissolution properties x ray absorption near edge structure xanes speciation was conducted to find evidence for the dominant long term p removal mechanisms the aim of this research was to investigate whether it is possible to improve the prediction of p removal performance and lifespan of a slag by knowing its mineralogical composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fresh eaf and aod with particle sizes ranging from 2 to 4 mm were collected from höganäs sweden ab and outokumpu stainless ab in avesta sweden the slags were stored in sealed plastic bottles at room temperature for around three months before the experiments details of the chemical composition of the slags can be found in zuo et al 22 the naoh used to modify the slag surface was of analytical reagent grade merck and peg with a molecular weight ranging from 950 to 1050 g mol 1 was used 2 2 modification of the slag samples solutions of peg and naoh were prepared by dissolving a certain amount of solid in distilled water at a solid liquid ratio of 1 100 duplicate 300 ml samples of aod and eaf with mass 358 g and 540 g respectively were immersed in peg solution at a volume ratio of 1 1 5 the mixtures were placed in a water bath at 80 c and shaken at 120 rpm for 24 h 20 21 afterwards the peg treated aod and eaf were removed from the peg solution and rinsed three times with distilled water one duplicate set of peg treated aod and eaf samples was dried at 105 c for 24 h and labeled ap and ep respectively the second peg treated set was immersed in naoh solution at a volume ratio of 1 1 5 and placed in the water bath again under the above mentioned conditions for 24 h the samples were then removed from the naoh solution rinsed and dried in the same way as the other two slag samples the peg naoh treated aod and eaf samples are referred to as apn and epn respectively aod and eaf without any modification were also tested in columns and are referred to as aor and eor they were dried at 105 c for 24 h prior to packing into the columns 2 3 column experiment set up the experiments were conducted in a laboratory at room temperature 21 2 c six plastic columns ø 5 cm length 35 cm were used image 1s plastic lids with inlet tubes located in the center were used to seal the bottom of the columns the top of each column was sealed with a rubber lid with an outlet tube situated in the center silicone was used on all lids to seal the columns and to prevent leakage of water and air separate columns were packed with 300 ml of eor ep epn aor ap or with apn in a consistent way and named according to the packed slags domestic wastewater was pumped into the bottom of the columns by an eight channel peristaltic pump upflow saturated conditions were used in the columns the effluent from each column was collected in 1 l pyrex media bottles and sampled every day to determine the effluent water quality ph p po4 ca si the effluent collection bottles were emptied immediately after sampling and rinsed with tap water three times before being connected to the effluent again the columns were fed for 30 min every three hours at 6 ml min 1 for the first 16 days as the pore volume of both slags was around 50 the hydraulic retention time was set at 2 5 h the volume of the collected effluent after a feed was measured every two days to ensure that every column received the same amount of wastewater this volume decreased gradually with time and at day 16 it was around 150 ml as the pipes became worn out and as pollutants accumulated on the inner wall of the pipes therefore the feeding frequency was adjusted to 30 min every 2 5 h to keep the hydraulic retention time hrt stable the feeding was stopped for two days from day 12 because of wastewater shortage these two days were not counted in the experimental duration the wastewater used to feed the columns was fresh effluent from a filtration bed for organic matter removal without any further treatment five batches of wastewater were used throughout the experiment starting on days 1 5 7 12 and 20 respectively table 1s each batch of wastewater was stored in plastic containers at room temperature and sampled before and after feeding the analytical results did not show any large differences in the water chemistry parameters between batches table 1s immediately after the end of the column experiment slag samples were collected from the six columns and well mixed column by column then they were dried in a fume hood at room temperature for 24 h prior to xrd sem eds and xanes analysis 2 4 analytical method the phosphate p p po4 concentrations in the aqueous samples were determined by the molybdate blue method using a seal analytical aa3 autoanalyzer a hach ph meter sension ph 31 equipped with a combination electrode was used to measure the ph dissolved concentrations of ca and silicon si were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo scientific icap 6000 with a detection limit of 1 ppb the morphology and structure of surfaces of samples aor and eor were determined using a scanning electron microscope fe sem s 4800 hitachi japan equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds x max 80 sdd oxford instruments uk prior to xrd and xanes analysis between 30 and 50 g of slag was sampled from each column and manually ground into a fine powder with a mortar the powder samples were then pressed into pellets in a steel sample holder the xrd analysis was conducted using a panalytical x pert pro powder diffractometer equipped with cu kα radiation of 45 kv and 45 ma the xrd pattern was recorded from 10 to 70 2ɵ at 0 01 step and 0 5 s step six scans were collected for each sample to minimize the noise and merged into one scan using the software high score plus mdi jade 5 0 was used to interpret the merged scan and match the spectrum with the standards from its library the p k edge xanes spectra were collected at beamline bl 8 at the synchrotron light research institute slri nakhon ratchasima thailand as described in previous research 22 23 a number of stainless steel sample holders with a window measuring 0 5 cm 1 cm 0 2 cm were used to pack the powder the powder samples were mounted on p free kapton tape and covered with polypropylene x ray film fluorescence data were collected using a solid state 13 channel ge detector between two and six scans per sample were collected depending on the level of noise in the data procedures for data treatment are detailed elsewhere 22 phosphorus speciation was performed by linear combination fitting of the normalized spectra across an energy range from 10 ev to 30 ev relative to e0 using weighted combinations of spectra from 31 known standards 22 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus removal performance at the beginning of the experiment an obvious improvement in p removal ability was observed for the peg and naoh modified slags compared with the other slag samples fig 1 a columns epn and apn achieved a p removal efficiency of 100 until pore volumes 60 0 33 mg retained p g slag and 84 0 52 mg retained p g slag respectively complete p removal was only observed until pore volumes 40 50 60 and 70 for columns eor ep aor and ap respectively however virgin slags exhibited superior long term p removal the eor column started to obtain higher p removal than columns ep and epn after pore volume 90 column aor had the best p removal among the three columns packed with aod after pore volume 120 the aor column had higher p removal efficiency than column eor before pore volume 244 but after that its p removal efficiency dropped faster and eor had the highest p removal by the end of the experiment columns aor ap and apn retained 2 11 2 09 and 1 75 mg p g slag respectively during this experiment while columns eor ep and epn retained 1 46 1 41 and 1 21 mg p g slag the effluent ph fell below 9 after pore volumes 178 185 218 281 and 288 for columns apn epn ap ep and aor respectively after these pore volumes the p removal started to decrease significantly in these five columns exhaustion of the slags was observed in columns apn and epn after 1 75 and 1 21 mg of p g slag respectively was retained by the two columns the two columns packed with peg treated slags were also approaching exhaustion after having retained 2 09 and 1 41 mg p g slag for columns ap and ep respectively although the mass of slag 540 g for eaf in the three eaf columns was considerably greater than the columns with aod 358 g the lifespan of column epn 311 pore volumes was only slightly longer than that of column apn 296 pore volumes the superior p removal capacity of the modified slags at the beginning can be ascribed to a higher ph in the solution fig 1b as the surfaces of the peg treated slags were coated with peg they were probably able to dissolve more quickly which led to an increased solution ph for the slags modified with peg and naoh the naoh coating might be consumed and contribute to an increased solution ph 21 moreover the modification might have made the slag surface rougher which could have facilitated dissolution of alkaline materials and contributed to higher p removal however the modification impeded the long term p removal ability of the slags due to the loss of active alkaline minerals during the treatment prior to the column experiment slags ap and ep was in contact with peg for 24 h and slags apn and epn had contact with peg naoh for 48 h in total according to the icp results the dissolved ca concentration of the naoh solution after removing the slags was much higher for eaf than for aod indicating a large ca loss from eaf due to dissolution of ca rich minerals in the modification process however dissolved si showed the opposite trend suggesting the dissolution of silicates from aod kriskova et al 25 observed high reaction rates for hydration of beta dicalcium silicates gamma dicalcium silicates and periclase for the first three days of a hydration experiment in which aod was immersed in water at solid to liquid ratios of 0 5 and 1 therefore the hydration dissolution of these silicates or calcium rich minerals during the modification process led to smaller amounts on the slag surface which resulted in earlier exhaustion of the slags the p removal in column aor was much higher than in a dual column containing only aod in our previous study 22 although the particle size of aor was larger and the hrt was shorter in the current experiment one reason may be that the aod slag used in the previous study was more than ten months old although the aged slag had been heated under high temperature its p removal capacity may not have been completely restored 3 2 mineralogical changes of slags the virgin eaf and aod slag referred to here as eaf and aod respectively were sampled before packing into the columns samples from column eor and aor referred to here as eor and aor were collected immediately after the end of the experiment samples eaf aod eor and aor were analyzed with xrd to identify the mineralogical changes before and after contact with wastewater compared with aod and aor samples eaf and eor had a significantly higher level of noise in the background fig 2 a b indicating more complex mineralogical composition of these two samples the minerals contained in samples eaf and eor included beta dicalcium silicate β c2s larnite ca2sio4 magnetite fe3o4 lizardite mg3si2 oh 4o5 and periclase mgo the dominant minerals detected in samples aod and aor were gamma dicalcium silicate γ c2s beta dicalcium silicate calcium aluminum oxide hydrate and periclase significant decreases in peak intensity of the main minerals were observed both in sample aor and sample eor which indicated that the mineral composition of the slags was noticeably affected by p removal a reduction in the peak intensity of beta dicalcium silicate peaks labeled 1 in fig 2 larnite peaks labeled 2 lizardite peaks labeled 3 and periclase peaks labeled 6 could be clearly seen for eor indicating dissolution of these mineral phases when eaf slag was in contact with wastewater for samples aod and aor a substantial decrease in peak intensity of γ c2s peaks labeled 8 was observed a decrease in peak intensity of β c2s between sample aor and sample aod was also observed suggesting the dissolution of β c2s no crystalline calcium phosphate was detected by xrd suggesting that the concentration of this mineral is below 1 in the sample powder carbonation of the slag was evidenced by an increase in the peak intensity of calcite at 2θ 29 404 peaks labeled 4 periclase dissolves in contact with wastewater 26 28 but for sample aor an unexpected significant increase in the peak intensity at 42 9 2ɵ was recorded this was probably caused by overlap with the increased peaks of the newly formed calcite 3 3 morphology changes of slags the surface of the virgin aod slag was dominated by irregular polygon aggregates with a smooth surface fig 3 a b however after contact with wastewater the disappearance of the edges of these polygon aggregates and disintegration of the polygon aggregates were observed on some parts of the aod surface fig 3c small flake like precipitates appeared on the aor surface fig 3d making the slag surface rougher the surface of sample aor became porous and much rougher than that of the virgin aod slag fig 3d e which was very likely caused by dissolution of the slag and precipitation of ca p minerals a growth of rounded aggregates was observed with many small rounded precipitates developing on the surface of large cloud aggregates fig 3e f the irregular polygon aggregates disappeared completely and were replaced by many variable sized spheroidal aggregates with a rough surface the aggregates shown in figs 3a and 3d were produced at higher voltage a significant change in crystal sizes and shapes can be clearly observed in these two images the surface of sample eor fig 3k l was flatter than that of sample aor fig 3e f cloud aggregates of greater size also appeared on the surface of eor but the amount was smaller the edges of the polygonal aggregates became rounded while a larger amount of small dots was observed on the surface of aggregates on aor fig 3f than on the aggregates on eor fig 3k pulverization of polygonal aggregates occurred on some parts of the eor surface fig 3l unlike the crystals formed on the surface of aor fig 3d crystals observed on the surface of eor under high voltage exhibited varied sizes and shapes fig 3i one reason for this variation might be that the two samples were at different stages of their p removal life span the aor slag showed a rapid decline in p removal at the end of the experiment meaning that it had aged and about to become exhausted therefore the ca p precipitates might have evolved to a less soluble phase 22 however the eor still removed around 90 of the p at the end of the experiment indicating that this slag was not close to the end of its lifespan and therefore amorphous calcium phosphate particles of different sizes were continuously generated a number of deep cracks were observed on the surface of eor fig 3j k the cracks partly contributed to the longer lifespan of eor as new surfaces were thereby created for dissolution of reactive minerals and release of ca2 these cracks might be a result of hydration of mg oxides 12 yildrim and prezzi 29 found that periclase free mgo hydrates at a rather low rate causing significant volume change after months or even years the eds analysis did not detect any p on virgin aod or eaf however the p content in samples aor and eor was 3 4 and 7 6 respectively table 1 for both eor and aor the eds images showed that the spatial p distribution matched the ca distribution very well confirming ca p precipitation as the main p removal mechanism visual inspection showed that areas rich in p overlapped with c rich areas in sample aor suggesting co precipitation of c and p on some parts of the slag surface the carbon c content showed a significant increase by the end of the column experiment table 1 virgin aod and eaf had a c content of 2 6 and 10 9 respectively but by the end of the column experiment these values increased to 9 35 and 16 3 for sample aor and eor respectively which meant a larger amount of c was precipitated during the experiment both the p and c concentrations in eor 7 6 16 were much higher than in aor 3 4 9 4 which might because of the smaller surface area of eor the rougher surface of aor shown in sem image also indicated a larger surface area 3 4 xanes analysis according to the lcf results fig 3s table 2 the speciation of p in the six samples was dominated by amorphous calcium phosphate acp slag with a substantial contribution from apatite carbonate apatite apatite gafsa was suggested to be present in the three aod samples while fluoroapatite apatite templeton was present in the three eaf samples fig 3s visual inspection of the spectra of fluoroapatite and carbonate apatite revealed that the first post white line peak of the former was stronger than that of the latter fig 4 the post edge features of the three eaf samples were not well described by the best fit of the lcf results since the first post white line peaks of the samples were much weaker than the fits fig 1s besides no fluoride was present on the surface of either virgin or used eaf according to the eds results hence the crystalline calcium phosphate phase in the three eaf slag might be carbonate apatite rather than fluoroapatite a minor amount around 10 of p adsorbed on al and fe hydr oxides was also suggested a weak contribution 13 5 of p adsorbed on ferrihydrite was suggested in the best fit for sample ap while p adsorbed on al hydroxides was included in the second and third best fit table 2 it is very difficult to distinguish between al bound p and fe bound p by xanes when these phases occur at low concentrations fig 4 according to the edx results the fe oxide content on the aod slag surface was quite limited less than 1 while the al content was around 6 table 1 since al hydroxides were present in much larger amounts than the fe oxides it is reasonable to assume that the three aod samples contained a minor fraction of al bound p instead of fe bound p the spectra of apn and epn were included as standards to fit the spectra of aor and eor respectively aor contained 78 5 of apn 15 of apatite and 7 7 of fe bound p indicating the conversion of amorphous calcium phosphate to crystalline apatite over time this was also evident from a comparison of the p speciation in this study with that found in our previous study 22 apatite was not suggested to be present in the two aod samples with higher ph in the previous study while the xanes analysis revealed the presence of apatite in the three aod samples in the current study in our previous study a substantial amount of p 20 40 was suggested to be adsorbed on al hydroxides especially for aod samples in the current study the percentage of al bound p was 9 13 for aod samples this inconsistency might be the result of the aging effect mentioned in section 3 1 since the slags used in our previous study were much older than the slags used in this study the reactive dicalcium silicates on the surface of the older slags may have been partly consumed due to spontaneous carbonation consequently less calcium phosphate would be generated on the older slags additionally the ph of the effluent from column aor was higher than from columns packed with aod in the previous study which probably inhibited the p adsorption onto al hydroxides 3 5 dissolution of calcium silicates the differences in dissolved ca and si between the effluent and influent were calculated to reveal the dissolution of soluble calcium silicates the six columns exhibited similar trends in terms of changes in dissolved ca and si fig 5 dissolved ca in the effluent from column eor and column ep increased significantly at the beginning fig 5a while the effluent si concentration was found to be lower than the influent for the first 10 pore volumes fig 5c this might have been caused by the dissolution of free lime rather than calcium silicates from eaf slag during this period as hydration of free lime is comparatively fast 29 column aor had higher effluent ca concentrations between pore volumes 100 and 200 than the other columns however the columns packed with eaf had a higher effluent si concentration than the columns packed with aod during this period the higher ca concentration but lower si concentration observed in the effluent of column aor could have been caused by several factors e g that eaf had a more complex mineral composition and apart from beta dicalcium silicate lizardite could also be a si donor whereas for aod slag the si donors were gamma dicalcium silicate and beta dicalcium silicate in terms of chemical composition eaf contains more sio2 while aod contains more cao 18 which could have contributed to the higher ca concentration but lower si concentration in the effluent of columns packed with aod the reason for the low si concentration in aod columns than in the three eaf columns might be different hydration products of γ c2s such as c s h or silicon gel as reported in other studies 30 33 4 conclusions modification with peg and naoh solution enhanced the p removal performance of slags in the short term however the loss of reactive minerals during the modification process accelerated the exhaustion of the slags leading to shorter lifespans of the modified slags in the long term the unmodified eaf and aod both achieved a p removal efficiency above 90 during the first 280 pore volumes column aor captured 2 11 mg p g slag while column eor captured 1 46 mg p g slag however neither column had reached exhaustion at the end of the experiment pulverization of the aggregates and appearance of cracks on the eaf slag surface contributed to a long lifespan of eaf slag columns epn and apn achieved p removal rates above 90 only for the first 180 pore volumes while columns ep and ap maintained this removal rate for the first 220 pore volumes therefore unmodified aod and eaf slags can be recommended to be used for small scale domestic wastewater treatment because of their longer lifespan the main p species of the retained p on the slag was amorphous calcium phosphate which transformed to crystalline apatite as the slags aged with operating time the high p concentration detected on the surface of unmodified eaf and aod slag by eds suggested that both slags had a strong p removal capacity which was ascribed to the dissolution of the main minerals such as beta dicalcium silicate and gamma dicalcium silicate it is predicted that materials with a main component of either of these two minerals could be promising p

respectively which were 20 pore volumes longer than virgin aod and eaf however virgin eaf and aod both had a p removal efficiency above 90 during the first 280 pore volumes possibly soluble minerals such as free lime are lost during the modification step causing a decreased long term p removal capacity the xrd results showed that the high p removal ability of aod and eaf was attributed to the

and the nature and amount of scrap variations in the grade of the steel products differences in the furnaces of steel producing plants cooling procedures and so on 13 for instance the composition of eaf can change from one production batch to another depending on the nature and amount of scrap metal recycled 14 however different types of slag may contain some common mineral phases beta dicalcium silicate β c2s can be found in eaf bof bfs and in argon oxygen decarburization slag aod 15 17 other common mineral phases in slags include gamma dicalcium silicate ca2sio4 γ c2s gehlenite ca2al alsi o7 merwinite ca3mg sio4 2 wustite feo magnetite fe3o4 periclase and brownmillerite ca2 al fe3 2o5 yildirim prezzi et al 2011 18 the dissolution of three common slag mineral phases including beta dicalcium silicate a mineral that exists in both eaf and aod was found to increase when ph decreased from 10 to 7 by addition of 0 1 m hno3 19 our previous research showed that aod slag had its p removal capacity enhanced after hydrothermal treatment with polyethylene glycol peg 9 as polyethylene glycol solution is acidic the hypothesis was that a peg coated slag surface could accelerate the dissolution of the active minerals and bring about a rougher surface with higher specific surface area for p precipitation and adsorption ladle slag coated with sodium hydroxide naoh 20 has a higher ph due to the naoh coating therefore naoh coated slag had higher p removal and longer lifespan than uncoated ladle slag 21 in the current study peg and naoh solutions were used to modify the ph and dissolution properties of two other slags aod and eaf aiming at achieving better p removal performance even though eaf and aod have very different mineral composition both are efficient p removal materials 7 9 18 in this study these two types of slag were examined in column experiments to investigate the effect of mineralogical composition on their p removal performance and lifespan x ray powder diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry sem eds were used to determine the mineralogy and morphology of the slags before and after the experiment the release of calcium and silicon from the slags was analyzed to unravel their dissolution properties x ray absorption near edge structure xanes speciation was conducted to find evidence for the dominant long term p removal mechanisms the aim of this research was to investigate whether it is possible to improve the prediction of p removal performance and lifespan of a slag by knowing its mineralogical composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fresh eaf and aod with particle sizes ranging from 2 to 4 mm were collected from höganäs sweden ab and outokumpu stainless ab in avesta sweden the slags were stored in sealed plastic bottles at room temperature for around three months before the experiments details of the chemical composition of the slags can be found in zuo et al 22 the naoh used to modify the slag surface was of analytical reagent grade merck and peg with a molecular weight ranging from 950 to 1050 g mol 1 was used 2 2 modification of the slag samples solutions of peg and naoh were prepared by dissolving a certain amount of solid in distilled water at a solid liquid ratio of 1 100 duplicate 300 ml samples of aod and eaf with mass 358 g and 540 g respectively were immersed in peg solution at a volume ratio of 1 1 5 the mixtures were placed in a water bath at 80 c and shaken at 120 rpm for 24 h 20 21 afterwards the peg treated aod and eaf were removed from the peg solution and rinsed three times with distilled water one duplicate set of peg treated aod and eaf samples was dried at 105 c for 24 h and labeled ap and ep respectively the second peg treated set was immersed in naoh solution at a volume ratio of 1 1 5 and placed in the water bath again under the above mentioned conditions for 24 h the samples were then removed from the naoh solution rinsed and dried in the same way as the other two slag samples the peg naoh treated aod and eaf samples are referred to as apn and epn respectively aod and eaf without any modification were also tested in columns and are referred to as aor and eor they were dried at 105 c for 24 h prior to packing into the columns 2 3 column experiment set up the experiments were conducted in a laboratory at room temperature 21 2 c six plastic columns ø 5 cm length 35 cm were used image 1s plastic lids with inlet tubes located in the center were used to seal the bottom of the columns the top of each column was sealed with a rubber lid with an outlet tube situated in the center silicone was used on all lids to seal the columns and to prevent leakage of water and air separate columns were packed with 300 ml of eor ep epn aor ap or with apn in a consistent way and named according to the packed slags domestic wastewater was pumped into the bottom of the columns by an eight channel peristaltic pump upflow saturated conditions were used in the columns the effluent from each column was collected in 1 l pyrex media bottles and sampled every day to determine the effluent water quality ph p po4 ca si the effluent collection bottles were emptied immediately after sampling and rinsed with tap water three times before being connected to the effluent again the columns were fed for 30 min every three hours at 6 ml min 1 for the first 16 days as the pore volume of both slags was around 50 the hydraulic retention time was set at 2 5 h the volume of the collected effluent after a feed was measured every two days to ensure that every column received the same amount of wastewater this volume decreased gradually with time and at day 16 it was around 150 ml as the pipes became worn out and as pollutants accumulated on the inner wall of the pipes therefore the feeding frequency was adjusted to 30 min every 2 5 h to keep the hydraulic retention time hrt stable the feeding was stopped for two days from day 12 because of wastewater shortage these two days were not counted in the experimental duration the wastewater used to feed the columns was fresh effluent from a filtration bed for organic matter removal without any further treatment five batches of wastewater were used throughout the experiment starting on days 1 5 7 12 and 20 respectively table 1s each batch of wastewater was stored in plastic containers at room temperature and sampled before and after feeding the analytical results did not show any large differences in the water chemistry parameters between batches table 1s immediately after the end of the column experiment slag samples were collected from the six columns and well mixed column by column then they were dried in a fume hood at room temperature for 24 h prior to xrd sem eds and xanes analysis 2 4 analytical method the phosphate p p po4 concentrations in the aqueous samples were determined by the molybdate blue method using a seal analytical aa3 autoanalyzer a hach ph meter sension ph 31 equipped with a combination electrode was used to measure the ph dissolved concentrations of ca and silicon si were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo scientific icap 6000 with a detection limit of 1 ppb the morphology and structure of surfaces of samples aor and eor were determined using a scanning electron microscope fe sem s 4800 hitachi japan equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds x max 80 sdd oxford instruments uk prior to xrd and xanes analysis between 30 and 50 g of slag was sampled from each column and manually ground into a fine powder with a mortar the powder samples were then pressed into pellets in a steel sample holder the xrd analysis was conducted using a panalytical x pert pro powder diffractometer equipped with cu kα radiation of 45 kv and 45 ma the xrd pattern was recorded from 10 to 70 2ɵ at 0 01 step and 0 5 s step six scans were collected for each sample to minimize the noise and merged into one scan using the software high score plus mdi jade 5 0 was used to interpret the merged scan and match the spectrum with the standards from its library the p k edge xanes spectra were collected at beamline bl 8 at the synchrotron light research institute slri nakhon ratchasima thailand as described in previous research 22 23 a number of stainless steel sample holders with a window measuring 0 5 cm 1 cm 0 2 cm were used to pack the powder the powder samples were mounted on p free kapton tape and covered with polypropylene x ray film fluorescence data were collected using a solid state 13 channel ge detector between two and six scans per sample were collected depending on the level of noise in the data procedures for data treatment are detailed elsewhere 22 phosphorus speciation was performed by linear combination fitting of the normalized spectra across an energy range from 10 ev to 30 ev relative to e0 using weighted combinations of spectra from 31 known standards 22 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus removal performance at the beginning of the experiment an obvious improvement in p removal ability was observed for the peg and naoh modified slags compared with the other slag samples fig 1 a columns epn and apn achieved a p removal efficiency of 100 until pore volumes 60 0 33 mg retained p g slag and 84 0 52 mg retained p g slag respectively complete p removal was only observed until pore volumes 40 50 60 and 70 for columns eor ep aor and ap respectively however virgin slags exhibited superior long term p removal the eor column started to obtain higher p removal than columns ep and epn after pore volume 90 column aor had the best p removal among the three columns packed with aod after pore volume 120 the aor column had higher p removal efficiency than column eor before pore volume 244 but after that its p removal efficiency dropped faster and eor had the highest p removal by the end of the experiment columns aor ap and apn retained 2 11 2 09 and 1 75 mg p g slag respectively during this experiment while columns eor ep and epn retained 1 46 1 41 and 1 21 mg p g slag the effluent ph fell below 9 after pore volumes 178 185 218 281 and 288 for columns apn epn ap ep and aor respectively after these pore volumes the p removal started to decrease significantly in these five columns exhaustion of the slags was observed in columns apn and epn after 1 75 and 1 21 mg of p g slag respectively was retained by the two columns the two columns packed with peg treated slags were also approaching exhaustion after having retained 2 09 and 1 41 mg p g slag for columns ap and ep respectively although the mass of slag 540 g for eaf in the three eaf columns was considerably greater than the columns with aod 358 g the lifespan of column epn 311 pore volumes was only slightly longer than that of column apn 296 pore volumes the superior p removal capacity of the modified slags at the beginning can be ascribed to a higher ph in the solution fig 1b as the surfaces of the peg treated slags were coated with peg they were probably able to dissolve more quickly which led to an increased solution ph for the slags modified with peg and naoh the naoh coating might be consumed and contribute to an increased solution ph 21 moreover the modification might have made the slag surface rougher which could have facilitated dissolution of alkaline materials and contributed to higher p removal however the modification impeded the long term p removal ability of the slags due to the loss of active alkaline minerals during the treatment prior to the column experiment slags ap and ep was in contact with peg for 24 h and slags apn and epn had contact with peg naoh for 48 h in total according to the icp results the dissolved ca concentration of the naoh solution after removing the slags was much higher for eaf than for aod indicating a large ca loss from eaf due to dissolution of ca rich minerals in the modification process however dissolved si showed the opposite trend suggesting the dissolution of silicates from aod kriskova et al 25 observed high reaction rates for hydration of beta dicalcium silicates gamma dicalcium silicates and periclase for the first three days of a hydration experiment in which aod was immersed in water at solid to liquid ratios of 0 5 and 1 therefore the hydration dissolution of these silicates or calcium rich minerals during the modification process led to smaller amounts on the slag surface which resulted in earlier exhaustion of the slags the p removal in column aor was much higher than in a dual column containing only aod in our previous study 22 although the particle size of aor was larger and the hrt was shorter in the current experiment one reason may be that the aod slag used in the previous study was more than ten months old although the aged slag had been heated under high temperature its p removal capacity may not have been completely restored 3 2 mineralogical changes of slags the virgin eaf and aod slag referred to here as eaf and aod respectively were sampled before packing into the columns samples from column eor and aor referred to here as eor and aor were collected immediately after the end of the experiment samples eaf aod eor and aor were analyzed with xrd to identify the mineralogical changes before and after contact with wastewater compared with aod and aor samples eaf and eor had a significantly higher level of noise in the background fig 2 a b indicating more complex mineralogical composition of these two samples the minerals contained in samples eaf and eor included beta dicalcium silicate β c2s larnite ca2sio4 magnetite fe3o4 lizardite mg3si2 oh 4o5 and periclase mgo the dominant minerals detected in samples aod and aor were gamma dicalcium silicate γ c2s beta dicalcium silicate calcium aluminum oxide hydrate and periclase significant decreases in peak intensity of the main minerals were observed both in sample aor and sample eor which indicated that the mineral composition of the slags was noticeably affected by p removal a reduction in the peak intensity of beta dicalcium silicate peaks labeled 1 in fig 2 larnite peaks labeled 2 lizardite peaks labeled 3 and periclase peaks labeled 6 could be clearly seen for eor indicating dissolution of these mineral phases when eaf slag was in contact with wastewater for samples aod and aor a substantial decrease in peak intensity of γ c2s peaks labeled 8 was observed a decrease in peak intensity of β c2s between sample aor and sample aod was also observed suggesting the dissolution of β c2s no crystalline calcium phosphate was detected by xrd suggesting that the concentration of this mineral is below 1 in the sample powder carbonation of the slag was evidenced by an increase in the peak intensity of calcite at 2θ 29 404 peaks labeled 4 periclase dissolves in contact with wastewater 26 28 but for sample aor an unexpected significant increase in the peak intensity at 42 9 2ɵ was recorded this was probably caused by overlap with the increased peaks of the newly formed calcite 3 3 morphology changes of slags the surface of the virgin aod slag was dominated by irregular polygon aggregates with a smooth surface fig 3 a b however after contact with wastewater the disappearance of the edges of these polygon aggregates and disintegration of the polygon aggregates were observed on some parts of the aod surface fig 3c small flake like precipitates appeared on the aor surface fig 3d making the slag surface rougher the surface of sample aor became porous and much rougher than that of the virgin aod slag fig 3d e which was very likely caused by dissolution of the slag and precipitation of ca p minerals a growth of rounded aggregates was observed with many small rounded precipitates developing on the surface of large cloud aggregates fig 3e f the irregular polygon aggregates disappeared completely and were replaced by many variable sized spheroidal aggregates with a rough surface the aggregates shown in figs 3a and 3d were produced at higher voltage a significant change in crystal sizes and shapes can be clearly observed in these two images the surface of sample eor fig 3k l was flatter than that of sample aor fig 3e f cloud aggregates of greater size also appeared on the surface of eor but the amount was smaller the edges of the polygonal aggregates became rounded while a larger amount of small dots was observed on the surface of aggregates on aor fig 3f than on the aggregates on eor fig 3k pulverization of polygonal aggregates occurred on some parts of the eor surface fig 3l unlike the crystals formed on the surface of aor fig 3d crystals observed on the surface of eor under high voltage exhibited varied sizes and shapes fig 3i one reason for this variation might be that the two samples were at different stages of their p removal life span the aor slag showed a rapid decline in p removal at the end of the experiment meaning that it had aged and about to become exhausted therefore the ca p precipitates might have evolved to a less soluble phase 22 however the eor still removed around 90 of the p at the end of the experiment indicating that this slag was not close to the end of its lifespan and therefore amorphous calcium phosphate particles of different sizes were continuously generated a number of deep cracks were observed on the surface of eor fig 3j k the cracks partly contributed to the longer lifespan of eor as new surfaces were thereby created for dissolution of reactive minerals and release of ca2 these cracks might be a result of hydration of mg oxides 12 yildrim and prezzi 29 found that periclase free mgo hydrates at a rather low rate causing significant volume change after months or even years the eds analysis did not detect any p on virgin aod or eaf however the p content in samples aor and eor was 3 4 and 7 6 respectively table 1 for both eor and aor the eds images showed that the spatial p distribution matched the ca distribution very well confirming ca p precipitation as the main p removal mechanism visual inspection showed that areas rich in p overlapped with c rich areas in sample aor suggesting co precipitation of c and p on some parts of the slag surface the carbon c content showed a significant increase by the end of the column experiment table 1 virgin aod and eaf had a c content of 2 6 and 10 9 respectively but by the end of the column experiment these values increased to 9 35 and 16 3 for sample aor and eor respectively which meant a larger amount of c was precipitated during the experiment both the p and c concentrations in eor 7 6 16 were much higher than in aor 3 4 9 4 which might because of the smaller surface area of eor the rougher surface of aor shown in sem image also indicated a larger surface area 3 4 xanes analysis according to the lcf results fig 3s table 2 the speciation of p in the six samples was dominated by amorphous calcium phosphate acp slag with a substantial contribution from apatite carbonate apatite apatite gafsa was suggested to be present in the three aod samples while fluoroapatite apatite templeton was present in the three eaf samples fig 3s visual inspection of the spectra of fluoroapatite and carbonate apatite revealed that the first post white line peak of the former was stronger than that of the latter fig 4 the post edge features of the three eaf samples were not well described by the best fit of the lcf results since the first post white line peaks of the samples were much weaker than the fits fig 1s besides no fluoride was present on the surface of either virgin or used eaf according to the eds results hence the crystalline calcium phosphate phase in the three eaf slag might be carbonate apatite rather than fluoroapatite a minor amount around 10 of p adsorbed on al and fe hydr oxides was also suggested a weak contribution 13 5 of p adsorbed on ferrihydrite was suggested in the best fit for sample ap while p adsorbed on al hydroxides was included in the second and third best fit table 2 it is very difficult to distinguish between al bound p and fe bound p by xanes when these phases occur at low concentrations fig 4 according to the edx results the fe oxide content on the aod slag surface was quite limited less than 1 while the al content was around 6 table 1 since al hydroxides were present in much larger amounts than the fe oxides it is reasonable to assume that the three aod samples contained a minor fraction of al bound p instead of fe bound p the spectra of apn and epn were included as standards to fit the spectra of aor and eor respectively aor contained 78 5 of apn 15 of apatite and 7 7 of fe bound p indicating the conversion of amorphous calcium phosphate to crystalline apatite over time this was also evident from a comparison of the p speciation in this study with that found in our previous study 22 apatite was not suggested to be present in the two aod samples with higher ph in the previous study while the xanes analysis revealed the presence of apatite in the three aod samples in the current study in our previous study a substantial amount of p 20 40 was suggested to be adsorbed on al hydroxides especially for aod samples in the current study the percentage of al bound p was 9 13 for aod samples this inconsistency might be the result of the aging effect mentioned in section 3 1 since the slags used in our previous study were much older than the slags used in this study the reactive dicalcium silicates on the surface of the older slags may have been partly consumed due to spontaneous carbonation consequently less calcium phosphate would be generated on the older slags additionally the ph of the effluent from column aor was higher than from columns packed with aod in the previous study which probably inhibited the p adsorption onto al hydroxides 3 5 dissolution of calcium silicates the differences in dissolved ca and si between the effluent and influent were calculated to reveal the dissolution of soluble calcium silicates the six columns exhibited similar trends in terms of changes in dissolved ca and si fig 5 dissolved ca in the effluent from column eor and column ep increased significantly at the beginning fig 5a while the effluent si concentration was found to be lower than the influent for the first 10 pore volumes fig 5c this might have been caused by the dissolution of free lime rather than calcium silicates from eaf slag during this period as hydration of free lime is comparatively fast 29 column aor had higher effluent ca concentrations between pore volumes 100 and 200 than the other columns however the columns packed with eaf had a higher effluent si concentration than the columns packed with aod during this period the higher ca concentration but lower si concentration observed in the effluent of column aor could have been caused by several factors e g that eaf had a more complex mineral composition and apart from beta dicalcium silicate lizardite could also be a si donor whereas for aod slag the si donors were gamma dicalcium silicate and beta dicalcium silicate in terms of chemical composition eaf contains more sio2 while aod contains more cao 18 which could have contributed to the higher ca concentration but lower si concentration in the effluent of columns packed with aod the reason for the low si concentration in aod columns than in the three eaf columns might be different hydration products of γ c2s such as c s h or silicon gel as reported in other studies 30 33 4 conclusions modification with peg and naoh solution enhanced the p removal performance of slags in the short term however the loss of reactive minerals during the modification process accelerated the exhaustion of the slags leading to shorter lifespans of the modified slags in the long term the unmodified eaf and aod both achieved a p removal efficiency above 90 during the first 280 pore volumes column aor captured 2 11 mg p g slag while column eor captured 1 46 mg p g slag however neither column had reached exhaustion at the end of the experiment pulverization of the aggregates and appearance of cracks on the eaf slag surface contributed to a long lifespan of eaf slag columns epn and apn achieved p removal rates above 90 only for the first 180 pore volumes while columns ep and ap maintained this removal rate for the first 220 pore volumes therefore unmodified aod and eaf slags can be recommended to be used for small scale domestic wastewater treatment because of their longer lifespan the main p species of the retained p on the slag was amorphous calcium phosphate which transformed to crystalline apatite as the slags aged with operating time the high p concentration detected on the surface of unmodified eaf and aod slag by eds suggested that both slags had a strong p removal capacity which was ascribed to the dissolution of the main minerals such as beta dicalcium silicate and gamma dicalcium silicate it is predicted that materials with a main component of either of these two minerals could be promising p

14517,the practical and energy efficient treatment of oil water mixtures especially those stabilized by surfactants has proven to be challenging to cope with this challenge two commercial microfiltration membranes polyester sulfone pes and nitrocellulose ncl were analyzed using a number of characterization methods and used for the separation of micrometer sized oil in water o w emulsions the emulsions were prepared with hexane water and dodecane water respectively and stabilized by the surfactant of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds the separation experiments were conducted at the trans membrane pressure of 0 1 bar the membranes showed superhydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity with the oil contact angles of 147 and 137 in water for pes and ncl membranes respectively pes membrane obtained a better separation efficiency of 98 9 while ncl membranes achieved a higher flux of 3412 2 l m2 h for separating dodecane o w emulsion the cyclic and differential filtration experiments suggested that both membranes can be easily fouled by large oil molecules dodecane which may decrease the initial flux by more than half in less than a minute the results provided benchmarks for future researches on the treatment of produced oily wastewater from industry and daily life keywords oil in water emulsion separation wettability membrane pes cellulose nomenclature

of oil water mixtures and emulsions is attracting more attention from both scientific community and industry owing to its impact on energy and environmental applications 1 8 crude oil extraction petroleum refinery as well as offshore oil spillage events unavoidably resulted in the generation of oily wastewater and the loss of energy resource 9 10 meanwhile the stringent environmental regulations require more efforts on the demulsification purification of such wastewater conventional separation technologies such as oil skimming centrifugation coagulation and flotation etc are able to remove most of the oily contaminants but they are less effective for surfactant stabilized emulsions with diameters less than 20 μm 11 on the other hand pressure driven filtration membranes with designated surface properties have achieved widespread acceptance as economical and efficient technology for separating these emulsions 12 in the past few decades superhydrophobic superoleophilic membranes were developed by using low surafce energy materails and by creating nanoscale hierarchical structures 13 15 these membranes were used to recover oils from water however the higher density viscosity of oils tends to form a barrier layer to prevent oil permeation and thus reducing the flux remarkably 16 19 consequently these superhydrophobic filtration membranes materails are unsuitable for the separation of water rich oil water mixtures or oil in water emulsions similarly another category of organic inorganic filtration membranes were developed with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity for the separation of oil water mixtures 20 24 for example polyaniline coated on the commercial microfiltration membranes made of stainless steel meshes and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf have shown superoleophobicity and low oil adhesion 25 these membranes achieved separation fluxes of 1000 and 3000 l m2h for surfactant stabilized and non surfactant stabilized emulsions respectively under the separation driving pressure pes ultrafiltration membranes modified with tio2 nanoparticles achieved better efficiency improved antifouling properties as well as the increased 30 40 fluxes 26 sio2 decorated polypropylene microfiltration membranes on the support of polydopamine polyethylenimine modified surfaces have shown high permeate flux 1200 l m2h and separation efficiency of 99 27 kanchapogu et al 28 modified the substrate of ceramic membrane using tio2 coating the contact angle was significantly reduced from 77 to 14 while better oil rejection high flux and lower fouling were reported taking advantage of high energy materials with superhydrophilicity and under water oleophobicity two commercialized microfiltration membranes polyester sulfone pes and nitrocellulose ncl are explored in this study the characterization and separation experimental results showed the capability of these original fresh membranes to achieve effective separation of sodium dodecyl sulfate stabilized oil in water o w emulsions with ultrafast flux rate and very high separation efficiency their separation performance over time and with different o w emulsions were studied to form the benchmarks for their future applications surface modifications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials n hexane dodecane sodium dodecyl sulfate c12h25so4na sds are of analytical grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich de ionized di water was used in all experiments to make oil in water emulsions ncl membrane was acquired from merk millipore while pes membrane was obtained from celltreat the characteristics of the two membranes are listed in table 1 2 2 characterization of pes and ncl membranes the top morphology of pes and ncl membranes was examined by a scanning electron microscope sem nova nanosem 650 fei water contact angle wca and oil contact angle oca measurements were performed using contact angle goniometer dm 501 kyowa interface science co ltd the turbidity of the as prepared o w emulsions was quickly measured using a turbidity meter hanna hi83414 while the total organic carbon toc of permeate was measured suing a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l 2 3 o w emulsions two types of o w emulsions were prepared by mixing hexane and dodecane in water using sds as the stabilizer 1 ml of dodecane and 10 ml of hexane were added respectively into 1 l of di water with 0 1 g of sds in each solution the mixtures were stirred and sonicated for 1 h to produce white milky o w emulsions the characteristics of the chemicals and two emulsions are listed in table 2 to check the stability of the o w mixtures freshly prepared 100 ml of o w emulsion solution was used to measure the turbidity hanna hi83414 turbidity meter and double checked by the total organic carbon with a shimadzu toc l toc analyzers at every 5 points fig 1 a shows as the example the turbidity of dodecane based o w emulsion over the time it is seen that the turbidity change is 20 while toc changed marginally in 4 h and virtually unchanged during our experiment intervals t 30 min 2 4 o w emulsion separation the experimental setup for o w emulsion separation is shown in fig 1b it consists of a funnel with porous glass support a collection flask and a diaphragm vacuum pump with pressure gauge and regulation valve the o w mixture was loaded into the funnel while the membrane was fixed onto the support via two big clamps the diameter of the filtration membrane is 28 mm vacuum grease was applied onto the rim of the funnel to avoid leakage of water air 2 5 flux and separation efficiency the filtration flux j is calculated using eq 1 1 j v a t where v is the filtrate volume in l t the time interval in hour and a is the active membrane area in m2 both the average flux based on the separation time for 200 ml of feed solution and the differential flux based on filtrates collected for every time interval of δt 15 20 seconds were measured the oil rejection ratio r is defined as the separation efficiency which is calculated according to eq 2 2 r f e e d o i l c o n c e n t r a t i o n p e r m e a t e o i l c o n c e n t r a t i o n f e e d o i l c o n c e n t r a t i o n 100 2 6 reusability the reusability is an important performance index for membranes and was examined in cyclic operations in each cycle about 200 ml of o w emulsion was fed to the membrane filter for separation the membrane was then cleaned back flushed with 5 ethanol solution followed by washing with di water the flux and efficiency were then computed and compared for each cycle 3 results and discussions 3 1 sem images fig 2 shows the sem images of pes and ncl membranes before and after the separation of emulsions for the original fresh membranes pes membrane fig 3 a has a non woven fibrous surface and prominent pores than ncl membrane fig 3c after the separation the surface morphology of both membrane has been changed significantly probably due to that the soaking of water oil surfactant altered the polymer matrix of the membranes e g via swelling and pore blocking these observations suggest that the surfaces of commercial microfiltration membranes are prone to fouling by oil molecules the sem images of the original membrane was then analyzed by the graphic processing software imagej for its pore size distribution of the top layer it was revealed that the mean pore size for each membrane is approximately 0 5 μm which is consistent with their product specifications as described in table 1 3 2 wettability results the wca and underwater oca 3 μl was measured for each membrane while the final value was taken as the average of 5 measurements on different points of the membrane it was found that water droplets disappeared within 3 s when deposited on the pes and ncl membranes which suggests that the membrane surfaces are superhydrophilic fig 3 shows the images of the underwater oca on pes 3a and ncl 3b membranes respectively we can see that both membranes exhibit underwater oleophobicity the average oca was found to be 147 for pes and 137 for ncl membranes respectively which suggested that the pes membrane is more oleophobic in water than ncl membrane 3 3 separation of o w emulsions the two surfactant stabilized o w emulsions were separated with the pes ncl membranes respectively about 200 ml emulsion was fed to the filtration set the pressure driven force trans membrane pressure was kept constant at δp 0 1 bar by regulating the control valve of the vacuum pump when the liquid level of the feed became invisible in the funnel the filtrates was collected measured and sent for toc turbidity analysis the average filtration fluxes oil rejection ratio and toc values of the filtrates were analyzed and shown in table 3 it is seen in table 3 that both membranes achieved effective separation with toc 75 ppm and the oil rejection ratio r 90 pes membrane has a slightly higher oil rejection ratio and therefore lower oil residue was found in permeate as compared to ncl membrane this is in agreement with their ocas 147 vs 137 measurements and their surface morphologies observed in fig 2 from which we can see that pes membrane has a smoother surface and a more homogeneous porous structure ncl membrane obtained higher fluxes than pes membrane with a 23 higher separation flux for dodecane based o w emulsions and a 15 higher separation flux for hexane based o w emulsions both membranes presented higher separation fluxes 35 40 higher for hexane based emulsions than for dodecane based o w emulsions these observations can be explained as follows the size of dodecane molecule is much larger than hexane so are their o w emulsions the smaller hexane based o w emulsion particles or micelles would experience less constraint resistance in the porous network of the membranes what is more when the emulsion is broken by the porous network some of the oil phase would adhere to the membrane surface and decrease the separation performance 29 in addition dodecane has the higher viscosity and stronger affinity to membrane surface than hexane which result in significantly higher resistance for its separation permeation lastly dodecane based o w emulsion was found to have a slightly better stability than the hexane based o w emulsion therefore we conclude here that the commercial microfiltration membranes are more effective for separating smaller o w emulsions with ncl membrane being a better candidate than pes membrane due to high flux low cost and comparable efficiency 3 4 differential flux the fluxes in table 3 are the average values over the total separation time one would expect that this flux and the oil rejection ratio vary during the separation to verify this point differential flux and oil rejection ratio were measured on pes membrane for dodecane δt 15 s and hexane based o w emulsions δt 20 s respectively the results were shown in fig 4 a and 4b respectively it is seen that the flux decreased monotonously over the separation time the ncl follows the similar trend within 50 s the differential fluxes decreased by 50 and thereafter remained relatively stable and leveled off this may indicate that the clean membrane surfaces were saturated while the oil fouling and concentration polarization reached their steady states after 1 min of separation operation these results provided us with some target direction for future surface modification of commercial membranes it suggests that the fluxes in table 3 can be potentially more than doubled if the differential flux can be kept close to their original state by decorating the membrane surface with nano particles functional groups to improve the wettability and antifouling properties etc 29 30 notably the decrease in flux is more significant for dodecane 75 than hexane 40 based o w emulsions the rejection ratio proportional to the turbidity toc of the filtrates on the other hand decreased marginally at the end of separation 3 for dodecane emulsions and virtually unchanged for hexane emulsions 1 these results are consistent with our previous discussions on surface characteristics and the separation data in table 3 3 5 reusability the cyclic experiments were performed on each membrane respectively it is seen in fig 5 that the flux on pes membrane decreased significantly 60 after 9 cycles of operation which suggests that the commercial membrane is prone to fouling when separating o w emulsions with large oil molecules dodecane the ncl membrane showed a similar trend as well fig 6 shows an example the cyclic test of hexane o w emulsions on pes membrane it is seen that the flux and turbidity are relatively stable over 8 cycles of operation we therefore concluded here that the commercial microfiltration membrane is prone to fouling by larger oil molecules e g c12 but are more feasible for separating o w emulsions with smaller oil molecules e g c6 as industrial oily wastewater samples are generally mixtures of various oils with which the commercial microfiltration membranes would become fouled quickly 4 conclusions two commercial microfiltration membranes pes and ncl were characterized and examined for the separation of dodecane and hexane based o w emulsions respectively both membranes possess good hydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity and are capable of separating the emulsions with satisfactory fluxes and efficiencies on the fresh membranes pes membrane presented better separation efficiency while ncl showed higher fluxes however differential and cyclic tests suggested that both membrane are more suitable for separating o w emulsions of small oil molecule hexane and are prone to fouling by the large oil molecule dodecane which may significantly decrease the fluxes 50 in a few cycles this study provides the good benchmark for the future research application of such microfiltration membranes

14517,the practical and energy efficient treatment of oil water mixtures especially those stabilized by surfactants has proven to be challenging to cope with this challenge two commercial microfiltration membranes polyester sulfone pes and nitrocellulose ncl were analyzed using a number of characterization methods and used for the separation of micrometer sized oil in water o w emulsions the emulsions were prepared with hexane water and dodecane water respectively and stabilized by the surfactant of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds the separation experiments were conducted at the trans membrane pressure of 0 1 bar the membranes showed superhydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity with the oil contact angles of 147 and 137 in water for pes and ncl membranes respectively pes membrane obtained a better separation efficiency of 98 9 while ncl membranes achieved a higher flux of 3412 2 l m2 h for separating dodecane o w emulsion the cyclic and differential filtration experiments suggested that both membranes can be easily fouled by large oil molecules dodecane which may decrease the initial flux by more than half in less than a minute the results provided benchmarks for future researches on the treatment of produced oily wastewater from industry and daily life keywords oil in water emulsion separation wettability membrane pes cellulose nomenclature

of oil water mixtures and emulsions is attracting more attention from both scientific community and industry owing to its impact on energy and environmental applications 1 8 crude oil extraction petroleum refinery as well as offshore oil spillage events unavoidably resulted in the generation of oily wastewater and the loss of energy resource 9 10 meanwhile the stringent environmental regulations require more efforts on the demulsification purification of such wastewater conventional separation technologies such as oil skimming centrifugation coagulation and flotation etc are able to remove most of the oily contaminants but they are less effective for surfactant stabilized emulsions with diameters less than 20 μm 11 on the other hand pressure driven filtration membranes with designated surface properties have achieved widespread acceptance as economical and efficient technology for separating these emulsions 12 in the past few decades superhydrophobic superoleophilic membranes were developed by using low surafce energy materails and by creating nanoscale hierarchical structures 13 15 these membranes were used to recover oils from water however the higher density viscosity of oils tends to form a barrier layer to prevent oil permeation and thus reducing the flux remarkably 16 19 consequently these superhydrophobic filtration membranes materails are unsuitable for the separation of water rich oil water mixtures or oil in water emulsions similarly another category of organic inorganic filtration membranes were developed with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity for the separation of oil water mixtures 20 24 for example polyaniline coated on the commercial microfiltration membranes made of stainless steel meshes and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf have shown superoleophobicity and low oil adhesion 25 these membranes achieved separation fluxes of 1000 and 3000 l m2h for surfactant stabilized and non surfactant stabilized emulsions respectively under the separation driving pressure pes ultrafiltration membranes modified with tio2 nanoparticles achieved better efficiency improved antifouling properties as well as the increased 30 40 fluxes 26 sio2 decorated polypropylene microfiltration membranes on the support of polydopamine polyethylenimine modified surfaces have shown high permeate flux 1200 l m2h and separation efficiency of 99 27 kanchapogu et al 28 modified the substrate of ceramic membrane using tio2 coating the contact angle was significantly reduced from 77 to 14 while better oil rejection high flux and lower fouling were reported taking advantage of high energy materials with superhydrophilicity and under water oleophobicity two commercialized microfiltration membranes polyester sulfone pes and nitrocellulose ncl are explored in this study the characterization and separation experimental results showed the capability of these original fresh membranes to achieve effective separation of sodium dodecyl sulfate stabilized oil in water o w emulsions with ultrafast flux rate and very high separation efficiency their separation performance over time and with different o w emulsions were studied to form the benchmarks for their future applications surface modifications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials n hexane dodecane sodium dodecyl sulfate c12h25so4na sds are of analytical grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich de ionized di water was used in all experiments to make oil in water emulsions ncl membrane was acquired from merk millipore while pes membrane was obtained from celltreat the characteristics of the two membranes are listed in table 1 2 2 characterization of pes and ncl membranes the top morphology of pes and ncl membranes was examined by a scanning electron microscope sem nova nanosem 650 fei water contact angle wca and oil contact angle oca measurements were performed using contact angle goniometer dm 501 kyowa interface science co ltd the turbidity of the as prepared o w emulsions was quickly measured using a turbidity meter hanna hi83414 while the total organic carbon toc of permeate was measured suing a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l 2 3 o w emulsions two types of o w emulsions were prepared by mixing hexane and dodecane in water using sds as the stabilizer 1 ml of dodecane and 10 ml of hexane were added respectively into 1 l of di water with 0 1 g of sds in each solution the mixtures were stirred and sonicated for 1 h to produce white milky o w emulsions the characteristics of the chemicals and two emulsions are listed in table 2 to check the stability of the o w mixtures freshly prepared 100 ml of o w emulsion solution was used to measure the turbidity hanna hi83414 turbidity meter and double checked by the total organic carbon with a shimadzu toc l toc analyzers at every 5 points fig 1 a shows as the example the turbidity of dodecane based o w emulsion over the time it is seen that the turbidity change is 20 while toc changed marginally in 4 h and virtually unchanged during our experiment intervals t 30 min 2 4 o w emulsion separation the experimental setup for o w emulsion separation is shown in fig 1b it consists of a funnel with porous glass support a collection flask and a diaphragm vacuum pump with pressure gauge and regulation valve the o w mixture was loaded into the funnel while the membrane was fixed onto the support via two big clamps the diameter of the filtration membrane is 28 mm vacuum grease was applied onto the rim of the funnel to avoid leakage of water air 2 5 flux and separation efficiency the filtration flux j is calculated using eq 1 1 j v a t where v is the filtrate volume in l t the time interval in hour and a is the active membrane area in m2 both the average flux based on the separation time for 200 ml of feed solution and the differential flux based on filtrates collected for every time interval of δt 15 20 seconds were measured the oil rejection ratio r is defined as the separation efficiency which is calculated according to eq 2 2 r f e e d o i l c o n c e n t r a t i o n p e r m e a t e o i l c o n c e n t r a t i o n f e e d o i l c o n c e n t r a t i o n 100 2 6 reusability the reusability is an important performance index for membranes and was examined in cyclic operations in each cycle about 200 ml of o w emulsion was fed to the membrane filter for separation the membrane was then cleaned back flushed with 5 ethanol solution followed by washing with di water the flux and efficiency were then computed and compared for each cycle 3 results and discussions 3 1 sem images fig 2 shows the sem images of pes and ncl membranes before and after the separation of emulsions for the original fresh membranes pes membrane fig 3 a has a non woven fibrous surface and prominent pores than ncl membrane fig 3c after the separation the surface morphology of both membrane has been changed significantly probably due to that the soaking of water oil surfactant altered the polymer matrix of the membranes e g via swelling and pore blocking these observations suggest that the surfaces of commercial microfiltration membranes are prone to fouling by oil molecules the sem images of the original membrane was then analyzed by the graphic processing software imagej for its pore size distribution of the top layer it was revealed that the mean pore size for each membrane is approximately 0 5 μm which is consistent with their product specifications as described in table 1 3 2 wettability results the wca and underwater oca 3 μl was measured for each membrane while the final value was taken as the average of 5 measurements on different points of the membrane it was found that water droplets disappeared within 3 s when deposited on the pes and ncl membranes which suggests that the membrane surfaces are superhydrophilic fig 3 shows the images of the underwater oca on pes 3a and ncl 3b membranes respectively we can see that both membranes exhibit underwater oleophobicity the average oca was found to be 147 for pes and 137 for ncl membranes respectively which suggested that the pes membrane is more oleophobic in water than ncl membrane 3 3 separation of o w emulsions the two surfactant stabilized o w emulsions were separated with the pes ncl membranes respectively about 200 ml emulsion was fed to the filtration set the pressure driven force trans membrane pressure was kept constant at δp 0 1 bar by regulating the control valve of the vacuum pump when the liquid level of the feed became invisible in the funnel the filtrates was collected measured and sent for toc turbidity analysis the average filtration fluxes oil rejection ratio and toc values of the filtrates were analyzed and shown in table 3 it is seen in table 3 that both membranes achieved effective separation with toc 75 ppm and the oil rejection ratio r 90 pes membrane has a slightly higher oil rejection ratio and therefore lower oil residue was found in permeate as compared to ncl membrane this is in agreement with their ocas 147 vs 137 measurements and their surface morphologies observed in fig 2

need for low cost wastewater treatment options the novel biological sand filtration system described in this pilot study is a sustainable off grid modular system which can be easily retrofitted to

wastewater 1 introduction wine production can be water intensive in addition to vineyard irrigation requirements an estimated 0 2 14 l of water is needed to produce 1 l of bottled wine 1 3 most of this water leaves the cellar in the form of winery wastewater www that is typically acidic and contains organic and inorganic fractions associated with seasonal cleaning activities 3 4 the character and volume of the www varies on a temporal basis with a pattern of high organic to inorganic load during the crush season and vice versa during the non crush period 5 in many countries including south africa australia and the united states www is often re used for irrigation of pastures or crops in water stressed areas unless adequately treated www may pose a threat to the soil environment and or groundwater 6 8 many treatment processes have been researched and or applied for the treatment of www including physicochemical processes biological processes membrane filtration and separation processes and advanced oxidation processes 9 membrane systems have not been widely adopted by the wine industry because of the high capital outlay and operating costs the propensity for membrane fouling and brine generation 10 11 physicochemical processes rely on either sedimentation precipitation coagulation flocculation or electrocoagulation 9 currently the most effective physicochemical and advanced oxidation processes require skilled to semi skilled labour chemical inputs create solid waste streams and need to be used in conjunction with biological treatment methods to achieve satisfactory organic removal rates 10 11 while biological systems such as rotating biological contactors upflow anaerobic sludge blankets and membrane bioreactors may be suited to larger wineries for biodegradation of www organics there is a global need for simple low maintenance cost effective systems at small wineries that do not have the finances or personnel to operate complex systems 9 many wineries utilise anaerobic or aerated ponds these are simple and cheap to operate however odour problems are associated with ponds and long hydraulic retention times hrts are required which translates into a large spatial footprint 12 13 constructed wetlands cws are an effective option if the www is diluted or mixed with domestic wastewater ww 14 15 the main drawback of cws is that poly phenolic rich effluent such as olive mill wastewater omww and www is phytotoxic 14 16 19 for example shepherd et al 19 demonstrated that gravel filled horizontal subsurface flow cws were able to achieve 97 cod removal when treating www with chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations 5000 mg l 1 but poor removal efficiency was achieved and plants died at cod concentrations of 12 800 16800 mg l 1 it can also be argued that the inclusion of plants in cws treating www is unnecessary because they play a limited role in reducing cod and suspended solids they require periodic harvesting and their roots can facilitate the formation of preferential flow paths 16 20 biological sand filters bsfs can be seen as unplanted cws the sand creates a physical substrate for biofilm attachment can adsorb pollutants catalyse chemical transformations and provide metabolic co factors the functional microorganisms within the biofilm are responsible for biotransformation biodegradation and mineralization of chemical pollutants 24 in a series of fundamental laboratory based experiments it was shown that simple bsfs containing ungraded locally available dune sand 21 were able to cope with the temporal nature of www and achieve reliable removal of organics including poly phenolics 22 23 to determine whether bsfs are viable for the treatment of www is a real world setting a pilot system was designed installed and operated at a wine farm in the stellenbosch area close to cape town south africa this manuscript details and analyses the performance of the system over approximately 27 months 2 materials and methods

1000 l sand filter modules and 4 100 l flow control tanks the system was connected to an existing 45 m3 baffled concrete solids settling delta fig 1 a a fraction of the www from the delta was treated and returned to the head of the delta thereby improving the quality of the www which was used to irrigate a sheep pasture the www from the cellar gravitated into the delta inlet and settled effluent was pumped from the delta outlet to the 5000 l collection tank using a shurflo pentair minneapolis usa 2088 313 145 12 v dc diaphragm premium demand solar pump the pump was controlled by a liquid level relay and a probe within the 5000 l collection tank which was set to fill the collection tank to 3800 l when the volume dropped to 2500 l the flow through the remainder of the system was controlled by gravity float valves and adjustable flow control tanks fig 1b the float valves and flow control tanks enabled the hlr to be automatically altered when the flow rates through the filters increased or decreased a constant head of 30 cm was maintained across each filter module the modules were filled with a locally available dune sand which had previously been well characterised and found to be suitable for use in bsf in terms of treatment capacity and hydraulic conductivity k 21 the system could be operated in parallel or series and was operated in parallel during the experimental period 2 2 sampling and characterisation of influent and effluent influent was defined as the grab ww samples from the 5000 l collection tank and the effluent as the final effluent fig 1

divided by the flow rate as shown in eq 3 29 while the volume of liquid was determined by multiplying the porosity of the substrate by the volume of the reactor the hlr was expressed in two different ways i as the discharge rate of influent divided by the volume of the reactor l m 3 d 1 eq 4 and ii as the discharge rate divided by the cross sectional area of the reactor l m 2 d 1 which is the formula typically applied for reactors operated in horizontal mode eq 5 the organic loading rate olr was determined by multiplying the influent flow rate by the influent cod or bod concentration

discussion the bsf system is intended to improve the suitability of www for irrigation or discharge to the environment the system was commissioned in january 2015 and www was slowly added and drained intermittently over a 3 month start up period in order to allow the microbial communities to acclimate this incremental priming with www during start up has been shown to increase the treatment performance in experimental bsfs 30 a batch test was performed in august 2015 and regular sampling commenced in october 2015 the operational results over a further 24 months are presented in this manuscript but the system is still fully functional to date july 2018 3 1 operational parameters 3 1 1 hydraulic capacity in wineries www production spikes during the crush season with small spikes at other times of the year when cellar activities such as bottling are taking place two methods 2 3 1 were used to estimate the average daily volume of www that was treated 427 l day 1 and 402 l day 1 137 l m 3 of sand 1 the latter values calculated using eq 1 were used in all subsequent calculations the pilot system was not intended to treat the entire volume of www produced by the cellar nevertheless 22 was treated in addition the treated effluent was circulated back into the system thereby improving the quality of all the www used for irrigation by diluting the fresh www entering the delta with final effluent from the bsf system in terms of size sawis 31 broadly divides wineries into 6 categories depending on the amount of grapes crushed each year 100 tons 500 tons 1000 tons 10 000 tons the infrastructure of the bsf system shown in fig 1 can support 1 to 12 filter modules after which the capacity and footprint would need to be increased using eq 2 combined with a safety factor of 1 1 32 it was calculated that on an annual basis the infrastructure of the pilot bsf system is capable of treating the www from a cellar crushing 47 tons of grapes which could be extended to a cellar crushing 141 tons by maximising the number of filters to 12 8 w a t e r 4037 5 t 0 9243 3 1 2 hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic retention time decreases in permeability and porosity and changes in mass transport parameters due to the build up of functional biomass and solids retention cause increased k leading to decreased hrt in free flow porous ww treatment systems 33 some researchers have developed models to predict the extent of changes in k but none have been properly validated e g 33 34 this is probably because the extent of biomass accumulation differs according to the type of physical substrate the type of effluent being treated and in different spatial locations within the systems 35 in a previous study using sand filled columns treating synthetic www a 51 reduction in the k of dune sand from an initial value of 0 284 mm s 1 was determined experimentally in column experiments using the constant head method 21 as no solids were present in the synthetic www the reduction was attributed to biomass alone in this pilot study there was an 80 reduction in the calculated k of the dune sand from the initial value of 0 199 mm s 1 to the operational average of 0 040 mm s 1 the start up hrt for a single bsf module of 0 53 days was calculated using the initial flow rate q 1 900 l day 1 and porosity values 0 292 0 02 determined experimentally for the fresh dune sand thereafter the initial porosity and the average system flow rate q 402 l day 1 was used to calculate the average operational hrt of a single bsf module 2 1 days adjusted to 1 8 days to account for partial saturation of the sand and 11 5 days when including the collection tank and other infrastructure in the calculation this hrt was significantly shorter than the hrt of other biological systems used to treat www table 2 but did not account for any decrease in porosity it was not possible to accurately determine the operational k values because the changes in porosity were in a state of flux due to the constant formation and degradation of functional biomass 3 1 3 hydraulic and organic loading rates the hlr and olr in cws are typically calculated using the surface or cross sectional area but the total volume gives a better indication of the treatment efficiency of the medium 21 for example a slender vessel may have a high surface loading rate but relatively low overall loading rate while the converse is true for a wide shallow vessel the initial hlr values for overall and cross sectional loading of the sand filters were 646 l m 3sand day 1 and 1084 l m 2sand day 1 respectively in comparison the average operational values were 150 l m 3sand day 1 range 12 313 l m 3sand day 1 and 252 l m 2 sand day 1 range 21 526 l m 2sand day 1 respectively the 77 decrease from initial to operational hlr was due to accumulation of bio solids including functional biomass and was accompanied by increased cod removal rates 3 2 over a 10 week period achak et al 16 also described a reduction 50 in the hlr and improvement of organic removal rates in a vertical flow sand filter treating diluted omww with a starting hlr of 68 2 l m3sand day 1 in this case the authors terminated the study because they felt that the hlr of 5 0 l m3sand day 1 was inadequate some degree of biomass clogging is essential because the microbial population is the most important functional component for organic biodegradation 36 37 in reality there is a balance between the hlr and system performance if the hlr is too high treatment may be inefficient but if it is too low the spatial footprint and capital costs may render the system uneconomical high hlrs can be overcome by setting up systems that allow hydraulic flexibility and strategies such as intermittent operation and adjustment of loading rates have been proposed to minimise biomass clogging and increase the hlr 16 36 39 the variable nature of the olr seen in this study resulted from the www being generated from different seasonal cellar activities and is typical of all wineries the average olr over the study period was 152 gcod m 3sand day 1 range 23 469 gcod m 3sand day 1 or 256 gcod m 2sand day 1 range 39 788 gcod m 2sand day 1 for the total volume and surface area of the sand respectively after the start up period the hlr also fluctuated which suggested that the accumulation and degradation of organic solids and or biomass was in a state of flux fig 2 overall the pilot bsf system demonstrated resilience to synthetic www fluctuations which was also demonstrated in experimental systems treating synthetic www 22 3 2 performance evaluation 3 2 1 introduction the variable character of www may lead to temporal sampling bias when collecting influent and effluent 22 in this study the incoming www was balanced in the collection and holding tanks the hrt within the bsf filters was only 1 8 days section 3 1 1 it was therefore expected that there would be no significant sampling bias and short term temporal system fluctuations to confirm that the measured parameters were a true reflection of transformations effected within the bsfs for example removal efficiencies a once off batch test was performed this consisted of taking samples every hour for 4 h 5 sampling instances supplementary material 1 for the batch study no significant temporal differences anova p 0 5 were seen in the conductivity cod voa and total phenolic measurements in i the t 0 to t 4hr influent samples ii the t 0 to t 4hr effluent samples iii the t 0 to t 4hr samples taken separately from each of the individual bsf modules this indicated that the performance assessment results were valid however when comparing the results from the different bsf modules a significant difference in the cod and voa measurements anova p 0 05 was noted data not shown although the modules were set up in an identical manner and received the same www inter bsf module performance variability in terms of organic degradation was demonstrated 3 2 2 removal of chemical oxygen demand and selected organics the system achieved an average cod removal efficiency of 79 range 28 98 the average cod concentration in the final effluent n 35 was 287 mg l 1 range 24 1382 mg l 1 fig 3 a voas and ethanol constitute the highest fraction of the cod in www 5 voas can also be formed in bsfs from other organic molecules including phenolics sugars and ethanol 22 in this study the average voa concentrations in the influent and effluent were 472 8 mgaae l 1 range 9 4 1018 4 mgaae l 1 and 186 3 mgaae l 1 range 0 2 662 0 mgaae l 1 respectively with removal rates of 93 to 99 9 fig 3b the intermittent negative removal rates indicated formation of voas within the system phenolics in omww and www may be toxic to plants and microbes and should therefore be removed reduced before discharge of the ww to the environment 16 40 removal of these aromatic molecules in bsfs takes place via biotic and abiotic mechanisms and it has been shown that over 88 removal of poly phenolics with cod concentrations of 5842 mg l 1 can be achieved 24 achak et al 16 also demonstrated similar removal of phenolics from omww 87 97 with an influent cod concentration of 4590 mg l 1 in this study the average total phenolic concentration in the influent and effluent were 18 4 mggae l 1 range 5 1 43 7 mggae l 1 and 3 9 mggae l 1 range 0 09 16 6 respectively with average removal rates of 77 range 16 100 fig 3c in comparison to other simple www treatment systems the system performed well in terms of cod removal table 2 montalvo et al 41 used two adjacent pilot scale batch fed aeration lagoons to treat 790 l day 1 and 170 l day 1 of www with a similar olr to the pilot bsf both ponds removed 91 of the cod but the system required aeration which is costly mulidzi 42 achieved 60 and 80 cod removal for a cw with retention times of 7 and 14 days respectively however sub surface flow cws are more complex require additional maintenance and www is potentially toxic to cw plants 16 19 rozema et al 15 co treated domestic and www ratio 1 3 in a vertical flow cw and achieved 99 cod removal the system operated at a relatively low olr compared to the bsf in this study serrano et al 13 also co treated www with domestic ww with a cod reduction of 73 across a two stage cw fed by a hydrolytic upflow sludge bed followed by a horizontal flow cw it is difficult to compare these systems with the bsf used in this study because of the presence of domestic ww domestic ww has a high carbon to nitrogen ratio in comparison to www therefore an advantage of this type of co treatment is that the domestic ww may enhance microbial activity because of the addition of nutrients to the www a disadvantage is the potential introduction of pathogens 3 2 3 neutralization of acidic winery wastewater the ph in the influent ranged from 4 55 to 7 95 while the ph of the effluent ranged from 6 63 to 8 69 fig 4 even the formation of voas in the system did not lead to an increase in the acidity of the effluent this effective neutralisation of the acidic www was attributed to both abiotic and biotic mechanisms the mineral calcite formed from calcium carbonate was present in the dune sand with calcium constituting 17 6 wt wt of the sand 21 in this study there was an average increase of 82 from the influent to the effluent which provided evidence of calcite dissolution as an abiotic neutralisation mechanism 44 www was also neutralised in experimental bsfs containing river sand that did not contain calcite or aluminosilicates 43 strongly suggesting that biotic neutralisation mechanisms also exist 3 2 4 inorganics sodium hydroxide is widely used as a cleaning agent and disinfectant in wineries and www can contain high concentrations of sodium 21 the cation binds to one negatively charged soil particle causing a tight arrangement which reduces infiltration of water into soils 45 potassium has a similar effect but not to the same magnitude 46 calcium and magnesium are divalent cations which bind to more than one negatively charged soil particle creating a matrix within the soil which allows for aeration and infiltration 45 47 the presence of divalent cations can therefore offset the detrimental effects of monovalent cations such as sodium the sar is a parameter that is widely used to assess the potential of water to cause sodicity and takes into account the concentration of sodium calcium and magnesium 48 according to the u s salinity laboratory 49 soil with an sar 13 is considered sodic 50 and horneck et al 51 state that soils with a sar 5 5 13 and 13 pose low medium and high risks respectively however the sar does not take into account the effect of potassium on soil dispersion which is relevant for www that can contain elevated levels of potassium sodium calcium and magnesium 45 the cross is a sodicity indicator that was derived by rengasamy and sumner 52 to overcome this limitation this ratio is more suitable for monitoring the effects of www on the soil structure 45 laurenson et al 48 suggested a maximum cross of 20 for disposal of www to the environment the authors found an average cross of 9 2 range 2 5 13 3 in www from 8 different wineries in australia the average influent and effluent concentrations of magnesium were 4 5 mg l 1 range 1 6 10 2 mg l 1 and 4 5 mg l 1 range 1 3 10 1 mg l 1 respectively while the average influent and effluent concentrations of potassium were 121 7 mg l 1 range 17 3 284 9 mg l 1 and 126 8 mg l 1 range 25 9 302 9 mg l 1 respectively data not shown the average sodium concentrations of the influent and effluent samples fig 5 a were 29 6 mg l 1 range 10 6 70 8 mg l 1 and 29 8 mg l 1 range 10 0 62 9 mg l 1 respectively in cws containing clay salts may be removed by physicochemical processes 53 but in this instance the sand did not contain clay particles and the data showed that neither magnesium potassium nor sodium were removed by the system in contrast the calcium concentration fig 5a showed an average 1 8 fold increase in concentration from influent to effluent of 36 2 mg l 1 range 96 6 104 0 mg l 1 to 65 7 mg l 1 range 14 7 200 3 mg l 1 this was attributed to the dissolution of calcite as discussed in 3 2 3 there was a highly significant p 0 005 negative correlation 0 37 between the ph of the influent samples and the change in calcium concentration from influent to effluent fig 5b this strongly suggested that the calcium dissolution rates increased with an increase in acidity the bsf system achieved an average decrease in the sar 13 and cross 12 from influent to effluent n 31 fig 5c this decrease in sar and cross improved the quality of the final effluent for soil application the cross values in the effluent were all below the limit of 20 suggested by laurenson et al 48 for irrigation with www crops such as banana musasapientum and lucerne medicago sativa have a remarkable ability to accumulate potassium 54 recent studies have also shown the ability of sugar beet to take up na 55 it is envisaged that www should be used for beneficial irrigation of these or other halophytic crops after treatment in bsfs 3 3 major nutrients the average total nitrogen n and phosphate p fig 6 in the influent was 1 6 mg l 1 range 0 5 10 4 mg l 1 and 2 4 mg l 1 range 0 86 3 98 mg l 1 respectively www is known to be deficient in n and p 5 and these may be added to assist bioremediation 56 58 for example researchers have dosed raw www with nutrients to attain cod n p ratios of 502 5 1 59 400 7 1 12 and 30 60 2 1 60 in this study no nutrients were added the influent cod n p ratio was 1138 1 6 2 4 n 17 exhibiting a particular n deficiency high carbon c n ratio it has been shown that bacterial n fixation can take place in systems treating high c n ww such as that from the paper and pulp industry 61 and synthetic ww 62 this could explain why the cod removal efficiency in the bsf system was high despite the nutrient limitation in the influent 4 conclusion this study showed that the bsf system is a viable option for the treatment of www at small cellars the capex and running costs were low the system was sustainable required minimal maintenance and did not need skilled labour to operate future designs will focus on creating greater treatment capacity and removing salts for example different modes of operation will be tested continuous v s batch mode vertical flow and the treated effluent will be used for beneficial irrigation of salt accumulating crops in order to reduce the

14518,wineries generate 0 2 14 l of wastewater per litre of wine produced which is often used for irrigation or discharged into aquatic systems to mitigate adverse environmental impacts there is a need for low cost wastewater treatment options the novel biological sand filtration system described in this pilot study is a sustainable off grid modular system which can be easily retrofitted to current infrastructure the system was operated with average hydraulic and organic loading rates of 150 l m 3 sand day 1 and 152 gcod m 3 of sand day 1 respectively over 762 days of operation average removal efficiencies of 79 and 77 in terms of chemical oxygen demand and total phenolic concentrations were achieved in addition an average 1 8 fold increase in the calcium concentration was achieved

wastewater 1 introduction wine production can be water intensive in addition to vineyard irrigation requirements an estimated 0 2 14 l of water is needed to produce 1 l of bottled wine 1 3 most of this water leaves the cellar in the form of winery wastewater www that is typically acidic and contains organic and inorganic fractions associated with seasonal cleaning activities 3 4 the character and volume of the www varies on a temporal basis with a pattern of high organic to inorganic load during the crush season and vice versa during the non crush period 5 in many countries including south africa australia and the united states www is often re used for irrigation of pastures or crops in water stressed areas unless adequately treated www may pose a threat to the soil environment and or groundwater 6 8 many treatment processes have been researched and or applied for the treatment of www including physicochemical processes biological processes membrane filtration and separation processes and advanced oxidation processes 9 membrane systems have not been widely adopted by the wine industry because of the high capital outlay and operating costs the propensity for membrane fouling and brine generation 10 11 physicochemical processes rely on either sedimentation precipitation coagulation flocculation or electrocoagulation 9 currently the most effective physicochemical and advanced oxidation processes require skilled to semi skilled labour chemical inputs create solid waste streams and need to be used in conjunction with biological treatment methods to achieve satisfactory organic removal rates 10 11 while biological systems such as rotating biological contactors upflow anaerobic sludge blankets and membrane bioreactors may be suited to larger wineries for biodegradation of www organics there is a global need for simple low maintenance cost effective systems at small wineries that do not have the finances or personnel to operate complex systems 9 many wineries utilise anaerobic or aerated ponds these are simple and cheap to operate however odour problems are associated with ponds and long hydraulic retention times hrts are required which translates into a large spatial footprint 12 13 constructed wetlands cws are an effective option if the www is diluted or mixed with domestic wastewater ww 14 15 the main drawback of cws is that poly phenolic rich effluent such as olive mill wastewater omww and www is phytotoxic 14 16 19 for example shepherd et al 19 demonstrated that gravel filled horizontal subsurface flow cws were able to achieve 97 cod removal when treating www with chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations 5000 mg l 1 but poor removal efficiency was achieved and plants died at cod concentrations of 12 800 16800 mg l 1 it can also be argued that the inclusion of plants in cws treating www is unnecessary because they play a limited role in reducing cod and suspended solids they require periodic harvesting and their roots can facilitate the formation of preferential flow paths 16 20 biological sand filters bsfs can be seen as unplanted cws the sand creates a physical substrate for biofilm attachment can adsorb pollutants catalyse chemical transformations and provide metabolic co factors the functional microorganisms within the biofilm are responsible for biotransformation biodegradation and mineralization of chemical pollutants 24 in a series of fundamental laboratory based experiments it was shown that simple bsfs containing ungraded locally available dune sand 21 were able to cope with the temporal nature of www and achieve reliable removal of organics including poly phenolics 22 23 to determine whether bsfs are viable for the treatment of www is a real world setting a pilot system was designed installed and operated at a wine farm in the stellenbosch area close to cape town south africa this manuscript details and analyses the performance of the system over approximately 27 months 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of pilot scale biological sand filtration system the bsf system consisted of a number of connected polyethylene pe containers a 5000 l collection tank a 500 l holding tank 4 1000 l sand filter modules and 4 100 l flow control tanks the system was connected to an existing 45 m3 baffled concrete solids settling delta fig 1 a a fraction of the www from the delta was treated and returned to the head of the delta thereby improving the quality of the www which was used to irrigate a sheep pasture the www from the cellar gravitated into the delta inlet and settled effluent was pumped from the delta outlet to the 5000 l collection tank using a shurflo pentair minneapolis usa 2088 313 145 12 v dc diaphragm premium demand solar pump the pump was controlled by a liquid level relay and a probe within the 5000 l collection tank which was set to fill the collection tank to 3800 l when the volume dropped to 2500 l the flow through the remainder of the system was controlled by gravity float valves and adjustable flow control tanks fig 1b the float valves and flow control tanks enabled the hlr to be automatically altered when the flow rates through the filters increased or decreased a constant head of 30 cm was maintained across each filter module the modules were filled with a locally available dune sand which had previously been well characterised and found to be suitable for use in bsf in terms of treatment capacity and hydraulic conductivity k 21 the system could be operated in parallel or series and was operated in parallel during the experimental period 2 2 sampling and characterisation of influent and effluent influent was defined as the grab ww samples from the 5000 l collection tank and the effluent as the final effluent fig 1 during the final year of the study the sampling regime was increased for more accurate assessment of bsf performance table 1 in addition to regular monthly or bi weekly analyses a once off batch test was performed which entailed hourly sampling table 1 in three scheduled sampling instances no samples could be taken due to operational problems dec 2015 jan 2016 mar 2016 2 2 1 determination of

rengasamy 26 and oster et al 8 2 3 calculation of operational parameters 2 3 1 flow rates and volume of wastewater treated the flow rate was determined by measuring the volume of water collected from the outlet over the period of one minute measurements were taken in triplicate averaged and converted into the daily flow rate q q was used to determine the volume of www treated and was estimated using 2 methods i the average of all the measured flow rates table 1 and ii a trapezoidal equation eq 1 that assumed a linear decrease or increase in q between measuring instances t 1 v o l n q n 1 t n 1 0 5 q n q n 1 t n 1 t n 2 3 2 hydraulic retention time hydraulic conductivity hydraulic loading rate organic loading rate the saturated cross sectional area at the discharge point was used in combination with the change in height h divided by the change in length l to determine k in terms of darcy s law eq 2 27 28 the hrt was determined using the volume v of liquid within a packed media divided by the flow rate as shown in eq 3 29 while the volume of liquid was determined by multiplying the porosity of the substrate by the volume of the reactor the hlr was expressed in two different ways i as the discharge rate of influent divided by the volume of the reactor l m 3 d 1 eq 4 and ii as the discharge rate divided by the cross sectional area of the reactor l m 2 d 1 which is the formula typically applied for reactors operated in horizontal mode eq 5 the organic loading rate olr was determined by multiplying the influent flow rate by the influent cod or bod concentration divided by the volume of reactor 29 eq 6 the functional saturated volume of sand was calculated using a formulated trapezoidal equation to determine the cross sectional area of the filter eq 7 the cross section was calculated by drawing a straight line between the height of the saturated zone at the inlet and the outlet the height of the saturated zones were determined by inserting pipes into the sand 2 q k a d h d l 3 h r t v l i q u i d q 4 h l r v q v r e a c t o r 5 h l r a q a c r o s s s e c t i o n 6 o l r c o d i n f l u e n t q v r e a c t o r 7 a 1070 x 10925 m m 2 3 results and discussion the bsf system is intended to improve the suitability of www for irrigation or discharge to the environment the system was commissioned in january 2015 and www was slowly added and drained intermittently over a 3 month start up period in order to allow the microbial communities to acclimate this incremental priming with www during start up has been shown to increase the treatment performance in experimental bsfs 30 a batch test was performed in august 2015 and regular sampling commenced in october 2015 the operational results over a further 24 months are presented in this manuscript but the system is still fully functional to date july 2018 3 1 operational parameters 3 1 1 hydraulic capacity in wineries www production spikes during the crush season with small spikes at other times of the year when cellar activities such as bottling are taking place two methods 2 3 1 were used to estimate the average daily volume of www that was treated 427 l day 1 and 402 l day 1 137 l m 3 of sand 1 the latter values calculated using eq 1 were used in all subsequent calculations the pilot system was not intended to treat the entire volume of www produced by the cellar nevertheless 22 was treated in addition the treated effluent was circulated back into the system thereby improving the quality of all the www used for irrigation by diluting the fresh www entering the delta with final effluent from the bsf system in terms of size sawis 31 broadly divides wineries into 6 categories depending on the amount of grapes crushed each year 100 tons 500 tons 1000 tons 10 000 tons the infrastructure of the bsf system shown in fig 1 can support 1 to 12 filter modules after which the capacity and footprint would need to be increased using eq 2 combined with a safety factor of 1 1 32 it was calculated that on an annual basis the infrastructure of the pilot bsf system is capable of treating the www from a cellar crushing 47 tons of grapes which could be extended to a cellar crushing 141 tons by maximising the number of filters to 12 8 w a t e r 4037 5 t 0 9243 3 1 2 hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic retention time decreases in permeability and porosity and changes in mass transport parameters due to the build up of functional biomass and solids retention cause increased k leading to decreased hrt in free flow porous ww treatment systems 33 some researchers have developed models to predict the extent of changes in k but none have been properly validated e g 33 34 this is probably because the extent of biomass accumulation differs according to the type of physical substrate the type of effluent being treated and in different spatial locations within the systems 35 in a previous study using sand filled columns treating synthetic www a 51 reduction in the k of dune sand from an initial value of 0 284 mm s 1 was determined experimentally in column experiments using the constant head method 21 as no solids were present in the synthetic www the reduction was attributed to biomass alone in this pilot study there was an 80 reduction in the calculated k of the dune sand from the initial value of 0 199 mm s 1 to the operational average of 0 040 mm s 1 the start up hrt for a single bsf module of 0 53 days was calculated using the initial flow rate q 1 900 l day 1 and porosity values 0 292 0 02 determined experimentally for the fresh dune sand thereafter the initial porosity and the average system flow rate q 402 l day 1 was used to calculate the average operational hrt of a single bsf module 2 1 days adjusted to 1 8 days to account for partial saturation of the sand and 11 5 days when including the collection tank and other infrastructure in the calculation this hrt was significantly shorter than the hrt of other biological systems used to treat www table 2 but did not account for any decrease in porosity it was not possible to accurately determine the operational k values because the changes in porosity were in a state of flux due to the constant formation and degradation of functional biomass 3 1 3 hydraulic and organic loading rates the hlr and olr in cws are typically calculated using the surface or cross sectional area but the total volume gives a better indication of the treatment efficiency of the medium 21 for example a slender vessel may have a high surface loading rate but relatively low overall loading rate while the converse is true for a wide shallow vessel the initial hlr values for overall and cross sectional loading of the sand filters were 646 l m 3sand day 1 and 1084 l m 2sand day 1 respectively in comparison the average operational values were 150 l m 3sand day 1 range 12 313 l m 3sand day 1 and 252 l m 2 sand day 1 range 21 526 l m 2sand day 1 respectively the 77 decrease from initial to operational hlr was due to accumulation of bio solids including functional biomass and was accompanied by increased cod removal rates 3 2 over a 10 week period achak et al 16 also described a reduction 50 in the hlr and improvement of organic removal rates in a vertical flow sand filter treating diluted omww with a starting hlr of 68 2 l m3sand day 1 in this case the authors terminated the study because they felt that the hlr of 5 0 l m3sand day 1 was inadequate some degree of biomass clogging is essential because the microbial population is the most important functional component for organic biodegradation 36 37 in reality there is a balance between the hlr and system performance if the hlr is too high treatment may be inefficient but if it is too low the spatial footprint and capital costs may render the system uneconomical high hlrs can be overcome by setting up systems that allow hydraulic flexibility and strategies such as intermittent operation and adjustment of loading rates have been proposed to minimise biomass clogging and increase the hlr 16 36 39 the variable nature of the olr seen in this study resulted from the www being generated from different seasonal cellar activities and is typical of all wineries the average olr over the study period was 152 gcod m 3sand day 1 range 23 469 gcod m 3sand day 1 or 256 gcod m 2sand day 1 range 39 788 gcod m 2sand day 1 for the total volume and surface area of the sand respectively after the start up period the hlr also fluctuated which suggested that the accumulation and degradation of organic solids and or biomass was in a state of flux fig 2 overall the pilot bsf system demonstrated resilience to synthetic www fluctuations which was also demonstrated in experimental systems treating synthetic www 22 3 2 performance evaluation 3 2 1 introduction the variable character of www may lead to temporal sampling bias when collecting influent and effluent 22 in this study the incoming www was balanced in the collection and holding tanks the hrt within the bsf filters was only 1 8 days section 3 1 1 it was therefore expected that there would be no significant sampling bias and short term temporal system fluctuations to confirm that the measured parameters were a true reflection of transformations effected within the bsfs for example removal efficiencies a once off batch test was performed this consisted of taking samples every hour for 4 h 5 sampling instances supplementary material 1 for the batch study no significant temporal differences anova p 0 5 were seen in the conductivity cod voa and total phenolic measurements in i the t 0 to t 4hr influent samples ii the t 0 to t 4hr effluent samples iii the t 0 to t 4hr samples taken separately from each of the individual bsf modules this indicated that the performance assessment results were valid however when comparing the results from the different bsf modules a significant difference in the cod and voa measurements anova p 0 05 was noted data not shown although the modules were set up in an identical manner and received the same www inter bsf module performance variability in terms of organic degradation was demonstrated 3 2 2 removal of chemical oxygen demand and selected organics the system achieved an average cod removal efficiency of 79 range 28 98 the average cod concentration in the final effluent n 35 was 287 mg l 1 range 24 1382 mg l 1 fig 3 a voas and ethanol constitute the highest fraction of the cod in www 5 voas can also be formed in bsfs from other organic molecules including phenolics sugars and ethanol 22 in this study the average voa concentrations in the influent and effluent were 472 8 mgaae l 1 range 9 4 1018 4 mgaae l 1 and 186 3 mgaae l 1 range 0 2 662 0 mgaae l 1 respectively with removal rates of 93 to 99 9 fig 3b the intermittent negative removal rates indicated formation of voas within the system phenolics in omww and www may be toxic to plants and microbes and should therefore be removed reduced before discharge of the ww to the environment 16 40 removal of these aromatic molecules in bsfs takes place via biotic and abiotic mechanisms and it has been shown that over 88 removal of poly phenolics with cod concentrations of 5842 mg l 1 can be achieved 24 achak et al 16 also demonstrated similar removal of phenolics from omww 87 97 with an influent cod concentration of 4590 mg l 1 in this study the average total phenolic concentration in the influent and effluent were 18 4 mggae l 1 range 5 1 43 7 mggae l 1 and 3 9 mggae l 1 range 0 09 16 6 respectively with average removal rates of 77 range 16 100 fig 3c in comparison to other simple www treatment systems the system performed well in terms of cod removal table 2 montalvo et al 41 used two adjacent pilot scale batch fed aeration lagoons to treat 790 l day 1 and 170 l day 1 of www with a similar olr to the pilot bsf both ponds removed 91 of the cod but the system required aeration which is costly mulidzi 42 achieved 60 and 80 cod removal for a cw with retention times of 7 and 14 days respectively however sub surface flow cws are more complex require additional maintenance and www is potentially toxic to cw plants 16 19 rozema et al 15 co treated domestic and www ratio 1 3 in a vertical flow cw and achieved 99 cod removal the system operated at a relatively low olr compared to the bsf in this study serrano et al 13 also co treated www with domestic ww with a cod reduction of 73 across a two stage cw fed by a hydrolytic upflow sludge bed followed by a horizontal flow cw it is difficult to compare these systems with the bsf used in this study because of the presence of domestic ww domestic ww has a high carbon to nitrogen ratio in comparison to www therefore an advantage of this type of co treatment is that the domestic ww may enhance microbial activity because of the addition of nutrients to the www a disadvantage is the potential introduction of pathogens 3 2 3 neutralization of acidic winery wastewater the ph in the influent ranged from 4 55 to 7 95 while the ph of the effluent ranged from 6 63 to 8 69 fig 4 even the formation of voas in the system did not lead to an increase in the acidity of the effluent this effective neutralisation of the acidic www was attributed to both abiotic and biotic mechanisms the mineral calcite formed from calcium carbonate was present in the dune sand with calcium constituting 17 6 wt wt of the sand 21 in this study there was an average increase of 82 from the influent to the effluent which provided evidence of calcite dissolution as an abiotic neutralisation mechanism 44 www was also neutralised in experimental bsfs containing river sand that did not contain calcite or aluminosilicates 43 strongly suggesting that biotic neutralisation mechanisms also exist 3 2 4 inorganics sodium hydroxide is widely used as a cleaning agent and disinfectant in wineries and www can contain high concentrations of sodium 21 the cation binds to one negatively charged soil particle causing a tight arrangement which reduces infiltration of water into soils 45 potassium has a similar effect but not to the same magnitude 46 calcium and magnesium are divalent cations which bind to more than one negatively charged soil particle creating a matrix within the soil which allows for aeration and infiltration 45 47 the presence of divalent cations can therefore offset the detrimental effects of monovalent cations such as sodium the sar is a parameter that is widely used to assess the potential of water to cause sodicity and takes into account the concentration of sodium calcium and magnesium 48 according to the u s salinity laboratory 49 soil with an sar 13 is considered sodic 50 and horneck et al 51 state that soils with a sar 5 5 13 and 13 pose low medium and high risks respectively however the sar does not take into account the effect of potassium on soil dispersion which is relevant for www that can contain elevated levels of potassium sodium calcium and magnesium 45 the cross is a sodicity indicator that was derived by rengasamy and sumner 52 to overcome this limitation this ratio is more suitable for monitoring the effects of www on the soil structure 45 laurenson et al 48 suggested a maximum cross of 20 for disposal of www to the environment the authors found an average cross of 9 2 range 2 5 13 3 in www from 8 different wineries in australia the average influent and effluent concentrations of magnesium were 4 5 mg l 1 range 1 6 10 2 mg l 1 and 4 5 mg l 1 range 1 3 10 1 mg l 1 respectively while the average influent and effluent concentrations of potassium were 121 7 mg l 1 range 17 3 284 9 mg l 1 and 126 8 mg l 1 range 25 9 302 9 mg l 1 respectively data not shown the average sodium concentrations of the influent and effluent samples fig 5 a were 29 6 mg l 1 range 10 6 70 8 mg l 1 and 29 8 mg l 1 range 10 0 62 9 mg l 1 respectively in cws containing clay salts may be removed by physicochemical processes 53 but in this instance the sand did not contain clay particles and the data showed that neither magnesium potassium nor sodium were removed by the system in contrast the calcium concentration fig 5a showed an average 1 8 fold increase in concentration from influent to effluent of 36 2 mg l 1 range 96 6 104 0 mg l 1 to 65 7 mg l 1 range 14 7 200 3 mg l 1 this was attributed to the dissolution of calcite as discussed in 3 2 3 there was a highly significant p 0 005 negative correlation 0 37 between the ph of the influent samples and the change in calcium concentration from influent to effluent fig 5b this strongly suggested that the calcium dissolution rates increased with an increase in acidity the bsf system achieved an average decrease in the sar 13 and cross 12 from influent to effluent n 31 fig 5c this decrease in sar and cross improved the quality of the final effluent for soil application the cross values in the effluent were all below the limit of 20 suggested by laurenson et al 48 for irrigation with www crops such as banana musasapientum and lucerne medicago sativa have a remarkable ability to accumulate potassium 54 recent studies have also shown the ability of sugar beet to take up na 55 it is envisaged that www should be used for beneficial irrigation of these or other halophytic crops after treatment in bsfs 3 3 major nutrients the average total nitrogen n and phosphate p fig 6 in the influent was 1 6 mg l 1 range 0 5 10 4 mg l 1 and 2 4 mg l 1 range 0 86 3 98 mg l 1 respectively www is known to be deficient in n and p 5 and these may be added to assist bioremediation 56 58 for example researchers have dosed raw www with nutrients to attain cod n p ratios of 502 5 1 59 400 7 1 12 and 30 60 2 1 60 in this study no nutrients were added the influent cod n p ratio was 1138 1 6 2 4 n 17 exhibiting a particular n deficiency high carbon c n ratio it has been shown that bacterial n fixation can take place in systems treating high c n ww such as that from the paper and pulp industry 61 and synthetic ww 62 this could explain why the cod removal efficiency in the bsf system was high despite the nutrient limitation in the influent 4 conclusion this study showed that the bsf system is a viable option for the treatment of www at small cellars the capex and running costs were low the system was sustainable required minimal maintenance and did not need skilled labour to operate future designs will focus on creating greater treatment capacity and removing salts for example different modes of operation will be tested continuous v s batch mode vertical flow and the treated effluent will be used for beneficial irrigation of salt accumulating crops in order to reduce the

14519,exfoliated graphite eg has been receiving much global attention in the last decade because of the growing number of potential applications however the production of eg has several disadvantages such as requiring more than one chemical compound consuming more chemical quantity time and energy etc here we report a simple low cost one compound based rapid and efficient production of eg using microwave irradiation technique as prepared eg material shows multifunctional outstanding performance including adsorption of various toxic organic dyes and absorption of various organic solvents as well as oils the maximum adsorption capacity reaches 384 6 10 2 222 32 8 6 151 51 9 2 and 196 08 5 4 mg g for malachite green mg methylene blue mb rhodamine 6 g rh6 g and congo red cr dyes at equilibrium it shows an efficient flow through filtration of dye contaminated water showing potential as the best technique for industrial waste water treatment it absorbs 40 120 g of various chemical solvents and oils per one gram of eg to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on single compound based rapid and efficient synthesis of eg in about one minute with multifunctional outstanding application performance keywords carbon materials porous materials exfoliated graphite adsorption and absorption 1 introduction the exponential rise of human population coupled with industrialization causes severe environmental pollution mainly water resources due to considerable depletion in useful water sources present on the earth it is essential to protect them 1 3 organic dyes are one of the major pollutants which are extensively used by many industries such as textile paper printing leather food cosmetics etc and discharging waste water containing dyes directly into the surrounding atmosphere dyes in wastewater are very difficult to treat because they are resistant to aerobic digestion recalcitrant organic molecules and are stable to light 1 the presence of dyes even in very low concentration is highly visible and produces toxic products that can cause severe problems to environment as well as all forms of life 4 5 several methods have been developed for treatment of water contaminated with dyes 6 9 among all adsorption is one of the most efficient process due to its ease of operation cost effectiveness low residue formation and the possibility of recycling the adsorbent materials 6 various adsorbent materials such as activated carbon ac 10 11 graphite oxide go 12 13 reduced graphene oxide rgo 14 16 multiwalled carbon nanotubes 17 zeolites 18 metal oxides 19 20 metal organic frameworks 21 nano membranes 22 and polymers 23 etc have been used for water purification however these materials exhibit several drawbacks such as high production cost difficult process for large scale separation of dyes from water after treatment and are not suitable for removal of all dyes therefore the problem is still challenging for purification of dye contaminated water moreover the increase in the usage as well as transport of oils and chemical solvents leakage of chemicals or oil spillage by accidents occur most commonly worldwide and is considered as another type of major pollution such accidents can spoil our living environment coastal area e g the gulf of mexico oil spill accident in 2010 and can also cause a significant loss of valuable natural resources 24 exfoliated graphite eg refers to graphite upon expansion along c axis up to several hundred times it has excellent mechanical electrical thermal dielectric and other properties making it as promising candidate for potential applications 25 28 the production of eg using h2so4 29 31 or hno3 32 or hclo4 33 35 as the intercalation agent in combination with potassium permanganate or ammonium persulphate or nitric acid or hydrogen peroxide as the oxidation agent followed by conventional or microwave heating or room temperature has been studied so far however the overall production of eg from these methods has several disadvantages firstly synthesis process involving too many difficult steps such as requiring more quantity of chemicasl and time for intercalation of ngf with more than one chemical compound at various conditions water washing drying and thermal or microwave expansion which will lead to large quantities of chemicals time water and energy consumption etc secondly the excessive usage of chemicals and washing will not only consume a lot of water resources can also cause adverse effects to the environment thirdly although the direct preparation of eg by microwave irradiation technique or at room temperature is possible the final product offers low quantity of exfoliated volume with certain amount of residue formation finally in conclusion the low exfoliated volume and formation of residue in the eg shows poor application performance especially in waste water purification these drawbacks limit eg s usefulness to explore wide range of potential applications therefore it is a great challenge to seek a more simpler large scale and less polluting approach to produce eg for wide range of applications in this study we report a very inexpensive one compound based production of eg using microwave heating technique in about one minute 60 70 sec the merits of present study over the previous are very simple process inexpensive low consumption of chemicals time as well as energy very light weight high exfoliated volume and yet showing excellent performance over wide range of applications the as prepared eg material shows an efficient adsorption of various dyes including malachite green mg methylene blue mb rhodamine 6 g rh6 g and congo red cr in aqueous solutions and rapid absorption of various chemical solvents and oils to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on single compound based rapid and efficient synthesis of eg about one minute with multifunctional outstanding application performance 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of exfoliated graphite eg natural graphite flakes ngf of 500 mg average particle size of 500micron were added into diluted perchloric acid 1 g of 60 hclo4 and mixed for 10s it form graphite intercalation compound gic due to quick absorption of acid by graphite flakes gics were directly placed into a domestic microwave oven samsung ce103vd operated at 800w for 50 60s microwave heating causes quick evaporation of intercalated species in the gics resulting in fuming and sparking of gic which forms highly porous worm like structured material called exfoliated graphite eg also the same amount of gics was placed under conventional tubular furnace at 1000 c for 60 s called conventional process for comparison purpose eg c moreover graphite oxide 36 and reduced graphene oxide 37 were also prepared using conventional methodsfor comparing the adsorption performance with eg 2 2 characterization the surface morphology of ngf gic and eg was recorded using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem ultra 55 fesem carl zeiss the structural analysis of ngf gic and eg was carried out with x ray diffraction xrd using rich seifert iso debyefle 202 diffractometer with cukα λ 1 54184 radiation uv vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm on a shimadzu uv 3600 double beam spectrophotometer with an appropriate baseline correction and set to zero absorbance at 800 nm the bet surface area of the eg samples was determined by nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 k using a surface area analyzer autosorb1csystem quantachrome usa a nicolet nexus 670 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrometer was used to identify the functional groups of the eg material in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the exfoliated volume of the eg was defined as volume occupied to the weight of eg in detail known quantity of eg material was filled without any gaps in a volume measuring jar and measured the total volume occupied by the eg the observed values are the arithmetic mean of five experimentally measured values according to the above procedure 2 3 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments were performed on a magnetic stirrer with a constant stirring speed of 300r p m in a typical experiment 50 ml of dye solution was stirred with the addition of 5 mg for malachite green mg and 10 mg for methylene blue mb congo red cr and rhodamine r6g dyes of eg for 60 min the initial concentration of all the dyes used for the adsorption study was 20 mg l the time dependent adsorption studies of eg for all four dyes were carried out up to 60 min with an equal interval of 10 min the adsorption of mg dye was studied by adding 5 mg of as prepared eg conventional eg eg c h2so4 based eg eg sa residue formed eg eg r go rgo and commercial ac for comparison the effect of solution ph on the adsorption was studied in a ph range of 2 0 10 0 at room temperature the solution ph was adjusted with a 0 1 m hno3 or naoh solution the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption was studied with 0 1m 0 5 m nacl concentration the adsorption of the dye by the adsorbent was described by the following a d s o r p t i o n c 0 c e c 0 x 100 the adsorption capacity of dye by the adsorbent at equilibrium qe mg g was calculated according to the following q e c 0 c e v m where co and ce mg l are the liquid phase concentration of dye at initial and equilibrium respectively v is the volume of the solution in l and m is the weight of the adsorbent in g 2 4 adsorption kinetics to identify the mechanism of the adsorption process and rate constants the conventional pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were used 4 5 the pseudo first order model is expressed by the following equation ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t the slope and intercept of the linear plot of ln qe qt against t yield the values of k1 and qe the pseudo second order model is expressed by the following equation t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are defined as adsorption capacity of dye by the adsorbent at equilibrium and time t min and k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order model of adsorption g mg min the slope and intercept of the linear plot of t qt against t yield the values of qe and k2 2 5 adsorption isotherm the dye concentrations in the range of 10 40 mg l were used to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacities of all dyes by eg at four different conditions such as normal ph 6 ph 2 0 5 m nacl and both ph 2 0 5 m nacl conditions at room temperature the linear langmuir adsorption isotherm equation can be expressed as follows 38 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max k l is the langmuir constant l mg which is related to the affinity of the energy of adsorption and qmax indicates the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent material mg g the values of qmax and k l are obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of ce qe against ce the dimensionless separation factor rl is also an important parameter which indicates the favorability of the adsorption processand is defined as 39 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 is the initial dye concentration mg l based on the value of rl the adsorption process can be assumed to be irreversible rl 0 favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 2 6 flow through adsorption experiments 2 6 1 individual pollutants filter the flow through adsorption of individual dyes 20 mg l initial concentration was studied by using glass filter of 50 cm length and 18 cm diameter filled with 250 mg of eg the individual dyesolution was passed flow rate of 8 10 ml min 1 through from one end of the vertically aligned glass tube the colored dye solution was translated into pure water while coming from other end of the glass tube the final filtered solution obtained was found to be completely pure water as confirmed by uv vis spectroscopy analysis mixture of both pollutants filter the all four dyes of equal weights were mixed to prepare final concentration of 20 mg l the flow through experiments were carried out according to the above procedure 2 7 recycling test the eg adsorption cyclic stability was investigated by flow through experiments for 5 cycles the cyclic performance of individual or mixture of all dyes onto eg was performed 250 ml of dye solution all four dyes was passed through upper opened end of vertically aligned glass filter of 50 cm length and 18 cm diameter filled with 250 mg of eg with a flow rate 8 10 ml min 1 it was confirmed by uv vis absorption spectra that the water coming from other end of the tube was completely pure for the next cycle we passed 25 ml of methyl alcohol solution followed by 25 ml deionised water through the glass tube to wash the eg containing dye again 250 ml of dye solution was passed through the filter and observed same quality of purified water as outcome product the procedure was repeated for 5 cycles and obtained same quality of purified water was confirmed by uv vis spectroscopy analysis 2 8 oils and organic solvents absorption the absorption of oils as well as organic solvents by eg was studied according to procedure 3 known quantity of eg material was taken on a mesh and the liquid was allowed drop wise on to the eg until it come out from the mesh and then the eg was removed from the mesh for measurements weight gain was calculated by the following expression a m o u n t a b s o r b e d p e r u n i t w e i g h t g g m m 0 m 0 where m0 and m are the weights of the eg before and after absorption respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of eg perchloric acid pa acts as both intercalation as well as oxidizing agent during the intercalation and exfoliation process pa quickly enters between the layers of the graphite and evaporates more easily during heat treatment because of its low viscosity and boiling point we performed experiments with 60 diluted pa at room temperature to avoid over oxidation the maximum exfoliated volume ev of eg obtained was 524 ml g with the weight g ratio of 0 5 0 8 for ngf pa the ev 375 ml g was obtained under conventional process exfoliation process is a bulk phenomenon and could be easily verified without doing any characterization the digital photographs of gics before and after exfoliation under mwi are presented see fig s1 in supplementary material it could be concluded that a successful exfoliation of chemically treated graphite flakes could be obtained under mwi fig 1 a d shows the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem images of as received ngf gic and eg flat flake like morphology of ngf could be seen in fig 1a the acid treated graphite flakes called gic as seen in fig 1b indicate that intercalation with perchloric acid did not damage the graphite flakes after successful exfoliation of gics under microwave irradiation a huge volume expansion of graphite flakes occurred and the morphology of resulting eg could be seen in fig 1c the eg microstructure resembles the vermiform in shape with loose and porous or worm like structure the magnified image of highly porous eg can be seen in fig 1d the xrd patterns of eg along with ngf and gic are presented in fig 2 a it was observed that the diffraction pattern of ngf shows two characteristic peaks at 26 530 and 54 80 corresponding to 002 and 004 reflections respectively as shown in fig 2a the highly intense sharp and symmetrical peak of ngf designates the crystalline nature of graphite flakes once the flakes were treated with perchloric acid and form gic the peak corresponding to 002 reflection of gic shifted towards the lower angle and exhibits at 26 130 which comes from increase in interlayer spacing caused by oxidation as well intercalation of the graphite flakes after successful exfoliation eg exhibits 002 reflection peak eg at 26 630 as shown in fig 2a which almost coincides with the peak observed in ngf but eg demonstrates large full width at half maxima fwhm and lower intensity when compared to the gic and ngf which is attributed to the increase in crystal defects and a resulting decrease in crystallinity from the bragg s law the maximum intensity d spacing values calculated for ngf gic and eg are 3 35 3 40 and 3 34 å respectively the moderate increase in d spacing value of gic indicates partial intercalation moreover the xrd data on gic are well explained by stage phenomena which is characterized by the number of graphene layers between adjacent intercalate layers 40 gic are thus classified by a stage number n could be calculated from the highly intense 00l reflection peak by using the expression l n 1 41 according to the expression the formation of gic was stage 1 the average stacking height lc of graphite microcrystallites was calculated by scherrer equation the lc values determined for ngf gic and eg are 587 274 and 50 å respectively the intercalation due to quick absorption of perchloric acid by the graphite flakes results in the insertion of acid between the layers due to absorption graphite flakes did not show any changes fig 2a as a result there is no change in the xrd pattern of gic but intensity of the peak decreases compared with graphite flakes due to insertion of perchloric acid between the layers ftir spectra of as received and after adsorption under normal condition of eg are shown in fig 2b ftir spectra of eg exhibits the bands at 1632 1365 1108 and 3351 cm 1 attributed to in plane vibration cc from un oxidized sp2 cc bonds 42 oh deformation of coh group n co stretching vibrations mode 43 and hydroxyl group designates the existence of oxygen containing functional groups such as carbonyl carboxylic epoxy and hydroxyl respectively after adsorption of each dye under normal condition ph 6 at room temperature the eg powder was collected and air dried for 12 h at room temperature the dried eg powder of each dye was taken the spectra and indicated as mg mb r6g and cr as shown in fig 2b it was observed that the eg band positions was changed after adsorption more details provided in the mechanism section in order to study the surface characteristics surface area total pore volume and pore size of eg the brunauer emmett teller bet gas adsorption method was used here we compared surface properties of eg prepared with mwi and conventional heating technique nitrogen adsorption desorption and pore distribution analysis of eg prepared by mwi and conventional techniques are shown in fig 3 a b the bet surface area and cumulative pore volume of as prepared eg with mwi and conventional were 66 4 32 6 m2 g 0 180437 and 0 061793 cm3 g respectively the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of both types of eg exhibit type iv isotherm according to iupac classification indicating the mesoporous nature of the material 44 the average pore size for both mwi and conventional eg was approximately 21 46 and 13 57 nm respectively 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of time ph and ionic strength time dependent adsorption experiments were carried out to evaluate the equilibrium adsorption time it was observed that initially the rate of adsorption was very rapid due to the availability of more active sites to capture the dye molecules but further increase in contact time shows a moderate increase in adsorption may be due to difficulty faced by ions to occupy remaining active sites because of the repulsive force between the solute molecules of the solid and bulk phase 45 as shown in fig 4 a moreover the slow uptake of dyes at later stage may also be due to intraparticle diffusion process dominating over adsorption 46 47 comparison mg adsorption performance of various adsorbent materials with present study is shown in fig 4b the effect of solution ph 2 to 10 and ionic strength on the adsorption was investigated see fig s2 in supplementary material at high ph values the surface of eg gets positively charged and can remove negatively charged cationic dyes faster the removal efficiency of dyes increases with increasing ionic strength from 0 1 m to 0 5 m the increased adsorption capacity by the addition of salt can be ascribed to the aggregation of dye molecules induced by the increase of interactive forces by salt ions 48 i e salt ions push dye molecules to aggregate thereby resulting in increasing the extent of sorption and so on the uv vis absorption spectra analysis of all four dyes onto eg at equilibrium was performed see fig s3 in supplementary material digital photographs of aqueous solution of each dye before and after adsorption is presented see fig s4 in supplementary material 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetic studies were thoroughly performed to get the important information about rate and mechanism of the adsorption the pseudo first order see fig s5 in supplementary material and pseudo second order see fig s6 in supplementary material adsorption plots for all dyes and their corresponding equilibrium adsorption qe cal rate constants k1 and k2 and correlation coefficient r2 values are presented in table ts1 in supplementary material it was observed that the qe cal values of pseudo first order model for all four dyes are far from the experimental values however the qe cal values of the pseudo second order model for all four dyes are approximately close to the experimental qmax value it concludes that the adsorption process could be well demonstrated by the pseudo second order model a similar conclusion was made in the previous reports on the adsorption of mb 49 3 2 3 adsorption isotherm in order to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity of eg standard linear langmuir adsorption isotherm equations were used 50 fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherm plots of mg fig 5a and mb fig 5b at four different conditions such as normal ph 6 ph 10 or 2 0 5 m nacl and both 0 5 m nacl ph 10 or 2 rh6 g at normal and ph 2 fig 5c and cr at normal and 0 5 m nacl fig 5d fig 6 shows the langmuir adsorption isotherms of mg fig 6a and mb fig 6b at four different conditions rh6 g fig 6c at normal and ph 2 and cr fig 6d at normal and 0 5 m nacl and their corresponding values are presented see table ts2 in supplementary material the maximum adsorption values qmax obtained for all four dyes are 384 6 and 222 32 mg g at both condition for mg and mb dyes 151 51 mg g at ph 2 for rh6 g dye and 196 08 mg g at 0 5 m nacl for cr dye respectively which are much higher than the previously reported adsorbents see table 1 it was observed that both mg and mb are cationic dyes but show different adsorption characteristics under solution ph the maximum adsorption of mg occurred at solution ph 10 whereas mb at ph 2 this is may be due to different types of functional groups present on each dye however the detailed mechanism has to be studied the recycling adsorption performance of eg for all dyes was carried out by flow through adsorption experiments see fig s8 in supplementary material the eg material shows excellent recycling stability for 5cycles fig 7 b 3 2 4 absorption of chemical solvents and oils previous reports 51 53 stated that eg is a prospective material to be used to sorb oils from a water surface the sorption capacity of eg mainly depends on pore structure which has been related with different parameters such as exfoliation volume pore volume pore size and its distribution etc 54 generally bulk eg has three kinds of pores large spaces among worm like particles wedge shaped pores on the surface of the particles and ellipsoidal pores inside the particles 55 it has been studied by shen et al 56 that the sorption of heavy oil by eg is mainly due to the space among worm like particles of eg here we performed sorption experiments with various types of chemical solvents and oils on eg by drop cast method it has been observed that the absorption of solvents and oils by eg increases its own weight by 40 to 130 times as shown in fig 7a its absorption efficiency values are much higher than that of spongy graphene 57 and hydrophobic chemical mechanical planarization hcmp polymers 58 the absorption process of various solvents as well as oils is shown by digital photographs see fig s7 in supplementary material 3 2 5 adsorption mechanisms the possible mechanisms of adsorption of all dyes onto eg material are mainly depending on electrostatic interaction vander waals forces of interaction n π interaction π π interaction pore distribution and hydrogen bonding formation based on solution ph ionic strength bet analysis and ftir spectra analysis observation from the section 3 2 1 it was observed that the adsorption of dyes was changed either by changing solution ph or ionic strength indicating that strong electrostatic interaction and ion exchange mechanism occurs between eg and dye molecules as shown in fig 8 i hydrogen bonding interactions can occur in the eg dye system by two possible ways 1 between surface hydrogen i e hydroxyl oh or carboxyl cooh functional groups of eg and the appropriate atoms i e nitrogen or oxygen or chlorine or other h acceptor of dye this phenomenon is also known as dipole dipole h bonding fig 8iii and 2 between surface functional groups of eg and the aromatic rings in dye molecules this phenomenon is also known as yoshida h bonding fig 8iv from the ftir spectra it was observed that the peak corresponding to oh groups of eg present at 3351 cm 1 is shifted to 3433 cm 1 after adsorption the shift in the peaks to the higher side suggested the existence of both dipole dipole and yoshida hydrogen bonding interactions 59 n π interactions or n π electron donor acceptor interactions were newly proposed by mattson et al 60 in these interactions the carbonyl oxygen functionalities on the eg surface act as electron donors and the aromatic rings of dye act as the electron acceptors fig 8vi the ftir spectra of eg revealed that the c o peak position changes after adsorption the shift in c o peak position after adsorption indicates possible n π interactions 61 however the h bonding and n p interactions based on oxygen containing functional groups i e cooh and oh present on the surface of eg might not be a dominant mechanism due to the limitation of the density of these oxygen groups on the eg s surface π π interactions or π π electron donor acceptor interactions between the π electrons of a carbonaceous material and the π electrons of the aromatic rings of an adsorbate were originally proposed by coughlin and ezra 62 the structure of each dye molecule possesses at least one polar functional group electron withdrawing on the benzene ring these functional groups often act as strong electron acceptors therefore the existence of strong π π interactions between eg and dye is expected fig 8v this was confirmed experimentally by the ftir analysis of eg the peak belonging to the in plane vibration of the aromatic cc bonds shifted towards higher wavenumbers after adsorption indicating the presence of π π interactions between the benzene rings of dye and the graphene planes and is good agreement with the previous report 63 graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon and has a two dimensional layered structure in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern within each layer called graphene layers graphene layers are linked together by a weak vander walls forces permanent dipole induced dipole forces and london dispersion forces produced by a delocalized π orbital 64 the strength of vander waals forces of an adsorbed molecule is relative to its contact surface area of the adsorbent and also the van der waals index specific to the adsorbent surface 65 the eg surface of carbonaceous adsorbents has a very high van der waals index graphite has a higher van der waals index than paraffin or teflon does 65 and the dye molecule has a great planar ring structure therefore strong van der waals forces are prone to take place between the dye molecule and the eg surface of adsorbents fig 8ii the adsorption not only depends on surface area but also on pore structure of the material it was observed that the adsorption strongly depends on exfoliated volume ev of eg especially the length of the exfoliated graphite flake called worm the performance of mg adsorption was compared with four different types of eg materials fig 9 shows the model diagram for adsorption of mg dye based on length of eg worm under same weight it was observed that the eg materials prepared based on h2so4 or hno3 or hclo4 as the intercalation agent combination with liquid oxidant materials like hno3 or h2o2 shows moderate high adsorption due to less ev whereas solid oxidant materials like kmno4 or k2cr2o7 or nh4 2s2o8 shows low adsorption due to less ev as well as residue formation see table ts3 in supplementary material in case of solid oxide materials the eg pores filled by these solid oxide particles results poor adsorption performance due to limited occupancy for dye molecule it concludes that the eg with more ev has dominant adsorption mechanism based on random pore distribution and vander waals forces of interaction moreover the performance of mg dye performance was compared with the high surface area materials like go rgo and ac see table ts3 in supplementary material it was observed that eg performs well compared to go rgo and ac another problem with these nanomaterials is separation from water after treatment here we used stainless steel mess of 300 size to separate eg from water after adsorption 4 conclusions in conclusion a rapid and efficient one compound perchloric acid based exfoliated graphite material has been produced by microwave irradiation technique in about one minute 60 70 sec during the intercalation process perchloric acid quickly enters into the layers of graphite flakes and form gic up on rapid microwave heating gics exfoliated successfully resulting in highly porous worm like structured materials called eg with the exfoliation volume of 524 mg l an inexpensive and easily available starting material such as graphite flakes facilitates production of large scale uniform exfoliation of graphite material showing superior performance in efficient removal of various organic pollutants from aqueous solutions and quick absorption of broad range of chemical solvents as well as oils due to bulk nature of exfoliated graphite it can be easily separated from water after adsorption process the flow through filtration of dye solutions with excellent recycling indicates excellent suitable material for industrial waste water purification acknowledgements the authors thank mncf facility of centre of nanoscience and

14519,exfoliated graphite eg has been receiving much global attention in the last decade because of the growing number of potential applications however the production of eg has several disadvantages such as requiring more than one chemical compound consuming more chemical quantity time and energy etc here we report a simple low cost one compound based rapid and efficient production of eg using microwave irradiation technique as prepared eg material shows multifunctional outstanding performance including adsorption of various toxic organic dyes and absorption of various organic solvents as well as oils the maximum adsorption capacity reaches 384 6 10 2 222 32 8 6 151 51 9 2 and 196 08 5 4 mg g for malachite green mg methylene blue mb rhodamine 6 g rh6 g and congo red cr dyes at equilibrium it shows an efficient flow through filtration of dye contaminated water showing potential as the best technique for industrial waste water treatment it absorbs 40 120 g of various chemical solvents and oils per one gram of eg to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on single compound based rapid and efficient synthesis of eg in about one minute with multifunctional outstanding application performance keywords carbon materials porous materials exfoliated graphite adsorption and absorption 1 introduction the exponential rise of human population coupled with industrialization causes severe environmental pollution mainly water resources due to considerable depletion in useful water sources present on the earth it is essential to protect them 1 3 organic dyes are one of the major pollutants which are extensively used by many industries such as textile paper printing leather food cosmetics etc and discharging waste water containing dyes directly into the surrounding atmosphere dyes in wastewater are very difficult to treat because they are resistant to aerobic digestion recalcitrant organic molecules and are stable to light 1 the presence of dyes even in very low concentration is highly visible and produces toxic products that can cause severe problems to environment as well as all forms of life 4 5 several methods have been developed for treatment of water contaminated with dyes 6 9 among all adsorption is one of the most efficient process due to its ease of operation cost effectiveness low residue formation and the possibility of recycling the adsorbent materials 6 various adsorbent materials such as activated carbon ac 10 11 graphite oxide go 12 13 reduced graphene oxide rgo 14 16 multiwalled carbon nanotubes 17 zeolites 18 metal oxides 19 20 metal organic frameworks 21 nano membranes 22 and polymers 23 etc have been used for water purification however these materials exhibit several drawbacks such as high production cost difficult process for large scale separation of dyes from water after treatment and are not suitable for removal of all dyes therefore the problem is still challenging for purification of dye contaminated water moreover the increase in the usage as well as transport of oils and chemical solvents leakage of chemicals or oil spillage by accidents occur most commonly worldwide and is considered as another type of major pollution such accidents can spoil our living environment coastal area e g the gulf of mexico oil spill accident in 2010 and can also cause a significant loss of valuable natural resources 24 exfoliated graphite eg refers to graphite upon expansion along c axis up to several hundred times it has excellent mechanical electrical thermal dielectric and other properties making it as promising candidate for potential applications 25 28 the production of eg using h2so4 29 31 or hno3 32 or hclo4 33 35 as the intercalation agent in combination with potassium permanganate or ammonium persulphate or nitric acid or hydrogen peroxide as the oxidation agent followed by conventional or microwave heating or room temperature has been studied so far however the overall production of eg from these methods has several disadvantages firstly synthesis process involving too many difficult steps such as requiring more quantity of chemicasl and time for intercalation of ngf with more than one chemical compound at various conditions water washing drying and thermal or microwave expansion which will lead to large quantities of chemicals time water and energy consumption etc secondly the excessive usage of chemicals and washing will not only consume a lot of water resources can also cause adverse effects to the environment thirdly although the direct preparation of eg by microwave irradiation technique or at room temperature is possible the final product offers low quantity of exfoliated volume with certain amount of residue formation finally in conclusion the low exfoliated volume and formation of residue in the eg shows poor application performance especially in waste water purification these drawbacks limit eg s usefulness to explore wide range of potential applications therefore it is a great challenge to seek a more simpler large scale and less polluting approach to produce eg for wide range of applications in this study we report a very inexpensive one compound based production of eg using microwave heating technique in about one minute 60 70 sec the merits of present study over the previous are very simple process inexpensive low consumption of chemicals time as well as energy very light weight high exfoliated volume and yet showing excellent performance over wide range of applications the as prepared eg material shows an efficient adsorption of various dyes including malachite green mg methylene blue mb rhodamine 6 g rh6 g and congo red cr in aqueous solutions and rapid absorption of various chemical solvents and oils to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on single compound based rapid and efficient synthesis of eg about one minute with multifunctional outstanding application performance 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of exfoliated graphite eg natural graphite flakes ngf of 500 mg average particle size of 500micron were added into diluted perchloric acid 1 g of 60 hclo4 and mixed for 10s it form graphite intercalation compound gic due to quick absorption of acid by graphite flakes gics were directly placed into a domestic microwave oven samsung ce103vd operated at 800w for 50 60s microwave heating causes quick evaporation of intercalated species in the gics resulting in fuming and sparking of gic which forms highly porous worm like structured material called exfoliated graphite eg also the same amount of gics was placed under conventional tubular furnace at 1000 c for 60 s called conventional process for comparison purpose eg c moreover graphite oxide 36 and reduced graphene oxide 37 were also prepared using conventional methodsfor comparing the adsorption performance with eg 2 2 characterization the surface morphology of ngf gic and eg was recorded using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem ultra 55 fesem carl zeiss the structural analysis of ngf gic and eg was carried out with x ray diffraction xrd using rich seifert iso debyefle 202 diffractometer with cukα λ 1 54184 radiation uv vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm on a shimadzu uv 3600 double beam spectrophotometer with an appropriate baseline correction and set to zero absorbance at 800 nm the bet surface area of the eg samples was determined by nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 k using a surface area analyzer autosorb1csystem quantachrome usa a nicolet nexus 670 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrometer was used to identify the functional groups of the eg material in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the exfoliated volume of the eg was defined as volume occupied to the weight of eg in detail known quantity of eg material was filled without any gaps in a volume measuring jar and measured the total volume occupied by the eg the observed values are the arithmetic mean of five experimentally measured values according to the above procedure 2 3 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments were performed on a magnetic stirrer with a constant stirring speed of 300r p m in a typical experiment 50 ml of dye solution was stirred with the addition of 5 mg for malachite green mg and 10 mg for methylene blue mb congo red cr and rhodamine r6g dyes of eg for 60 min the initial concentration of all the dyes used for the adsorption study was 20 mg l the time dependent adsorption studies of eg for all four dyes were carried out up to 60 min with an equal interval of 10 min the adsorption of mg dye was studied by adding 5 mg of as prepared eg conventional eg eg c h2so4 based eg eg sa residue formed eg eg r go rgo and commercial ac for comparison the effect of solution ph on the adsorption was studied in a ph range of 2 0 10 0 at room temperature the solution ph was adjusted with a 0 1 m hno3 or naoh solution the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption was studied with 0 1m 0 5 m nacl concentration the adsorption of the dye by the adsorbent was described by the following a d s o r p t i o n c 0 c e c 0 x 100 the adsorption capacity of dye by the adsorbent at equilibrium qe mg g was calculated according to the following q e c 0 c e v m where co and ce mg l are the liquid phase concentration of dye at initial and equilibrium respectively v is the volume of the solution in l and m is the weight of the adsorbent in g 2 4 adsorption kinetics to identify the mechanism of the adsorption process and rate constants the conventional pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were used 4 5 the pseudo first order model is expressed by the following equation ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t the slope and intercept of the linear plot of ln qe qt against t yield the values of k1 and qe the pseudo second order model is expressed by the following equation t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are defined as adsorption capacity of dye by the adsorbent at equilibrium and time t min and k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order model of adsorption g mg min the slope and intercept of the linear plot of t qt against t yield the values of qe and k2 2 5 adsorption isotherm the dye concentrations in the range of 10 40 mg l were used to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacities of all dyes by eg at four different conditions such as normal ph 6 ph 2 0 5 m nacl and both ph 2 0 5 m nacl conditions at room temperature the linear langmuir adsorption isotherm equation can be expressed as follows 38 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max k l is the langmuir constant l mg which is related to the affinity of the energy of adsorption and qmax indicates the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent material mg g the values of qmax and k l are obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of ce qe against ce the dimensionless separation factor rl is also an important parameter which indicates the favorability of the adsorption processand is defined as 39 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 is the initial dye concentration mg l based on the value of rl the adsorption process can be assumed to be irreversible rl 0 favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 2 6 flow through adsorption experiments 2 6 1 individual pollutants filter the flow through adsorption of individual dyes 20 mg l initial concentration was studied by using glass filter of 50 cm length and 18 cm diameter filled with 250 mg of eg the individual dyesolution was passed flow rate of 8 10 ml min 1 through from one end of the vertically aligned glass tube the colored dye solution was translated into pure water while coming from other end of the glass tube the final filtered solution obtained was found to be completely pure water as confirmed by uv vis spectroscopy analysis mixture of both pollutants filter the all four dyes of equal weights were mixed to prepare final concentration of 20 mg l the flow through experiments were carried out according to the above procedure 2 7 recycling test the eg adsorption cyclic stability was investigated by flow through experiments for 5 cycles the cyclic performance of individual or mixture of all dyes onto eg was performed 250 ml of dye solution all four dyes was passed through upper opened end of vertically aligned glass filter of 50 cm length and 18 cm diameter filled with 250 mg of eg with a flow rate 8 10 ml min 1 it was confirmed by uv vis absorption spectra that the water coming from other end of the tube was completely pure for the next cycle we passed 25 ml of methyl alcohol solution followed by 25 ml deionised water through the glass tube to wash the eg containing dye again 250 ml of dye solution was passed through the filter and observed same quality of purified water as outcome product the procedure was repeated for 5 cycles and obtained same quality of purified water was confirmed by uv vis spectroscopy analysis 2 8 oils and organic solvents absorption the absorption of oils as well as organic solvents by eg was studied according to procedure 3 known quantity of eg material was taken on a mesh and the liquid was allowed drop wise on to the eg until it come out from the mesh and then the eg was removed from the mesh for measurements weight gain was calculated by the following expression a m o u n t a b s o r b e d p e r u n i t w e i g h t g g m m 0 m 0 where m0 and m are the weights of the eg before and after absorption respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of eg perchloric acid pa acts as both intercalation as well as oxidizing agent during the intercalation and exfoliation process pa quickly enters between the layers of the graphite and evaporates more easily during heat treatment because of its low viscosity and boiling point we performed experiments with 60 diluted pa at room temperature to avoid over oxidation the maximum exfoliated volume ev of eg obtained was 524 ml g with the weight g ratio of 0 5 0 8 for ngf pa the ev 375 ml g was obtained under conventional process exfoliation process is a bulk phenomenon and could be easily verified without doing any characterization the digital photographs of gics before and after exfoliation under mwi are presented see fig s1 in supplementary material it could be concluded that a successful exfoliation of chemically treated graphite flakes could be obtained under mwi fig 1 a d shows the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem images of as received ngf gic and eg flat flake like morphology of ngf could be seen in fig 1a the acid treated graphite flakes called gic as seen in fig 1b indicate that intercalation with perchloric acid did not damage the graphite flakes after successful exfoliation of gics under microwave irradiation a huge volume expansion of graphite flakes occurred and the morphology of resulting eg could be seen in fig 1c the eg microstructure resembles the vermiform in shape with loose and porous or worm like structure the magnified image of highly porous eg can be seen in fig 1d the xrd patterns of eg along with ngf and gic are presented in fig 2 a it was observed that the diffraction pattern of ngf shows two characteristic peaks at 26 530 and 54 80 corresponding to 002 and 004 reflections respectively as shown in fig 2a the highly intense sharp and symmetrical peak of ngf designates the crystalline nature of graphite flakes once the flakes were treated with perchloric acid and form gic the peak corresponding to 002 reflection of gic shifted towards the lower angle and exhibits at 26 130 which comes from increase in interlayer spacing caused by oxidation as well intercalation of the graphite flakes after successful exfoliation eg exhibits 002 reflection peak eg at 26 630 as shown in fig 2a which almost coincides with the peak observed in ngf but eg demonstrates large full width at half maxima fwhm and lower intensity when compared to the gic and ngf which is attributed to the increase in crystal defects and a resulting decrease in crystallinity from the bragg s law the maximum intensity d spacing values calculated for ngf gic and eg are 3 35 3 40 and 3 34 å respectively the moderate increase in d spacing value of gic indicates partial intercalation moreover the xrd data on gic are well explained by stage phenomena which is characterized by the number of graphene layers between adjacent intercalate layers 40 gic are thus classified by a stage number n could be calculated from the highly intense 00l reflection peak by using the expression l n 1 41 according to the expression the formation of gic was stage 1 the average stacking height lc of graphite microcrystallites was calculated by scherrer equation the lc values determined for ngf gic and eg are 587 274 and 50 å respectively the intercalation due to quick absorption of perchloric acid by the graphite flakes results in the insertion of acid between the layers due to absorption graphite flakes did not show any changes fig 2a as a result there is no change in the xrd pattern of gic but intensity of the peak decreases compared with graphite flakes due to insertion of perchloric acid between the layers ftir spectra of as received and after adsorption under normal condition of eg are shown in fig 2b ftir spectra of eg exhibits the bands at 1632 1365 1108 and 3351 cm 1 attributed to in plane vibration cc from un oxidized sp2 cc bonds 42 oh deformation of coh group n co stretching vibrations mode 43 and hydroxyl group designates the existence of oxygen containing functional groups such as carbonyl carboxylic epoxy and hydroxyl respectively after adsorption of each dye under normal condition ph 6 at room temperature the eg powder was collected and air dried for 12 h at room temperature the dried eg powder of each dye was taken the spectra and indicated as mg mb r6g and cr as shown in fig 2b it was observed that the eg band positions was changed after adsorption more details provided in the mechanism section in order to study the surface characteristics surface area total pore volume and pore size of eg the brunauer emmett teller bet gas adsorption method was used here we compared surface properties of eg prepared with mwi and conventional heating technique nitrogen adsorption desorption and pore distribution analysis of eg prepared by mwi and conventional techniques are shown in fig 3 a b the bet surface area and cumulative pore volume of as prepared eg with mwi and conventional were 66 4 32 6 m2 g 0 180437 and 0 061793 cm3 g respectively the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of both types of eg exhibit type iv isotherm according to iupac classification indicating the mesoporous nature of the material 44 the average pore size for both mwi and conventional eg was approximately 21 46 and 13 57 nm respectively 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of time ph and ionic strength time dependent adsorption experiments were carried out to evaluate the equilibrium adsorption time it was observed that initially the rate of adsorption was very rapid due to the availability of more active sites to capture the dye molecules but further increase in contact time shows a moderate increase in adsorption may be due to difficulty faced by ions to occupy remaining active sites because of the repulsive force between the solute molecules of the solid and bulk phase 45 as shown in fig 4 a moreover the slow uptake of dyes at later stage may also be due to intraparticle diffusion process dominating over adsorption 46 47 comparison mg adsorption performance of various adsorbent materials with present study is shown in fig 4b the effect of solution ph 2 to 10 and ionic strength on the adsorption was investigated see fig s2 in supplementary material at high ph values the surface of eg gets positively charged and can remove negatively charged cationic dyes faster the removal efficiency of dyes increases with increasing ionic strength from 0 1 m to 0 5 m the increased adsorption capacity by the addition of salt can be ascribed to the aggregation of dye molecules induced by the increase of interactive forces by salt ions 48 i e salt ions push dye molecules to aggregate thereby resulting in increasing the extent of sorption and so on the uv vis absorption spectra analysis of all four dyes onto eg at equilibrium was performed see fig s3 in supplementary material digital photographs of aqueous solution of each dye before and after adsorption is presented see fig s4 in supplementary material 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetic studies were thoroughly performed to get the important information about rate and mechanism of the adsorption the pseudo first order see fig s5 in supplementary material and pseudo second order see fig s6 in supplementary material adsorption plots for all dyes and their corresponding equilibrium adsorption qe cal rate constants k1 and k2 and correlation coefficient r2 values are presented in table ts1 in supplementary material it was observed that the qe cal values of pseudo first order model for all four dyes are far from the experimental values however the qe cal values of the pseudo second order model for all four dyes are approximately close to the experimental qmax value it concludes that the adsorption process could be well demonstrated by the pseudo second order model a similar conclusion was made in the previous reports on the adsorption of mb 49 3 2 3 adsorption isotherm in order to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity of eg standard linear langmuir adsorption isotherm equations were used 50 fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherm plots of mg fig 5a and mb fig 5b at four different conditions such as normal ph 6 ph 10 or 2 0 5 m nacl and both 0 5 m nacl ph 10 or 2 rh6 g at normal and ph 2 fig 5c and cr at normal and 0 5 m nacl fig 5d fig 6 shows the langmuir adsorption isotherms of mg fig 6a and mb fig 6b at four different conditions rh6 g fig 6c at normal and ph 2 and cr fig 6d at normal and 0 5 m nacl and their corresponding values are presented see table ts2 in supplementary material the maximum adsorption values qmax obtained for all four dyes are 384 6 and 222 32 mg g at both condition for mg and mb dyes 151 51 mg g at ph 2 for rh6 g dye and 196 08 mg g at 0 5 m nacl for cr dye respectively which are much higher than the previously reported adsorbents see table 1 it was observed that both mg and mb are cationic dyes but show different adsorption characteristics under solution ph the maximum adsorption of mg occurred at solution ph 10 whereas mb at ph 2 this is may be due to different types of functional groups present on each dye however the detailed mechanism has to be studied the recycling adsorption performance of eg for all dyes was carried out by flow through adsorption experiments see fig s8 in supplementary material the eg material shows excellent recycling stability for 5cycles fig 7 b 3 2 4 absorption of chemical solvents and oils previous reports 51 53 stated that eg is a prospective material to be used to sorb oils from a water surface the sorption capacity of eg mainly depends on pore structure which has been related with different parameters such as exfoliation volume pore volume pore size and its distribution etc 54 generally bulk eg has three kinds of pores large spaces among worm like particles wedge shaped pores on the surface of the particles and ellipsoidal pores inside the particles 55 it has been studied by shen et al 56 that the sorption of heavy oil by eg is mainly due to the space among worm like particles of eg here we performed sorption experiments with various types of chemical solvents and oils on eg by drop cast method it has been observed that the absorption of solvents and oils by eg increases its own weight by 40 to 130 times as shown in fig 7a its absorption efficiency values are much higher than that of spongy graphene 57 and hydrophobic chemical mechanical planarization hcmp polymers 58 the absorption process of various solvents as well as oils is shown by digital photographs see fig s7 in supplementary material 3 2 5 adsorption mechanisms the possible mechanisms of adsorption of all dyes onto eg material are mainly depending on electrostatic interaction vander waals forces of interaction n π interaction π π interaction pore distribution and hydrogen bonding formation based on solution ph ionic strength bet analysis and ftir spectra analysis observation from the section 3 2 1 it was observed that the adsorption of dyes was changed either by changing solution ph or ionic strength indicating that strong electrostatic interaction and ion exchange mechanism occurs between eg and dye molecules as shown in fig 8 i hydrogen bonding interactions can occur in the eg dye system by two possible ways 1 between surface hydrogen i e hydroxyl oh or carboxyl cooh functional groups of eg and the appropriate atoms i e nitrogen or oxygen or chlorine or other h acceptor of dye this phenomenon is also known as dipole dipole h bonding fig 8iii and 2 between surface functional groups of eg and the aromatic rings in dye molecules this phenomenon is also known as yoshida h bonding fig 8iv from the ftir spectra it was observed that the peak corresponding to oh groups of eg present at 3351 cm 1 is shifted to 3433 cm 1 after adsorption the shift in the peaks to the higher side suggested the existence of both dipole dipole and yoshida hydrogen bonding interactions 59 n π interactions or n π electron donor acceptor interactions were newly proposed by mattson et al 60 in these interactions the carbonyl oxygen functionalities on the eg surface act as electron donors and the aromatic rings of dye act as the electron acceptors fig 8vi the ftir spectra of eg revealed that the c o peak position changes after adsorption the shift in c o peak position after adsorption indicates possible n π interactions 61 however the h bonding and n p interactions based on oxygen containing functional groups i e cooh and oh present on the surface of eg might not be a dominant mechanism due to the limitation of the density of these oxygen groups on the eg s surface π π interactions or π π electron donor acceptor interactions between the π electrons of a carbonaceous material and the π electrons of the aromatic rings of an adsorbate were originally proposed by coughlin and ezra 62 the structure of each dye molecule possesses at least one polar functional group electron withdrawing on the benzene ring these functional groups often act as strong electron acceptors therefore the existence of strong π π interactions between eg and dye is expected fig 8v this was confirmed experimentally by the ftir analysis of eg the peak belonging to the in plane vibration of the aromatic cc bonds shifted towards higher wavenumbers after adsorption indicating the presence of π π interactions between the benzene rings of dye and the graphene planes and is good agreement with the previous report 63 graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon and has a two dimensional layered structure in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern within each layer called graphene layers graphene layers are linked together by a weak vander walls forces permanent dipole induced dipole forces and london dispersion forces produced by a delocalized π orbital 64 the strength of vander waals forces of an adsorbed molecule is relative to its contact surface area of the adsorbent and also the van der waals index specific to the adsorbent surface 65 the eg surface of carbonaceous adsorbents has a very high van der waals index graphite has a higher van der waals index than paraffin or teflon does 65 and the dye molecule has a great planar ring structure therefore strong van der waals forces are prone to take place between the dye molecule and the eg surface of adsorbents fig 8ii the adsorption not only depends on surface area but also on pore structure of the material it was observed that the adsorption strongly depends on exfoliated volume ev of eg especially the length of the exfoliated graphite flake called worm the performance of mg adsorption was compared with four different types of eg materials fig 9 shows the model diagram for adsorption of mg dye based on length of eg worm under same weight it was observed that the eg materials prepared based on h2so4 or hno3 or hclo4 as the intercalation agent combination with liquid oxidant materials like hno3 or h2o2 shows moderate high adsorption due to less ev whereas solid oxidant materials like kmno4 or k2cr2o7 or nh4 2s2o8 shows low adsorption due to less ev as well as residue formation see table ts3 in supplementary material in case of solid oxide materials the eg pores filled by these solid oxide particles results poor adsorption performance due to limited occupancy for dye molecule it concludes that the eg with more ev has dominant adsorption mechanism based on random pore distribution and vander waals forces of interaction moreover the performance of mg dye performance was compared with the high surface area materials like go rgo and ac see table ts3 in supplementary material it was observed that eg performs well compared to go rgo and ac another problem with these nanomaterials is separation from water after treatment here we used stainless steel mess of 300 size to separate eg from water after adsorption 4 conclusions in conclusion a rapid and efficient one compound perchloric acid based exfoliated graphite material has been produced by microwave irradiation technique in about one minute 60 70 sec during the intercalation process perchloric acid quickly enters into the layers of graphite flakes and form gic up on rapid microwave heating gics exfoliated successfully resulting in highly porous worm like structured materials called eg with the exfoliation volume of 524 mg l an inexpensive and easily available starting material such as graphite flakes facilitates production of large scale uniform exfoliation of graphite material showing superior performance in efficient removal of various organic pollutants from aqueous solutions and quick absorption of broad range of chemical solvents as well as oils due to bulk nature of exfoliated graphite it can be easily separated from water after adsorption process the flow through filtration of dye solutions with excellent recycling indicates excellent suitable material for industrial waste water purification acknowledgements the authors thank mncf facility of centre of nanoscience and
