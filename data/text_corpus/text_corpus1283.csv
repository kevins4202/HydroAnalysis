6415,formation of soil crusts results in reduced infiltration increased runoff and reduced rainfall and irrigation efficiency improved knowledge of the hydrological properties of soil crusts is required to improve simulation of infiltration and soil water movement in crop soil water models development of soil crust algorithms in soil water models is limited by a lack of in situ and laboratory approaches for measuring the physical properties of soil crusts in this study we evaluate a number of novel and modified approaches for determining changes in the hydraulic properties of soil crusts formed in an intensively cropped sandy loam physical crust formation over a 71 day period resulted in an increase in surface soil density from 1 17 to 1 51 g cm 3 a reduction in infiltration from 474 to 33 2 mm h 1 and a decrease in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at 0 05 kpa from 136 9 to 10 14 mm h 1 whilst the ability to determine the van genuchten properties of soil crusts was progressed uncertainty with matching crust thickness to sampling depth and difficulty measuring the total porosity of soil crusts resulted in error and uncertainty in the estimation of the θs parameter and to a lesser extent the α and ɳ parameters further work is required to improve the development of simple in situ means of measuring or estimating the physical properties of soil crusts keywords crusting soil seal hydrus 1d 2d infiltration inverse estimation 1 introduction physical soil crusts are thin transient soil surface layers that are less porous than the material immediately beneath them miralles mellado et al 2011 their formation results in considerable modification to the physical properties of the soil surface including lower porosity high bulk density and reduced size and continuity of macropores compared to the underlying bulk soil hussein et al 2010 miralles mellado et al 2011 these changes in surface soil structure result in a substantial reduction in infiltration rate increased runoff and erosion and decreased efficiency of rainfall and irrigation awadhwal and thierstein 1985 souza et al 2014 to date no single soil water model can account for the factors that contribute to crust formation or the consequence of soil crust formation on soil hydrology nciizah and wakindiki 2015b modelling and prediction of surface crust characteristics is difficult due to crust development being a function of multiple soil and climate factors including soil texture aggregate stability organic matter tillage rainfall intensity wind speed and droplet size assouline and mualem 1997 roberts and clanton 2000 nciizah and wakindiki 2015b presence of soil crusts exert disproportional control over surface soil hydrology šimůnek et al 1998a as such knowledge of their hydrological properties is required to improve the modelling of rainfall and irrigation into the soil surface roberts and clanton 2000 many approaches have been proposed to account for the effect of soil crusts on the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and infiltration baumhardt et al 1990 mualem et al 1990 mualem and assouline 1992 assouline and mualem 1997 geeves 1997 roberts and clanton 2000 assouline 2011 touma et al 2011 the simplest approaches use usda curve numbers u s department of agriculture 1972 to arbitrarily partition rainfall into runoff and infiltration based on one of four soil types and surface condition examples include apsim keating et al 2003 and ceres jones and kiniry 1986 more explicit approaches involve reducing the hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil to invoke a crust like effect baumhardt et al 1990 assouline and mualem 2003 such as the rzwqm2 model ma et al 2012 which assumes surface crusts have 1 5 of the hydraulic conductivity of non crusted soil bartling et al 2017 soil water models including hydrus 1d 2d šimůnek et al 2012 macro 5 1 jarvis 1994 swim verburg et al 1996 and swap kroes et al 2017 use richards equation to simulate water movement and storage in either one or two dimensions these models are spatially explicit in that individual soil layers are able to be separately described by knowledge of their thickness saturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil water retention function which is usually described by the van genuchten mualem equation as such it would seem a relatively simple task to model the effects of soil crusts on water movement and storage into and through the soil profile using spatially explicit richards equation models however measuring the hydraulic properties of soil crusts in order to parameterise such models is far from straight forward a task made all the more difficult by the thin fragile nature of soil crusts which makes routine measurement with standard laboratory and field techniques problematic pulido et al 2014 nciizah and wakindiki 2015a as souza et al 2014 laments it is practically impossible to characterize properties which are normally associated with soil crusting assouline and mualem 2003 go so far as to state that there is not a single experimental study reported in the literature in which such detailed and extensive measurements were carried out difficulties with the direct measurement of the water retention function of soil crusts has led to attempts to inversely solve the retention properties of surface soils including soil crusts from in situ infiltration experiments šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 1997 šimůnek et al 1998a 1999 hopmans et al 2002 chahinian et al 2006 ramos et al 2006 hardie et al 2013 souza et al 2014 of the range of infiltration approaches preference has been shown for the tension infiltrometer disk permeameter as it can be operated in situ with minimal if any disruption to the soil surface and can be operated at multiple consecutive tensions which reduces probability of non uniqueness during parameter optimisation šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 this study was established to i evaluate a range of existing and novel approaches for measuring or estimating the physical properties of soil crusts ii measure changes in soil crust properties over time to gain insight into crust formation over time iii make recommendations for the parameterisation of soil crusts for simulation in richards equation based soil water models 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the trial was conducted in a commercial packet salad farm in the coal river valley in southern tasmania 42 72532 south 147 43182 east salad production requires up to 13 cultivations a year which has resulted in loss of soil carbon and led to severe soil crusting the climate was defined as mediterranean with 500 mm of annual rainfall yearly mean maximum temperature range of 12 22 c and mean minimum temperature range of 4 12 c bureau of meteorology 2015 the soil was classified as a brown chromosol isbell 2002 or alfisol soil survey staff 2006 derived from tertiary quaternary sediments the topsoil 0 5 cm depth contained 55 9 sand 10 8 silt and 33 3 clay and had a ph water of 6 0 electrical conductivity ec of 0 42 ds m 1 organic carbon of 2 3 cation exchange capacity cec of 13 9 meq 100 g 1 soil and exchangeable sodium percentage esp of 3 96 soil physical properties were monitored on 5 occasions 1 8 14 28 and 71 days after cultivation cultivation and bed forming were conducted in a single pass by rotary hoe the site was irrigated with approximately 3 to5 mm day 1 between day 1 and day 34 as per normal practice for salad production over summer and 11 separate irrigation or rainfall events over the following 37 days in situ soil tests were conducted on fallow beds adjacent sown beds as previous studies had encountered difficulty measuring soil physical properties as the crop matured 2 2 crust density total porosity crust density was measured in triplicate using the water replacement procedure 503 04 described by cresswell and hamilton 2002 the procedure involves removing the surface crust by scraping and the use of a thin water filled plastic bag to determine the volume of the extracted soil crust we augmented the approach by cresswell and hamilton 2002 to include the use of a battery powered hand held vacuum to ensure collection of the disturbed crust fragments soil density immediately beneath the soil crust 1 7 cm depth was measured in triplicate using 6 cm high 250 cm3 intact cores according to 503 01 cresswell and hamilton 2002 total porosity tp was calculated from the crust density in which the particle density was measured at 2 526 g cm 3 sd 0 014 g cm 3 using triplicate 50 ml pycnometers hao et al 2008 2 3 total porosity and near saturated moisture content at day 71 crust density and total porosity were determined on soil crusts collected 71 days after cultivation via the paraffin wax procedure 503 03 cresswell and hamilton 2002 analysis was conducted on i six 7 0 12 mm thick 3 0 8 0 g air dried fragments obtained by hand sampling and ii six 1 0 2 0 mm thick 0 2 1 2 g air dried crusts in which the soil attached to the base of the crust was carefully removed with a razor gravimetric soil moisture content of the air dried crusts was separately determined from five independent samples to be 0 023 g g 1 sd 0 002 g g 1 near saturated moisture content of soil crusts was also determined as a surrogate of total porosity by capillary wetting on ceramic suction tables cresswell 2002 five 7 0 12 mm thick crusts collected 71 days after cultivation were embedded on a ceramic tension table using a fine layer of diatomaceous earth crusts were slowly wet by capillary flow over a period of 1 week by raising the hanging column from 50 to 1 0 cm 0 1 kpa gravimetric near saturated soil moisture content was determined by drying at 105 c for 24 h the volume of the near saturated soil crusts could not be determined by the paraffin wax method due to their fragility when moist as such volumetric moisture content was calculated by the paraffin wax method for the air dried crusts capillary wetting of the 0 2 1 2 g crusts was not successful due to their fragility when moist 2 4 crust thickness and proportional area of pores sem and epoxy resin approaches crust thickness and porosity were determined from six images of three crust fragments collected 71 days after cultivation scanning electron micrograph sem images were obtained using a fei mla650 sem in the variable pressure mode at central science laboratory university of tasmania images were analysed for crust thickness porosity and pore size using photoshop cs3 and the analyse particle function in image j schneider et al 2012 in situ surface soil crusts were impregnated with around 350 cm3 west system 105 epoxy resin containing 10 g fluorescein dye the epoxy was poured into a 100 mm diameter ring placed on the soil surface two days after resin application the hardened soil was excavated and re impregnated with epoxy resin in a modified pressure cooker at 60 kpa hardened soils were cut vertically into 1 5 cm thick sections and photographed using a cannon 200d slr in both natural light and uv blacklight images were corrected for lens distortion and radial distortion in photoshop cs3 then converted to binary format and the proportion of pore space and non pore space determined using the analyse particle function in image j schneider et al 2012 2 5 unsaturated infiltration and hydraulic conductivity unsaturated infiltration experiments were conducted with 45 mm diameter decagon mini disk infiltrometers decagon version 10 and 200 mm diameter eijkelkamp 09 09 tension infiltrometers infiltration and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with the minidisk infiltrometer were determined in triplicate at supply potentials ψ of 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 05 kpa despite the infiltration disk of the eijkelkamp tension infiltrometer being detached from the supply reservoir to reduce weight during infiltration field observation indicated compression of the soil and thus change in soil structure during infiltration at matric potentials between 0 6 and 0 05 kpa consequently data from the eijkelkamp infiltrometer between 0 05 and 0 6 kpa were rejected whilst data between 1 0 kpa and 1 5 kpa were added to that of the minidisks which are only able to operate down to 0 6 kpa supply potential initial water content in the soil surface adjacent the infiltrometers and final water content below the tension infiltrometers was measured by inserting a calibrated decagon ec5 probe at a shallow angle into the upper 1 0 cm of the soil surface calibration was conducted by sequential drying in repacked soil at 1 30 g cm 3 in which changes in mass and sensor values were recorded twice a day for 9 days unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated according to the procedure developed by ankeny et al 1991 and presented in mckenzie et al 2002 2 6 effect of droplet height on infiltration steady state infiltration was measured using a cornell sprinkler infiltrometer mounted at 2 cm and 120 cm height in order to explore the effect of droplet energy on crust formation and infiltration measurements were conducted for 20 min for each of four replicates at both droplet heights flow rate from the infiltrometer was adjusted by lowering and raising the air entry tube and by shutting off flow in order to maintain a thin film of water on the soil surface whilst minimising runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the steady state infiltration rate according to reynolds and elrick 1990 in which the depth of ponding was assumed to be 2 0 mm and α assumed to be 0 06 cm 1 2 7 determination of the dry end soil water retention curve by wp4c the fragile nature of moist soil crusts prevents determination of their retention function by traditional suction table and pressure chamber methods as such the soil water retention function below 1000 kpa was determined by wp4c dew point hygrometer meter group inc usa on 4 replicate soil crusts collected 71 days after cultivation soil crusts were air dried to enable the crusts to be trimmed to between 2 and 5 mm thickness and fitted within the wp4c sample cups a set of four non crusted disturbed soil samples were also prepared for comparison the soil samples were slowly moistened without disturbance using a cold air humidifier over a period of several hours the samples were sealed and left overnight to equilibrate before being analysed by wp4c in the precise mode samples were dried under ambient conditions over several days in which multiple readings were obtained after equilibration by sealing the sample chamber for 1 h prior to analysis gravimetric moisture content was determined by oven drying at 105 c for 24 h following the final wp4c determination of matric potential data was converted to a volumetric basis by multiplication with bulk density determined by water replacement 2 8 determination of the van genuchten mualem parameters α ɳ and ksat by retc retc was used to estimate the van genuchten mualem α n and ksat parameters from the cumulative tension infiltration data as it is a considerably simpler and potentially more robust procedure compared to inverse estimation in hydrus 2d the computer program retc uses nonlinear least squares parameter optimization methods to estimate the unknown coefficients in the van genuchten mualem hydraulic model from observed water retention and or unsaturated hydraulic conductivity data van genuchten et al 1991 the maximum number of iterations was set at 50 initial values of α n and ksat were estimated using the rosetta pedotransfer function for a sandy clay loam patil and rajput 2009 fitting was performed with different combinations of input data i including or excluding wp4c dry end retention data ii including or excluding total porosity determined by water replacement iii fitting either all van genuchten mualem parameters or restricting fitting to only the α ɳ and ksat parameters 2 9 inverse estimation of the van genuchten mualem parameters by hydrus 2d inverse estimation of van genuchten parameter values from the cumulative tension infiltration at sequential supply potentials was conducted in hydrus 2d based on procedures developed in šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 1997 šimůnek et al 1998a two different flow domains were created for exploring whether knowledge of the van genuchten mualem properties of the soil beneath the soil crust influenced estimated parameter values of the crust a single layer axisymmetrical vertical flow domain based on šimůnek et al 1998a was created in which all soil throughout the flow domain had identical hydraulic properties the single layer approach assumed that water flow through the whole soil layer was controlled by the soil crust due to its lower saturated hydraulic conductivity the 40 cm 30 cm single layer flow domain had a 0 18 cm mesh refinement beneath the tension infiltrometer in order to improve simulation accuracy resulting in 1476 nodes and 2818 2d elements the dual layer flow domain consisted of a 0 20 mm thick upper boundary crust layer in which the hydraulic properties were included in the objective function and a lower beneath crust soil layer in which the hydraulic properties were measured using replicated intact cores by the ums hyprop evaporative flux procedure wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008 ums 2013 the 25 cm 30 cm dual layer flow domain had a 0 18 cm mesh refinement near the soil surface to provide sufficient nodes to separately represent the soil crust resulting in a total of 3539 nodes and 6840 2d elements the flexibility of the hydrus 2d inverse estimation procedure enabled inclusion and exclusion of a broad range of different observed data and output parameters in which we sought to identify the best trade off between input data requirements and output quality where values for θr θs and ksat may be estimated by other means i e total porosity by water replacement to represent θs etc the simplest simulations consisted of only including α and ɳ in the objective function whilst the most complex simulations included all van genuchten mualem parameters in the objective function in all 38 different combinations of input data and simulations options were simulated for the tension infiltration conducted 71 days after cultivation table 1 in all simulations initial values for parameters in the objective function were estimated using the rosetta pedotransfer function for a sandy clay loam patil and rajput 2009 the pore connectivity parameter ʅ was assumed to be 0 5 to reduce the number of variables in the objective function and all infiltration data were equally weighted with a factor of 1 with the exception of the final volumetric moisture content θfinal ksat and total porosity which were weighted by a factor of 10 as suggested by ramos et al 2006 2 10 statistical analysis changes in crust density aggregate stability hydraulic conductivity and steady state infiltration over time were explored using one way analysis of variance anova with bonferroni post hoc test differences in unsaturated infiltration rate and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity over time were explored using one way analysis of variance anova with bonferroni post hoc test for each supply potential differences in steady state infiltration between the two droplet heights were determined using t tests as the wp4c generates unique matric potential versus gravimetric moisture content data pairs for each sample statistical analysis between the crusted and non crusted soil required data to be fitted using a logarithmic function r2 0 96 this function was then used to estimate gravimetric water content at matric potentials of 1000 2000 5000 10000 20000 and 50 000 kpa to which one way analysis of variance and t test were used to explore differences in all tests significant differences were said to exist if p 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted in spss version 21 3 results 3 1 crust density crust density measured by water replacement significantly increased from 1 17 g cm 3 sd 0 02 g cm 3 one day after cultivation to 1 42 g cm 3 sd 0 03 g cm 3 14 days after cultivation and to 1 50 g cm 3 sd 0 03 g cm 3 28 days after cultivation accordingly total porosity decreased from 0 54 to 0 42 cm3 cm 3 and to 0 41 cm3 cm 3 over the same period the maximum crust density was 1 51 g cm 3 sd 0 04 g cm 3 as such the lowest total porosity was 0 401 cm3 cm 3 which was observed 71 days after cultivation crust density did not significantly increase between days 28 and 71 fig 1 the density of soil directly beneath the soil crust 1 6 cm depth also increased significantly from 1 12 g cm 3 sd 0 06 g cm 3 one day after cultivation to 1 31 g cm 3 sd 0 03 g cm 3 14 days after cultivation presumably due to consolidation after which soil density remained unchanged 3 2 crust density and total porosity day 71 the density of the 7 0 12 0 mm thick crusts measured using the paraffin wax technique ranged from 1 23 to 1 35 g cm 3 ave 1 32 g cm 3 and thus an average total porosity of 0 47 cm3 cm 3 sd 0 02 cm3 cm 3 whilst the density of the 1 0 2 0 mm thick crusts ranged from 0 80 to 2 21 g cm 3 ave 1 60 g cm 3 with an average total porosity of 0 37 cm3 cm 3 sd 0 28 cm3 cm 3 the near saturated 0 01 kpa volumetric moisture content of the capillary wetted 7 0 12 0 mm thick crusts averaged 0 52 cm3 cm 3 sd 0 06 cm3 cm 3 and 0 49 cm3 cm 3 sd 0 06 cm3 cm 3 for the 1 0 2 0 mm thick crusts 3 3 visual determination of crust porosity sem images indicated that the soil crusts consisted of two distinct layers an upper layer 290 μm thick layer and a 1800 μm thick layer the upper crust layer had approximately 0 04 cm2 cm 2 porosity when viewed in cross section fig 2 b and approximately 0 02 cm2 cm 2 in plan view fig 2a pore diameter ranged from around 40 250 μm the lower crust layer had a porosity of around 0 15 cm2 cm 2 overall the soil crusts were estimated to have an average porosity of around 0 14 cm2 cm 2 analysis of the epoxy resin impregnated blocks indicated that prior to rainfall or irrigation day 1 the pore area near the soil surface was 0 55 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 09 cm3 cm 3 which reduced to 0 25 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 07 cm3 cm 3 at 100 μm depth fig 3 by day 14 surface porosity had reduced to 0 11 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 07 cm3 cm 3 which then increased to 0 21 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 07 cm3 cm 3 at 4000 μm depth and below by day 28 surface porosity had further reduced to 0 07 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 03 cm3 cm 3 whilst between 300 and 1000 μm depth porosity was less than 0 05 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 00 cm3 cm 3 the linear decrease in porosity from 100 to 4000 μm depth indicates that surface crusts sampled 14 and 28 days after cultivation ranged in thickness somewhere between 4000 and 6000 μm fig 3 in summary values of total porosity or surrogates of porosity near saturated moisture content and final moisture content after infiltration for crusts collected 71 days after cultivation were between 0 07 cm2 cm 2 to 0 520 cm3 cm 3 direct approaches including water replacement and paraffin wax coating of air dried and capillary crust resulted in values between 0 401 and 0 520 cm3 cm 3 ignoring the 1 0 2 0 mm thick crusts whereas the soil moisture sensor and visual approaches resulted in values between 0 07 and 0 22 cm2 cm 2 table 2 3 4 infiltration and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity infiltration and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity decreased at all supply potentials as the soil crust developed fig 4 overall unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at 0 05 kpa supply potential significantly decreased from day 1 at 136 91 mm h 1 sd 8 32 mm h 1 to day 71 at 10 14 mm h 1 sd 1 95 mm h 1 and from 22 26 mm h 1 sd 2 59 mm h 1 to 2 87 mm h 1 sd 0 33 mm h 1 at the 0 6 kpa supply potential unsaturated hydraulic conductivity decreased significantly at all supply potentials from day 1 to day 8 and between day 8 and day 14 other than at 0 6 kpa no significant difference in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity existed between day 14 and day 28 whilst between day 28 and day 71 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity only decreased significantly at the 0 05 kpa supply potential fig 4 3 5 infiltration and droplet height steady state infiltration rate was significantly lower for droplets emitted from 120 cm height compared to 2 cm height for all the measurements other than those performed on day 71 for droplets emitted at 2 cm height the steady state infiltration rate ranged from 474 mm h 1 sd 45 2 mm h 1 on day 1 to 33 2 mm h 1 sd 12 1 mm h 1 on day 71 whilst for droplets emitted from 120 cm height the steady state infiltration rate ranged from 178 mm h 1 sd 51 0 mm h 1 on day 1 12 1 mm h 1 sd 3 01 mm h 1 on day 71 no significant difference in the steady state infiltration rate existed between day 8 day 14 and day 28 for droplets falling from both 2 0 cm and 120 cm height field soils exposed to droplets emitted at 2 cm height reached the minimum infiltration rate 71 days after cultivation whereas droplets emitted at 120 cm height reached the minimum infiltration rate only 8 days after cultivation fig 5 3 6 determination of the van genuchten mualem parameters α ɳ and ksat the dry end water retention curves measured with the wp4c were described by a logarithmic relationship in which no significant differences existed between the crusted and non crusted soil water retention curves the permanent wilting point 1500 kpa for the crusted soil was 0 118 cm3 cm 3 and 0 105 cm3 cm 3 for the non crusted soil the retc fitting approach indicated that provision of wp4c and total porosity data in the solution data and or inclusion or exclusion of θs and θr in the objective function had minimal effect on estimated van genuchten mualem parameter values or parameter error fig 6 however inclusion of wp4c data without the total porosity data resulted in considerable overestimation of θs whilst inclusion of total porosity in the solution data without the wp4c data often led to failure of the solution to converge data not presented retc indicated that saturated hydraulic conductivity α and η all decreased with time between day 1 and day 28 as the crust formed however on day 71 the α and η values were similar to values measured on day 14 the hydrus 2d inverse estimation of van genuchten mualem parameter values were conducted using the single layer flow domain as the difference between the single and dual flow domains was slight differences from 5 comparative simulations was 0 011 cm3 cm 3 for θr and 0 015 cm3 cm 3 for θs in which the dual layer simulation only improved the overall model fit r2 by 0 003 inclusion or exclusion of additional data and different means of measuring additional data total porosity near saturated water content θfinal wp4c in the hydrus 2d inverse solution resulted in vastly different retention curves fig 7 and corresponding van genuchten parameter values table 3 estimated values for the saturated water content θs parameter were strongly influenced by the form of the input data as expected inverse solutions in which θfinal was measured by the ec 5 probe resulted in θs values near the measured value of 0 219 cm3 cm 3 table 3 h i j k while simulations in which final moisture content were determined by capillary wetting resulted in θs values at or near the measured value at 0 464 cm3 cm 3 table 3 j and k and those in which θs was specified as the total porosity determined by water replacement resulted in θs values of 0 402 cm3 cm 3 table 3 a b e simulations in which neither θfinal or total porosity were provided in the solution data table 3 c d f g resulted in similar dry end retention data and θr values to those in which total porosity or θfinal data were provided yet when wp4c data was included in the solution data without provision of total porosity or θfinal data table 3 c and d θs values solved to 0 550 cm3 cm 3 the maximum allowable θs value and thus in error when wp4c data was not included in the solution data and no θfinal or total porosity data were provided table 3 f and g θs values were incorrectly low around 0 165 cm3 cm 3 and had high parameter error somewhat unexpectedly inclusion of wp4c retention data in the inverse solution data had minimal effect on the θr parameter and the dry end of the retention curve table 3 a vs e c vs f d vs g and fig 7 however inclusion of wp4c data in the objective function had minimal effect on estimated values of θs when θfinal data was included in the solution data h vs i j vs k yet when θfinal or total porosity data were not provided inclusion of wp4c values in the solution data c vs f d vs g solved θs at or near 0 550 cm3 cm 3 the maximum allowable value inclusion of

soil water retention curves determined by inclusion or exclusion of θfinal wp4c and total porosity data within the hydrus 2d inverse solution of multistep tension infiltration into a surface soil crust 71 days after cultivation letter nomenclature refers to different simulation strategies detailed in table 3 error in both the parameter values and the inverse solution were difficult to relate to the simulation approach other than simulations in which parameter values for α and n were previously determined by retc simulations in which the wp4c data was included in the solution data tended to have higher rmse 0 190 and lower r2 values 0 979 than simulations in which wp4c data were not provided 0 059 0 989 respectively table 3 simulations e f j and k produced the highest error values for θr whilst simulations c d and f showed the highest error values for θs overall error in simulations g and i which did not include wp4c or total porosity values in the solution data had the lowest parameter error for both the van genuchten parameters and the overall inverse simulation however it should be noted that simulation f which also excluded wp4c and total porosity information from the solution data had extremely high error values for the θr and θs parameters inclusion of wp4c information in the inverse solution data resulted in lower r2 values and higher rmse than inverse simulations in which wp4c data was withheld in addition while inclusion of the wp4c values in the inverse solution data had little effect on estimated θr values inclusion of the wp4c data profoundly reduced the average θr parameter error from 6 991 to 0 008 cm3 cm 3 table 3 different approaches for estimating van genuchten maulem parameter values also had considerable influence on estimated changes in soil water retention curves over time table 4 the hydrus 2d inverse solution in which the wp4c data was included in the solution data indicated crust formation resulted in a sequential loss of pores between 0 and 10 000 kpa pores greater than 0 03 μm diameter over time fig 8 a for inverse solutions in which the wp4c data was withheld from the solution data fig 8b there was a small loss of pores between 0 and 1 kpa pores larger than 300 μm diameter and considerable loss of all pores less than 1 kpa between days 14 and day 71 including complete loss of all pores less than 50 kpa pores less than 300 μm and 6 μm diameter respectively the soil water retention curves produced by retc are similar to those of the hydrus 2d inverse simulation without the wp4c data yet the retc based retention curves appear steeper and reach a value of around 0 10 cm3 cm 3 between 1 and 10 kpa fig 8c as opposed to 10 000 kpa as existed with the hydrus 2d inverse simulations with wp4c data fig 8a the rect k ψ fitting approach fig 8c suggested that crust formation between days 1 and day 14 resulted in loss of pores between 0 and 1 kpa pores larger than 300 μm and creation of pores between 1 and 1000 kpa pores between 300 and 0 03 μm however between day 14 and day 28 crust formation resulted in a small loss of pores between 0 and 1000 kpa pores greater than 0 3 μm whilst between day 28 and day 71 crust formation resulted in a small loss of pores between 0 1 and 1000 kpa pores between 3000 and 0 3 μm diameter 4 discussion 4 1 crust thickness and sampling error we experienced difficulty identifying the lower boundary of the soil crusts the sem analysis indicated that soil crusts extended to approximately 2100 μm depth the epoxy resin analysis at day 28 indicated crust extended to somewhere between 4000 and 6000 μm depth whilst hand sampling on day 71 resulted in collection of 7000 12000 μm thick crusts the difficulty we experienced determining the thickness of the surface crusts was not unique to this study mualem and assouline 1989 also reported that it was quite difficult to define exactly the seal lower boundary our estimation that crusts were between 4000 and 7000 μm thick is generally consistent with the literature including armenise et al 2018 who reported crust thickness ranged from 600 to 5400 μm ma et al 2014 reported crust thicknesses between 3000 and 5000 μm while pires et al 2007 found crust thicknesses were between 2300 and 3500 μm the greater thickness of crust in this study compared to the literature values was attributed to sampling up to 71 days after disturbance compared to mostly single event and short term studies 4 2 effect of crust development on pore size and infiltration the effects of crust formation on infiltration have been widely reported romkens et al 1990 moss 1991 nciizah and wakindiki 2015b wang et al 2016 we found infiltration rates underwent a 15 fold decrease over the 71 day monitoring period this reduction in infiltration rate is greater than many short term or single event studies such as bullard et al 2018 who reported that 9 mm artificial rainfall reduced infiltration by a factor of between 3 and 10 on 11 different soils and jakab et al 2013 who reported a 3 fold reduction in infiltration associated with crust formation analysis of droplet height on infiltration demonstrated that emitting droplets at 120 cm height compared to 2 0 cm resulted in a 62 lower infiltration rate on day 1 and 79 lower infiltration rate day 28 this along with the tension infiltration data suggests that crust formation principally resulting from raindrop impact which continued least 28 and possibly up to 71 days after cultivation this finding is significant in that it differs to most of the literature mostly single events or short term studies with artificial rainfall which indicate that crusts develop in a matter of minutes to hours mellis et al 1996 fohrer et al 1999 castilho et al 2011 armenise et al 2018 crust formation is known to decrease infiltration in response to reduced size number and continuity of pores at and near the soil surface pagliai et al 1983 bresson and boiffin 1990 valentin and bresson 1992 pagliai 2007 yet little is known of the effects of crust formation on pore size distribution the tension infiltration data demonstrated that crust formation reduced the presence of all soil pore size classes greater than 300 μm reduction in pore size tended to be greatest for pores larger than 500 μm as indicated by larger changes in hydraulic conductivity at supply potentials near zero furthermore crust formation tended to no longer affect sequentially larger pores over time the retc and hydrus 2d procedures also indicated that crust formation up to day 28 resulted in loss of pores greater than 300 μm but did not affect pores less than 0 3 μm unfortunately differences between procedures means that the effect of crust formation on changes in pores between 300 μm and 0 3 μm could not be inferred these findings are similar to malam issa et al 2004 who also reported that crust formation resulted in reduced relative hydraulic conductivity in larger pores between 600 and 2000 μm whilst panini et al 1997 found that crust formation mostly occurred through loss of 200 1000 μm pores whilst pores between 50 and 100 μm were mostly unaffected 4 3 determination of total porosity independent determination of total porosity was found to be important for estimation of θs and to a lesser extent α and ɳ determination of the total porosity or saturated water content of the soil crusts proved surprisingly difficult with each approach resulting in vastly different values we suspect the water replacement method may have overestimated total porosity due to more porous soil being attached underneath the crust during hand sampling in addition the volume of the soil crust may have been underestimated by difficulty filling the void created by the excavation of the crust with the water filled plastic bag as also noted by cresswell and hamilton 2002 unfortunately the literature does not provide any guidance on the veracity of our measurements as reported values for crust density range from 1 74 to 1 88 g cm 3 tarchitzky et al 1984 to 1 26 g cm 3 han et al 2016 compared to our value of 1 51 g cm 3 sd 0 04 g cm 3 the sem and epoxy image based approaches resulted in considerably lower estimates of porosity than the direct methods other than the ec 5 sensor underestimation of porosity by sem is thought to have resulted from difficulty distinguishing between soil voids and the soil matrix whilst underestimation of porosity with the epoxy method resulted from poor ingress of the epoxy resin and uv tracer into non surface connected pores dead end pores and pores within larger aggregates capillary wetting of ex situ crusts was able to accurately determine the gravimetric moisture content of soil crusts near saturation however their fragile nature prevented direct measurement of their volume by paraffin wax and thus the volumetric moisture content could not be directly calculated the ex situ determination of the total porosity of air dried crusts by the paraffin wax approach proved highly unreliable not only did values of crust density vary widely analysis revealed that a significant r2 0 7 0 9 relationship existed between crust density and the amount of adsorbed wax which suggest that wax ingress into surface pores compromised the procedure normally the paraffin wax approach is conducted on large soil clods in which wax ingress into surface pores results in a minor error due to the low surface area to volume ratio of the clods however when applied to thin surface crusts with high surface area to volume ratio wax ingress into surface pores reduced the proportion of air filled pores without influencing the measured volume estimation of total porosity from θfinal following tension infiltration failed we sought to avoid the issues identified by mckenzie et al 2002 associated with determination of θfinal in which a thin scraping of the soil surface is taken immediately after infiltration this approach is particularly problematic for investigations of soil crusts due to the need to independently determine crust density flooding of the soil surface during removal of the tension infiltrometer mixing of the soil crust with the sand contact material and difficulty only sampling the soil crust and not the underlying more porous soil values θfinal by the ec 5 soil moisture probe were impossibly low 0 220 cm3 cm 3 sd 0 008 cm3 cm 3 being less than the gravimetric moisture content of the near saturated capillary wetted crusts 0 394 cm3 cm 3 sd 0 042 cm3 cm 3 whilst the θfinal is expected to be slightly lower than capillary wetted aggregates due to air entrapment in non surface connected pores during infiltration šimůnek et al 1998b these differences should be slight in a compacted non porous crust accordingly we attributed the error with the ec 5 sensor to its shallow installation resulting in the sensor reading the air above the soil crust or fault with the laboratory calibration procedure in which the nature of the field soil crusts were not able to be adequately replicated in the laboratory 4 4 determination of van genuchten parameters retc was unable to solve for the θs parameter however retc produced remarkably consistent estimates of α n and ksat regardless of parameterisation approach in the case of ksat this is not unexpected due to the simple nature of the extrapolation of the k ψ curve to zero using the van genuchten mualem equation whilst retc predicted α and η values seemed reasonable parameter error was high which was attributed to the α and η parameters being fitted to the whole retention curve based on only 6 data points all of which were very close to saturation 0 05 to 0 6 kpa hydrus 2d determination of van genuchten mualem parameter values by inverse estimation of stepwise cumulative infiltration was generally poor and inconsistent error was largely due to dependence of the approach on provision of a independent measure of total porosity or θfinal which we were unable to measure with a high degree of confidence without provision of either total porosity or θfinal inverse estimation of van genuchten parameters was poor resulting in unrealistic parameter values and unacceptably high parameter error terms despite exceptionally good agreement between the measured and inversely estimated cumulative infiltration data ventrella et al 2005 also reported difficulty inversely solving van genuchten parameters from multi tension infiltration data for which they suggested that independent water retention measurements from soil cores is required to estimate α šimůnek and van genuchten 2000 also produced poor estimates of retention function values despite removing θr from the objective function to force the retention curves to the same end point and šimůnek et al 1998b found that inverse estimation of cumulative infiltration from tensiometers resulted in underestimation of θs θr and ksat inclusion of the wp4c values in the inverse solution had little effect on estimated θr values however inclusion of wp4c values in the solution profoundly reduced parameter error and resulted in more realistic values for α and η hardie et al 2013 also reported the inverse solution of tension infiltration were improved by independent determination of soil moisture content at 1500 kpa whilst augeard et al 2007 reported that model uncertainty during inverse estimation of soil crust hydraulic properties from a laboratory transient outflow experiment was dominated by the θr parameter 5 conclusion this study attempted to evaluate approaches for measuring or estimating the physical properties of soil crusts to facilitate the simulation of soil crusts in richards equation based soil water models this study has clearly shown the nature and rate of changes in a range of soil physical properties associated with the development of soil crust over time which in contrast to many laboratory or artificial rainfall studies demonstrated that crust development occurred up to at least 28 days and possibly 71 days after cultivation estimation and measurement of the crust hydraulic properties proved difficult and often inconsistent uncertainty resulted in part from difficulty matching sampling depth to crust thickness for example the sem and epoxy resin impregnation images indicated the crust layer extended to at least 2000 μm and possibly up to 6000 μm thickness whereas hand sampling for determination of total porosity by water replacement and ex situ approaches tended to remove crusts of 7000 10 000 μm thickness this potential for sampling the more porous soil beneath the true crust is thought to have resulted in overestimation of crust porosity by a number of approaches including water replacement paraffin wax method capillary wetting of ex situ soil crusts and thus also estimates of θs the extent to which potential overestimation of porosity influenced values of θs is unknown and was unable to be independently tested estimation of θs and to a lesser extent the α and ɳ parameters required accurate independent assessment of either total porosity or the final soil moisture content beneath the tension infiltrometer whilst determination of total porosity or the final soil moisture content of normal soils is straightforward we encountered considerable difficulty determining these properties for thin fragile soil crusts previous approaches in which θs had been solved using knowledge of θfinal are not supported due to poor sensor function in shallow soils and multiple difficulties associated with the thin scraping technique results from this study suggest that total porosity is best measured in situ using the water replacement technique described by cresswell and hamilton 2002 with due care to prevent or minimise sampling the more porous soil attached to the underneath of the soil crust uncertainty also existed with the estimation of θr α and ɳ error with the estimation of θr was found to be greatly reduced by provision of wp4c dry end retention values however this approach is also prone to error as it requires independent measurement of crust density to convert values to a volumetric basis we were unable to adequately determine whether if retc or hydrus 2d were the better procedure for estimation of α and ɳ from cumulative tension infiltration data both techniques were found to be greatly influenced by prior determination of total porosity retc produced consistent values for α and η but with lower r2 values and higher parameter error than the hydrus 2d inverse solutions parameter error with the hydrus 2d approach was generally noted to be lower when wp4c and ksat values were included in the solution data uncertainty with the retc approach resulted from extrapolation of only 6 data points near saturation over the entire water retention curve the ksat parameter was easily and reliably estimated by retc extrapolation of the conductivity function to zero potential whilst we made considerable progress with the measurement and estimation of soil crust hydraulic properties further research is required to develop better procedures for the measurement of θs α and ɳ

6415,formation of soil crusts results in reduced infiltration increased runoff and reduced rainfall and irrigation efficiency improved knowledge of the hydrological properties of soil crusts is required to improve simulation of infiltration and soil water movement in crop soil water models development of soil crust algorithms in soil water models is limited by a lack of in situ and laboratory approaches for measuring the physical properties of soil crusts in this study we evaluate a number of novel and modified approaches for determining changes in the hydraulic properties of soil crusts formed in an intensively cropped sandy loam physical crust formation over a 71 day period resulted in an increase in surface soil density from 1 17 to 1 51 g cm 3 a reduction in infiltration from 474 to 33 2 mm h 1 and a decrease in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at 0 05 kpa from 136 9 to 10 14 mm h 1 whilst the ability to determine the van genuchten properties of soil crusts was progressed uncertainty with matching crust thickness to sampling depth and difficulty measuring the total porosity of soil crusts resulted in error and uncertainty in the estimation of the θs parameter and to a lesser extent the α and ɳ parameters further work is required to improve the development of simple in situ means of measuring or estimating the physical properties of soil crusts keywords crusting soil seal hydrus 1d 2d infiltration inverse estimation 1 introduction physical soil crusts are thin transient soil surface layers that are less porous than the material immediately

and continuity of macropores compared to the underlying bulk soil hussein et al 2010 miralles mellado et al 2011 these changes in surface soil structure result in a substantial reduction in

factors that contribute to crust formation or the consequence of soil crust formation on soil hydrology nciizah and wakindiki 2015b modelling and prediction of surface crust characteristics is

richards equation to simulate water movement and storage in either one or two dimensions these models are spatially explicit in that individual soil layers are able to be separately described by knowledge of their thickness saturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil water retention function which is usually described by the van genuchten mualem equation as such it would seem a relatively simple task to model the effects of soil crusts on water movement and storage into and through the soil profile using spatially explicit richards equation models however measuring the hydraulic properties of soil crusts in order to parameterise such models is far from straight forward a task made all the more difficult by the thin fragile nature of soil crusts which makes routine measurement

normally associated with soil crusting assouline and mualem 2003 go so far as to state that there is not a single experimental study reported in the literature in which such detailed and extensive

was conducted in a commercial packet salad farm in the coal river valley in southern tasmania 42 72532 south 147 43182 east salad production requires up to 13 cultivations a year which has resulted in loss of soil carbon and led to severe soil crusting the climate was defined as mediterranean with 500 mm of annual rainfall yearly mean maximum temperature range of 12 22 c and mean minimum temperature range of 4 12 c bureau of meteorology 2015 the soil was classified as a brown chromosol isbell 2002 or alfisol soil survey staff 2006 derived from tertiary quaternary sediments the topsoil 0 5 cm depth contained 55 9 sand 10 8 silt and 33 3 clay and had a ph water of 6 0 electrical conductivity ec of 0 42 ds m 1 organic carbon of 2 3 cation exchange capacity cec of 13 9 meq 100 g 1 soil and exchangeable sodium percentage esp of 3 96 soil physical properties were monitored on 5 occasions 1 8 14 28 and 71 days after cultivation cultivation and bed forming were conducted in a single pass by rotary hoe the site was irrigated with approximately 3 to5 mm day 1 between day 1 and day 34 as per normal practice for salad production over summer and 11 separate irrigation or rainfall events over the following 37 days in situ soil tests were conducted on fallow beds adjacent sown beds as previous studies had encountered difficulty measuring soil physical properties as the crop matured 2 2 crust density total porosity crust density was measured in triplicate using the water replacement procedure 503 04 described by cresswell and hamilton 2002 the procedure involves removing the surface crust by scraping and the use of a thin water filled plastic bag to determine the volume of the extracted soil crust we augmented the approach by cresswell and hamilton 2002 to include the use of a battery powered hand held vacuum to ensure collection of the disturbed crust fragments soil density immediately beneath the soil crust 1 7 cm depth was measured in triplicate using 6 cm high 250 cm3 intact cores according to 503 01 cresswell and hamilton 2002 total porosity tp was calculated from the crust density in which the particle density was measured at 2 526 g cm 3 sd 0 014 g cm 3 using triplicate 50 ml pycnometers hao et al 2008 2 3 total porosity and near saturated moisture content at day 71 crust density and total porosity were determined on soil crusts collected 71 days after cultivation via the paraffin wax procedure 503 03 cresswell and hamilton 2002 analysis was conducted on i six 7 0 12 mm thick 3 0 8 0 g air dried fragments obtained by hand sampling and ii six 1 0 2 0 mm thick 0 2 1 2 g air dried crusts in which the soil attached to the base of the crust was carefully removed with a razor gravimetric soil moisture content of the air dried crusts was separately determined from five independent samples to be 0 023 g g 1 sd 0 002 g g 1 near saturated moisture content of soil crusts was also determined as a surrogate of total porosity by capillary wetting on ceramic suction tables cresswell 2002 five 7 0 12 mm thick crusts collected 71 days after cultivation were embedded on a ceramic tension table using a fine layer of diatomaceous earth crusts were slowly wet by capillary flow over a period of 1 week by raising the hanging column from 50 to 1 0 cm 0 1 kpa gravimetric near saturated soil moisture content was determined by drying at 105 c for 24 h the volume of the near saturated soil crusts could not be determined by the paraffin wax method due to their fragility when moist as such volumetric moisture content was calculated by the paraffin wax method for the air dried crusts capillary wetting of the 0 2 1 2 g crusts was not successful due to their fragility when moist 2 4 crust thickness and proportional area of pores sem and epoxy resin approaches crust thickness and porosity were determined from six images of three crust fragments collected 71 days after cultivation scanning electron micrograph sem images were obtained using a fei mla650 sem in the variable pressure mode at central science laboratory university of tasmania images were analysed for crust thickness porosity and pore size using photoshop cs3 and the analyse particle function in image j schneider et al 2012 in situ surface soil crusts were impregnated with around 350 cm3 west system 105 epoxy resin containing 10 g fluorescein dye the epoxy was poured into a 100 mm diameter ring placed on the soil surface two days after resin application the hardened soil was excavated and re impregnated with epoxy resin in a modified pressure cooker at 60 kpa hardened soils were cut vertically into 1 5 cm thick sections and photographed using a cannon 200d slr in both natural light and uv blacklight images were corrected for lens distortion and radial distortion in photoshop cs3 then converted to binary format and the proportion of pore space and non pore space determined using the analyse particle function in image j schneider et al 2012 2 5 unsaturated infiltration and hydraulic conductivity unsaturated infiltration experiments were conducted with 45 mm diameter decagon mini disk infiltrometers decagon version 10 and 200 mm diameter eijkelkamp 09 09 tension infiltrometers infiltration and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with the minidisk infiltrometer were determined in triplicate at supply potentials ψ of 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 05 kpa despite the infiltration disk of the eijkelkamp tension infiltrometer being detached from the supply reservoir to reduce weight during infiltration field observation indicated compression of the soil and thus change in soil structure during infiltration at matric potentials between 0 6 and 0 05 kpa consequently data from the eijkelkamp infiltrometer between 0 05 and 0 6 kpa were rejected whilst data between 1 0 kpa and 1 5 kpa were added to that of the minidisks which are only able to operate down to 0 6 kpa supply potential initial water content in the soil surface adjacent the infiltrometers and final water content below the tension infiltrometers was measured by inserting a calibrated decagon ec5 probe at a shallow angle into the upper 1 0 cm of the soil surface calibration was conducted by sequential drying in repacked soil at 1 30 g cm 3 in which changes in mass and sensor values were recorded twice a day for 9 days unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated according to the procedure developed by ankeny et al 1991 and presented in mckenzie et al 2002 2 6 effect of droplet height on infiltration steady state infiltration was measured using a cornell sprinkler infiltrometer mounted at 2 cm and 120 cm height in order to explore the effect of droplet energy on crust formation and infiltration measurements were conducted for 20 min for each of four replicates at both droplet heights flow rate from the infiltrometer was adjusted by lowering and raising the air entry tube and by shutting off flow in order to maintain a thin film of water on the soil surface whilst minimising runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the steady state infiltration rate according to reynolds and elrick 1990 in which the depth of ponding was assumed to be 2 0 mm and α assumed to be 0 06 cm 1 2 7 determination of the dry end soil water retention curve by wp4c the fragile nature of moist soil crusts prevents determination of their retention function by traditional suction table and pressure chamber methods as such the soil water retention function below 1000 kpa was determined by wp4c dew point hygrometer meter group inc usa on 4 replicate soil crusts collected 71 days after cultivation soil crusts were air dried to enable the crusts to be trimmed to between 2 and 5 mm thickness and fitted within the wp4c sample cups a set of four non crusted disturbed soil samples were also prepared for comparison the soil samples were slowly moistened without disturbance using a cold air humidifier over a period of several hours the samples were sealed and left overnight to equilibrate before being analysed by wp4c in the precise mode samples were dried under ambient conditions over several days in which multiple readings were obtained after equilibration by sealing the sample chamber for 1 h prior to analysis gravimetric moisture content was determined by oven drying at 105 c for 24 h following the final wp4c determination of matric potential data was converted to a volumetric basis by multiplication with bulk density determined by water replacement 2 8 determination of the van genuchten mualem parameters α ɳ and ksat by retc retc was used to estimate the van genuchten mualem α n and ksat parameters from the cumulative tension infiltration data as it is a considerably simpler and potentially more robust procedure compared to inverse estimation in hydrus 2d the computer program retc uses nonlinear least squares parameter optimization methods to estimate the unknown coefficients in the van genuchten mualem hydraulic model from observed water retention and or unsaturated hydraulic conductivity data van genuchten et al 1991 the maximum number of iterations was set at 50 initial values of α n and ksat were estimated using the rosetta pedotransfer function for a sandy clay loam patil and rajput 2009 fitting was performed with different combinations of input data i including or excluding wp4c dry end retention data ii including or excluding total porosity determined by water replacement iii fitting either all van genuchten mualem parameters or restricting fitting to only the α ɳ and ksat parameters 2 9 inverse estimation of the van genuchten mualem parameters by hydrus 2d inverse estimation of van genuchten parameter values from the cumulative tension infiltration at sequential supply potentials was conducted in hydrus 2d based on procedures developed in šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 1997 šimůnek et al 1998a two different flow domains were created for exploring whether knowledge of the van genuchten mualem properties of the soil beneath the soil crust influenced estimated parameter values of the crust a single layer axisymmetrical vertical flow domain based on šimůnek et al 1998a was created in which all soil throughout the flow domain had identical hydraulic properties the single layer approach assumed that water flow through the whole soil layer was controlled by the soil crust due to its lower saturated hydraulic conductivity the 40 cm 30 cm single layer flow domain had a 0 18 cm mesh refinement beneath the tension infiltrometer in order to improve simulation accuracy resulting in 1476 nodes and 2818 2d elements the dual layer flow domain consisted of a 0 20 mm thick upper boundary crust layer in which the hydraulic properties were included in the objective function and a lower beneath crust soil layer in which the hydraulic properties were measured using replicated intact cores by the ums hyprop evaporative flux procedure wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008 ums 2013 the 25 cm 30 cm dual layer flow domain had a 0 18 cm mesh refinement near the soil surface to provide sufficient nodes to separately represent the soil crust resulting in a total of 3539 nodes and 6840 2d elements the flexibility of the hydrus 2d inverse estimation procedure enabled inclusion and exclusion of a broad range of different observed data and output parameters in which we sought to identify the best trade off between input data requirements and output quality where values for θr θs and ksat may be estimated by other means i e total porosity by water replacement to represent θs etc the simplest simulations consisted of only including α and ɳ in the objective function whilst the most complex simulations included all van genuchten mualem parameters in the objective function in all 38 different combinations of input data and simulations options were simulated for the tension infiltration conducted 71 days after cultivation table 1 in all simulations initial values for parameters in the objective function were estimated using the rosetta pedotransfer function for a sandy clay loam patil and rajput 2009 the pore connectivity parameter ʅ was assumed to be 0 5 to reduce the number of variables in the objective function and all infiltration data were equally weighted with a factor of 1 with the exception of the final volumetric moisture content θfinal ksat and total porosity which were weighted by a factor of 10 as suggested by ramos et al 2006 2 10 statistical analysis changes in crust density aggregate stability hydraulic conductivity and steady state infiltration over time were explored using one way analysis of variance anova with bonferroni post hoc test differences in unsaturated infiltration rate and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity over time were explored using one way analysis of variance anova with bonferroni post hoc test for each supply potential differences in steady state infiltration between the two droplet heights were determined using t tests as the wp4c generates unique matric potential versus gravimetric moisture content data pairs for each sample statistical analysis between the crusted and non crusted soil required data to be fitted using a logarithmic function r2 0 96 this function was then used to estimate gravimetric water content at matric potentials of 1000 2000 5000 10000 20000 and 50 000 kpa to which one way analysis of variance and t test were used to explore differences in all tests significant differences were said to exist if p 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted in spss version 21 3 results 3 1 crust density crust density measured by water replacement significantly increased from 1 17 g cm 3 sd 0 02 g cm 3 one day after cultivation to 1 42 g cm 3 sd 0 03 g cm 3 14 days after cultivation and to 1 50 g cm 3 sd 0 03 g cm 3 28 days after cultivation accordingly total porosity decreased from 0 54 to 0 42 cm3 cm 3 and to 0 41 cm3 cm 3 over the same period the maximum crust density was 1 51 g cm 3 sd 0 04 g cm 3 as such the lowest total porosity was 0 401 cm3 cm 3 which was observed 71 days after cultivation crust density did not

cultivation to 1 31 g cm 3 sd 0 03 g cm 3 14 days after cultivation presumably due to consolidation after which soil density remained unchanged 3 2 crust density and total porosity day 71 the density

crust porosity sem images indicated that the soil crusts consisted of two distinct layers an upper layer 290 μm thick layer and a 1800 μm thick layer the upper crust layer had approximately 0 04 cm2

cm2 cm 2 overall the soil crusts were estimated to have an average porosity of around 0 14 cm2 cm 2 analysis of the epoxy resin impregnated blocks indicated that prior to rainfall or irrigation day 1 the pore area near the soil surface was 0 55 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 09 cm3 cm 3 which reduced to 0 25 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 07 cm3 cm 3 at 100 μm depth fig 3 by day 14 surface porosity had reduced to 0 11 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 07 cm3 cm 3 which then increased to 0 21 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 07 cm3 cm 3 at 4000 μm depth and below by day 28 surface porosity had further reduced to 0 07 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 03 cm3 cm 3 whilst between 300 and 1000 μm depth porosity was less than 0 05 cm2 cm 2 sd 0 00 cm3 cm 3 the linear decrease in porosity from 100 to 4000 μm depth indicates that surface crusts sampled 14 and 28 days after cultivation ranged in thickness somewhere between 4000 and 6000 μm fig 3 in summary values of total porosity or surrogates of porosity near saturated moisture content and final moisture content after infiltration for crusts collected 71 days after cultivation were between 0 07 cm2 cm 2 to 0 520 cm3 cm 3 direct approaches including water replacement and paraffin wax coating of air dried and capillary crust resulted in values between 0 401 and 0 520 cm3 cm 3 ignoring the 1 0 2 0 mm thick crusts whereas the soil moisture sensor and visual approaches resulted in values between 0 07 and 0 22 cm2 cm 2 table 2 3 4 infiltration and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity infiltration and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity decreased at all supply potentials as the soil crust developed fig 4 overall unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at 0 05 kpa supply potential significantly decreased from day 1 at 136 91 mm h 1 sd 8 32 mm h 1 to day 71 at 10 14 mm h 1 sd 1 95 mm h 1 and from 22 26 mm h 1 sd 2 59 mm h 1 to 2 87 mm h 1 sd 0 33 mm h 1 at the 0 6 kpa supply potential unsaturated hydraulic conductivity decreased significantly at all supply potentials from day 1 to day 8 and between day 8 and day 14 other than at 0 6 kpa no significant difference in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity existed between day 14 and day 28 whilst between day 28 and day 71 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity only decreased significantly at the 0 05 kpa supply potential fig 4 3 5 infiltration and droplet height steady state infiltration rate was significantly lower for droplets emitted from 120 cm height compared to 2 cm height for all the measurements other than those performed on day 71 for droplets emitted at 2 cm height the steady state infiltration rate ranged from 474 mm h 1 sd 45 2 mm h 1 on day 1 to 33 2 mm h 1 sd 12 1 mm h 1 on day 71 whilst for droplets emitted from 120 cm height the steady state infiltration rate ranged from 178 mm h 1 sd 51 0 mm h 1 on day 1 12 1 mm h 1 sd 3 01 mm h 1 on day 71 no significant difference in the steady state infiltration rate existed between day 8 day 14 and day 28 for droplets falling from both 2 0 cm and 120 cm height field soils exposed to droplets emitted at 2 cm height reached the minimum infiltration rate 71 days after cultivation whereas droplets emitted at 120 cm height reached the minimum infiltration rate only 8 days after cultivation fig 5 3 6 determination of the van genuchten mualem parameters α ɳ and ksat the dry end water retention curves measured with the wp4c were described by a logarithmic relationship in which no significant differences existed between the crusted and non crusted soil water retention curves the permanent wilting point 1500 kpa for the crusted soil was 0 118 cm3 cm 3 and 0 105 cm3 cm 3 for the non crusted soil the retc fitting approach indicated that provision of wp4c and total porosity data in the solution data and or inclusion or exclusion of θs and θr in the objective function had minimal effect on estimated van genuchten mualem parameter values or parameter error fig 6 however inclusion of wp4c data without the total porosity data resulted in considerable overestimation of θs whilst inclusion of total porosity in the solution data without the wp4c data often led to failure of the solution to converge data not presented retc indicated that saturated hydraulic conductivity α and η all decreased with time between day 1 and day 28 as the crust formed however on day 71 the α and η values were similar to values measured on day 14 the hydrus 2d inverse estimation of van genuchten mualem parameter values were conducted using the single layer flow domain as the difference between the single and dual flow domains was slight differences from 5 comparative simulations was 0 011 cm3 cm 3 for θr and 0 015 cm3 cm 3 for θs in which the dual layer simulation only improved the overall model fit r2 by 0 003 inclusion or exclusion of additional data and different means of measuring additional data total porosity near saturated water content θfinal wp4c in the hydrus 2d inverse solution resulted in vastly different retention curves fig 7 and corresponding van genuchten parameter values table 3 estimated values for the saturated water content θs parameter were strongly influenced by the form of the input data as expected inverse solutions in which θfinal was measured by the ec 5 probe resulted in θs values near the measured value of 0 219 cm3 cm 3 table 3 h i j k while simulations in which final moisture content were determined by capillary wetting resulted in θs values at or near the measured value at 0 464 cm3 cm 3 table 3 j and k and those in which θs was specified as the total porosity determined by water replacement resulted in θs values of 0 402 cm3 cm 3 table 3 a b e simulations in which neither θfinal or total porosity were provided in the solution data table 3 c d f g resulted in similar dry end retention data and θr values to those in which total porosity or θfinal data were provided yet when wp4c data was included in the solution data without provision of total porosity or θfinal data table 3 c and d θs values solved to 0 550 cm3 cm 3 the maximum allowable θs value and thus in error when wp4c data was not included in the solution data and no θfinal or total porosity data were provided table 3 f and g θs values were incorrectly low around 0 165 cm3 cm 3 and had high parameter error somewhat unexpectedly inclusion of wp4c retention data in the inverse solution data had minimal effect on the θr parameter and the dry end of the retention curve table 3 a vs e c vs f d vs g and fig 7 however inclusion of wp4c data in the objective function had minimal effect on estimated values of θs when θfinal data was included in the solution data h vs i j

soil water retention curves determined by inclusion or exclusion of θfinal wp4c and total porosity data within the hydrus 2d inverse solution of multistep tension infiltration into a surface soil crust 71 days after cultivation letter nomenclature refers to different simulation strategies detailed in table 3 error in both the parameter values and the inverse solution were difficult to relate to the simulation approach other than simulations in which parameter values for α and n were previously determined by retc simulations in which the wp4c data was included in the solution data tended to have higher rmse 0 190 and lower r2 values 0 979 than simulations in which wp4c data were not provided 0 059 0 989 respectively table 3 simulations e f j and k produced the highest error values for θr whilst simulations c d and f showed the highest error values for θs overall error in simulations g and i which did not include wp4c or total porosity values in the solution data had the lowest parameter error for both the van genuchten parameters and the overall inverse simulation however it should be noted that simulation f which also excluded wp4c and total porosity information from the solution data had extremely high error values for the θr and θs parameters inclusion of wp4c information in the inverse solution data resulted in lower r2 values and higher rmse than inverse simulations in which wp4c data was withheld in addition while inclusion of the wp4c values in the inverse solution data had little effect on estimated θr values inclusion of the wp4c data profoundly reduced the average θr parameter error from 6 991 to 0 008 cm3 cm 3 table 3 different approaches for estimating van genuchten maulem parameter values also had considerable influence on estimated changes in soil water retention curves over time table 4 the hydrus 2d inverse solution in which the wp4c data was included in the solution data indicated crust formation resulted in a sequential loss of pores between 0 and 10 000 kpa pores greater than 0 03 μm diameter over time fig 8 a for inverse solutions in which the wp4c data was withheld from the solution data fig 8b there was a small loss of pores between 0 and 1 kpa pores larger than 300 μm diameter and considerable loss of all pores less than 1 kpa between days 14 and day 71 including complete loss of all pores less than 50 kpa pores less than 300 μm and 6 μm diameter respectively the soil water retention curves produced by retc are similar to those of the hydrus 2d inverse simulation without the wp4c data yet the retc based retention curves appear steeper and reach a value of around 0 10 cm3 cm 3 between 1 and 10 kpa fig 8c as opposed to 10 000 kpa as existed with the hydrus 2d inverse simulations with wp4c data fig 8a the rect k ψ fitting approach fig 8c suggested that crust formation between days 1 and day 14 resulted in loss of pores between 0 and 1 kpa pores larger than 300 μm and creation of pores between 1 and 1000 kpa pores between 300 and 0 03 μm however between day 14 and day 28 crust formation resulted in a small loss of pores between 0 and 1000 kpa pores greater than 0 3 μm whilst between day 28 and day 71 crust formation resulted in a small loss of pores between 0 1 and 1000 kpa pores between 3000 and 0 3 μm diameter 4 discussion 4 1 crust thickness and sampling error we experienced difficulty identifying the lower boundary of the soil crusts the sem analysis indicated that soil crusts extended to approximately 2100 μm depth the epoxy resin analysis at day 28 indicated crust extended to somewhere between 4000 and 6000 μm depth whilst hand sampling on day 71 resulted in collection of 7000 12000 μm thick crusts the difficulty we experienced determining the thickness of the surface crusts was not unique to this study mualem and assouline 1989 also reported that it was quite difficult to define exactly the seal lower boundary our estimation that crusts were between 4000 and 7000 μm thick is generally consistent with the literature including armenise et al 2018 who reported crust thickness ranged from 600 to 5400 μm ma et al 2014 reported crust thicknesses between 3000 and 5000 μm while pires et al 2007 found crust thicknesses were between 2300 and 3500 μm the greater thickness of crust in this study compared to the literature values was attributed to sampling up to 71 days after disturbance compared to mostly single event and short term studies 4 2 effect of crust development on pore size and infiltration the effects of crust formation on infiltration have been widely reported romkens et al 1990 moss 1991 nciizah and wakindiki 2015b wang et al 2016 we found infiltration rates underwent a 15 fold decrease over the 71 day monitoring period this reduction in infiltration rate is greater than many short term or single event studies such as bullard et al 2018 who reported that 9 mm artificial rainfall reduced infiltration by a factor of between 3 and 10 on 11 different soils and jakab et al 2013 who reported a 3 fold reduction in infiltration associated with crust formation analysis of droplet height on infiltration demonstrated that emitting droplets at 120 cm height compared to 2 0 cm resulted in a 62 lower infiltration rate on day 1 and 79 lower infiltration rate day 28 this along with the tension infiltration data suggests that crust formation principally resulting from raindrop impact which continued least 28 and possibly up to 71 days after cultivation this finding is significant in that it differs to most of the literature mostly single events or short term studies with artificial rainfall which indicate that crusts develop in a matter of minutes to hours mellis et al 1996 fohrer et al 1999 castilho et al 2011 armenise et al 2018 crust formation is known to decrease infiltration in response to reduced size number and continuity of pores at and near the soil surface pagliai et al 1983 bresson and boiffin 1990 valentin and bresson 1992 pagliai 2007 yet little is known of the effects of crust formation on pore size distribution the tension infiltration data demonstrated that crust formation reduced the presence of all soil pore size classes greater than 300 μm reduction in pore size tended to be greatest for pores larger than 500 μm as indicated by larger changes in hydraulic conductivity at supply potentials near zero furthermore crust formation tended to no longer affect sequentially larger pores over time the retc and hydrus 2d procedures also indicated that crust formation up to day 28 resulted in loss of pores greater than 300 μm but did not affect pores less than 0 3 μm unfortunately differences between procedures means that the effect of crust formation on changes in pores between 300 μm and 0 3 μm could not be inferred these findings are similar to malam issa et al 2004 who also reported that crust formation resulted in reduced relative hydraulic conductivity in larger pores between 600 and 2000 μm whilst panini et al 1997 found that crust formation mostly occurred through loss of 200 1000 μm pores whilst pores between 50 and 100 μm were mostly unaffected 4 3 determination of total porosity independent determination of total porosity was found to be important for estimation of θs and to a lesser extent α and ɳ determination of the total porosity or saturated water content of the soil crusts proved surprisingly difficult with each approach resulting in vastly different values we suspect the water replacement method may have overestimated total porosity due to more porous soil being attached underneath the crust during hand sampling in addition the volume of the soil crust may have been underestimated by difficulty filling the void created by the excavation of the crust with the water filled plastic bag as also noted by cresswell and hamilton 2002 unfortunately the literature does not provide any guidance on the veracity of our measurements as reported values for crust density range from 1 74 to 1 88 g cm 3 tarchitzky et al 1984 to 1 26 g cm 3 han et al 2016 compared to our value of 1 51 g cm 3 sd 0 04 g cm 3 the sem and epoxy image based approaches resulted in considerably lower estimates of porosity than the direct methods other than the ec 5 sensor underestimation of porosity by sem is thought to have resulted from difficulty distinguishing between soil voids and the soil matrix whilst underestimation of porosity with the epoxy method resulted from poor ingress of the epoxy resin and uv tracer into non surface connected pores dead end pores and pores within larger aggregates capillary wetting of ex situ crusts was able to accurately determine the gravimetric moisture content of soil crusts near saturation however their fragile nature prevented direct measurement of their volume by paraffin wax and thus the volumetric moisture content could not be directly calculated the ex situ determination of the total porosity of air dried crusts by the paraffin wax approach proved highly unreliable not only did values of crust density vary widely analysis revealed that a significant r2 0 7 0 9 relationship existed between crust density and the amount of adsorbed wax which suggest that wax ingress into surface pores compromised the procedure normally the paraffin wax approach is conducted on large soil clods in which wax ingress into surface pores results in a minor error due to the low surface area to volume ratio of the clods however when applied to thin surface crusts with high surface area to volume ratio wax ingress into surface pores reduced the proportion of air filled pores without influencing the measured volume estimation of total porosity from θfinal following tension infiltration failed we sought to avoid the issues identified by mckenzie et al 2002 associated with determination of θfinal in which a thin scraping of the soil surface is taken immediately after infiltration this approach is particularly problematic for investigations of soil crusts due to the need to independently determine crust density flooding of the soil surface during removal of the tension infiltrometer mixing of the soil crust with the sand contact material and difficulty only sampling the soil crust and not the underlying more porous soil values θfinal by the ec 5 soil moisture probe were impossibly low 0 220 cm3 cm 3 sd 0 008 cm3 cm 3 being less than the gravimetric moisture content of the near saturated capillary wetted crusts 0 394 cm3 cm 3 sd 0 042 cm3 cm 3 whilst the θfinal is expected to be slightly lower than capillary wetted aggregates due to air entrapment in non surface connected pores during infiltration šimůnek et al 1998b these differences should be slight in a compacted non porous crust accordingly we attributed the error with the ec 5 sensor to its shallow installation resulting in the sensor reading the air above the soil crust or fault with the laboratory calibration procedure in which the nature of the field soil crusts were not able to be adequately replicated in the laboratory 4 4 determination of van genuchten parameters retc was unable to solve for the θs parameter however retc produced remarkably consistent estimates of α n and ksat regardless of parameterisation approach in the case of ksat this is not unexpected due to the simple nature of the extrapolation of the k ψ curve to zero using the van genuchten mualem equation whilst retc predicted α and η values seemed reasonable parameter error was high which was attributed to the α and η parameters being fitted to the whole retention curve based on only 6 data points all of which were very close to saturation 0 05 to 0 6 kpa hydrus 2d determination of van genuchten mualem parameter values by inverse estimation of stepwise cumulative infiltration was generally poor and inconsistent error was largely due to dependence of the approach on provision of a independent measure of total porosity or θfinal which we were unable to measure with a high degree of confidence without provision of either total porosity or θfinal inverse estimation of van genuchten parameters was poor resulting in unrealistic parameter values and unacceptably high parameter error terms despite exceptionally good agreement between the measured and inversely estimated cumulative infiltration data ventrella et al 2005 also reported difficulty inversely solving van genuchten parameters from multi tension infiltration data for which they suggested that independent water retention measurements from soil cores is required to estimate α šimůnek and van genuchten 2000 also produced poor estimates of retention function values despite removing θr from the objective function to force the retention curves to the same end point and šimůnek et al 1998b found that inverse estimation of cumulative infiltration from tensiometers resulted in underestimation of θs θr and ksat inclusion of the wp4c values in the inverse solution had little effect on estimated θr values however inclusion of wp4c values in the solution profoundly reduced parameter error and resulted in more realistic values for α and η hardie et al 2013 also reported the inverse solution of tension infiltration were improved by independent determination of soil moisture content at 1500 kpa whilst augeard et al 2007 reported that model uncertainty during inverse estimation of soil crust hydraulic properties from a laboratory transient outflow experiment was dominated by the θr parameter 5 conclusion this study attempted to evaluate approaches for measuring or estimating the physical properties of soil crusts to facilitate the simulation of soil crusts in richards equation based soil water models this study has clearly shown the nature and rate of changes in a range of soil physical properties associated with the development of soil crust over time which in contrast to many laboratory or artificial rainfall studies demonstrated that crust development occurred up to at least 28 days and possibly 71 days after cultivation estimation and measurement of the crust hydraulic properties proved difficult and often inconsistent uncertainty resulted in part from difficulty matching sampling depth to crust thickness for example the sem and epoxy resin impregnation images indicated the crust layer extended to at least 2000 μm and possibly up to 6000 μm thickness whereas hand sampling for determination of total porosity by water replacement and ex situ approaches tended to remove crusts of 7000 10 000 μm thickness this potential for sampling the more porous soil beneath the true crust is thought to have resulted in overestimation of crust porosity by a number of approaches including water replacement paraffin wax method capillary wetting of ex situ soil crusts and thus also estimates of θs the extent to which potential overestimation of porosity influenced values of θs is unknown and was unable to be independently tested estimation of θs and to a lesser extent the α and ɳ parameters required accurate independent assessment of either total porosity or the final soil moisture content beneath the tension infiltrometer whilst determination of total porosity or the final soil moisture content of normal soils is straightforward we encountered considerable difficulty determining these properties for thin fragile soil crusts previous approaches in which θs had been solved using knowledge of θfinal are not supported due to poor sensor function in shallow soils and multiple difficulties associated with the thin scraping technique results from this study suggest that total porosity is best measured in situ using the water replacement technique described by cresswell and hamilton 2002 with due care to prevent or minimise sampling the more porous soil attached to the underneath of the soil crust uncertainty also existed with the estimation of θr α and ɳ error with the estimation of θr was found to be greatly reduced by provision of wp4c dry end retention values however this approach is also prone to error as it requires independent measurement of crust density to convert values to a volumetric basis we were unable to adequately determine whether if retc or hydrus 2d were the better procedure for estimation of α and ɳ from cumulative tension infiltration data both techniques were found to be greatly influenced by prior determination of total porosity retc produced consistent values for α and η but with lower r2 values and higher parameter error than the hydrus 2d inverse solutions parameter error with the hydrus 2d approach was generally noted to be lower when wp4c and ksat values were included in the solution data uncertainty with the retc approach resulted from extrapolation of only 6 data points near saturation over the entire water retention curve the ksat parameter was easily and reliably estimated by retc extrapolation of the conductivity function to zero potential whilst we made considerable progress with the measurement and estimation of soil crust hydraulic properties further research is required to develop better procedures for the measurement of θs α and ɳ

6416,it is computationally difficult to model unsaturated flow through a highly fractured rock system that contains porous rock matrix densely distributed fracture networks and narrowly spaced drainage holes we present an efficient numerical procedure that uses a three dimensional finite element model to solve richards equation with embedded zero thickness elements for fractures and line elements for drainage holes a mixed boundary condition is applied at potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone is specified to precisely locate the phreatic surface the procedure compares favorably with results from other numerical solutions and experimental data a case study is developed to evaluate seepage through a densely fractured rock slope the simulated results demonstrate that fractures disorder the hydraulic potential distribution with fracture patterns acting as significant influential factors and drainage holes dramatically lower the phreatic surface due to the effects of drainage and depressurization the proposed numerical procedure shows to be capable of investigating the unsaturated flow in highly fractured rock mass keywords unsaturated flow rock mass fracture network drainage hole numerical analysis 1 introduction fractured rock mass is a typical kind of complicated geological medium that comprises structural bodies surrounded by significant structural features such as flaws faults joints bedding planes fissures and fractures which are commonly termed as geological discontinuities chen 2019 these discontinuities with various attitudes and different scales play a dominant role in determining the physical and mechanical properties of rock mass e g density thermal conductivity permeability deformability and strength jaeger et al 2007 sahimi 2011 for most geotechnical engineering problems such as fractured petroleum reservoirs geothermal energy extraction nuclear waste disposal carbon dioxide geologic storage slope stability and seepage control for hydraulic structures e g dam foundations the mechanical and hydraulic behaviors of rock mass are closely related to the fractures and the subsurface flow in them both saturated and unsaturated ye et al 2017 prediction of water flow in fractured rock mass is a matter of continuing and significant interest for engineering practice however it has always been challenging due to the highly heterogeneous discontinuities within the rock mass especially for the unsaturated case which brings about additional strong nonlinearity to the analysis this leads to extensive research on the development of suitable and efficient numerical approaches for fractured rock mass generally numerical models used for simulating water transport through fractured rock mass can be divided into two categories the continuum equivalent porous medium epm models and the discrete fracture network dfn ones in the epm models fractured rock mass is generalized as an equivalent porous medium with isotropic and homogeneous properties and it is usually assumed that the seepage flow of underground water through the rock mass obeys darcy s law which could reflect the comprehensive effects of fractures and rocks snow 1969 neuman 1973 in the past few decades significant progress has been made toward developing the numerical solutions to unconfined seepage problems based on the epm models oda 1986 jackson et al 2000 pan et al 2010 though the epm models are simple to implement and require low computational resources they are not suitable for the cases where the influence of the individual fractures cannot be ignored for example the small scale studies from previous investigations pyrak nolte et al 1988 zimmerman et al 1992 the permeability of intact rock block is usually recognized to be extremely low and generally several orders of magnitude smaller than that of fractures the presence of fractures can enhance the permeability of rock mass and provides preferential and fast flow pathways when connective fracture networks are formed ren et al 2017a in the dfn models the geological geometry and hydraulic properties of individual fractures can be explicitly considered in the simulation i e both the fluid flow in the fractures and that in the surrounding rock matrix blocks are simulated cacas et al 1990 benedetto et al 2014 for such models the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the groundwater flux can be described more accurately and conveniently with cubic law describing the fluid flow through the fractures whereas darcy s law for modeling the porous flow in intact rock the effects of fractures particularly from distinct fracture patterns e g fracture density length width and distribution are explicitly interpreted increasing attractions have been drawn to model the subsurface flow in fractured rock mass using dfn models see literature rasmussen 1991 jiang et al 2014 zhang 2015 xing et al 2017 xu et al 2018 with both rocks and individual fractures modeled and the flux exchange between them taken into account the dfn models are more difficult to implement owing to the mesh discretization and the poor convergence of the numerical integration particularly for the cases considering dense fracture networks furthermore the unsaturated or unconfined seepage problems involving a phreatic surface through the fractured rock mass could make the simulation using dfn models more complicated the variably saturated flow and infiltration outflow boundaries in the fractures or fracture networks may be highly nonlinear recently significant efforts have been made to develop numerical solutions for the unsaturated water flow in fractured rock mass evans et al 2001 or et al 2005 for instance ye et al 2017 employed a discrete fracture modeling method and developed a systematic finite element algorithm to analyze water movement in unsaturated fractured rocks with the van genuchten model for describing the constitutive relationships of unsaturated flow ren et al 2016a proposed an efficient unconfined seepage analysis method for analyzing fluid flow in fractured rock mass by modeling both the porous rock matrix and the discrete fractures as permeable pipe networks a finite volume based approach was applied to solve the equations for unconfined seepage flow the method has been validated by finding the phreatic surface in dam structures fang and zhu 2018 developed a new approach to simulate groundwater flow through both an overlying unconfined aquifer and an underlying discrete fracture network the groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network is explicitly simulated with laminar and turbulent flows zhang et al 2017 proposed a novel numerical method by coupling the radial point interpolation method rpim and finite element method fem with rpim utilized to model the rock matrix and fem for the fractures the mesh discretization was simplified and the two dimensional 2d free surface seepage analysis in fractured rock mass was conducted however the large amount of computational cost in numerical models still restricts their feasibility and applicability for engineering practice particularly for the three dimensional 3d cases the scale of many engineering problems outstrips that of thin fractures or joints and tiny drainage holes or injection production wells seepage analysis for rock mass containing both fractures and drainage holes is also essential for the design of seepage control measures the presence of dense discontinuities and drainage holes in rock mass results in a complex fractured rock system and current modeling techniques are insufficient for such scenarios therefore it is important to develop a more efficient numerical approach for unsaturated or unconfined seepage analysis in the complex fractured rock system which is also the main objective of the present study in this paper an efficient modeling procedure is proposed for unsaturated seepage analysis in highly fractured rock mass an improved dfn model is developed for a complex system composed of rock matrix blocks discrete fracture networks and drainage holes based on the unsaturated flow theory a 3d fem is adopted to solve the unsaturated seepage problems with fractures modeled by embedded zero thickness elements and drainage holes interpreted as line elements the mesh discretization is considerably simplified and the computational cost is efficiently reduced in order to precisely determine the location of phreatic surface and the downstream exit points a mixed boundary condition is applied for the potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone is utilized for locating the phreatic surface the proposed modeling procedure is tested and evaluated by comparison with other numerical solutions and experimental data finally a case study with respect to the seepage field in fractured rock slope is presented for better understanding the effects of fractures and drainage holes 2 basic theory for unsaturated flow 2 1 governing equation naturally fractured rock mass is traditionally conceptualized as a dual porosity and dual permeability medium containing fractures or fracture networks with high permeability and rock matrix with relatively lower permeability with regard to fluid flow in the fractured rock mass the mixed case involving saturated flow and capillary flow can be easily envisaged i e the saturated and unsaturated flow a typical example demonstrating the unsaturated flow of water through a rock slope under the hydraulic potential including capillary suction hydraulic pressure and gravity force is shown in fig 1 the entire domain of the fractured system for both fractures and rock matrix is categorized into three parts i e the saturated zone referring to the lowermost zone with the pores or fractures fully filled with water the dry zone to the uppermost zone with the pores or fractures completely dry and the unsaturated zone in between particularly for fractures the saturated zone provides preferential flow paths along fracture walls with direct connectivity to porous matrix and the dry zone restricts in both tangential and normal directions the three zones are separated by the phreatic surface or water table and the wetting front respectively in this case it is therefore desirable to have a unified description of saturated and unsaturated flow unsaturated flow theory is generally utilized to describe water penetration into partially saturated fractured rock mass based on the assumption of neglecting the gas phase transport water movement in porous media e g soil concrete and rock mass is governed by richards equation sahimi 2011 shoushtari et al

relation seeking a solution for the unsaturated flow problem requires prior knowledge of the specific moisture capacity c m and the relative permeability k r both of which are dependent on the water retention properties of the medium numerous approaches toward mathematical representation i e fitting or prediction of the soil water characteristic curve have been proposed lu and likos 2004 xin et al 2016 ye et al 2018 the brooks and corey model the van genuchten model and the fredlund and xing model are commonly adopted for geotechnical engineering applications lu and likos 2004 for example the van genuchten model is usually written as van genuchten 1980 8 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ϕ p n m ϕ p 0 θ s ϕ p 0 9 k r s e l 1 1 s e 1 m 2 ϕ p 0 1 ϕ p 0 in which α n l 0 5 and m 1 1 n are empirical fitting parameters obtained from experimental data and ϕ p 0 is the atmospheric pressure that distinguishes the saturated and unsaturated zone another key parameter namely the specific moisture capacity is defined as shoushtari et al 2015 10 c m d θ d ϕ p ϕ p 0 0 ϕ p 0 once these water retention properties have been determined the richards equation can be solved to account for the saturated and unsaturated flow 3 methodology in this study a dfn based numerical procedure is developed for modeling the hydraulic behavior of unsaturated fractured rock mass it is assumed that the complex dfn system is composed of rock matrix discrete fracture networks and drainage holes with the geometry and position of each individual fractures specified as well as the drainage holes based on the richards equation the unsaturated flow in such a dfn system is numerically modeled by 3d fem regarding the grid discretization for fe analysis the rock matrix domain is discretized into 3d solid elements fractures are modeled with embedded zero thickness elements and drainage holes are interpreted as line elements in order to precisely determine the location of seepage line i e phreatic surface and downstream exit points a mixed boundary condition is applied to the potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone is utilized a detailed description of this numerical procedure is outlined below 3 1 modeling of fluid flow in rock matrix and fractures in the dfn based model the rock matrix is postulated as an isotropic porous medium and thus the unsaturated flow in this phase is governed by eq 1 while that of the fracture is quite different the unsaturated flow in a fracture is strongly affected by many factors not only the fracture aperture and orientation but also the fracture roughness and the connectivity of multi fractures the geometrical aperture of a fracture is rather small but has a significant influence on the permeability so it should be gauged as precisely as possible in spite of the inherent difficulties chen 2019 the extremely small fracture aperture and the actual complex fracture network could bring about high complexity in dfn modeling special element types are usually adopted in fem to describe the transport behavior along the fracture network for example the extended finite element berrone et al 2013 the composite element chen et al 2010 the embedded element qian and xu 2017 and the zero thickness element li et al 2017b in this study the zero thickness element is further extended to model the unsaturated flow in highly dense fractures embedded in rock matrix as shown in fig 2 the zero thickness element has been successfully employed to simulate the unsaturated water penetration and capillary absorption in interfacial transition zone itz and microcracks within concrete as reported in the authors previous work li et al 2017a b for simplicity the surface roughness effects of the fracture are not considered in the present work the fracture is considered as a pair of open smooth and parallel plates with a uniform aperture or width referred to the mechanical aperture with regard to the unsaturated flow in fractures one of the common approaches for numerical modeling is to assume an analogy to flow in porous media in this study the fractured domain is idealized as a porous medium with porosity of 1 0 so the richards equation could be adopted again similar to the works of ye et al 2017 li et al 2017a and lu et al 2018 to properly incorporate the effect of highly permeable fracture network the governing equation for unsaturated flow along the fractures is given as 11 d f c m s e s f ϕ f t τ d f ρ g μ κ f k r τ ϕ f f where d f represents the mechanical aperture l of a fracture and k f is its saturated permeability coefficient l t 1 denoted as k f κ f k r with κ f representing the intrinsic permeability of fracture l2 ϕ f is the hydraulic potential l in the fracture and ϕ f p is the pressure potential l denoted as ϕ f p ϕ f z f is the flow rate l t 1 penetrating into fracture in the normal direction from rock matrix i e the flux exchange between the fracture and the rock matrix which is expressed as 12 f up k m d ϕ up d n up f down k m d ϕ down d n down in which k m is the permeability of the rock matrix n is the unit vector normal to the fracture plane and the subscripts up and down respectively mean the up and down surfaces note that water exchange occurs on both sides of the fracture therefore f equals the sum of f up and f down the term d ϕ d n means the gradient of hydraulic potential between the fracture and the matrix material which can be written as 13 d ϕ d n ϕ f ϕ 1 2 d f as the opening of a fracture is far smaller than the normal size of the fractured rock mass it can be assumed that the hydraulic potentials at two sides of the fracture plane are identical i e 14 ϕ up ϕ down ϕ f the permeability of individual fractures is a dominant factor to the bulk hydraulic performance of the rock mass according to the basic theory of fluid mechanics the physical mathematical description of laminar flow through a single fracture is described by the cubic law which is developed from the parallel plate concept li et al 2017b chen 2019 by combining this equation with darcy s law the water permeability coefficient or hydraulic conductivity of a fracture is given as 15 k f ρ g μ κ f ρ g w f 2 12 μ in eq 15 w f is the hydraulic aperture of the fracture different from the mechanical fracture that representing the separation distance between the two walls the hydraulic aperture is in a way a virtual aperture which is just defined according to the cubic law using equivalent flow rate method rasmussen 1995 zou et al 2013 since the fractures are conceptualized as smooth parallel plates in this work it could be assumed that its hydraulic aperture is equal to the mechanical aperture i e w f d f with the aforementioned formulations the fracture is idealized as a thin conductive porous layer with larger water permeability in rock mass the fracture aperture is implicitly modeled in its permeation equation in eq 11 so the mesh discretization could be accomplished with ease the zero thickness fracture element can not only model the hydraulic response in the fracture but also reduce the number of freedom degrees without generating new solid elements and consequently bring down the computational cost 3 2 modeling of fluid flow in drainage holes to improve the stability of fractured rock mass drainage facilities containing a large number of drainage holes with small diameter e g 3 10 cm are usually deployed within a small width and large stretch zone e g distance of 1 5 3 m between the holes in the explicit modeling approaches the wall of the drainage holes is commonly taken as boundary with possible drainage conditions this may result in a tremendous amount of time consuming pre processing work to discretize the calculation domain furthermore when the free surface is intersected by the drainage holes the iteration procedure will become fairly complicated chen et al 2010 chen 2015 to address these considerations line elements with much higher permeability are employed to simulate drainage hole while preventing the computational mesh from becoming strongly dependent on how the drainage holes are deployed in this work it is assumed that the drainage hole is filled with a virtual filler material with much larger permeability coefficient similar to the conceptualized air element hu and chen 2003 chen et al 2010 therefore the drainage hole can be included in the variational equation of fem and no boundary condition should be imposed on the wall of the hole the permeability of drainage hole serves as a virtual index for indicating the effect of drainage and it should be sufficiently large to drain water that penetrates into the hole as stated in literature hu and chen 2003 chen et al 2010 the appropriate permeability for the imagined material within the drainage hole ranges between 103 and 104 larger than that of the surrounding rock when guaranteeing the solution precision for the line elements representing a drainage hole see fig 3 of radius r and permeability k h the flux exchange between the drainage hole and rock matrix is given by 16 q m k m d ϕ dr 2 π r q h k h ϕ ϕ h r 2 π r 17 f h q h π r 2 where ϕ h is the hydraulic potential in the drainage hole and ϕ is the hydraulic potential nearby the surrounding rock matrix at the interface q m is the flux l2 t 1 drained from the surrounding rock matrix and q h is the flux l2 t 1 penetrating into the drainage hole from the point view of the mass conservation principle q m q h f h serves as a source sink term t 1 for line elements which can be directly incorporated into the fem simulation when the phreatic surface is intersected by the drainage hole the value of ϕ h is equal to the gravitational potential z with respect to the flux penetrating into the line elements it is given by eq 17 for the saturated zone ϕ h z and turns out to be zero for the unsaturated and dry zones ϕ h z using this method the drainage holes are modeled as conductive pipes in the entire domain of rock mass the diametrical dimension of the hole is implicitly modeled in its governing equation defined in eq 17 therefore the fe meshes can be discretized with ease and this process will not increase the computational complexity 3 3 modeling of phreatic surface and exit points for saturated or unconfined seepage analysis the phreatic surface especially the downstream exit points are of great interest partially because the exit height indicates the extent of the downstream face submerged by the seepage groundwater ren et al 2017b scudeler et al 2017 the phreatic surface being a special unknown boundary in the seepage regime involves strong geometrical nonlinearity and should be mathematically determined by certain iteration algorithms meanwhile when the unconfined seepage field manifests in a complex multi connected domain particularly with regard to the highly fractured system the nonlinearity attributable to the phreatic surface will be very intense leading to difficulties in the convergence of the iteration process wang et al 2014 chen 2019 to overcome this limitation the saturated and unsaturated flow in the entire domain is modeled in the present study and the phreatic surface is obtained as the narrow transition zone between saturated and unsaturated zones which makes the simulation more efficient moreover to find the exit points a boundary condition on the potential seepage surfaces are specified as a general mixed boundary condition thereby it is able to identify the transition between the dirichlet first type and the neumann second type boundary conditions following the work of chui and freyberg 2009 as 18 n ρ g μ κ s k r ϕ r b ϕ b ϕ where ϕ b represents the external hydraulic potential l and r b denotes the external resistance t 1 a detailed illustration of this boundary condition is presented in fig 4 the aforementioned mixed condition transforms to the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions when r b is infinite or very large and zero respectively by solving the richards equation the position of the exit points and the phreatic surface i e the narrow transition zone at p 0 are determined according to eq 18 above the phreatic surface in the unsaturated zone p 0 the resistance r b is assumed to be zero to create a no flux boundary condition below the phreatic surface p 0 a pervious layer filled with a virtual matter of much higher permeability is created and attached to the boundary thus r b is conveniently expressed in terms of the saturated permeability coefficient k s and a coupling length scale t b l as chui and freyberg 2009 19 r b k s t b the boundary condition given by eq 18 is then adjusted and the unsaturated seepage field is recalculated again the iterative process continues until the correct locations of the exit points and the phreatic surface have been determined note that a precise description of the seepage faces requires r b to be sufficiently large and t b to be close to zero given the convergence challenges for smaller value of t b the value of r b is determined using parametric sensitivity analysis to ensure reasonable accuracy 3 4 model parameters the reliability of the numerical simulation depends largely on the accuracy level of the model parameters parameters required for characterizing the unsaturated flow include the specific moisture capacity c m relative permeability k r specific storage s and hydraulic conductivity k s the hydraulic conductivity of a fracture is directly related to its aperture as expressed by eq 15 whereas that of the intact rock which is typically much denser is presumably several orders of magnitude lower than that of the fracture the specific storage s is commonly defined as the volume of water released from storage because of the compressibility of the porous media it is a constant in the saturated zone and zero in the unsaturated zone ren et al 2016b since no adequate measurements are available for the specific storage of the porous rock and fractures the reported data in literature kim and lee 2000 blessent et al 2011 can be referred note that other parameters are determined by the water retention relation and may differ in intact rocks and fractures however the water retention relation for the rock like material is still difficult to be exactly measured in laboratory as discussed in section 2 2 several well known constitutive relationships are commonly adopted for unsaturated flow modeling in porous media among which the van genuchten model is most widely utilized from the conceptual idea in continuum models the role of individual fractures in fractured media is similar to that of individual pores in porous media liu and bodvarsson 2001 therefore the van genuchten model is applied in the present study for modeling unsaturated flow in fractures as for the fitting parameters of the van genuchten model two combinations reported in literature or et al 2005 ye et al 2017 are listed in table 1 along with those values suggested in the present study fig 5 provides the comparison of different fitting parameters for the van genuchten model as can be seen the water saturation and relative permeability undergo a sudden variation near the axis origin of zero pressure the third combination of fitting parameters denotes a modified constitutive relationship with extremely narrow unsaturated zone for the reason that the unsaturated zone is of lesser interest in this work and moreover this relationship allows us to locate the phreatic surface more precisely since the permeability of the intact rock is much lower than that of fractures the unsaturated flow in the fractures usually plays a more significant role for simplification of the numerical modeling it is assumed that the van genuchten parameters for the rock matrix are the same with that of fractures i e the identical water retention relation is adopted for them 3 5 equation discretization the overall discretized equations for the fe solution of the unsaturated flow in fractured rock mass can be expressed by 20 k ϕ ϕ s ϕ ϕ t f ϕ where 21 k ϕ e k ϕ e s ϕ e s ϕ e f ϕ e f ϕ e with the element arrays specified by 22 k ϕ e ω n t k s e n d ω γ τ n f t d f k f s e τ n f d γ 23 s ϕ e ω n t c m s e s n d ω γ n f t d f c f s e s f n f d γ 24 f ϕ e γ n t q d γ in the discretization formulations ω represents the domain of the rock matrix γ represents the fracture domain n represents the shape function in ω and n f represents the shape function in γ for transient problems time integration uses the backward euler method in the calculation process this can be written as 25 ϕ t 1 δ t ϕ t δ t ϕ t where ϕ t and ϕ t δ t represent the hydraulic potentials in the calculated domain at time steps t and t δ t respectively by substituting eqs 21 25 into eq 20 the hydraulic potential distribution in fractured rock mass can be obtained by solving the system of nonlinear equations the numerical solution of this problem is achieved by 3d fem using the commercial software comsol multiphysics comsol 2014 4 model evaluation 4 1 comparison with explicitly modeling fracture aperture to test the proposed algorithm a 3d numerical example of modeling water penetration in rock mass containing one fracture is performed this example adopts a sample sized by 5 m 10 m 1 m with one horizontal planar fracture located in its center for ease of interpretation the central profile of the sample is presented in fig 6 to demonstrate the details of the numerical test the geometry and boundary conditions of the sample are given in fig 6 a with the thick central horizontal line representing the fracture hydraulic potentials at the upstream and downstream surfaces are 10 m and 2 m respectively at the downstream surface where y 2 m the mixed boundary condition is applied the other surfaces are specified as no flux boundaries for verifying the developed method described in this study two cases are examined by comparing the implicit modeling with explicit modeling of fracture aperture in case 1 the fracture is simulated by the zero thickness fracture element whose aperture is implicitly modeled in eq 11 in case 2 the fracture domain is meshed into solid elements with its aperture explicitly addressed and the water flow in the fracture is modeled using eq 1 this explicit computation is to provide a benchmark in the verification study fe meshes for the central profile of the two cases are shown in fig 6 b and c these contain 4070 elements 2120 nodes and 5319 elements 2777 nodes respectively note that sufficiently fine meshes are used throughout this study to ensure mesh independent solutions compared with the zero thickness element modeling method the explicit modeling approach could drastically increase the difficulty of mesh discretization because the fracture aperture is extremely small and relatively fine meshes are required in this sample the unsaturated flow is simulated to determine the location of phreatic surface moreover the effects exerted by the permeability of the rock matrix and fracture aperture on the phreatic surface in fractured porous media are also investigated parameters used in the example are as follows the intrinsic permeability of the rock matrix is taken as 5 10 15 m2 and the fracture aperture is successively set to 0 00001 m 0 0001 m and 0 001 m i e the permeability ratio between the fracture and matrix is 1 67 103 1 67 105 and 1 67 107 respectively fig 7 shows the hydraulic potential distribution in the central profile of the sample at a steady state for the two cases when the fracture aperture is 0 0001 m the predicted results of these two cases exhibit exactly the same patterns the distribution of the hydraulic potential in the sample varies significantly because of the irregular nature of the fractured system the effect of different fracture apertures on the location of the phreatic surface is depicted in fig 8 it is shown that the phreatic surface declines notably as the fracture aperture increases which means that the presence of a fracture can have a remarkable effect on the phreatic surface in a fractured system similar to the drainage principle of the horizontal drainage blanket installed over that portion of the downstream foundation of embankment dams chen 2015 figs 7 and 8 indicate that the calculation results from explicit and implicit modeling of the fracture aperture are perfectly close this demonstrates that the proposed method is a feasible and reliable means of describing the water flow in unconfined fractured porous media 4 2 comparison with experimental test to validate the present numerical method for simulating fluid flow through fractured porous medium a comparison is made with an experimental test conducted by grenoble 1989 in the test a sheet of plexiglas in size of 60 96 cm 45 72 cm 2 54 cm was sawed to form a discrete fracture network with fractures of 12 7 mm in depth and 0 508 mm in width a schematic layout of the fracture pattern is shown in fig 9 while being subjected to the constant hydraulic head difference ranging from 0 762 cm to 172 84 cm the water pressure distribution was measured at 24 fracture intersection ports in this study a numerical test is conducted to model the laboratory experiment using the proposed algorithm hydraulic potentials of 80 52 cm and 71 76 cm are applied to the right and left surfaces respectively since the other side surfaces of the model are generally considered to be sealed an impervious condition is employed in the numerical model the permeability of the fractures is determined by the cubic law while the permeability of plexiglas is much lower therefore it may be assumed that the plexiglas is basically impermeable with permeability coefficient 10 7 lower than that of fractures in this study namely k m k f 10 7 based on the fe simulation the seepage field in the fractured rock mass is calculated fig 10 shows the seepage field in the numerical model it is observed that the simulated hydraulic potential distribution is highly heterogeneous due to the presence of an irregular network of fractures a comparison of the numerical and experimental results is listed in table 2 where δ represents the relative error defined as δ ϕ fem ϕ exp ϕ exp ϕ fem and ϕ exp are the simulated and measured hydraulic potentials respectively it can be found that the simulated results agree well with the experimental data with relative errors not exceeding 1 056 which is consistent with the simulated results by discontinuous deformation analysis dda presented in literature kim et al 1999 as 1 123 meanwhile it is far smaller than the extreme value of the relative error i e 0 8052 0 7176 0 7176 100 12 207 this indicates that the proposed approach is suitable for simulating the fluid flow within rock mass containing a discrete fracture network 4 3 fluid flow in rock mass containing a drainage hole in order to evaluate the proposed method for modeling the drainage holes in rock mass an example of phreatic surface intersected by one drainage hole is presented a homogeneous numerical sample in dimensions of 10 m 10 m 20 m is prepared with a drainage hole of diameter 0 1 m located in its center the permeability coefficient of the sample is assumed as 10 6 m s and a hydraulic potential of 20 m is applied to the surface boundaries at x 5 m the impervious condition is employed to the other side surfaces of the numerical model the results given by the proposed approach using line elements to implicitly model the hole diameter are compared with those obtained by explicitly modeling the hole diameter and using the superposed element method wang et al 2011 in explicitly modeling approach the drainage hole wall is taken as potential seepage surface fig 11 demonstrates the geometry of the model and fe meshes where the number of elements and nodes are 29 480 32 634 and 8000 9261 for fig 11 b and c respectively the hydraulic potential distribution in the central profile of the sample y 0 by three different means i e superposed element method explicit modeling method and implicit modeling method is shown in fig 12 a c respectively it could be found that the numerically predicted results from implicit modeling method using line elements are in good agreement with those from the other two approaches both for the location of the phreatic surface and the distribution of the hydraulic potential it is shown that the phreatic surface in the block arcs down to the drainage hole which means that this drainage facility plays an important role in the control of hazardous seepage flow generally the proposed method is capable of describing the process of the water intrusion into drainage hole and might be useful in assessing the effect of the drainage curtain in seepage control system 5 case study the presence of highly permeable fractures can provide preferential transport pathways to underground water in the rock mass resulting in changes to the overall mechanical and hydraulic properties therefore the prediction of unsaturated flow in fractured rock mass is of important significance in many research fields such as the rock slope stability analysis seepage control of dam foundations and contaminant transport in unconfined aquifers etc in this section a case study analyzing unsaturated flow through a fractured rock slope is presented the geometry of the fractured rock slope is illustrated in fig 13 to gain a fundamental understanding of the effects of fractures and drainage holes different modeling details are employed in this case study see fig 14 fig 14 a shows a model with two sets of orthogonal fractures at dip angles i e the angle between the fracture plane and horizontal direction of 45 and 135 respectively the trace lengths of the two sets of fractures are 4 0 m with a standard deviation of 1 0 m fig 14 b shows a model with randomly distributed fractures in which the fracture density is nearly the same with that shown in fig 14 a the trace lengths of the fractures are again 4 0 m with a standard deviation of 1 0 m fig 14 c displays a model with three horizontal drainage holes the drainage holes have a radius of 0 075 m and a spacing of 2 0 m using the proposed modeling scheme unsaturated flow is simulated in the fractured rock slope under three circumstances a different fracture patterns b sudden drop in downstream water level c with and without drainage holes 5 1 different fracture patterns steady unsaturated flow in a fractured rock slope is simulated by two different models i e with two sets of orthogonal fractures and with randomly distributed fractures the upstream water level at the left of this slope is 15 m the downstream water level at the right side is 6 m the boundary at the right side above the downstream water level is assigned with the mixed boundary condition and the other boundaries are assumed to be impervious the intrinsic permeability of the rock matrix is assumed to be 5 10 15 m2 for this case study fig 15 depicts the hydraulic potential distribution and the phreatic surface obtained from the two models with a uniform aperture of 0 1 mm the hydraulic potential decreases from the upstream to the downstream in both models however the fractures in the rock slope cause a remarkable degree of disorder in the distribution of the hydraulic potential as well as in the shape and position of the phreatic surface the modeling results differ substantially for different fracture patterns i e orthogonally distributed and randomly distributed the presence of highly permeable fractures leads to the strong heterogeneity of the seepage field in rock mass complicating the determination of the phreatic surface the effect of the different hydraulic apertures on the phreatic surface is also investigated the phreatic surface in the fractured rock slope with orthogonally distributed fractures is obtained using the fracture apertures of 0 05 mm 0 1 mm 0 2 mm and 0 5 mm as illustrated in fig 16 though the position of the phreatic surface may have changed slightly its shape is obviously altered by different hydraulic apertures particularly in the region of the fractures when the fracture aperture is larger its effect could be more pronounced since the difference in permeability between the fracture and the rock matrix is greater it is expected that the basic information of fracture patterns e g distribution density length aperture and roughness is necessarily demanded for the simulation of the unsaturated flow and the determination of the phreatic surface in a fractured rock slope such basic information should be obtained directly by in situ testing to provide reliable model parameters 5 2 sudden drop in downstream water level transient unsaturated flow in the fractured rock slope is simulated using the model with orthogonally distributed fractures the water level is initially at the top of the slope and the flow system is the static equilibrium condition the upstream water level is maintained at a constant value of 15 m while the downstream water level drops instantaneously at t 0 d from 15 m to 6 m and is maintained there subsequently the permeability of the rock matrix is assumed to be 5 10 15 m2 the mechanical aperture for the fractures is 0 1 mm and the specific storage for both rock matrix and fractures is taken as 1 0 10 6 m 1 for simplification unsaturated flow trough the rock slope is then numerically modeled and the performed transient analysis spreads over a total period of 50 d with each time step of 1 d time integration in comsol for this transient analysis utilizes the backward euler method which is an implicit scheme the changes of hydraulic potential at four points in fractures are illustrated in fig 17 and the evolution of locations of the phreatic surface over time is shown in fig 18 because of the instantaneous drop of the external water level at the right boundary a rapid drop in pressure occurs within the rock slope and then the pressure distribution becomes stable gradually against time due to the specific storage effects it can be found that the phreatic surface declines with the fall of the downstream water level and the trend is similar to that obtained from the simulation performed by jiang et al 2014 which indicates that the results obtained from the proposed approach are reasonable additionally it is also observed that the presence of fractures can make the phreatic surface quite rough and irregular during the drop in the downstream water level 5 3 with and without drainage holes the effect of drainage holes on the phreatic surface of the fractured rock slope is investigated utilizing the model containing orthogonally distributed fractures shown in fig 14 a and that also containing drainage holes shown in fig 14 c the steady unsaturated flow is simulated for the scenarios without and with drainage holes respectively the mechanical aperture of the fractures is 0 015 mm and the same boundary conditions as discussed in section 5 1 are employed for this simulation the drainage holes are efficiently modeled by line elements the phreatic surfaces in the fractured rock mass with and without drainage holes are compared in fig 19 it is found that the initial phreatic surface without the drainage holes is relatively higher while the presence of drainage holes could significantly lower the phreatic surface the drainage holes play an important role in controlling the seepage flow in the fractured rock slope whose effects of drainage and depressurization can be accurately reproduced by the proposed approach the simulated results may provide useful knowledge for the design and optimization of efficient drainage facilities for lowering the underground water level in fractured rock slope engineering 6 conclusions modeling unsaturated flow in the fractured rock system with densely distributed fractures and narrowly spaced drainage holes is still challenging particularly with regard to determining the phreatic surface in this paper an efficient numerical procedure is proposed for unsaturated seepage analysis in highly fractured rock system consisting of rock matrix blocks discrete fracture networks and drainage holes 3d fem is adopted to solve the richards equation for unsaturated flow the proposed method is validated by comparison with several numerical and experimental results and further applicated to simulate the unsaturated seepage field in fractured rock slope the aim of this research is to gain a better understanding of the effects of fracture patterns including the fracture distribution and fracture aperture and drainage holes based on these investigations the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed method shows to be efficient in modeling the fractured rock system with densely distributed fractures and narrowly spaced drainage holes with fractures modeled by embedded zero thickness elements and drainage holes interpreted as line elements the computational cost for fem analysis can be reduced the proposed method may be further developed to model coupled hydraulic and mechanical processes in fractured rock mass 2 the results of the proposed method show reasonable accordance with the experimental data and numerical solutions reported in literature by applying the mixed boundary condition to the potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone for unsaturated flow the phreatic surface and exit points of seepage through fractured rock masses could be determined properly 3 the proposed method is applied to predict the unsaturated flow behavior through a fractured rock slope the effects of fracture patterns strongly disordering the seepage field and drainage holes appreciably lowering the phreatic surface can be well captured by the simulation the simulated results presented in this study may provide useful knowledge for performance assessments of fractures and design optimization of drainage holes for the complex fracture systems involved in rock engineering applications however the simulation of unsaturated flow in this study is carried out based on parameters and constitutive relations with simplifications and assumptions due to the lack of exact experimental measurements these may affect the prediction accuracy level of the proposed method moreover the quantification of geometric patterns of natural fractures e g distribution density length aperture and roughness is also necessarily demanded for the simulation of the unsaturated flow and the determination of the phreatic surface in fractured rock engineering such basic information constitutive relations material properties and geometric patterns etc of rock mass should be obtained directly by in situ testing or laboratory experiments to provide reliable modeling parameters in future work declaration of interests none acknowledgments this work was supported by

6416,it is computationally difficult to model unsaturated flow through a highly fractured rock system that contains porous rock matrix densely distributed fracture networks and narrowly spaced drainage holes we present an efficient numerical procedure that uses a three dimensional finite element model to solve richards equation with embedded zero thickness elements for fractures and line elements for drainage holes a mixed boundary condition is applied at potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone is specified to precisely locate the phreatic surface the procedure compares favorably with results from other numerical solutions and experimental data a case study is developed to evaluate seepage through a densely fractured rock slope the simulated results demonstrate that fractures disorder the hydraulic potential distribution with fracture patterns acting as significant influential factors and drainage holes dramatically lower the phreatic surface due to the effects of drainage and depressurization the proposed numerical procedure shows to be capable of investigating the unsaturated flow in highly fractured rock mass keywords unsaturated flow rock mass fracture network drainage hole numerical analysis 1 introduction fractured rock mass is a typical kind of complicated geological medium that comprises structural bodies surrounded by significant structural features such as flaws faults joints bedding planes fissures and fractures which are commonly termed as geological discontinuities chen 2019 these discontinuities with various attitudes and different scales play a dominant role in determining the physical and mechanical properties of rock mass e g density thermal conductivity permeability deformability and strength jaeger et al 2007 sahimi 2011 for most geotechnical engineering problems such as fractured petroleum reservoirs geothermal energy extraction nuclear waste disposal carbon dioxide geologic storage slope stability and seepage control for hydraulic structures e g dam foundations the mechanical and hydraulic behaviors of rock mass are closely related to the fractures and the subsurface flow in them both saturated and unsaturated ye et al 2017 prediction of water flow in fractured rock mass is a matter of continuing and significant interest for engineering practice however it has always been challenging due to the highly heterogeneous discontinuities within the rock mass especially for the unsaturated case which brings about additional strong nonlinearity to the analysis this leads to extensive research on the development of suitable and efficient numerical approaches for fractured rock mass generally numerical models used for simulating water transport through fractured rock mass can be divided into two categories the continuum equivalent porous medium epm models and the discrete fracture network dfn ones in the epm models fractured rock mass is generalized as an equivalent porous medium with isotropic and homogeneous properties and it is usually assumed that the seepage flow of underground water through the rock mass obeys darcy s law which could reflect the comprehensive effects of fractures and rocks snow 1969 neuman 1973 in the past few decades significant progress has been made toward developing the numerical solutions to unconfined seepage problems based on the epm models oda 1986 jackson et al 2000 pan et al 2010 though the epm models are simple to implement and require low computational resources they are not suitable for the cases where the influence of the individual fractures cannot be ignored for example the small scale studies from previous investigations pyrak nolte et al 1988 zimmerman et al 1992 the permeability of intact rock block is usually recognized to be extremely low and generally several orders of magnitude smaller than that of fractures the presence of fractures can enhance the permeability of rock mass and provides preferential and fast flow pathways when connective fracture networks are formed ren et al 2017a in the dfn models the geological geometry and hydraulic properties of individual fractures can be explicitly considered in the simulation i e both the fluid flow in the fractures and that in the surrounding rock matrix blocks are simulated cacas et al 1990 benedetto et al 2014 for such models the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the groundwater flux can be described more accurately and conveniently with cubic law describing the fluid flow through the fractures whereas darcy s law for modeling the porous flow in intact rock the effects of fractures particularly from distinct fracture patterns e g fracture density length width and distribution are explicitly interpreted increasing attractions have been drawn to model the subsurface flow in fractured rock mass using dfn models see literature rasmussen 1991 jiang et al 2014 zhang 2015 xing et al 2017 xu et al 2018 with both rocks and individual fractures modeled and the flux exchange between them taken into account the dfn models are more difficult to implement owing to the mesh discretization and the poor convergence of the numerical integration particularly for the cases considering dense fracture networks furthermore the unsaturated or unconfined seepage problems involving a phreatic surface through the fractured rock mass could make the simulation using dfn models more complicated the variably saturated flow and infiltration outflow boundaries in the fractures or fracture networks may be highly nonlinear recently significant efforts have been made to develop numerical solutions for the unsaturated water flow in fractured rock mass evans et al 2001 or et al 2005 for instance ye et al 2017 employed a discrete fracture modeling method and developed a systematic finite element algorithm to analyze water movement in unsaturated fractured rocks with the van genuchten model for describing the constitutive relationships of unsaturated flow ren et al 2016a proposed an efficient unconfined seepage analysis method for analyzing fluid flow in fractured rock mass by modeling both the porous rock matrix and the discrete fractures as permeable pipe networks a finite volume based approach was applied to solve the equations for unconfined seepage flow the method has been validated by finding the phreatic surface in dam structures fang and zhu 2018 developed a new approach to simulate groundwater flow through both an overlying unconfined aquifer and an underlying discrete fracture network the groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network is explicitly simulated with laminar and turbulent flows zhang et al 2017 proposed a novel numerical method by coupling the radial point interpolation method rpim and finite element method fem with rpim utilized to model the rock matrix and fem for the fractures the mesh discretization was simplified and the two dimensional 2d free surface seepage analysis in fractured rock mass was conducted however the large amount of computational cost in numerical models still restricts their feasibility and applicability for engineering practice particularly for the three dimensional 3d cases the scale of many engineering problems outstrips that of thin fractures or joints and tiny drainage holes or injection production wells seepage analysis for rock mass containing both fractures and drainage holes is also essential for the design of seepage control measures the presence of dense discontinuities and drainage holes in rock mass results in a complex fractured rock system and current modeling techniques are insufficient for such scenarios therefore it is important to develop a more efficient numerical approach for unsaturated or unconfined seepage analysis in the complex fractured rock system which is also the main objective of the present study in this paper an efficient modeling procedure is proposed for unsaturated seepage analysis in highly fractured rock mass an improved dfn model is developed for a complex system composed of rock matrix blocks discrete fracture networks and drainage holes based on the unsaturated flow theory a 3d fem is adopted to solve the unsaturated seepage problems with fractures modeled by embedded zero thickness elements and drainage holes interpreted as line elements the mesh discretization is considerably simplified and the computational cost is efficiently reduced in order to precisely determine the location of phreatic surface and the downstream exit points a mixed boundary condition is applied for the potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone is utilized for locating the phreatic surface the proposed modeling procedure is tested and evaluated by comparison with other numerical solutions and experimental data finally a case study with respect to the seepage field in fractured rock slope is presented for better understanding the effects of fractures and drainage holes 2 basic theory for unsaturated flow 2 1 governing equation naturally fractured rock mass is traditionally conceptualized as a dual porosity and dual permeability medium containing fractures or fracture networks with high permeability and rock matrix with relatively lower permeability with regard to fluid flow in the fractured rock mass the mixed case involving saturated flow and capillary flow can be easily envisaged i e the saturated and unsaturated flow a typical example demonstrating the unsaturated flow of water through a rock slope under the hydraulic potential including capillary suction hydraulic pressure and gravity force is shown in fig 1 the entire domain of the fractured system for both fractures and rock matrix is categorized into three parts i e the saturated zone referring to the lowermost zone with the pores or fractures fully filled with water the dry zone to the uppermost zone with the pores or fractures completely dry and the unsaturated zone in between particularly for fractures the saturated zone provides preferential flow paths along fracture walls with direct connectivity to porous matrix and the dry zone restricts in both tangential and normal directions the three zones are separated by the phreatic surface or water table and the wetting front respectively in this case it is therefore desirable to have a unified description of saturated and unsaturated flow unsaturated flow theory is generally utilized to describe water penetration into partially saturated fractured rock mass based on the assumption of neglecting the gas phase transport water movement in porous media e g soil concrete and rock mass is governed by richards equation sahimi 2011 shoushtari et al 2015 kong et al 2015 ren et al 2016b li et al 2017a 1 c m s e s ϕ t ρ g μ κ s k r ϕ q m in which c m is the specific moisture capacity l 1 s is the specific storage l 1 s e is the effective saturation μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid m l 1 t 1 q m is the fluid source t 1 is the spatial gradient operator l 1 κ s is the intrinsic permeability l2 and k r is the relative permeability in eq 1 ϕ is the hydraulic potential l which is the dependent variable denoted as 2 ϕ ϕ p z p ρ g z where p is the hydraulic pressure m l 1 t 2 ρ is the fluid density m l 3 g is the gravitational acceleration l t 2 ϕ p is the pressure potential l and z is the gravitational potential l the effective saturation s e is also termed as the reduced water content usually defined as 3 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θ represents the volumetric water content i e the ratio of the water volume to the sample bulk volume θ r and θ s are denoted as the residual and saturated volumetric water contents respectively thus s e reflects the degree of saturation which equals 0 initially and 1 at saturation the intrinsic permeability κ s is commonly related to the hydraulic conductivity as 4 k s ρ g μ κ s where k s denotes the saturated permeability coefficient or hydraulic conductivity l t 1 with which the unsaturated permeability coefficient of the medium can be expressed as k s e k s k r eq 1 is subject to

cosines of the external normal to the boundary ϕ 1 is the specified hydraulic potential at the first type boundary γ 1 and q is the flow rate through the second type boundary γ 2 2 2 water retention relation seeking a solution for the unsaturated flow problem requires prior knowledge of the specific moisture capacity c m and the relative permeability k r both of which are dependent on the water retention properties of the medium numerous approaches toward mathematical representation i e fitting or prediction of the soil water characteristic curve have been proposed lu and likos 2004 xin et al 2016 ye et al 2018 the brooks and corey model the van genuchten model and the fredlund and xing model are commonly adopted for geotechnical engineering applications lu and likos 2004 for example the van genuchten model is usually written as van genuchten 1980 8 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ϕ p n m ϕ p 0 θ s ϕ p 0 9 k r s e l 1 1 s e 1 m 2 ϕ p 0 1 ϕ p 0 in which α n l 0 5 and m 1 1 n are empirical fitting parameters obtained from experimental data and ϕ p 0 is the atmospheric pressure that distinguishes the saturated and unsaturated zone another key parameter namely the specific moisture capacity is defined as shoushtari et al 2015 10 c m d θ d ϕ p ϕ p 0 0 ϕ p 0 once these water retention properties have been determined the richards equation can be solved to account for the saturated and unsaturated flow 3 methodology in this study a dfn based numerical procedure is developed for modeling the hydraulic behavior of unsaturated fractured rock mass it is assumed that the complex dfn system is composed of rock matrix discrete fracture networks and drainage holes with the geometry and position of each individual fractures specified as well as the drainage holes based on the richards equation the unsaturated flow in such a dfn system is numerically modeled by 3d fem regarding the grid discretization for fe analysis the rock matrix domain is discretized into 3d solid elements fractures are modeled with embedded zero thickness elements and drainage holes are interpreted as line elements in order to precisely determine the location of seepage line i e phreatic surface and downstream exit points a mixed boundary condition is applied to the potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone is utilized a detailed description of this numerical procedure is outlined below 3 1 modeling of fluid flow in rock matrix and fractures in the dfn based model the rock matrix is postulated as an isotropic porous medium and thus the unsaturated flow in this phase is governed by eq 1 while that of the fracture is quite different the unsaturated flow in a fracture is strongly affected by many factors not only the fracture aperture and orientation but also the fracture roughness and the connectivity of multi fractures the geometrical aperture of a fracture is rather small but has a significant influence on the permeability so it should be gauged as precisely as possible in spite of the inherent difficulties chen 2019 the extremely small fracture aperture and the actual complex fracture network could bring about high complexity in dfn modeling special element types are usually adopted in fem to describe the transport behavior along the fracture network for example the extended finite element berrone et al 2013 the composite element chen et al 2010 the embedded element qian and xu 2017 and the zero thickness element li et al 2017b in this study the zero thickness element is further extended to model the unsaturated flow in highly dense fractures embedded in rock matrix as shown in fig 2 the zero thickness element has been successfully employed to simulate the unsaturated water penetration and capillary absorption in interfacial transition zone itz and microcracks within concrete as reported in the authors previous work li et al 2017a b for simplicity the surface roughness effects of the fracture are not considered in the present work the fracture is considered as a pair of open smooth and parallel plates with a uniform aperture or width referred to the mechanical aperture with regard to the unsaturated flow in fractures one of the common approaches for numerical modeling is to assume an analogy to flow in porous media in this study the fractured domain is idealized as a porous medium with porosity of 1 0 so the richards equation could be adopted again similar to the works of ye et al 2017 li et al 2017a and lu et al 2018 to properly incorporate the effect of highly permeable fracture network the governing equation for unsaturated flow along the fractures is given as 11 d f c m s e s f ϕ f t τ d f ρ g μ κ f k r τ ϕ f f where d f represents the mechanical aperture l of a fracture and k f is its saturated permeability coefficient l t 1 denoted as k f κ f k r with κ f representing the intrinsic permeability of fracture l2 ϕ f is the hydraulic potential l in the fracture and ϕ f p is the pressure potential l denoted as ϕ f p ϕ f z f is the flow rate l t 1 penetrating into fracture in the normal direction from rock matrix i e the flux exchange between the fracture and the rock matrix which is expressed as 12 f up k m d ϕ up d n up f down k m d ϕ down d n down in which k m is the permeability of the rock matrix n is the unit vector normal to the fracture plane and the subscripts up and down respectively mean the up and down surfaces note that water exchange occurs on both sides of the fracture therefore f equals the sum of f up and f down the term d ϕ d n means the gradient of hydraulic potential between the fracture and the matrix material which can be written as 13 d ϕ d n ϕ f ϕ 1 2 d f as the opening of a fracture is far smaller than the normal size of the fractured rock mass it can be assumed that the hydraulic potentials at two sides of the fracture plane are identical i e 14 ϕ up ϕ down ϕ f the permeability of individual fractures is a dominant factor to the bulk hydraulic performance of the rock mass according to the basic theory of fluid mechanics the physical mathematical description of laminar flow through a single fracture is described by the cubic law which is developed from the parallel plate concept li et al 2017b chen 2019 by combining this equation with darcy s law the water permeability coefficient or hydraulic conductivity of a fracture is given as 15 k f ρ g μ κ f ρ g w f 2 12 μ in eq 15 w f is the hydraulic aperture of the fracture different from the mechanical fracture that representing the separation distance between the two walls the hydraulic aperture is in a way a virtual aperture which is just defined according to the cubic law using equivalent flow rate method rasmussen 1995 zou et al 2013 since the fractures are conceptualized as smooth parallel plates in this work it could be assumed that its hydraulic aperture is equal to the mechanical aperture i e w f d f with the aforementioned formulations the fracture is idealized as a thin conductive porous layer with larger water permeability in rock mass the fracture aperture is implicitly modeled in its permeation equation in eq 11 so the mesh discretization could be accomplished with ease the zero thickness fracture element can not only model the hydraulic response in the fracture but also reduce the number of freedom degrees without generating new solid elements and consequently bring down the computational cost 3 2 modeling of fluid flow in drainage holes to improve the stability of fractured rock mass drainage facilities containing a large number of drainage holes with small diameter e g 3 10 cm are usually deployed within a small width and large stretch zone e g distance of 1 5 3 m between the holes in the explicit modeling approaches the wall of the drainage holes is commonly taken as boundary with possible drainage conditions this may result in a tremendous amount of time consuming pre processing work to discretize the calculation domain furthermore when the free surface is intersected by the drainage holes the iteration procedure will become fairly complicated chen et al 2010 chen 2015 to address these considerations line elements with much higher permeability are employed to simulate drainage hole while preventing the computational mesh from becoming strongly dependent on how the drainage holes are deployed in this work it is assumed that the drainage hole is filled with a virtual filler material with much larger permeability coefficient similar to the conceptualized air element hu and chen 2003 chen et al 2010 therefore the drainage hole can be included in the variational equation of fem and no boundary condition should be imposed on the wall of the hole the permeability of drainage hole serves as a virtual index for indicating the effect of drainage and it should be sufficiently large to drain water that penetrates into the hole as stated in literature hu and chen 2003 chen et al 2010 the appropriate permeability for the imagined material within the drainage hole ranges between 103 and 104 larger than that of the surrounding rock when guaranteeing the solution precision for the line elements representing a drainage hole see fig 3 of radius r and permeability k h the flux exchange between the drainage hole and rock matrix is given by 16 q m k m d ϕ dr 2 π r q h k h ϕ ϕ h r 2 π r 17 f h q h π r 2 where ϕ h is the hydraulic potential in the drainage hole and ϕ is the hydraulic potential nearby the surrounding rock matrix at the interface q m is the flux l2 t 1 drained from the surrounding rock matrix and q h is the flux l2 t 1 penetrating into the drainage hole from the point view of the mass conservation principle q m q h f h serves as a source sink term t 1 for line elements which can be directly incorporated into the fem simulation when the phreatic surface is intersected by the drainage hole the value of ϕ h is equal to the gravitational potential z with respect to the flux penetrating into the line elements it is given by eq 17 for the saturated zone ϕ h z and turns out to be zero for the unsaturated and dry zones ϕ h z using this method the drainage holes are modeled as conductive pipes in the entire domain of rock mass the diametrical dimension of the hole is implicitly modeled in its governing equation defined in eq 17 therefore the fe meshes can be discretized with ease and this process will not increase the computational complexity 3 3 modeling of phreatic surface and exit points for saturated or unconfined seepage analysis the phreatic surface especially the downstream exit points are of great interest partially because the exit height indicates the extent of the downstream face submerged by the seepage groundwater ren et al 2017b scudeler et al 2017 the phreatic surface being a special unknown boundary in the seepage regime involves strong geometrical nonlinearity and should be mathematically determined by certain iteration algorithms meanwhile when the unconfined seepage field manifests in a complex multi connected domain particularly with regard to the highly fractured system the nonlinearity attributable to the phreatic surface will be very intense leading to difficulties in the convergence of the iteration process wang et al 2014 chen 2019 to overcome this limitation the saturated and unsaturated flow in the entire domain is modeled in the present study and the phreatic surface is obtained as the narrow transition zone between saturated and unsaturated zones which makes the simulation more efficient moreover to find the exit points a boundary condition on the potential seepage surfaces are specified as a general mixed boundary condition thereby it is able to identify the transition between the dirichlet first type and the neumann second type boundary conditions following the work of chui and freyberg 2009 as 18 n ρ g μ κ s k r ϕ r b ϕ b ϕ where ϕ b represents the external hydraulic potential l and r b denotes the external resistance t 1 a detailed illustration of this boundary condition is presented in fig 4 the aforementioned mixed condition transforms to the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions when r b is infinite or very large and zero respectively by solving the richards equation the position of the exit points and the phreatic surface i e the narrow transition zone at p 0 are determined according to eq 18 above the phreatic surface in the unsaturated zone p 0 the resistance r b is assumed to be zero to create a no flux boundary condition below the phreatic surface p 0 a pervious layer filled with a virtual matter of much higher permeability is created and attached to the boundary thus r b is conveniently expressed in terms of the saturated permeability coefficient k s and a coupling length scale t b l as chui and freyberg 2009 19 r b k s t b the boundary condition given by eq 18 is then adjusted and the unsaturated seepage field is recalculated again the iterative process continues until the correct locations of the exit points and the phreatic surface have been determined note that a precise description of the seepage faces requires r b to be sufficiently large and t b to be close to zero given the convergence challenges for smaller value of t b the value of r b is determined using parametric sensitivity analysis to ensure reasonable accuracy 3 4 model parameters the reliability of the numerical simulation depends largely on the accuracy level of the model parameters parameters required for characterizing the unsaturated flow include the specific moisture capacity c m relative permeability k r specific storage s and hydraulic conductivity k s the hydraulic conductivity of a fracture is directly related to its aperture as expressed by eq 15 whereas that of the intact rock which is typically much denser is presumably several orders of magnitude lower than that of the fracture the specific storage s is commonly defined as the volume of water released from storage because of the compressibility of the porous media it is a constant in the saturated zone and zero in the unsaturated zone ren et al 2016b since no adequate measurements are available for the specific storage of the porous rock and fractures the reported data in literature kim and lee 2000 blessent et al 2011 can be referred note that other parameters are determined by the water retention relation and may differ in intact rocks and fractures however the water retention relation for the rock like material is still difficult to be exactly measured in laboratory as discussed in section 2 2 several well known constitutive relationships are commonly adopted for unsaturated flow modeling in porous media among which the van genuchten model is most widely utilized from the conceptual idea in continuum models the role of individual fractures in fractured media is similar to that of individual pores in porous media liu and bodvarsson 2001 therefore the van genuchten model is applied in the present study for modeling unsaturated flow in fractures as for the fitting parameters of the van genuchten model two combinations reported in literature or et al 2005 ye et al 2017 are listed in table 1 along with those values suggested in the present study fig 5 provides the comparison of different fitting parameters for the van genuchten model as can be seen the water saturation and relative permeability undergo a sudden variation near the axis origin of zero pressure the third combination of fitting parameters denotes a modified constitutive relationship with extremely narrow unsaturated zone for the reason that the unsaturated zone is of lesser interest in this work and moreover this relationship allows us to locate the phreatic surface more precisely since the permeability of the intact rock is much lower than that of fractures the unsaturated flow in the fractures usually plays a more significant role for simplification of the numerical modeling it is assumed that the van genuchten parameters for the rock matrix are the same with that of fractures i e the identical water retention relation is adopted for them 3 5 equation discretization the overall discretized equations for the fe solution of the unsaturated flow in fractured rock mass can be expressed by 20 k ϕ ϕ s ϕ ϕ t f ϕ where 21 k ϕ e k ϕ e s ϕ e s ϕ e f ϕ e f ϕ e with the element arrays specified by 22 k ϕ e ω n t k s e n d ω γ τ n f t d f k f s e τ n f d γ 23 s ϕ e ω n t c m s e s n d ω γ n f t d f c f s e s f n f d γ 24 f ϕ e γ n t q d γ in the discretization formulations ω represents the domain of the rock matrix γ represents the fracture domain n represents the shape function in ω and n f represents the shape function in γ for transient problems time integration uses the backward euler method in the calculation process this can be written as 25 ϕ t 1 δ t ϕ t δ t ϕ t where ϕ t and ϕ t δ t represent the hydraulic potentials in the calculated domain at time steps t and t δ t respectively by substituting eqs 21 25 into eq 20 the hydraulic potential distribution in fractured rock mass can be obtained by solving the system of nonlinear equations the numerical solution of this problem is achieved by 3d fem using the commercial software comsol multiphysics comsol 2014 4 model evaluation 4 1 comparison with explicitly modeling fracture aperture to test the proposed algorithm a 3d numerical example of modeling water penetration in rock mass containing one fracture is performed this example adopts a sample sized by 5 m 10 m 1 m with one horizontal planar fracture located in its center for ease of interpretation the central profile of the sample is presented in fig 6 to demonstrate the details of the numerical test the geometry and boundary conditions of the sample are given in fig 6 a with the thick central horizontal line representing the fracture hydraulic potentials at the upstream and downstream surfaces are 10 m and 2 m respectively at the downstream surface where y 2 m the mixed boundary condition is applied the other surfaces are specified as no flux boundaries for verifying the developed method described in this study two cases are examined by comparing the implicit modeling with explicit modeling of fracture aperture in case 1 the fracture is simulated by the zero thickness fracture element whose aperture is implicitly modeled in eq 11 in case 2 the fracture domain is meshed into solid elements with its aperture explicitly addressed and the water flow in the fracture is modeled using eq 1 this explicit computation is to provide a benchmark in the verification study fe meshes for the central profile of the two cases are shown in fig 6 b and c these contain 4070 elements 2120 nodes and 5319 elements 2777 nodes respectively note that sufficiently fine meshes are used throughout this study to ensure mesh independent solutions compared with the zero thickness element modeling method the explicit modeling approach could drastically increase the difficulty of mesh discretization because the fracture aperture is extremely small and relatively fine meshes are required in this sample the unsaturated flow is simulated to determine the location of phreatic surface moreover the effects exerted by the permeability of the rock matrix and fracture aperture on the phreatic surface in fractured porous media are also investigated parameters used in the example are as follows the intrinsic permeability of the rock matrix is taken as 5 10 15 m2 and the fracture aperture is successively set to 0 00001 m 0 0001 m and 0 001 m i e the permeability ratio between the fracture and matrix is 1 67 103 1 67 105 and 1 67 107 respectively fig 7 shows the hydraulic potential distribution in the central profile of the sample at a steady state for the two cases when the fracture aperture is 0 0001 m the predicted results of these two cases exhibit exactly the same patterns the distribution of the hydraulic potential in the sample varies significantly because of the irregular nature of the fractured system the effect of different fracture apertures on the location of the phreatic surface is depicted in fig 8 it is shown that the phreatic surface declines notably as the fracture aperture increases which means that the presence of a fracture can have a remarkable effect on the phreatic surface in a fractured system similar to the drainage principle of the horizontal drainage blanket installed over that portion of the downstream foundation of embankment dams chen 2015 figs 7 and 8 indicate that the calculation results from explicit and implicit modeling of the fracture aperture are perfectly close this demonstrates that the proposed method is a feasible and reliable means of describing the water flow in unconfined fractured porous media 4 2 comparison with experimental test to validate the present numerical method for simulating fluid flow through fractured porous medium a comparison is made with an experimental test conducted by grenoble 1989 in the test a sheet of plexiglas in size of 60 96 cm 45 72 cm 2 54 cm was sawed to form a discrete fracture network with fractures of 12 7 mm in depth and 0 508 mm in width a schematic layout of the fracture pattern is shown in fig 9 while being subjected to the constant hydraulic head difference ranging from 0 762 cm to 172 84 cm the water pressure distribution was measured at 24 fracture intersection ports in this study a numerical test is conducted to model the laboratory experiment using the proposed algorithm hydraulic potentials of 80 52 cm and 71 76 cm are applied to the right and left surfaces respectively since the other side surfaces of the model are generally considered to be sealed an impervious condition is employed in the numerical model the permeability of the fractures is determined by the cubic law while the permeability of plexiglas is much lower therefore it may be assumed that the plexiglas is basically impermeable with permeability coefficient 10 7 lower than that of fractures in this study namely k m k f 10 7 based on the fe simulation the seepage field in the fractured rock mass is calculated fig 10 shows the seepage field in the numerical model it is observed that the simulated hydraulic potential distribution is highly heterogeneous due to the presence of an irregular network of fractures a comparison of the numerical and experimental results is listed in table 2 where δ represents the relative error defined as δ ϕ fem ϕ exp ϕ exp ϕ fem and ϕ exp are the simulated and measured hydraulic potentials respectively it can be found that the simulated results agree well with the experimental data with relative errors not exceeding 1 056 which is consistent with the simulated results by discontinuous deformation analysis dda presented in literature kim et al 1999 as 1 123 meanwhile it is far smaller than the extreme value of the relative error i e 0 8052 0 7176 0 7176 100 12 207 this indicates that the proposed approach is suitable for simulating the fluid flow within rock mass containing a discrete fracture network 4 3 fluid flow in rock mass containing a drainage hole in order to evaluate the proposed method for modeling the drainage holes in rock mass an example of phreatic surface intersected by one drainage hole is presented a homogeneous numerical sample in dimensions of 10 m 10 m 20 m is prepared with a drainage hole of diameter 0 1 m located in its center the permeability coefficient of the sample is assumed as 10 6 m s and a hydraulic potential of 20 m is applied to the surface boundaries at x 5 m the impervious condition is employed to the other side surfaces of the numerical model the results given by the proposed approach using line elements to implicitly model the hole diameter are compared with those obtained by explicitly modeling the hole diameter and using the superposed element method wang et al 2011 in explicitly modeling approach the drainage hole wall is taken as potential seepage surface fig 11 demonstrates the geometry of the model and fe meshes where the number of elements and nodes are 29 480 32 634 and 8000 9261 for fig 11 b and c respectively the hydraulic potential distribution in the central profile of the sample y 0 by three different means i e superposed element method explicit modeling method and implicit modeling method is shown in fig 12 a c respectively it could be found that the numerically predicted results from implicit modeling method using line elements are in good agreement with those from the other two approaches both for the location of the phreatic surface and the distribution of the hydraulic potential it is shown that the phreatic surface in the block arcs down to the drainage hole which means that this drainage facility plays an important role in the control of hazardous seepage flow generally the proposed method is capable of describing the process of the water intrusion into drainage hole and might be useful in assessing the effect of the drainage curtain in seepage control system 5 case study the presence of highly permeable fractures can provide preferential transport pathways to underground water in the rock mass resulting in changes to the overall mechanical and hydraulic properties therefore the prediction of unsaturated flow in fractured rock mass is of important significance in many research fields such as the rock slope stability analysis seepage control of dam foundations and contaminant transport in unconfined aquifers etc in this section a case study analyzing unsaturated flow through a fractured rock slope is presented the geometry of the fractured rock slope is illustrated in fig 13 to gain a fundamental understanding of the effects of fractures and drainage holes different modeling details are employed in this case study see fig 14 fig 14 a shows a model with two sets of orthogonal fractures at dip angles i e the angle between the fracture plane and horizontal direction of 45 and 135 respectively the trace lengths of the two sets of fractures are 4 0 m with a standard deviation of 1 0 m fig 14 b shows a model with randomly distributed fractures in which the fracture density is nearly the same with that shown in fig 14 a the trace lengths of the fractures are again 4 0 m with a standard deviation of 1 0 m fig 14 c displays a model with three horizontal drainage holes the drainage holes have a radius of 0 075 m and a spacing of 2 0 m using the proposed modeling scheme unsaturated flow is simulated in the fractured rock slope under three circumstances a different fracture patterns b sudden drop in downstream water level c with and without drainage holes 5 1 different fracture patterns steady unsaturated flow in a fractured rock slope is simulated by two different models i e with two sets of orthogonal fractures and with randomly distributed fractures the upstream water level at the left of this slope is 15 m the downstream water level at the right side is 6 m the boundary at the right side above the downstream water level is assigned with the mixed boundary condition and the other boundaries are assumed to be impervious the intrinsic permeability of the rock matrix is assumed to be 5 10 15 m2 for this case study fig 15 depicts the hydraulic potential distribution and the phreatic surface obtained from the two models with a uniform aperture of 0 1 mm the hydraulic potential decreases from the upstream to the downstream in both models however the fractures in the rock slope cause a remarkable degree of disorder in the distribution of the hydraulic potential as well as in the shape and position of the phreatic surface the modeling results differ substantially for different fracture patterns i e orthogonally distributed and randomly distributed the presence of highly permeable fractures leads to the strong heterogeneity of the seepage field in rock mass complicating the determination of the phreatic surface the effect of the different hydraulic apertures on the phreatic surface is also investigated the phreatic surface in the fractured rock slope with orthogonally distributed fractures is obtained using the fracture apertures of 0 05 mm 0 1 mm 0 2 mm and 0 5 mm as illustrated in fig 16 though the position of the phreatic surface may have changed slightly its shape is obviously altered by different hydraulic apertures particularly in the region of the fractures when the fracture aperture is larger its effect could be more pronounced since the difference in permeability between the fracture and the rock matrix is greater it is expected that the basic information of fracture patterns e g distribution density length aperture and roughness is necessarily demanded for the simulation of the unsaturated flow and the determination of the phreatic surface in a fractured rock slope such basic information should be obtained directly by in situ testing to provide reliable model parameters 5 2 sudden drop in downstream water level transient unsaturated flow in the fractured rock slope is simulated using the model with orthogonally distributed fractures the water level is initially at the top of the slope and the flow system is the static equilibrium condition the upstream water level is maintained at a constant value of 15 m while the downstream water level drops instantaneously at t 0 d from 15 m to 6 m and is maintained there subsequently the permeability of the rock matrix is assumed to be 5 10 15 m2 the mechanical aperture for the fractures is 0 1 mm and the specific storage for both rock matrix and fractures is taken as 1 0 10 6 m 1 for simplification unsaturated flow trough the rock slope is then numerically modeled and the performed transient analysis spreads over a total period of 50 d with each time step of 1 d time integration in comsol for this transient analysis utilizes the backward euler method which is an implicit scheme the changes of hydraulic potential at four points in fractures are illustrated in fig 17 and the evolution of locations of the phreatic surface over time is shown in fig 18 because of the instantaneous drop of the external water level at the right boundary a rapid drop in pressure occurs within the rock slope and then the pressure distribution becomes stable gradually against time due to the specific storage effects it can be found that the phreatic surface declines with the fall of the downstream water level and the trend is similar to that obtained from the simulation performed by jiang et al 2014 which indicates that the results obtained from the proposed approach are reasonable additionally it is also observed that the presence of fractures can make the phreatic surface quite rough and irregular during the drop in the downstream water level 5 3 with and without drainage holes the effect of drainage holes on the phreatic surface of the fractured rock slope is investigated utilizing the model containing orthogonally distributed fractures shown in fig 14 a and that also containing drainage holes shown in fig 14 c the steady unsaturated flow is simulated for the scenarios without and with drainage holes respectively the mechanical aperture of the fractures is 0 015 mm and the same boundary conditions as discussed in section 5 1 are employed for this simulation the drainage holes are efficiently modeled by line elements the phreatic surfaces in the fractured rock mass with and without drainage holes are compared in fig 19 it is found that the initial phreatic surface without the drainage holes is relatively higher while the presence of drainage holes could significantly lower the phreatic surface the drainage holes play an important role in controlling the seepage flow in the fractured rock slope whose effects of drainage and depressurization can be accurately reproduced by the proposed approach the simulated results may provide useful knowledge for the design and optimization of efficient drainage facilities for lowering the underground water level in fractured rock slope engineering 6 conclusions modeling unsaturated flow in the fractured rock system with densely distributed fractures and narrowly spaced drainage holes is still challenging particularly with regard to determining the phreatic surface in this paper an efficient numerical procedure is proposed for unsaturated seepage analysis in highly fractured rock system consisting of rock matrix blocks discrete fracture networks and drainage holes 3d fem is adopted to solve the richards equation for unsaturated flow the proposed method is validated by comparison with several numerical and experimental results and further applicated to simulate the unsaturated seepage field in fractured rock slope the aim of this research is to gain a better understanding of the effects of fracture patterns including the fracture distribution and fracture aperture and drainage holes based on these investigations the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed method shows to be efficient in modeling the fractured rock system with densely distributed fractures and narrowly spaced drainage holes with fractures modeled by embedded zero thickness elements and drainage holes interpreted as line elements the computational cost for fem analysis can be reduced the proposed method may be further developed to model coupled hydraulic and mechanical processes in fractured rock mass 2 the results of the proposed method show reasonable accordance with the experimental data and numerical solutions reported in literature by applying the mixed boundary condition to the potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone for unsaturated flow the phreatic surface and exit points of seepage through fractured rock masses could be determined properly 3 the proposed method is applied to predict the unsaturated flow behavior through a fractured rock slope the effects of fracture patterns strongly disordering the seepage field and drainage holes appreciably lowering the phreatic surface can be well captured by the simulation the simulated results presented in this study may provide useful knowledge for performance assessments of fractures and design optimization of drainage holes for the complex fracture systems involved in rock engineering applications however the simulation of unsaturated flow in this study is carried out based on parameters and constitutive relations with simplifications and assumptions due to the lack of exact experimental measurements these may affect the prediction accuracy level of the proposed method moreover the quantification of geometric patterns of natural fractures e g distribution density length aperture and roughness is also necessarily demanded for the simulation of the unsaturated flow and the determination of the phreatic surface in fractured rock engineering such basic information constitutive relations material properties and geometric patterns etc of rock mass should be obtained directly by in situ testing or laboratory experiments to provide reliable modeling parameters in future work declaration of interests none acknowledgments this work was supported by

6417,the identification of preferential flow generation and the tracking of their pathways in agricultural soils are challenging tasks in particular while keeping the soil profile undisturbed the noninvasive electrical resistivity tomography ert method seems a priori to be an ideal tool for these purposes but the simultaneous dependence of soil electrical resistivity er on soil moisture content and salt concentration poses a problem when high salinity water is involved the dependence of these variables is expressed for example by archie s law irrigation with brackish or treated wastewater are two such complicated cases the latter has been found to render soils water repellent with inherent flow in preferential pathways a method that resolves this complication is developed and applied for in situ measured ert data this method combines a model that simulates the preferential er t as a series of interconnected well mixed units wmus with frequent ert scans during soil wetting and subsequent drying following validation by comparison of its output to simulations using the richards equation for flow and convection dispersion equation for transport the wmu model was used to simulate scenarios of simultaneous variations in moisture content salinity and er t in a well mixed soil volume unit the characteristic patterns acquired by these simulations were compared with in situ measured er z t to determine whether the observed preferential er pathways coincide with preferential flow or salinity pathways or both from the eight sections in the profile where this analysis was made for five exhibit preferential flow characterized by fast wetting front propagation that includes by passing of a certain soil volume while the wetting front velocity in the other three was moderate we therefore concluded based on the water content salinity effect on er that the measured preferential er pathways coincide with preferential flow pathways salinity has for the current case a minor if any effect on the er spatial variation therefore ert is an advantageous mean of mapping of preferential flow pathways in the soil profile and the method developed herein can be used for studying the water distribution in the soil profile particular irrigation design and management can be then used to ease the negative effects of preferential flow pathways on soil water availability to plant roots and the enhanced leaching of agrochemical below the active root zone keywords preferential flow pathways water repellency root zone ert brackish water irrigation 1 introduction preferential flow pathways are one form of uneven water flow in the root zone this flow pattern can form under a variety of circumstances e g the presence of differently sized pores and macropores structural cracks rootholes wormholes etc or coarse textured soils jarvis et al 2016 ritsema et al 1993 preferential flow can significantly affect infiltration related processes such as groundwater recharge crop irrigation vadose zone transport of nutrients and contaminants and residence time of water in the vadose zone where chemical compounds are degraded or exchanged in the soil recent studies have found preferential flow pathways fingering where the soil is water repellent or even subcritically water repellent bauters et al 1998 dekker and ritsema 1996 2000 ritsema and dekker 1994 robinson 1999 täumer et al 2005 wallach et al 2013 the different factors that render soil water repellent are described in doerr et al 2000 and references therein moreover wallach et al 2005 recently found that long term irrigation with treated wastewater tww renders the soil water repellent inducing the formation of preferential flow pathways crop irrigation with tww has become a common practice in arid and semiarid areas to deal with water scarcity and to reduce the usage of fresh water in israel the reuse of former wastewater already provides more than 50 of total water consumption by agriculture oecd 2015 besides the advantages as a sustainable water resource and recycling of nutrients compared to fresh water tww is generally characterized by a higher load of dissolved organic matter suspended solids sodium adsorption ratio and significant levels of salinity compounds that can render a surface hydrophobic and that have been identified in water repellent soils are broadly subdivided into aliphatic hydrocarbons and amphiphilic compounds mainly long chained fatty acids franco et al 2000 horne and mcintosh 2000 the latter compounds were also suggested to play a role in the development of water repellent in soils irrigated with wastewater graber et al 2009 a reduced affinity of soil to water so called soil water repellency may lead to reduced infiltration capacities intensify overland flow and formation of preferential flow paths that render the spatial wetting pattern uneven wallach et al 2005 rahav et al 2017 under these conditions the preferential flow is considered as gravity induced unstable flow resulting in vertical narrow paths that have been noted as fingered flow glass et al 1989 however identifying the extent of preferential flow pathways in the soil profile is a challenge the difficulty is related to the methods used to measure uneven soil water distribution in the root zone and its variation with time based on installing many sensors at predetermined or random locations in the soil profile the typically limited sampling volume of these sensors 10 100 cm3 e g ferre et al 1998 limits the estimation of spatial and temporal distribution of water content in the root zone bogena et al 2007 flury et al 1994 kim et al 2008 moreover finding a priori unknown locations of preferential flow pathways using these sensors is not feasible scanlon 2000 vereecken et al 2008 furthermore installation of the local measurement sensors requires drilling gee et al 2003 which interferes with the natural soil structure and water flow regime rothe et al 1997 the advantages of noninvasive methods to measure soil water content are obvious recently electrical resistivity tomography ert has been used in soil science studies as a noninvasive method for acquiring spatiotemporal distribution of soil profiles it has been found to be an appropriate alternative to the aforementioned methods michot et al 2003 moreno et al 2015 nijland et al 2010 in ert electrodes are inserted into the soil surface a pseudo direct electrical current dc is injected through two electrodes current electrodes and the resultant electrical potential is measured by another two electrodes potential electrodes the current flow in the subsurface is described by the poisson equation derived from a combination of ohm s and kirchhoff s laws loke 2000 for 2d ert surveys the electrodes can be placed in a line at the soil surface enabling a large number of possibilities for current and potential electrodes first a pseudo section of the soil s electrical properties is constructed and for each electrode quartet a measurement s horizontal and vertical location is determined the pseudo section usually does not show the correct electrical resistivity er distribution because each resistivity measurement is influenced by a larger soil volume than that around each measurement location and the heterogeneity of the soil electrical properties with its effect on the electrical current in the soil furman et al 2002 the soil heterogeneity causes this apparent resistivity to differ from the true one to determine the true bulk er of the soil an inversion of the measured values must be conducted in this inverse problem the main goal is to determine the subsurface structure i e the bulk er distribution that will provide a forward simulation result similar to the measured data i e finding an er distribution model that best explains the results loke 2000 this is by definition an ill posed problem therefore solving it entails the application of some constraints typically requiring smoothness of the solution loke 2000 each ert survey provides detailed distribution of the bulk soil er over a relatively large soil volume binley et al 1996 michot et al 2003 the strong dependence of bulk soil er on water content makes ert a relatively simple method to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of moisture content in the soil profile without disturbing it samouëlian et al 2005 the semi empirical archie law archie 1942 and its many variants e g waxman and smits 1968 rhoades et al 1976 mualem and friedman 1991 have been used to relate bulk soil er and soil water content it is accepted that in general of the two the er is much more sensitive to the moisture content than to the salinity sheets and hendrickx 1995 many studies on soil water content evaluation by ert surveys have assumed a uniform spatiotemporal value of the pore water electrical conductivity beff et al 2013 srayeddin and doussan 2009 zhou et al 2001 however the bulk soil er s dependence on pore water electrical conductivity is disregarded which may introduce errors when soil salinity is high as in cases where brackish water or treated wastewater tww are used for irrigation recent studies on drip irrigation in a grapefruit orchard using ert furman et al 2013 zur 2009 have shown that an assumption of uniform pore water electrical conductivity leads to a larger apparent porosity moisture content by ignoring the salinity buildup as the irrigation season progresses moreno et al 2015 isolated the contribution of pore water electrical conductivity from the bulk electrical conductivity by calibrating a coupled flow and transport model the temporal dynamics of the measured electrical signal enabled a better understanding of the water and solute dynamics in the root zone however this method seems less practical when preferential flow paths are formed in a water repellent soil profile by the flow instability associated with non zero contact angles aminzadeh et al 2011 brindt and wallach 2017 the high water salinity associated with brackish water may then affect the interpretation of the measured bulk soil er distribution thus a priori determination of the coefficients in the modified archie law that combines the water content and salinity effects on the bulk soil er at the field scale is complicated and less unrealistic in practice modeling of flow in gravity induced fingers is still challenging the soil physics community dicarlo 2013 and particularly fingers that are inherently formed in water repellent soils many efforts to simulate the formation of preferential flow paths and their extent using the 1d richards equation have been unsuccessful owing to the lack of this parabolic type partial differential equation to simulate a sharp wetting front and the nonmonotonic soil water distribution that have been observed along gravity induced fingers more details on this issue can be found in dicarlo 2013 and brindt and wallach 2017 and references therein therefore the use the richards equation based model for a 2d preferential flow is not feasible and alternative models should be developed and used moreover the lack of a simple model and given that soil resistivity is a function of both soil water content and salinity an answer to the question whether a measured preferential er path indicates a preferential flow pathway or spatial salt distribution of such shape by a 2d model is still open given that this study provides a means to resolve this difficulty by combining measured ert scans and a simplified 1d model for each er preferential path based on the above the method suggested herein intends to examine whether a preferential er path is formed mainly by a preferential flow pathway or rather by a spatial salt distribution this method is based on already measured sequential preferential er t paths and using a model that simulates the preferential er t path as a series of vertical interconnected well mixed units wmus frequent ert in situ scans during soil wetting and subsequent drying were used together with wmu simulations for er variation during a complete irrigation cycle soil wetting and drying for different initial moisture content and salt concentration scenarios the following stage includes a comparison of the ert sequential scans with the wmu simulations that enables to deduce whether the er preferential pathway results by a preferential flow a similar shape of a spatial salt distribution or both the method is used for an interpretation of actual er data measured in water repellent soils that are irrigated with brackish water this study is complementary to a comprehensive field study by rahav et al 2017 that aimed to examine the effects of i soil wettability decrease due to prolonged tww irrigation on the spatial and temporal distribution of water content and associated chemical properties in the root zone ii soil reclamation by replacing tww irrigation with freshwater fw for soil reclamation 2 material and methods 2 1 field study setup the study took place in a commercial tww irrigated citrus orchard located in sitriya in central israel the orchard was planted in a noncalcareous sandy loam soil 80 1 sand 8 8 silt and 10 1 clay with an average ph of 7 2 rahav et al 2017 the orchard was irrigated with a drip irrigation system with fw until 2008 when tww from the ayalon sewage treatment plant replaced the fw the star ruby grapefruit trees were planted at spacings 2 6 m in 2012 when the comprehensive study was initiated an orchard area of 1500 m2 was divided into two halves one half continued to be irrigated with tww while fw replaced the tww in the other half rahav et al 2017 ert surveys were performed to look into the spatial soil water distribution in the tww and fw plots with the expectation that these surveys would enable locating the preferential flow pathways and following their development the plots and entire orchard were irrigated daily excluding saturdays by a single drip line located 30 cm from the tree row the 3 8 l h drippers were 75 cm apart along the dripper lines and the wetted area of adjacent drippers was expected to merge to form a continuous wetting strip along the dripper line the average irrigation amount during the irrigation season april to november was 700 mm the electrical conductivity of the fw was half that of the tww 0 9 and 1 8 ds m respectively both sources categorized as brackish water for more details on the study site and its soil characteristics we refer the reader to rahav et al 2017 2 2 ert surveys successive 2d x z ert surveys to trace the course of the temporal changes in er distribution in the soil profile during wetting and subsequent drying were performed for the tww and fw plots the syscal pro switch 96 system iris instruments france with 36 stainless steel electrodes was used for these surveys the electrodes were placed 15 cm apart in a line parallel to the tree rows and drip line 10 cm off the drip line the surveys were started on the morning prior to irrigation initiation and stopped in the late afternoon hours to monitor the spatial soil water distribution during the irrigation and subsequent drainage events each ert survey included hundreds of separate electrical potential measurements using dipole dipole dp dp and wenner schlumberger sequences in the dp dp sequence single electrode spacing was maintained between the current electrode pair as well as between the potential electrode pair in the wenner schlumberger sequences a specific interval between the four current and potential electrodes was chosen for each measurement each measurement included 3 to 10 repeats of current injection and potential measurement the preferred standard deviation of these repetitions was 1 namely if the standard deviation was higher after three repetitions additional repetitions were conducted until the preferred standard deviation was reached or 10 reparation repetitions were completed measurements with larger than 10 standard deviation even after ten repetitions were ignored and removed from further analysis an inversion process is needed for achieving the er distribution from the apparent resistivity measurements this inversion aim is to provide a 2d er distribution model with a certain predetermined degree of uncertainty based on the measured er data owing to the solution nonuniqueness the inversion process may lead to nonrealistic results binley and kemna 2005 to overcome this obstacle additional constraints were added and the inversion is treated as a regularized optimization problem tikhonov and arsenin 1977 a detailed explanation of the inversion process can be found in binley and kemna 2005 data inversion for the apparent resistivity field measurements was performed with r2 software binley 2013 this software provides an inverse solution to the measured apparent resistivity data based on a 3d charge current with a 2d finite element mesh the solution is based on a regularized objective function combined with weighted least squares the iterative optimization reduces the differences between measured resistivity values and those calculated with the inversion model until the difference estimated by a root mean square error rmse is reaching 1 2 3 preferential er pathway analysis to determine whether a preferential e r pathway coincides with preferential flow pathways or rather represents a combination of salinity and water content distributions the following steps were taken i virtual 10 cm wide sections were plotted along what seemed to be preferential e r pathways ii the sections were divided into three sequential segments of similar length 12 cm each iii the e r variation with time for section i e r i j t was determined from the successive e r surveys note that j 1 2 3 denotes the segments in each column iv the measured e r i j t and the well mixed unit wmu simulations for the different sections see section 2 4 for details were compared to determine whether the preferential e r i t coincides with a preferential flow pathway 2 4 the wmu model following the wmu approach a measured er preferential pathway divided into a finite number of units within which the moisture content θ t and salt concentration c t are uniformly distributed fig 1 the wmus are interconnected such that the water and salinity outflow from a unit is the inflow from unit underneath it the upper unit represents the soil surface layer and its input represents the boundary condition at the soil surface the wmu mathematical model is based on a mass balance of water and salt in each unit along the column the model consists of the following stages fig 1 i tww or brackish water enters the upper unit at a rate q 1 i n and salt concentration c 1 i n the initial water content in the upper unit and in practice between field capacity fc the water content in which water drainage turns negligible and wilting point should provide plants with available water to keep high yield it depends on the farmer s experience and soil and crop types as long as θ 1 t f c water does not leave the upper unit actually any unit in the column and is depleted by root uptake transpiration t and evaporation these two water depletion processes can be lumped in the model to a single evapotranspiration parameter et the ongoing water and salinity inflow into the upper unit given that q 1 i n e t increases its water content and changes its salinity ii drainage q 1 o u t q 2 i n initiates when θ 1 t f c the dissolved salt concentration in the water that leaves the upper unit is c 1 t c 2 t in the initial water level in the lower unit can be either lower or higher than f c for θ 2 t f c water is depleted solely by root uptake and for θ 2 t f c water and salt leave the unit water content in this unit is then depleted by drainage and root water uptake simultaneously fig 1 iii when irrigation stops water and salt continue to drain as long as θ i t f c where i 1 for the upper unit and 2 3 for deeper units note that water depletion by root water uptake continues for θ 1 t θ 2 t a n d θ 3 t f c water and salt do not discharge out of the units while water depletion continues by root uptake as the model simulations are run for an orchard that is irrigated daily the water depletion by either et or e is assumed constant as water content variation and free drainage in particular are less sensitive to hourly et variation farahani et al 2007 wegehenkel and beyrich 2014 and references therein the balance equations for water and salt for coupled above and underneath wmus are for the upper unit i 1 1 b d θ 1 dt q 1 i n e t q 1 o u t t b d θ 1 i c 1 i dt c 1 i n q 1 i n c 1 t q 1 o u t t c 1 o c ir where b is the unit depth q 1 i n and c 1 i n are the water and salinity influx respectively and q 1 o u t t is the outflow from the wmu which depends on the difference between θ 1 t and f c 2 q 1 o u t t 0 θ i 0 f c α θ 1 t f c θ i 0 f c in which α is the outflow rate coefficient which indicates the relative water access above fc that will be drained in a single time step coarser soil and soil with a large number of macropores will have higher drainage parameters the drainage expression as a whole when the moisture content is larger than fc in eq 2 can be considered as an analogous to the darcy law under gravitation flow unit gradient for lower units i 2 3 the influx is actually the outflux from the above unit so replacing the influx q iin t for lower units to the outflux from the above unit q i 1 o u t t yields 3 b d θ i dt q i 1 o u t t e t q iout t b d θ i c i dt c i 1 t q i 1

built in ode45 solver the process was divided into a series of problems according to the different in out fluxes at the units once a condition that triggers flux is reached e g moisture content that reaches fc or irrigation initiation a new problem is solved whose initial conditions are the moisture content and salt concentration at the end of the previous problem the archie equation archie 1942 was used to relate the simultaneous variation of θ t and c t to er t 5 ρ t kf c t θ t θ r θ s θ r m where ρ t is the bulk er f and m are the formation and cementation factors respectively θ s is the saturation moisture content and θ r is the residual moisture content the simulations in the sequel are made with f 2 5 and m 1 3 the parameter k is a conversion parameter from solute concentration in meq l to electrical conductivity in ms m and was chosen to be equal to 100 m e q l 1 s m 1 rhoades et al 1992 3 results 3 1 sequential ert surveys the sequential ert surveys that were measured in situ during tww irrigation soil wetting and subsequent drainage drying are depicted in fig 2 where the er distribution in the soil profile is seen to be spatially uneven the relatively sharp changes in er over short distances particularly along the horizontal direction are attributed to preferential pathways that were generated in the soil that was rendered water repellent by the irrigation with tww rahav et al 2017 the high soil salinity in the plot rahav et al 2017 may contribute to the spatial distribution of the er t in general and in particular to the formation of preferential er pathways fig 2 the difficulty in distinguishing between the relative contribution of high water content and salinity as both simultaneously reduce the soil er led to the development of an indirect method based on a comparison between in situ measured and simulated er t using the wmu model for the latter 3 2 wmu model verification the wmu model was verified by comparing its simulation outcomes with simulations using the richards richards 1942 and convection dispersion equations the θ t and c t in a single unit fig 3 were calculated by averaging the data obtained by hydrus 1 d over the unit depth b the parameters used for the simulations eqs 2 and 4 were θ s 0 38 θ r 0 05 van genuchten parameters α vg 0 035 and n vg 1 94 saturation hydraulic conductivity k s 0 104 cm min and the dispersion coefficient d 0 01 cm2 min for the hydrus 1 d simulations and b 20 c m and α 24 10 4 min 1 and fc 0 16 for the wmu model the soil hydraulic parameters for the hydrus 1 d simulations where taken from the rosetta neural network prediction algorithm provided by the hydrus 1 d software based on the field study site particle size distribution rahav et al 2017 the wmu model parameters were evaluated from the hydrus 1 d simulations the fc was chosen when water depletion turned constant during drainage simulations namely the drainage stops and water is depleted solely by et the alpha was then chosen to provide the best fit between the hydrus 1 d and wmu model simulations the parameters for the wmu model have provided a good agreement between the wmu model and hydrus 1 d simulations the simulations included two consecutive stages i in fig 3a and b water drained from an initially wet unit with brackish water θ 0 0 34 a n d c 0 34 meq l with a constant evapotranspiration et of 5 10 4 cm min the drainage stage lasted 2880 min 2 days for both models in the wmu the drainage stopped when water reached fc θ 0 16 with only water depletion by et occurring until θ 0 12 very good agreement rmse 0 007 was reached between the moisture content of the hydrus and wmu model simulations at the end of this stage fig 3a however a slight deviation in salt concentration was obtained between the two models fig 3b ii at this stage a flux o f b r a c k i s h w a t e r q in 0 01 cm min and c in 35 meq l was introduced into the unit for 3 h the water content increased while the salt concentration decreased fig 3c d respectively note that drainage in the wmu does not start before fc θ 0 1 6 has been reached the initial conditions for stage 2 were the final moisture content and salt concentration at the end of the former stage as for the drainage scenario a good agreement between the hydrus and the wmu model output was obtained with rmse of 0 002 in the water content comparison fig 3c and 0 08 for the salt concentration fig 3d the very good agreement between the wmu model and hydrus simulations fig 3 enables a further use of the former to examine whether the measured preferential e r fig 2 is generated by preferential water flow or a local salinity effect and the extent of these effects 3 3 simulations for θ t c t and ρ t in a two wmu system two case studies were simulated using the wmu model for two interconnected units upper and lower to study the typical variations in θ t c t and ρ t in a soil profile under brackish water irrigation the wmu parameters and initial conditions for each case are provided in table 1 the initial water content and salt concentration in the units denoted by θ 10 and c 10 for the upper unit and by θ 20 and c 20 for the lower one were similar for the first set of case studies the second set included a scenario in which the initial water content differed among the two units θ 10 θ 20 for both sets with units lengths b was 20 cm brackish water c in 9 meq l entered the upper unit at a rate of q 1 i n 0 03 cm min for 562 min water and salt outflow from the upper and lower units occurred as long as θ 1 t a n d θ 2 t f c 0 16 moreover water depletion by plant root uptake occurred continually at a constant rate of 0 0055 cm min daily et of 8 c m d a y the coefficient for water outflow from the units was α 0 01 cm 1 and the er variation ρ t was calculated by substituting θ t and c t into archie s model eq 5 fig 4 depicts the simulation results for the first set of case studies the initial water content in both units was θ 10 θ 02 0 097 fc whereas the salt concentration in the first case study was initially high c 10 c 20 75 meq l fig 4b and low for the second case study c 10 c 20 25 meq l fig 4e the initial er ρ t in the units differed for the two case studies fig 4c f outflow from the upper unit started after 51 min when water content reached fc fig 4a nevertheless water content continued to increase as long as irrigation occurred the water content in the lower unit initially decreased due to root uptake and started to increase afterward when water inflow outflow from the upper unit exceeded the root uptake rate fig 4d as irrigation water salinity 0 09 meq l was lower than the initial salt concentration c 10 a n d c 20 for both case studies the salt concentration in the upper unit decreased while irrigation occurred dilution effect and increased when irrigation stopped t 562 min fig 4b salinity in the lower unit increased as long as water was being depleted by root uptake and did not flow in water content in the upper unit had not reached fc a higher rate of salinity decrease during irrigation was clearly associated with a higher initial salt concentration fig 4e moreover for both case studies the pattern of salinity change in the lower unit differed from that in the upper one while the decrease in the upper unit was monotonic as long as water flowed in it varied in a nonmonotonic pattern in the lower unit first increasing and then decreasing fig 4b e a nonmonotonic variation in ρ t also occurred in both units for the two case studies fig 4c f this nonmonotonicity was a result of the opposite effects of θ and c on ρ eq 5 a decreased salt concentration decreases er whereas increased moisture content increases it so although during irrigation the moisture content rose continuously the er t increased after an initial decrease owing to the salt dilution in the unit this pattern may confuse the interpretation of er t when the changes in solute concentration are not taken into account which may lead to misinterpretation of moisture content distribution and in particular oversaturation the simulation results for three additional cases are depicted in fig 5 where the upper unit was initially drier than the lower one θ 10 0 097 θ 20 0 15 for all case studies this represents a common scenario in irrigated fields where the topsoil layer is drier than the layer underneath it before irrigation is started owing to evaporation and enhanced root water uptake the initial salt concentration in the upper unit was higher than lower than or equal to the concentration in the lower unit fig 5b e and h respectively the general pattern of θ t and c t variation in fig 5 was similar to those in the previous two case studies fig 4a b d e despite the different initial water content as the figure speaks for itself we skip the detailed verbal description of θ t and c t variation for the latter case studies the variation in ρ t in fig 5c f i indicates that the water content variation had a larger effect than that of the salt concentration all simulations depicted in fig 5 showed a similar trend when water enters the upper unit ρ t first decreases sharply and then shows a gradual or no increase depending on the balance between the rates of water content increase and salt concentration decrease consequently the simulations indicated that an a priori estimation of ρ t from variations in θ t and c t is not straightforward owing to the opposite effects of the two latter variables on the former 3 4 do preferential er and preferential flow pathways coincide the examination of whether the in situ observed preferential er pathways are associated with preferential flow pathways or a result of spatial salinity distribution was based on the aforementioned wmu model simulations figs 4 and 5 the overall e r t variation within the segments was summarized based on the simulations figs 4 and 5 for further use in analyzing the field measured ert scans as follows i a monotonic er t decrease was associated with a continuous increase in net water content in the segment the rate of the er t decrease depended mainly on the initial water content in the segment and the rate at which it increased and to a lesser extent on the initial salt concentration and its variation over time within the segment ii a monotonic increase of er t was associated with net continuous water content depletion by et drainage or both as was demonstrated in case 1 the rate at which the er t increased depended mainly on the rate at which the water was depleted salinity variation in the segment had a minor effect on the rate at which the er t increased iii a constant er t indicated no change in water content or salinity iv an er t decrease followed by an increase nonmonotonic variation occurred when water entered a segment while drainage started sometime afterward namely when the water level reached fc the lowest er t value coincided with drainage initiation as the drainage rate depended on water content in the segment the rate of its increase diminished as water content increased figs 4a d and 5a d g and the er t increase followed the inverse pattern however while the moisture content slowly reached a constant value the salt in the segment underwent a continuous dilution due to a lower input concentration entering from above this combination caused an increase in er t the increase intensified when the irrigation stopped and both drainage and et were occurring the initial salt concentration in the segment affected the rate at which er t increased where a higher lower rate of increase was associated with higher lower initial salt concentration respectively note that salinity affected the rate at which er t varied but not the overall variation pattern v an er t increase followed by a decrease nonmonotonic variation represented the case in which water is first depleted by et and is then increased by the recharging water irrigation into and drainage from an upper segment to a lower one the er t increase rate depended on the salt concentration in the segment being higher for higher salt concentration the decrease in er t initiated when drainage from the upper segment started to flow into the lower one the rate of er t increase depended on the initial moisture content the water depletion rate the balance between the water discharge and depletion rates and to a minor extent on the salt concentration the above er t variation scenarios within a certain soil volume show that this variation is mainly dependent on the change in water content and to a lesser extent on the variation in salt concentration to determine whether the highlighted columns in fig 2 are preferential paths or not the e r variation with time within each of the three segments in the eight columns e r i j t where i 1 3 and j 1 8 fig 2 depicted in fig 6 was studied the er variation in each unit was then compared to the five scenarios above the variation of er t for each segment was obtained by following the change in the measured er for the segment in consecutive scans fig 2 the er for the segment was determined by averaging the er x z within each segment with t 0 in fig 6 denotes the start of irrigation according to fig 6 there are nonmonotonic er t patterns in the upper segment blue line of sections 1 2 3 4 5 7 and 8 the er t in the upper segment of sections 1 3 4 5 7 and 8 first decreased and then increased scenario iv above whereas in section 2 it first increased and then decreased scenario v above the er t remained mostly constant in section 6 scenario iii above the nonmonotonic er variation in the lowest units of sections 1 4 5 and 7 can be related to the retarded water entrance from the above unit scenario iv above and of sections 2 3 6 and 8 to a moisture content increase followed by a dilution scenario v above fig 6 notice that the initial retardation in section 7 is also related to scenario v following the above patterns a distinction between preferential and uniform flow could be made by examining the following sequence of events i the three units in a section receive water in sequential order similar to the gradual wetting front advance which indicates that flow is stable ii two or three units in a section wet simultaneously indicating that flow is preferential iii the lower unit receives water before the upper one indicating a preferential flow path that bypasses the upper unit the case of a 3d flow pattern that cannot be monitored by the 2d ert scans the application of these characteristic patterns to the measured er t scans revealed that the flow in sections 2 3 and 5 in fig 6 is uniform whereas the flow in sections 1 4 6 7 and 8 is preferential bypassing the upper unit in sections 1 7 and 8 or the middle unit in sections 4 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 general given that salinity and water content affect soil er independently albeit not in a similar fashion the identification of spatial water distribution in the soil profile using ert becomes a challenging task when brackish water is used this challenge is even greater when flow takes place in preferential flow paths fingers that are inherent to water repellent soils that are irrigated with tww that contain high salt concentrations the current study presents a method that combines ert scans and a relatively simple mathematical model to identify preferential flow paths in the soil profile for the above mentioned case the method is based on frequent ert scans during an irrigation event and the identification of preferential er paths the er t for each of couple vertical soil segments that comprise the preferential er path are then compared qualitatively to the er t patterns that were independently calculated by the wmu model the changes within the soil segments are simulated by a series of interconnected well mixed units that are located one above the other given that the spatial salinity concentration within each unit is assumed uniform and varies with time the spatial variation along the preferential er path is taken care of by the variation within the interconnected units the combination of measured and simulated er t scans enabled to examine whether the er preferential paths were generated by preferential flow or rather by a certain salt distribution in the current case using this method verified that the preferential er t pathways coincided with preferential flow pathways additionally and as opposed to interpreting the er changes by solving the richards equation for water and convective dispersive solvers e g hydrus 1 d along the entire preferential path a discretization of the preferential er path into well mixed units enables to detect flow that bypasses some units above it such scenario takes often place under unstable flow conditions this flow option is obtained when the variation of water content and salt concentration with time in a unit does not obey the variation as calculated by the wmu model for such case a 2 d flow is indirectly identified by using the 1 d wmu model 4 2 method limitations and guidelines for use besides its advantages the method suggested in this study has some limitations that should be considered prior to its application and results analysis the resolution sensitivity depth of investigation and the ability to detect particular er distribution depend on the purpose of the survey as they are affected by the electrode configuration spacing and length binley and kemna 2005 samouëlian et al 2005 for example the dipole dipole configuration has high sensitivity to changes in the horizontal direction whereas the wenner schlumberger configuration has a higher sensitivity to changes in the vertical direction however for all configurations the resolution and sensitivity of the er survey decrease as the spacing between electrode increases a practicable approach to deal with this issue is to conduct a series of forward problem simulations using different ert surveys of different spacing and configurations furman et al 2007 rings and hauck 2009 garré et al 2012 a theoretical study that investigated adequate electrode configurations for preferential flow pathways detection in soils brindt 2012 revealed that for the given electrode spacing and survey configuration dipole dipole fingers of 5 10 cm width and higher can be identified however an ert survey that uses the above mentioned configurations with all possible electrode quadripoles will yield several thousand measurements for only a few electrode quadripoles and will substantially increase the acquisition time garré et al 2012 and will not be practical for repeatable er scans during soil wetting and drainage an inherent drawback of the wmu model is that only flow in the vertical direction can be simulated as the input to and output from each unit this assumption limits the use of the wmu model for 1d that takes place within a preferential er path rather than for 2d moreover the accuracy of the wmu model that assumes well mixed units depends on the unit depth b the accuracy increases as more units are used the number of units should be chosen by a compromise between accuracy and practical feasibilities units of 20 cm depth each were chosen as the residence time in a unit that simulates sandy soil is relatively short as gravity driving force is larger than capillary driving force thus a higher number of units should be considered for soils of lower permeability the values chosen for α and fc parameters should also be related to the associated hydraulic properties of the simulated soil regarding the relationship between the pore water electrical conductivity and salt concentration in the archie law it should be noted the linear relationship that used in the current study is valid only for low concentrations pore water electrical conductivity up to 10 d s m 1 a non linear relationship should be considered for higher salt concentrations shea and luthin 1961 solute composition may affect the electrical properties as solute charge and mobility are playing a key role samouëlian et al 2005 5 conclusions and recommendations this work supports the use of the ert method for locating and tracking of gravity driven fingering in water repellent plots that are irrigated with tww soil water salinity may cause difficulties in finding fingers owing to its influence on soil electrical resistivity however analyzing the er t results by using wmu model simulations enables the isolation of gravity driven fingers with higher confidence the suggested method can be used for studying the water distribution in the soil profile and particularly if preferential er has been measured the knowledge whether measured preferential er paths are due to preferential flow or rather to a certain spatial salt distribution is important if treatments to ease their effects are sought in both cases an appropriate irrigation design may help in cases where preferential er paths coincide with preferential flow pathways a particular irrigation design and management can ease the negative effects of such flow regime on soil water availability to plant roots and the enhanced leaching of agrochemical below the active root zone a customized although different irrigation design can ease the negative effects associated with salinity induced preferential er paths by leaching the salt below the root zone beyond identification of the cause to preferential er paths repeated er measurements enable to monitor the effectiveness of the methods used to reclaim the current situation and improve it if found not efficient 
6417,the identification of preferential flow generation and the tracking of their pathways in agricultural soils are challenging tasks in particular while keeping the soil profile undisturbed the noninvasive electrical resistivity tomography ert method seems a priori to be an ideal tool for these purposes but the simultaneous dependence of soil electrical resistivity er on soil moisture content and salt concentration poses a problem when high salinity water is involved the dependence of these variables is expressed for example by archie s law irrigation with brackish or treated wastewater are two such complicated cases the latter has been found to render soils water repellent with inherent flow in preferential pathways a method that resolves this complication is developed and applied for in situ measured ert data this method combines a model that simulates the preferential er t as a series of interconnected well mixed units wmus with frequent ert scans during soil wetting and subsequent drying following validation by comparison of its output to simulations using the richards equation for flow and convection dispersion equation for transport the wmu model was used to simulate scenarios of simultaneous variations in moisture content salinity and er t in a well mixed soil volume unit the characteristic patterns acquired by these simulations were compared with in situ measured er z t to determine whether the observed preferential er pathways coincide with preferential flow or salinity pathways or both from the eight sections in the profile where this analysis was made for five exhibit preferential flow characterized by fast wetting front propagation that includes by passing of a certain soil volume while the wetting front velocity in the other three was moderate we therefore concluded based on the water content salinity effect on er that the measured preferential er pathways coincide with preferential flow pathways salinity has for the current case a minor if any effect on the er spatial variation therefore ert is an advantageous mean of mapping of preferential flow pathways in the soil profile and the method developed herein can be used for studying the water distribution in the soil profile particular irrigation design and management can be then used to ease the negative effects of preferential flow pathways on soil water availability to plant roots and the enhanced leaching of agrochemical below the active root zone keywords preferential flow pathways water repellency root zone ert brackish water irrigation 1 introduction preferential flow pathways are one form of uneven water flow in the root zone this flow pattern can form under a variety of circumstances e g the presence of differently sized pores and macropores structural cracks rootholes wormholes etc or coarse textured soils jarvis et al 2016 ritsema et al 1993 preferential flow can significantly affect infiltration related processes such as groundwater recharge crop irrigation vadose zone transport of nutrients and contaminants and residence time of water in the vadose zone where chemical compounds are degraded or exchanged in the soil recent studies have found preferential flow pathways fingering where the soil is water repellent or even subcritically water repellent bauters et al 1998 dekker and ritsema 1996 2000 ritsema and dekker 1994 robinson 1999 täumer et al 2005 wallach et al 2013 the different factors that render soil water repellent are described in doerr et al 2000 and references therein moreover wallach et al 2005 recently found that long term irrigation with treated wastewater tww renders the soil water repellent inducing the formation of preferential flow pathways crop irrigation with tww has become a common practice in arid and semiarid areas to deal with water scarcity and to reduce the usage of fresh water in israel the reuse of former wastewater already provides more than 50 of total water consumption by agriculture oecd 2015 besides the advantages as a sustainable water resource and recycling of nutrients compared to fresh water tww is generally characterized by a higher load of dissolved organic matter suspended solids sodium adsorption ratio and significant levels of salinity compounds that can render a surface hydrophobic and that have been identified in water repellent soils are broadly subdivided into aliphatic hydrocarbons and amphiphilic compounds mainly long chained fatty acids franco et al 2000 horne and mcintosh 2000 the latter compounds were also suggested to play a role in the development of water repellent in soils irrigated with wastewater graber et al 2009 a reduced affinity of soil to water so called soil water repellency may lead to reduced infiltration capacities intensify overland flow and formation of preferential flow paths that render the spatial wetting pattern uneven wallach et al 2005 rahav et al 2017 under these conditions the preferential flow is considered as gravity induced unstable flow resulting in vertical narrow paths that have been noted as fingered flow glass et al 1989 however identifying the extent of preferential flow pathways in the soil profile is a challenge the difficulty is related to the methods used to measure uneven soil water distribution in the root zone and its variation with time based on installing many sensors at predetermined or random locations in the soil profile the typically limited sampling volume of these sensors 10 100 cm3 e g ferre et al 1998 limits the estimation of spatial and temporal distribution of water content in the root zone bogena et al 2007 flury et al 1994 kim et al 2008 moreover finding a priori unknown locations of preferential flow pathways using these sensors is not feasible scanlon 2000 vereecken et al 2008 furthermore installation of the local measurement sensors requires drilling gee et al 2003 which interferes with the natural soil structure and water flow regime rothe et al 1997 the advantages of noninvasive methods to measure soil water content are obvious recently electrical resistivity tomography ert has been used in soil science studies as a noninvasive method for acquiring spatiotemporal distribution of soil profiles it has been found to be an appropriate alternative to the aforementioned methods michot et al 2003 moreno et al 2015 nijland et al 2010 in ert electrodes are inserted into the soil surface a pseudo direct electrical current dc is injected through two electrodes current electrodes and the resultant electrical potential is measured by another two electrodes potential electrodes the current flow in the subsurface is described by the poisson equation derived from a combination of ohm s and kirchhoff s laws loke 2000 for 2d ert surveys the electrodes can be placed in a line at the soil surface enabling a large number of possibilities for current and potential electrodes first a pseudo section of the soil s electrical properties is constructed and for each electrode quartet a measurement s horizontal and vertical location is determined the pseudo section usually does not show the correct electrical resistivity er distribution because each resistivity measurement is influenced by a larger soil volume than that around each measurement location and the heterogeneity of the soil electrical properties with its effect on the electrical current in the soil furman et al 2002 the soil heterogeneity causes this apparent resistivity to differ from the true one to determine the true bulk er of the soil an inversion of the measured values must be conducted in this inverse problem the main goal is to determine the subsurface structure i e the bulk er distribution that will provide a forward simulation result similar to the measured data i e finding an er distribution model that best explains the results loke 2000 this is by definition an ill posed problem therefore solving it entails the application of some constraints typically requiring smoothness of the solution loke 2000 each ert survey provides detailed distribution of the bulk soil er over a relatively large soil volume binley et al 1996 michot et al 2003 the strong dependence of bulk soil er on water content makes ert a relatively simple method to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of moisture content in the soil profile without disturbing it samouëlian et al 2005 the semi empirical archie law archie 1942 and its many variants e g waxman and smits 1968 rhoades et al 1976 mualem and friedman 1991 have been used to relate bulk soil er and soil water content it is accepted that in general of the two the er is much more sensitive to the moisture content than to the salinity sheets and hendrickx 1995 many studies on soil water content evaluation by ert surveys have assumed a uniform spatiotemporal value of the pore water electrical conductivity beff et al 2013 srayeddin and doussan 2009 zhou et al 2001 however the bulk soil er s dependence on pore water electrical conductivity is disregarded which may introduce errors when soil salinity is high as in cases where brackish water or treated wastewater tww are used for irrigation recent studies on drip irrigation in a grapefruit orchard using ert furman et al 2013 zur 2009 have shown that an assumption of uniform pore water electrical conductivity leads to a larger apparent porosity moisture content by ignoring the salinity buildup as the irrigation season progresses moreno et al 2015 isolated the contribution of pore water electrical conductivity from the bulk electrical conductivity by calibrating a coupled flow and transport model the temporal dynamics of the measured electrical signal enabled a better understanding of the water and solute dynamics in the root zone however this method seems less practical when preferential flow paths are formed in a water repellent soil profile by the flow instability associated with non zero contact angles aminzadeh et al 2011 brindt and wallach 2017 the high water salinity associated with brackish water may then affect the interpretation of the measured bulk soil er distribution thus a priori determination of the coefficients in the modified archie law that combines the water content and salinity effects on the bulk soil er at the field scale is complicated and less unrealistic in practice modeling of flow in gravity induced fingers is still challenging the soil physics community dicarlo 2013 and particularly fingers that are inherently formed in water repellent soils many efforts to simulate the formation of preferential flow paths and their extent using the 1d richards equation have been unsuccessful owing to the lack of this parabolic type partial differential equation to simulate a sharp wetting front and the nonmonotonic soil water distribution that have been observed along gravity induced fingers more details on this issue can be found in dicarlo 2013 and brindt and wallach 2017 and references therein therefore the use the richards equation based model for a 2d preferential flow is not feasible and alternative models should be developed and used moreover the lack of a simple model and given that soil resistivity is a function of both soil water content and salinity an answer to the question whether a measured preferential er path indicates a preferential flow pathway or spatial salt distribution of such shape by a 2d model is still open given that this study provides a means to resolve this difficulty by combining measured ert scans and a simplified 1d model for each er preferential path based on the above the method suggested herein intends to examine whether a preferential er path is formed mainly by a preferential flow pathway or rather by a spatial salt distribution this method is based on already measured sequential preferential er t paths and using a model that simulates the preferential er t path as a series of vertical interconnected well mixed units wmus frequent ert in situ scans during soil wetting and subsequent drying were used together with wmu simulations for er variation during a complete irrigation cycle soil wetting and drying for different initial moisture content and salt concentration scenarios the following stage includes a comparison of the ert sequential scans with the wmu simulations that enables to deduce whether the er preferential pathway results by a preferential flow a similar shape of a spatial salt distribution or both the method is used for an interpretation of actual er data measured in water repellent soils that are irrigated with brackish water this study is complementary to a comprehensive field study by rahav et al 2017 that aimed to examine the effects of i soil wettability decrease due to prolonged tww irrigation on the spatial and temporal distribution of water content and associated chemical properties in the root zone ii soil reclamation by replacing tww irrigation with freshwater fw for soil reclamation 2 material and methods 2 1 field study setup the study took place in a commercial tww irrigated citrus orchard located in sitriya in central israel the orchard was planted in a noncalcareous sandy loam soil 80 1 sand 8 8 silt and 10 1 clay with an average ph of 7 2 rahav et al 2017 the orchard was irrigated with a drip irrigation system with fw until 2008 when tww from the ayalon sewage treatment plant replaced the fw the star ruby grapefruit trees were planted at spacings 2 6 m in 2012 when the comprehensive study was initiated an orchard area of 1500 m2 was divided into two halves one half continued to be irrigated with tww while fw replaced the tww in the other half rahav et al 2017 ert surveys were performed to look into the spatial soil water distribution in the tww and fw plots with the expectation that these surveys would enable locating the preferential flow pathways and following their development the plots and entire orchard were irrigated daily excluding saturdays by a single drip line located 30 cm from the tree row the 3 8 l h drippers were 75 cm apart along the dripper lines and the wetted area of adjacent drippers was expected to merge to form a continuous wetting strip along the dripper line the average irrigation amount during the irrigation season april to november was 700 mm the electrical conductivity of the fw was half that of the tww 0 9 and 1 8 ds m respectively both sources categorized as brackish water for more details on the study site and its soil characteristics we refer the reader to rahav et al 2017 2 2 ert surveys successive 2d x z ert surveys to trace the course of the temporal changes in er distribution in the soil profile during wetting and subsequent drying were performed for the tww and fw plots the syscal pro switch 96 system iris instruments france with 36 stainless steel electrodes was used for these surveys the electrodes were placed 15 cm apart in a line parallel to the tree rows and drip line 10 cm off the drip line the surveys were started on the morning prior to irrigation initiation and stopped in the late afternoon hours to monitor the spatial soil water distribution during the irrigation and subsequent drainage events each ert survey included hundreds of separate electrical potential measurements using dipole dipole dp dp and wenner schlumberger sequences in the dp dp sequence single electrode spacing was maintained between the current electrode pair as well as between the potential electrode pair in the wenner schlumberger sequences a specific interval between the four current and potential electrodes was chosen for each measurement each measurement included 3 to 10 repeats of current injection and potential measurement the preferred standard deviation of these repetitions was 1 namely if the standard deviation was higher after three repetitions additional repetitions were conducted until the preferred standard deviation was reached or 10 reparation repetitions were completed measurements with larger than 10 standard deviation even after ten repetitions were ignored and removed from further analysis an inversion process is needed for achieving the er distribution from the apparent resistivity measurements this inversion aim is to provide a 2d er distribution model with a certain predetermined degree of uncertainty based on the measured er data owing to the solution nonuniqueness the inversion process may lead to nonrealistic results binley and kemna 2005 to overcome this obstacle additional constraints were added and the inversion is treated as a regularized optimization problem tikhonov and arsenin 1977 a detailed explanation of the inversion process can be found in binley and kemna 2005 data inversion for the apparent resistivity field measurements was performed with r2 software binley 2013 this software provides an inverse solution to the measured apparent resistivity data based on a 3d charge current with a 2d finite element mesh the solution is based on a regularized objective function combined with weighted least squares the iterative optimization reduces the differences between measured resistivity values and those calculated with the inversion model until the difference estimated by a root mean square error rmse is reaching 1 2 3 preferential er pathway analysis to determine whether a preferential e r pathway coincides with preferential flow pathways or rather represents a combination of salinity and water content distributions the following steps were taken i virtual 10 cm wide sections were plotted along what seemed to be preferential e r pathways ii the sections were divided into three sequential segments of similar length 12 cm each iii the e r variation with time for section i e r i j t was determined from the successive e r surveys note that j 1 2 3 denotes the segments in each column iv the measured e r i j t and the well mixed unit wmu simulations for the different sections see section 2 4 for details were compared to determine whether the preferential e r i t coincides with a preferential flow pathway 2 4 the wmu model following the wmu approach a measured er preferential pathway divided into a finite number of units within which the moisture content θ t and salt concentration c t are uniformly distributed fig 1 the wmus are interconnected such that the water and salinity outflow from a unit is the inflow from unit underneath it the upper unit represents the soil surface layer and its input represents the boundary condition at the soil surface the wmu mathematical model is based on a mass balance of water and salt in each unit along the column the model consists of the following stages fig 1 i tww or brackish water enters the upper unit at a rate q 1 i n and salt concentration c 1 i n the initial water content in the upper unit and in practice between field capacity fc the water content in which water drainage turns negligible and wilting point should provide plants with available water to keep high yield it depends on the farmer s experience and soil and crop types as long as θ 1 t f c water does not leave the upper unit actually any unit in the column and is depleted by root uptake transpiration t and evaporation these two water depletion processes can be lumped in the model to a single evapotranspiration parameter et the ongoing water and salinity inflow into the upper unit given that q 1 i n e t increases its water content and changes its salinity ii drainage q 1 o u t q 2 i n initiates when θ 1 t f c the dissolved salt concentration in the water that leaves the upper unit is c 1 t c 2 t in the initial water level in the lower unit can be either lower or higher than f c for θ 2 t f c water is depleted solely by root uptake and for θ 2 t f c water and salt leave the unit water content in this unit is then depleted by drainage and root water uptake simultaneously fig 1 iii when irrigation stops water and salt continue to drain as long as θ i t f c where i 1 for the upper unit and 2 3 for deeper units note that water depletion by root water uptake continues for θ 1 t θ 2 t a n d θ 3 t f c water and salt do not discharge out of the units while water depletion continues by root uptake as the model simulations are run for an orchard that is irrigated daily the water depletion by either et or e is assumed constant as water content variation and free drainage in particular are less sensitive to hourly et variation farahani et al 2007 wegehenkel and beyrich 2014 and references therein the balance equations for water and salt for coupled above and underneath wmus are for the upper unit i 1 1 b d θ 1 dt q 1 i n e t q 1 o u t t b d θ 1 i c 1 i dt c 1 i n q 1 i n c 1 t q 1 o u t t c 1 o c ir where b is the unit depth q 1 i n and c 1 i n are the water and salinity influx respectively and q 1 o u t t is the outflow from the wmu which depends on the difference between θ 1 t and f c 2 q 1 o u t t 0 θ i 0 f c α θ 1 t f c θ i 0 f c in which α is the outflow rate coefficient which indicates the relative water access above fc that will be drained in a single time step coarser soil and soil with a large number of macropores will have higher drainage parameters the drainage expression as a whole when the moisture content is larger than fc in eq 2 can be considered as an analogous to the darcy law under gravitation flow unit gradient for lower units i 2 3 the influx is actually the outflux from the above unit so replacing the influx q iin t for lower units to the outflux from the above unit q i 1 o u t t yields 3 b d θ i dt q i 1 o u t t e t q iout t b d θ i c i dt c i 1 t q i 1

built in ode45 solver the process was divided into a series of problems according to the different in out fluxes at the units once a condition that triggers flux is reached e g moisture content that reaches fc or irrigation initiation a new problem is solved whose initial conditions are the moisture content and salt concentration at the end of the previous problem the archie equation archie 1942 was used to relate the simultaneous variation of θ t and c t to er t 5 ρ t kf c t θ t θ r θ s θ r m where ρ t is the bulk er f and m are the formation and cementation factors respectively θ s is the saturation moisture content and θ r is the residual moisture content the simulations in the sequel are made with f 2 5 and m 1 3 the parameter k is a conversion parameter from solute concentration in meq l to electrical conductivity in ms m and was chosen to be equal to 100 m e q l 1 s m 1 rhoades et al 1992 3 results 3 1 sequential ert surveys the sequential ert surveys that were measured in situ during tww irrigation soil wetting and subsequent drainage drying are depicted in fig 2 where the er distribution in the soil profile is seen to be spatially uneven the relatively sharp changes in er over short distances particularly along the horizontal direction are attributed to preferential pathways that were generated in the soil that was rendered water repellent by the irrigation with tww rahav et al 2017 the high soil salinity in the plot rahav et al 2017 may contribute to the spatial distribution of the er t in general and in particular to the formation of preferential er pathways fig 2 the difficulty in distinguishing between the relative contribution of high water content and salinity as both simultaneously reduce the soil er led to the development of an indirect method based on a comparison between in situ measured and simulated er t using the wmu model for the latter 3 2 wmu model verification the wmu model was verified by comparing its simulation outcomes with simulations using the richards richards 1942 and convection dispersion equations the θ t and c t in a single unit fig 3 were calculated by averaging the data obtained by hydrus 1 d over the unit depth b the parameters used for the simulations eqs 2 and 4 were θ s 0 38 θ r 0 05 van genuchten parameters α vg 0 035 and n vg 1 94 saturation hydraulic conductivity k s 0 104 cm min and the dispersion coefficient d 0 01 cm2 min for the hydrus 1 d simulations and b 20 c m and α 24 10 4 min 1 and fc 0 16 for the wmu model the soil hydraulic parameters for the hydrus 1 d simulations where taken from the rosetta neural network prediction algorithm provided by the hydrus 1 d software based on the field study site particle size distribution rahav et al 2017 the wmu model parameters were evaluated from the hydrus 1 d simulations the fc was chosen when water depletion turned constant during drainage simulations namely the drainage stops and water is depleted solely by et the alpha was then chosen to provide the best fit between the hydrus 1 d and wmu model simulations the parameters for the wmu model have provided a good agreement between the wmu model and hydrus 1 d simulations the simulations included two consecutive stages i in fig 3a and b water drained from an initially wet unit with brackish water θ 0 0 34 a n d c 0 34 meq l with a constant evapotranspiration et of 5 10 4 cm min the drainage stage lasted 2880 min 2 days for both models in the wmu the drainage stopped when water reached fc θ 0 16 with only water depletion by et occurring until θ 0 12 very good agreement rmse 0 007 was reached between the moisture content of the hydrus and wmu model simulations at the end of this stage fig 3a however a slight deviation in salt concentration was obtained between the two models fig 3b ii at this stage a flux o f b r a c k i s h w a t e r q in 0 01 cm min and c in 35 meq l was introduced into the unit for 3 h the water content increased while the salt concentration decreased fig 3c d respectively note that drainage in the wmu does not start before fc θ 0 1 6 has been reached the initial conditions for stage 2 were the final moisture content and salt concentration at the end of the former stage as for the drainage scenario a good agreement between the hydrus and the wmu model output was obtained with rmse of 0 002 in the water content comparison fig 3c and 0 08 for the salt concentration fig 3d the very good agreement between the wmu model and hydrus simulations fig 3 enables a further use of the former to examine whether the measured preferential e r fig 2 is generated by preferential water flow or a local salinity effect and the extent of these effects 3 3 simulations for θ t c t and ρ t in a two wmu system two case studies were simulated using the wmu model for two interconnected units upper and lower to study the typical variations in θ t c t and ρ t in a soil profile under brackish water irrigation the wmu parameters and initial conditions for each case are provided in table 1 the initial water content and salt concentration in the units denoted by θ 10 and c 10 for the upper unit and by θ 20 and c 20 for the lower one were similar for the first set of case studies the second set included a scenario in which the initial water content differed among the two units θ 10 θ 20 for both sets with units lengths b was 20 cm brackish water c in 9 meq l entered the upper unit at a rate of q 1 i n 0 03 cm min for 562 min water and salt outflow from the upper and lower units occurred as long as θ 1 t a n d θ 2 t f c 0

the er variation ρ t was calculated by substituting θ t and c t into archie s model eq 5 fig 4 depicts the simulation results for the first set of case studies the initial water content in both units was θ 10 θ 02 0 097 fc whereas the salt concentration in the first case study was initially high c 10 c 20 75 meq l fig 4b and low for the second case study c 10 c 20 25 meq l fig 4e the initial er ρ t in the units differed for the two case studies fig 4c f outflow from the upper unit started after 51 min when water content reached fc fig 4a nevertheless water content continued to increase as long as irrigation occurred the water content in the lower unit initially decreased due to root uptake and started to increase afterward when water inflow outflow from the upper unit exceeded the root uptake rate fig 4d as irrigation water salinity 0 09 meq l was lower than the initial salt concentration c 10 a n d c 20 for both case studies the salt concentration in the upper unit decreased while irrigation occurred dilution effect and increased when irrigation stopped t 562 min fig 4b salinity in the lower unit increased as long as water was being depleted by root uptake and did not flow in water content in the upper unit had not reached fc a higher rate of salinity decrease during irrigation was clearly associated with a higher initial salt concentration fig 4e moreover for both case studies the pattern of salinity change in the lower unit differed from that in the upper one while the decrease in the upper unit was monotonic as long as water flowed in it varied in a nonmonotonic pattern in the lower unit first increasing and then decreasing fig 4b e a nonmonotonic variation in ρ t also occurred in both units for the two case studies fig 4c f this nonmonotonicity was a result of the opposite effects of θ and c on ρ eq 5 a decreased salt concentration decreases er whereas increased moisture content increases it so although during irrigation the moisture content rose continuously the er t increased after an initial decrease owing to the salt dilution in the unit this pattern may confuse the interpretation of er t when the changes in solute concentration are not taken into account which may lead to misinterpretation of moisture content distribution and in particular oversaturation the simulation results for three additional cases are depicted in fig 5 where the upper unit was initially drier than the lower one θ 10 0 097 θ 20 0 15 for all case studies this represents a common scenario in irrigated fields where the topsoil layer is drier than the layer underneath it before irrigation is started owing to evaporation and enhanced root water uptake the initial salt concentration in the upper unit was higher than lower than or equal to the concentration in the lower unit fig 5b e and h respectively the general pattern of θ t and c t variation in fig 5 was similar to those in the previous two case studies fig 4a b d e despite the different initial water content as the figure speaks for itself we skip the detailed verbal description of θ t and c t variation for the latter case studies the variation in ρ t in fig 5c f i indicates that the water content variation had a larger effect than that of the salt concentration all simulations depicted in fig 5 showed a similar trend when water enters the upper unit ρ t first decreases sharply and then shows a gradual or no increase depending on the balance between the rates of water content increase and salt concentration decrease consequently the simulations indicated that an a priori estimation of ρ t from variations in θ t and c t is not straightforward owing to the opposite effects of the two latter variables on the former 3 4 do preferential er and preferential flow pathways coincide the examination of whether the in situ observed preferential er pathways are associated with preferential flow pathways or a result of spatial salinity distribution was based on the aforementioned wmu model simulations figs 4 and 5 the overall e r t variation within the segments was summarized based on the simulations figs 4 and 5 for further use in analyzing the field measured ert scans as follows i a monotonic er t decrease was associated with a continuous increase in net water content in the segment the rate of the er t decrease depended mainly on the initial water content in the segment and the rate at which it increased and to a lesser extent on the initial salt concentration and its variation over time within the segment ii a monotonic increase of er t was associated with net continuous water content depletion by et drainage or both as was demonstrated in case 1 the rate at which the er t increased depended mainly on the rate at which the water was depleted salinity variation in the segment had a minor effect on the rate at which the er t increased iii a constant er t indicated no change in water content or salinity iv an er t decrease followed by an increase nonmonotonic variation occurred when water entered a segment while drainage started sometime afterward namely when the water level reached fc the lowest er t value coincided with drainage initiation as the drainage rate depended on water content in the segment the rate of its increase diminished as water content increased figs 4a d and 5a d g and the er t increase followed the inverse pattern however while the moisture content slowly reached a constant value the salt in the segment underwent a continuous dilution due to a lower input concentration entering from above this combination caused an increase in er t the increase intensified when the irrigation stopped and both drainage and et were occurring the initial salt concentration in the segment affected the rate at which er t increased where a higher lower rate of increase was associated with higher lower initial salt concentration respectively note that salinity affected the rate at which er t varied but not the overall variation pattern v an er t increase followed by a decrease nonmonotonic variation represented the case in which water is first depleted by et and is then increased by the recharging water irrigation into and drainage from an upper segment to a lower one the er t increase rate depended on the salt concentration in the segment being higher for higher salt concentration the decrease in er t initiated when drainage from the upper segment started to flow into the lower one the rate of er t increase depended on the initial moisture content the water depletion rate the balance between the water discharge and depletion rates and to a minor extent on the salt concentration the above er t variation scenarios within a certain soil volume show that this variation is mainly dependent on the change in water content and to a lesser extent on the variation in salt concentration to determine whether the highlighted columns in fig 2 are preferential paths or not the e r variation with time within each of the three segments in the eight columns e r i j t where i 1 3 and j 1 8 fig 2 depicted in fig 6 was studied the er variation in each unit was then compared to the five scenarios above the variation of er t for each segment was obtained by following the change in the measured er for the segment in consecutive scans fig 2 the er for the segment was determined by averaging the er x z within each segment with t 0 in fig 6 denotes the start of irrigation according to fig 6 there are nonmonotonic er t patterns in the upper segment blue line of sections 1 2 3 4 5 7 and 8 the er t in the upper segment of sections 1 3 4 5 7 and 8 first decreased and then increased scenario iv above whereas in section 2 it first increased and then decreased scenario v above the er t remained mostly constant in section 6 scenario iii above the nonmonotonic er variation in the lowest units of sections 1 4 5 and 7 can be related to the retarded water entrance from the above unit scenario iv above and of sections 2 3 6 and 8 to a moisture content increase followed by a dilution scenario v above fig 6 notice that the initial retardation in section 7 is also related to scenario v following the above patterns a distinction between preferential and uniform flow could be made by examining the following sequence of events i the three units in a section receive water in sequential order similar to the gradual wetting front advance which indicates that flow is stable ii two or three units in a section wet simultaneously indicating that flow is preferential iii the lower unit receives water before the upper one indicating a preferential flow path that bypasses the upper unit the case of a 3d flow pattern that cannot be monitored by the 2d ert scans the application of these characteristic patterns to the measured er t scans revealed that the flow in sections 2 3 and 5 in fig 6 is uniform whereas the flow in sections 1 4 6 7 and 8 is preferential bypassing the upper unit in sections 1 7 and 8 or the middle unit in sections 4 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 general given that salinity and water content affect soil er independently albeit not in a similar fashion the identification of spatial water distribution in the soil profile using ert becomes a challenging task when brackish water is used this challenge is even greater when flow takes place in preferential flow paths fingers that are inherent to water repellent soils that are irrigated with tww that contain high salt concentrations the current study presents a method that combines ert scans and a relatively simple mathematical model to identify preferential flow paths in the soil profile for the above mentioned case the method is based on frequent ert scans during an irrigation event and the identification of preferential er paths the er t for each of couple vertical soil segments that comprise the preferential er path are then compared qualitatively to the er t patterns that were independently calculated by the wmu model the changes within the soil segments are simulated by a series of interconnected well mixed units that are located one above the other given that the spatial salinity concentration within each unit is assumed uniform and varies with time the spatial variation along the preferential er path is taken care of by the variation within the interconnected units the combination of measured and simulated er t scans enabled to examine whether the er preferential paths were generated by preferential flow or rather by a certain salt distribution in the current case using this method verified that the preferential er t pathways coincided with preferential flow pathways additionally and as opposed to interpreting the er changes by solving the richards equation for water and convective dispersive solvers e g hydrus 1 d along the entire preferential path a discretization of the preferential er path into well mixed units enables to detect flow that bypasses some units above it such scenario takes often place under unstable flow conditions this flow option is obtained when the variation of water content and salt concentration with time in a unit does not obey the variation as calculated by the wmu model for such case a 2 d flow is indirectly identified by using the 1 d wmu model 4 2 method limitations and guidelines for use besides its advantages the method suggested in this study has some limitations that should be considered prior to its application and results analysis the resolution sensitivity depth of investigation and the ability to detect particular er distribution depend on the purpose of the survey as they are affected by the electrode configuration spacing and length binley and kemna 2005 samouëlian et al 2005 for example the dipole dipole configuration has high sensitivity to changes in the horizontal direction whereas the wenner schlumberger configuration has a higher sensitivity to changes in the vertical direction however for all configurations the resolution and sensitivity of the er survey decrease as the spacing between electrode increases a practicable approach to deal with this issue is to conduct a series of forward problem simulations using different ert surveys of different spacing and configurations furman et al 2007 rings and hauck 2009 garré et al 2012 a theoretical study that investigated adequate electrode configurations for preferential flow pathways detection in soils brindt 2012 revealed that for the given electrode spacing and survey configuration dipole dipole fingers of 5 10 cm width and higher can be identified however an ert survey that uses the above mentioned configurations with all possible electrode quadripoles will yield several thousand measurements for only a few electrode quadripoles and will substantially increase the acquisition time garré et al 2012 and will not be practical for repeatable er scans during soil wetting and drainage an inherent drawback of the wmu model is that only flow in the vertical direction can be simulated as the input to and output from each unit this assumption limits the use of the wmu model for 1d that takes place within a preferential er path rather than for 2d moreover the accuracy of the wmu model that assumes well mixed units depends on the unit depth b the accuracy increases as more units are used the number of units should be chosen by a compromise between accuracy and practical feasibilities units of 20 cm depth each were chosen as the residence time in a unit that simulates sandy soil is relatively short as gravity driving force is larger than capillary driving force thus a higher number of units should be considered for soils of lower permeability the values chosen for α and fc parameters should also be related to the associated hydraulic properties of the simulated soil regarding the relationship between the pore water electrical conductivity and salt concentration in the archie law it should be noted the linear relationship that used in the current study is valid only for low concentrations pore water electrical conductivity up to 10 d s m 1 a non linear relationship should be considered for higher salt concentrations shea and luthin 1961 solute composition may affect the electrical properties as solute charge and mobility are playing a key role samouëlian et al 2005 5 conclusions and recommendations this work supports the use of the ert method for locating and tracking of gravity driven fingering in water repellent plots that are irrigated with tww soil water salinity may cause difficulties in finding fingers owing to its influence on soil electrical resistivity however analyzing the er t results by using wmu model simulations enables the isolation of gravity driven fingers with higher confidence the suggested method can be used for studying the water distribution in the soil profile and particularly if preferential er has been measured the knowledge whether measured preferential er paths are due to preferential flow or rather to a certain spatial salt distribution is important if treatments to ease their effects are sought in both cases an appropriate irrigation design may help in cases where preferential er paths coincide with preferential flow pathways a particular irrigation design and management can ease the negative effects of such flow regime on soil water availability to plant roots and the enhanced leaching of agrochemical below the active root zone a customized although different irrigation design can ease the negative effects associated with salinity induced preferential er paths by leaching the salt below the root zone beyond identification of the cause to preferential er paths repeated er measurements enable to monitor the effectiveness of the methods used to reclaim the current situation and improve it if found not efficient 
6418,groundwater is the most important water resource in arid regions however the groundwater traditional models and field measurements are limited due to the fluctuations in hydrological cycles and the difficulty in the accurate quantification of associated parameters here we hypothesized that maximum potential tree height could be used to predict groundwater depth due to the hydraulic limitation of water transportation to address this hypothesis we measured two proxy indicators of maximum potential tree height i e the maxima of heights and volumes of three common dominant tree species in northwest china to construct classical measurement error cme model for predicting groundwater depth in an arid region our results showed that the optimal model based on maximum tree height had the best predictive performance of groundwater depth particularly the tallest plant species the cme model showed that maximum tree height played a vital role in predicting groundwater depth mathematically the model can be expressed as e l n d w ln t h θ 7 11 1 85 e x ln t h θ where dw and th are respectively the theoretical values of groundwater depth and maximum tree height x is the measured maximum tree height θ 7 11 1 85 7 19 0 15 1 91 13 45 r 2 0 82 marginal log likelihood 131 04 rmse 0 33 in addition leave one out cross validation together with correlation analysis indicated that groundwater depth prediction based on maximum tree height in arid regions was an accurate and promising approach in conclusion our study showed that the hydraulic limitation of water transportation led to a negative relationship between maximum tree height and groundwater depth our developed model for predicting groundwater depth with maximum tree height has provided the important basis for the conservation and management of groundwater resources in arid regions keywords arid region groundwater depth predictive model maximum tree height tallest plant species 1 introduction in arid regions drought is severe because the rate of precipitation is significantly lower than the evapotranspiration rate and groundwater is a major water resource jolly et al 2008 schilling et al 2014 shang et al 2016 fluctuation in groundwater depth is one of the major factors for determining ecosystem stability cooper et al 2006 hanxue et al 1998 and greatly influences the diversity structure and productivity of an ecosystem cooper et al 2006 dai et al 2014 hanxue et al 1998 zhao et al 2017 recently groundwater depth has declined due to the rapid development of economy weak irrigation management and poor water resource availability in arid regions famiglietti 2014 shang et al 2016 sishodia et al 2016 the decline in groundwater depth significantly decreases ecosystem productivity and stability grogan et al 2015 kløve et al 2014 however the management and conservation of groundwater resources are difficult due to the fluctuations in hydrological cycles mirzavand and ghazavi

based models and field measurements have been developed and applied in the prediction of groundwater depth in semi arid and arid regions bear 2007 schilling et al 2014 shang et al 2016 zhu et al 2015 the statistical models such as time series model have been widely applied in predicting groundwater depths but the application of this method is limited due to difficulty of data collection mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 nayak et al 2006 zhu et al 2016 physics based models like mike she model also are limited in semi arid and arid regions because it is difficult to obtain hydrogeological parameters due to the constraints of several natural and anthropogenic factors bear 2007 nayak et al 2006 gis based models are not easy to predicte groundwater depths accurately because it is overly dependent on the operative level and experiments of researchers machiwal et al 2012 tiwari et al 2016 field measurement methods e g observation wells are laborious and complex and seldom applied in predicting groundwater depth bear 2007 schilling et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to develop a simple and effective method for the conservation and management of groundwater resources in arid regions hydraulic limitation hypothesis and cohesion tension theory postulate that as trees grow taller they constantly improve the water transport capacity to supply water for metabolism and to overcome the increasing gravity resistance koch et al 2004 niklas 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 during the growth process the risks of embolism and cellular death caused by turgor pressure may increase correspondingly and hence cause the trade offs among water availability plant s height growth and survival to limit the longest distance of water transportation ryan and yoder 1997 sevanto et al 2014 in other words due to hydraulic limitation water transportation distance via xylem vessels has a maximum value depending on species and local conditions midgley 2003 sevanto et al 2014 for a given species in a specific environment the longest water transportation distance of individual plants are the same givnish 2017 klein et al 2015 water transportation distance can be divided into two parts the lengths of underground roots and aboveground stem maximum potential tree height is associated with the maximum water transportation distance via aboveground stem falster and westoby 2003 marks et al 2017 due to the similarity in longest water transportation distance and the adaptability in the length allocation between underground roots and aboveground stem maximum potential tree height is positively correlated with water availability for a specific species in a specific environment falster and westoby 2003 midgley 2003 yin et al 2015 under favorable conditions e g high water availability trees capture water easily from the environment allocate more nutritional resources for increasing the tree height in order to capture light and improve the primary productivity and finally realize the longer maximum potential height fig 1 iwasa et al 1985 klein et al 2015 under unfavorable conditions trees have the shorter maximum potential height and a longer underground root system because trees allocate more nutritional resources for root growth for absorbing more water fig 1 koch et al 2004 niklas 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of predicting groundwater depth in an arid region based on maximum potential tree height due to the precipitation shortage groundwater is the main water resource of ecosystem in arid regions ma et al 2017 shang et al 2016 water availability in arid regions can be determined by the groundwater depth schilling et al 2014 yin et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 in this context we hypothesized that maximum potential tree height could be used to predict groundwater depth in an arid region based on hydraulic limitation hypothesis and cohesion tension theory koch et al 2004 niklas 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 the result of our study provides the basis for developing the sustainable management and utilization strategies of the groundwater resource in arid regions in the background of regional and global climate changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling approach the study was conducted in the yili state of northern tianshan mountain in xinjiang uygur autonomous region northwest china 80 9 42 to 91 01 45 e 40 14 16 to 49 10 45 n fig 2 the study site covers an area of 3 50 105 km2 and is characterized by an arid climate with the annual precipitation of less than 500 mm the annual potential evaporation in the study site ranges from 1800 to 2250 mm whereas the temperature ranges from 51 0 to 42 8 c in this region plants are greatly dependent on the groundwater resource ma et al 2017 yang et al 2014 based on the geological structure land use and vegetation cover 92 sampling points were randomly selected in order to obtain the measured groundwater depths in the yili state fig 2a then private water wells used for small scale irrigation and drinking water production were searched within 2 km from each sampling point to measure the groundwater depths with an electric water level indicator gamicos glt500a xian gavin shaanxi china to assess the average groundwater depth we monitored water wells in spring april summer july and autumn october seasons in 2016 seasonal fluctuations of groundwater depth among sampling water wells ranged from 0 3 to 2 0 m maximum potential tree height is a hypothetical value which can not be measured in the experimental and natural environments in this study we used the maxima of tree height and volume to quantify the maximum potential tree height as suggested in previous studies falster and westoby 2003 givnish 2017 however the maxima of tree height and volume differ among different species due to the variations in heredity and plant adaptability falster and westoby 2003 iwasa et al 1985 marks et al 2017 we therefore selected three dominant species with different maximum heights i e populus nigra var thevestina populus bolleana and ulmus pumila as the representative species in the study area within the distance of 500 m away from the observed water wells the 2 3 tallest individual trees of each of the three dominant species were selected to measure the maxima of tree height and volume for an individual tree the height and crown widths were measured with a vertex meter vertex iv haglöf haglof dalarna sweden and a meter stick respectively crown area was calculated as the average diameter of the east west and north south cross sections of the tree crown i e mathematically as d east west d south north tree crown area was multiplied by the tree height to obtain tree volume yang et al 2015 although groundwater depth was measured in april july and october in 2016 the maxima of tree height and volume were assessed in july only due to the following 4 reasons firstly july is the best growth period with the peak biomass at the experimental site and the measurement accuracy of the maxima of tree height and volume in july is relatively higher than that in other months of the year secondly the responses of the maxima of tree height and volume to groundwater depth can be delayed in other months and hence the change in groundwater depth cannot immediately decrease the maxima of tree height and volume denda et al 2004 thirdly it is difficult to measure the maxima of tree height and volume in april the sprouting period and october the litterfall period in the experimental site fourthly the delayed responses of the maxima of tree height and volume to groundwater depth and plant adaptations to the hydraulic limitation such as water storage partial defoliation and stomatal closure may cause a minor change in maximum tree height manzoni et al 2013 meinzer 1993 yang et al 2015 since the measurement points of individual tree were selected within 500 m of water wells the changes in the micro topography might result in measurement errors between the theoretical and the measured values of the maxima of tree height and volume the measurement errors may be interpreted as follows maximum tree height and maximum tree volume are respectively the vertical distance between treetop and the top plane of selected water wells and the value calculated with theoretical maximum tree height and crown area the inconsistency in the spatial position between the tree measurement points and water wells resulted in measurement errors between the theoretical and the measured values of maximum tree height and volume thus a portable gps a10 zhuolin hefei china was used to measure the elevations of the top plane of the selected water wells and the measurement points of individual trees and then the elevation difference between them was calculated the results showed that all elevation differences between the top plane of the water wells and their sourrounding measurement points were no more than 1 0 m the theoretical values of maximum tree heights were equal to the sum of the measured maximum tree height and the elevation difference between the top plane of water wells and surrounding tree measurement points the measurement errors between the theoretical and measured values of maximum tree heights in the study area ranged from 0 m to 1 m similarly based on the theoretical values of maximum tree heights the measurement errors of maximum tree volumes ranged from 0 m3 to 1 m3 3 data analyses in this study an exponential regressions was selected to determine the optimal independent variable for a predictive model according to the regression analysis results maximum tree height and volume were considered as the optimal independent variable for predicting groundwater depth in order to construct the optimal predictive model of groundwater depth and test the predictive accuracy of the model we divided 92 sampling points collected from 10 counties into two spatially separated groups fig 2a the first group contained 73 points across eight counties non shaded area in fig 2a whereas the second group contained 19 points across two surplus counties shaded area in fig 2a the data of the sampling points of the first group were used to obtain the optimal theoretical model using the classical measurement error cme model approach martins et al 2013 on the contrary the data of the sampling points of the second group were used to test the predictive accuracy of the obtained optimal model the predictive accuracy of the optimal model was determined by the coefficient of determination r 2 between the predicted and the measured values of groundwater depths we used high r 2 and p value 0 05 as the best fit indicators to assess the predictive accuracy of the optimal model apart from the optimal theoretical model cme model can also be used to eliminate the prediction uncertainties caused by the internal variations of independent and dependent variables in this study the prediction uncertainties were mainly derived from the variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depths across three measurements and the measurement errors of maximum tree heights due to the following two factors firstly although the average of groundwater depth was used to develop the predictive model the variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depth among three measurements could affect the uncertainties of the predictive model secondly the measurement error of maximum tree height could also affect the uncertainties of the predictive model due to the inconsistency in spatial position between water wells and their surrounding measurement points in this study based on the data of the sampling points of the first group leave one out cross validation approach was used to test the reliability of the model through a uniform distribution in probability integral transform of a leave one out cross validation a predicted dependent variable which follows a continuous normal distribution can be converted into a series of random variables dawid 1984 if this procedure results in a standard uniform distribution of the transformed predicted dependent variable the model can be considered as reliable dawid 1984 a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was used to evaluate for standard uniform distribution gneiting et al 2007 the application of cme model involves three steps formulating a model hypothesis parameter estimation and reliability analysis to formulate a model hypothesis a relationship between independent and dependent variables is postulated in the parameter estimation step the probability density functions of all the parameters are obtained from their prior distribution in reliability analysis of the model the measured values are used to test the reasonability of postulated relationships between independent and dependent variables in the model in this study three model hypotheses were formulated for the cme model eqs 1 3 firstly groundwater depth has a linear relationship with maximum potential tree height eq 1 secondly groundwater depth has a seasonal fluctuation and its theoretical value equals the sum of the variation in seasonal fluctuation among three measurements and the predicted value from maximum tree height eq 2 thirdly maximum tree height contains a measurement error so its theoretical value equals the sum of the measured value and the measurement error eq 3 1 δ a b x 2 l n dw δ ε 3 l n th x η where dw and th are respectively the theoretical values of groundwater depth and maximum tree height δ is the predicted value of groundwater depth from maximum tree height x is the measured value of maximum potential tree height a and b are respectively the intercept and slope of the linear relationship ε and η are the parameters of cme model for decreasing the prediction uncertainties which respectively refer to the variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depth among three measurements and measurement errors of maximum tree height eqs 1 3 contain six parameters a b x δ ε and η previous studies showed that the estimation of the prior distributions of parameters could be divided into the following two types martins et al 2013 firstly when the probability density function of a parameter is known the prior distribution of the parameter can be expressed with the known function secondly when it is unknown the prior distribution can be assumed as the diffusion prior gaussian distribution with the average 0 and the variance 0 0001 or 0 001 in this study a b and δ were assumed as the diffusion prior gaussian distribution n 0 0 001 since the probability density function was unknown martins et al martins et al 2013 and carroll et al carroll et al 2006 suggested that the diffusion prior distribution of measured independent variables followed gaussian distribution n μ xe τ x 1 i here μ x is the average of the independent variable e and i are respectively an n dimensional vector of element 1 and a unit matrix τx 1 is a minimal value 0 0001 in this case maximum tree height x follows the gaussian distribution n 13 45e 0 001i carroll et al carroll et al 2006 pettit 1990 and pettit carroll et al 2006 pettit 1990 reported that the diffusion prior distribution of random experimental error followed the random gaussian distribution with the average 0 and the variance the inverse of the experimental error 1 measurement error in this study ε and η were the random experimental errors in groundwater depths among three measurements and the measurement error of maximum tree height so their prior distributions followed the gaussian distribution of n 0 τ ε and n 0 τη respectively maximum could provide a sufficiently large range to consider errors in exploring prediction uncertainties of the model in this study the maximum variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depth among three measurements and the measurement errors of maximum tree height were equal to 2 m and 1 m respectively in these cases τ ε and τη were equal to the inverses of maximum variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depth among three measurement times 1 2 0 5 and maximum measurement errors of maximum tree height 1 1 1 0 respectively approximate bayesian inferences in cme model were analyzed with integrated nested laplace approximations algorithm inla muff et al 2013 all data analyses were conducted in r 3 3 3 and cme model was evaluated in inla package martins et al 2013 a summary of variables used in this study is presented in table 1 4 results and discussion groundwater depth had a significant negative relationship with the maxima of tree height and volume fig 3 however compared to maximum tree volume maximum tree height of the studied three common dominant species had a higher explanation of variation of groundwater depth fig 3 indicating that the groundwater depth could be best predicted with maximum tree height this result might be ascribed to the fact that maximum tree height rather than maximum tree volume was the best substitute indicator of maximum potential tree height and hence considered as the best indicator of tree demography falster and westoby 2003 midgley 2003 in this study maximum tree heights of p nigra var thevestina p bolleana and u pumila were respectively 32 00 26 00 and 8 30 m and p nigra var thevestina was the tallest species among three dominant species in the study area table 1 consequently the coefficient of determination r 2 for the relationship between maximum height of p nigra var thevestina and groundwater depth was higher than those for p bolleana and u pumila fig 3 this result indicated that the maximum height of the tallest plant species was more suitable for the accurate prediction of the groundwater depth in an arid region the mechanism for the difference might be interpreted as follows compared to the shortest plant species the tallest plant species has the more sensitive responses to the change in water availability midgley 2003 sevanto et al 2014 our finding supported the general notion that the effect of hydraulic limitation of water transportation on the growth of tree height increased strongly with tree height iwasa et al 1985 klein et al 2015 mcculloh et al 2015 midgley 2003 yang et al 2015 small variations in groundwater depth can lead to a substantial limitation on the height of the tallest species king 1990 klein et al 2015 midgley 2003 verifying the correlation between maximum tree height of the tallest plant species and groundwater depth fig 1 therefore the maximum height of p nigra var thevestina was further considered as an independent variable in the cme model for the prediction of groundwater depth with the data of the sampling points of the first group the cme model indicated the relationship expressions between groundwater depth and maximum tree height in an arid region eqs 4 and 5 r 2 0 82 marginal log likelihood

accuracy of maximum tree height in the ith measurement point in addition most of the measured values were in the 95 confidence interval curves of the predicted values of groundwater depths obtained with the cme model fig 4 a these results indicated that maximum tree height was a promising parameter for the prediction of the groundwater depth in arid regions under the the assumptions of hydraulic limitation hypothesis and cohesion tension theory koch et al 2004 niklas 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 in arid regions hydraulic limitation might limit the growth of tree height due to the trade offs among water availability height growth and water transportation distance thus causing a similar maximum water transportation distance within a specific species in a specific environment givnish 2017 klein et al 2015 under drought conditions plants tend to increase the length of underground roots to offset the stresses of water absorption and transportation thus resulting in a negative relationship between groundwater depth and maximum tree height the results of leave one out cross validation showed that the predicted groundwater depth had a significant correlation with its measured value at 73

6418,groundwater is the most important water resource in arid regions however the groundwater traditional models and field measurements are limited due to the fluctuations in hydrological cycles and the difficulty in the accurate quantification of associated parameters here we hypothesized that maximum potential tree height could be used to predict groundwater depth due to the hydraulic limitation of water transportation to address this hypothesis we measured two proxy indicators of maximum potential tree height i e the maxima of heights and volumes of three common dominant tree species in northwest china to construct classical measurement error cme model for predicting groundwater depth in an arid region our results showed that the optimal model based on maximum tree height had the best predictive performance of groundwater depth particularly the tallest plant species the cme model showed that maximum tree height played a vital role in predicting groundwater depth mathematically the model can be expressed as e l n d w ln t h θ 7 11 1 85 e x ln t h θ where dw and th are respectively the theoretical values of groundwater depth and maximum tree height x is the measured maximum tree height θ 7 11 1 85 7 19 0 15 1 91 13 45 r 2 0 82 marginal log likelihood 131 04 rmse 0 33 in addition leave one out cross validation together with correlation analysis indicated that groundwater depth prediction based on maximum tree height in arid regions was an accurate and promising approach in conclusion our study showed that the hydraulic limitation of water transportation led to a negative relationship between maximum tree height and groundwater depth our developed model for predicting groundwater depth with maximum tree height has provided the important basis for the conservation and management of groundwater resources in arid regions keywords arid region groundwater depth predictive model maximum tree height tallest plant species 1 introduction in arid regions drought is severe because the rate of precipitation is significantly lower than the evapotranspiration rate and groundwater is a major water resource jolly et al 2008 schilling et al 2014 shang et al 2016 fluctuation in groundwater depth is one of the major factors for determining ecosystem stability cooper et al 2006 hanxue et al 1998 and greatly influences the diversity structure and productivity of an ecosystem cooper et al 2006 dai et al 2014 hanxue et al 1998 zhao et al 2017 recently groundwater depth has declined due to the rapid development of economy weak irrigation management and poor water resource availability in arid regions famiglietti 2014 shang et al 2016 sishodia et al 2016 the decline in groundwater depth significantly decreases ecosystem productivity and stability grogan et al 2015 kløve et al 2014 however the management and conservation of groundwater resources are difficult due to the fluctuations in hydrological cycles mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 taylor et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 the precise prediction of groundwater depth may help us to develop sustainable management strategies of the groundwater source under regional and global climatic changes mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 shang et al 2016 zhu et al 2015 for the management and conservation of the groundwater resource numerous methods e g statistical models physics based models gis based models and field measurements have been developed and applied in the prediction of groundwater depth in semi arid and arid regions bear 2007 schilling et al 2014 shang et al 2016 zhu et al 2015 the statistical models such as time series model have been widely applied in predicting groundwater depths but the application of this method is limited due to difficulty of data collection mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 nayak et al 2006 zhu et al 2016 physics based models like mike she model also are limited in semi arid and arid regions because it is difficult to obtain hydrogeological parameters due to the constraints of several natural and anthropogenic factors bear 2007 nayak et al 2006 gis based models are not easy to predicte groundwater depths accurately because it is overly dependent on the operative level and experiments of researchers machiwal et al 2012 tiwari et al 2016 field measurement methods e g observation wells are laborious and complex and seldom applied in predicting groundwater depth bear 2007 schilling et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to develop a simple and effective method for the conservation and management of groundwater resources in arid regions hydraulic limitation hypothesis and cohesion tension theory postulate that as trees grow taller they constantly improve the water transport capacity to supply water for metabolism and to overcome the increasing gravity resistance koch et al 2004 niklas 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 during the growth process the risks of embolism and cellular death caused by turgor pressure may increase correspondingly and hence cause the trade offs among water availability plant s height growth and survival to limit the longest distance of water transportation ryan and yoder 1997 sevanto et al 2014 in other words due to hydraulic limitation water transportation distance via xylem vessels has a maximum value depending on species and local conditions midgley 2003 sevanto et al 2014 for a given species in a specific environment the longest water transportation distance of individual plants are the same givnish 2017 klein et al 2015 water transportation distance can be divided into two parts the lengths of underground roots and aboveground stem maximum potential tree height is associated with the maximum water transportation distance via aboveground stem falster and westoby 2003 marks et al 2017 due to the similarity in longest water transportation distance and the adaptability in the length allocation between underground roots and aboveground stem maximum potential tree height is positively correlated with water availability for a specific species in a specific environment falster and westoby 2003 midgley 2003 yin et al 2015 under favorable conditions e g high water availability trees capture water easily from the environment allocate more nutritional resources for increasing the tree height in order to capture light and improve the primary productivity and finally realize the longer maximum potential height fig 1 iwasa et al 1985 klein et al 2015 under unfavorable conditions trees have the shorter maximum potential height and a longer underground root system because trees allocate more nutritional resources for root growth for absorbing more water fig 1 koch et al 2004 niklas 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of predicting groundwater depth in an arid region based on maximum potential tree height due to the precipitation shortage groundwater is the main water resource of ecosystem in arid regions ma et al 2017 shang et al 2016 water availability in arid regions can be determined by the groundwater depth schilling et al 2014 yin et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 in this context we hypothesized that maximum potential tree height could be used to predict groundwater depth in an arid region based on hydraulic limitation hypothesis and cohesion tension theory koch et al 2004 niklas 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 the result of our study provides the basis for developing the sustainable management and utilization strategies of the groundwater resource in arid regions in the background of regional and global climate changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling approach the study was conducted in the yili state of northern tianshan mountain in xinjiang uygur autonomous region northwest china 80 9 42 to 91 01 45 e 40 14 16 to 49 10 45 n fig 2 the study site covers an area of 3 50 105 km2 and is characterized by an arid climate with the annual precipitation of less than 500 mm the annual potential evaporation in the study site ranges from 1800 to 2250 mm whereas the temperature ranges from 51 0 to 42 8 c in this region plants are greatly dependent on the groundwater resource ma et al 2017 yang et al 2014 based on the geological structure land use and vegetation cover 92 sampling points were randomly selected in order to obtain the measured groundwater depths in the yili state fig 2a then private water wells used for small scale irrigation and drinking water production were searched within 2 km from each sampling point to measure the groundwater depths with an electric water level indicator gamicos glt500a xian gavin shaanxi china to assess the average groundwater depth we monitored water wells in spring april summer july and autumn october seasons in 2016 seasonal fluctuations of groundwater depth among sampling water wells ranged from 0 3 to 2 0 m maximum potential tree height is a hypothetical value which can not be measured in the experimental and natural environments in this study we used the maxima of tree height and volume to quantify the maximum potential tree height as suggested in previous studies falster and westoby 2003 givnish 2017 however the maxima of tree height and volume differ among different species due to the variations in heredity and plant adaptability falster and westoby 2003 iwasa et al 1985 marks et al 2017 we therefore selected three dominant species with different maximum heights i e populus nigra var thevestina populus bolleana and ulmus pumila as the representative species in the study area within the distance of 500 m away from the observed water wells the 2 3 tallest individual trees of each of the three dominant species were selected to measure the maxima of tree height and volume for an individual tree the height and crown widths were measured with a vertex meter vertex iv haglöf haglof dalarna sweden and a meter stick respectively crown area was calculated as the average diameter of the east west and north south cross sections of the tree crown i e mathematically as d east west d south north tree crown area was multiplied by the tree height to obtain tree volume yang et al 2015 although groundwater depth was measured in april july and october in 2016 the maxima of tree height and volume were assessed in july only due to the following 4 reasons firstly july is the best growth period with the peak biomass at the experimental site and the measurement accuracy of the maxima of tree height and volume in july is relatively higher than that in other months of the year secondly the responses of the maxima of tree height and volume to groundwater depth can be delayed in other months and hence the change in groundwater depth cannot immediately decrease the maxima of tree height and volume denda et al 2004 thirdly it is difficult to measure the maxima of tree height and volume in april the sprouting period and october the litterfall period in the experimental site fourthly the delayed responses of the maxima of tree height and volume to groundwater depth and plant adaptations to the hydraulic limitation such as water storage partial defoliation and stomatal closure may cause a minor change in maximum tree height manzoni et al 2013 meinzer 1993 yang et al 2015 since the measurement points of individual tree were selected within 500 m of water wells the changes in the micro topography might result in measurement errors between the theoretical and the measured values of the maxima of tree height and volume the measurement errors may be interpreted as follows maximum tree height and maximum tree volume are respectively the vertical distance between treetop and the top plane of selected water wells and the value calculated with theoretical maximum tree height and crown area the inconsistency in the spatial position between the tree measurement points and water wells resulted in measurement errors between the theoretical and the measured values of maximum tree height and volume thus a portable gps a10 zhuolin hefei china was used to measure the elevations of the top plane of the selected water wells and the measurement points of individual trees and then the elevation difference between them was calculated the results showed that all elevation differences between the top plane of the water wells and their sourrounding measurement points were no more than 1 0 m the theoretical values of maximum tree heights were equal to the sum of the measured maximum tree height and the elevation difference between the top plane of water wells and surrounding tree measurement points the measurement errors between the theoretical and measured values of maximum tree heights in the study area ranged from 0 m to 1 m similarly based on the theoretical values of maximum tree heights the measurement errors of maximum tree volumes ranged from 0 m3 to 1 m3 3 data analyses in this study an exponential regressions was selected to determine the optimal independent variable for a predictive model according to the regression analysis results maximum tree height and volume were considered as the optimal independent variable for predicting groundwater depth in order to construct the optimal predictive model of groundwater depth and test the predictive accuracy of the model we divided 92 sampling points collected from 10 counties into two spatially separated groups fig 2a the first group contained 73 points across eight counties non shaded area in fig 2a whereas the second group contained 19 points across two surplus counties shaded area in fig 2a the data of the sampling points of the first group were used to obtain the optimal theoretical model using the classical measurement error cme model approach martins et al 2013 on the contrary the data of the sampling points of the second group were used to test the predictive accuracy of the obtained optimal model the predictive accuracy of the optimal model was determined by the coefficient of determination r 2 between the predicted and the measured values of groundwater depths we used high r 2 and p value 0 05 as the best fit indicators to assess the predictive accuracy of the optimal model apart from the optimal theoretical model cme model can also be used to eliminate the prediction uncertainties caused by the internal variations of independent and dependent variables in this study the prediction uncertainties were mainly derived from the variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depths across three measurements and the measurement errors of maximum tree heights due to the following two factors firstly although the average of groundwater depth was used to develop the predictive model the variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depth among three measurements could affect the uncertainties of the predictive model secondly the measurement error of maximum tree height could also affect the uncertainties of the predictive model due to the inconsistency in spatial position between water wells and their surrounding measurement points in this study based on the data of the sampling points of the first group leave one out cross validation approach was used to test the reliability of the model through a uniform distribution in probability integral transform of a leave one out cross validation a predicted dependent variable which follows a continuous normal distribution can be converted into a series of random variables dawid 1984 if this procedure results in a standard uniform distribution of the transformed predicted dependent variable the model can be considered as reliable dawid 1984 a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was used to evaluate for standard uniform distribution gneiting et al 2007 the application of cme model involves three steps formulating a model hypothesis parameter estimation and reliability analysis to formulate a model hypothesis a relationship between independent and dependent variables is postulated in the parameter estimation step the probability density functions of all the parameters are obtained from their prior distribution in reliability analysis of the model the measured values are used to test the reasonability of postulated relationships between independent and dependent variables in the model in this study three model hypotheses were formulated for the cme model eqs 1 3 firstly groundwater depth has a linear relationship with maximum potential tree height eq 1 secondly groundwater depth has a seasonal fluctuation and its theoretical value equals the sum of the variation in seasonal fluctuation among three measurements and the predicted value from maximum tree height eq 2 thirdly maximum tree height contains a measurement error so its theoretical value equals the sum of the measured value and the measurement error eq 3 1 δ a b x 2 l n dw δ ε 3 l n th x η where dw and th are respectively the theoretical values of groundwater depth and maximum tree height δ is the predicted value of groundwater depth from maximum tree height x is the measured value of maximum potential tree height a and b are respectively the intercept and slope of the linear relationship ε and η are the parameters of cme model for decreasing the prediction uncertainties which respectively refer to the variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depth among three measurements and measurement errors of maximum tree height eqs 1 3 contain six parameters a b x δ ε and η previous studies showed that the estimation of the prior distributions of parameters could be divided into the following two types martins et al 2013 firstly when the probability density function of a parameter is known the prior distribution of the parameter can be expressed with the known function secondly when it is unknown the prior distribution can be assumed as the diffusion prior gaussian distribution with the average 0 and the variance 0 0001 or 0 001 in this study a b and δ were assumed as the diffusion prior gaussian distribution n 0 0 001 since the probability density function was unknown martins et al martins et al 2013 and carroll et al carroll et al 2006 suggested that the diffusion prior distribution of measured independent variables followed gaussian distribution n μ xe τ x 1 i here μ x is the average of the independent variable e and i are respectively an n dimensional vector of element 1 and a unit matrix τx 1 is a minimal value 0 0001 in this case maximum tree height x follows the gaussian distribution n 13 45e 0 001i carroll et al carroll et al 2006 pettit 1990 and pettit carroll et al 2006 pettit 1990 reported that the diffusion prior distribution of random experimental error followed the random gaussian distribution with the average 0 and the variance the inverse of the experimental error 1 measurement error in this study ε and η were the random experimental errors in groundwater depths among three measurements and the measurement error of maximum tree height so their prior distributions followed the gaussian distribution of n 0 τ ε and n 0 τη respectively maximum could provide a sufficiently large range to consider errors in exploring prediction uncertainties of the model in this study the maximum variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depth among three measurements and the measurement errors of maximum tree height were equal to 2 m and 1 m respectively in these cases τ ε and τη were equal to the inverses of maximum variations in seasonal fluctuation of groundwater depth among three measurement times 1 2 0 5 and maximum measurement errors of maximum tree height 1 1 1 0 respectively approximate bayesian inferences in cme model were analyzed with integrated nested laplace approximations algorithm inla muff et al 2013 all data analyses were conducted in r 3 3 3 and cme model was evaluated in inla package martins et al 2013 a summary of variables used in this study is presented in table 1 4 results and discussion groundwater depth had a significant negative relationship with the maxima of tree height and volume fig 3 however compared to maximum tree volume maximum tree height of the studied three common dominant species had a higher explanation of variation of groundwater depth fig 3 indicating that the groundwater depth could be best predicted with maximum tree height this result might be ascribed to the fact that maximum tree height rather than maximum tree volume was the best substitute indicator of maximum potential tree height and hence considered as the best indicator of tree demography falster and westoby 2003 midgley 2003 in this study maximum tree heights of p nigra var thevestina p bolleana and u pumila were respectively 32 00 26 00 and 8 30 m and p nigra var thevestina was the tallest species among three dominant species in the study area table 1 consequently the coefficient of determination r 2 for the relationship between maximum height of p nigra var thevestina and groundwater depth was higher than those for p bolleana and u pumila fig 3 this result indicated that the maximum height of the tallest plant species was more suitable for the accurate prediction of the groundwater depth in an arid region the mechanism for the difference might be interpreted as follows compared to the shortest plant species the tallest plant species has the more sensitive responses to the change in water availability midgley 2003 sevanto et al 2014 our finding supported the general notion that the effect of hydraulic limitation of water transportation on the growth of tree height increased strongly with tree height iwasa et al 1985 klein et al 2015 mcculloh et al 2015 midgley 2003 yang et al 2015 small variations in groundwater depth can lead to a substantial limitation on the height of the tallest species king 1990 klein et al 2015 midgley 2003 verifying the correlation between maximum tree height of the tallest plant species and groundwater depth fig 1 therefore the maximum height of p nigra var thevestina was further considered as an independent variable in the cme model for the prediction of groundwater depth with the data of the sampling points of the first group the cme model indicated the relationship expressions between groundwater depth and maximum tree height in an arid region eqs 4 and 5 r 2 0 82 marginal log likelihood

accuracy of maximum tree height in the ith measurement point in addition most of the measured values were in the 95 confidence interval curves of the predicted values of groundwater depths obtained with the cme model fig 4 a these results indicated that maximum tree height was a promising parameter for the prediction of the groundwater depth in arid regions under the the assumptions of hydraulic limitation hypothesis and cohesion tension theory koch et al 2004 niklas 2007 ryan and yoder 1997 in arid regions hydraulic limitation might limit the growth of tree height due to the trade offs among water availability height growth and water transportation distance thus causing a similar maximum water transportation distance within a specific species in a specific environment givnish 2017 klein et al 2015 under drought conditions plants tend to increase the length of underground roots to offset the stresses of water absorption and transportation thus resulting in a negative relationship between groundwater depth and maximum tree height the results of leave one out cross validation showed that the predicted groundwater depth had a significant correlation with its measured value at 73

6419,a decrease in soil water content swc has been observed at the global scale and has led to a reduction in evapotranspiration et however the trend in swc in eastern asia differed from the global trend and this may be due to the overlapping of warm wet seasons because of the limitation of deep soil water content data especially in drylands changes in swc and the correlation between swc particularly deep swc and et remain poorly understood in this study spatial distribution of correlation coefficient r between swc and et were calculated based on reanalysis data and remote sensing data which were validated by in situ data 2004 2005 and sampling data 2016 2017 firstly the correlation between swc and et decreased with soil depth the depth of the sharp decrease was 10 cm based on in situ monitoring data 2005 2008 and spatial sampling data 2016 2017 secondly the spatial correlation between swc and et varied with different vegetation cover types the correlation increased from the western typical steppe to the eastern forest the highest values of r were in a forest covered area because it had the highest water uptake capacity however the difference between r 10 and r 100 d r showed a different spatial pattern and the lowest negative d r value was obtained from a forest grass transition zone in which the enhanced vegetation index showed a significant increasing trend the significant negative regression determination coefficient r2 0 9 p 0 01 between b evi 0 0 1 and d r indicated that the narrowed d r in the transition zone was due to the vegetation increase this meant that more deep soil water was taken up into the atmosphere thus the deep swc could become unstable and deep soil could become drier which would be unsustainable for the ecosystem abbreviations swc soil water content et evapotranspiration t temperature p precipitation evi enhanced vegetation index agb above ground biomass av average b slope of change trend keywords soil water content swc vertical depth vegetation evapotranspiration et correlation 1 introduction water limited ecosystems drylands including arid semiarid and sub humid areas cover 40 of the land s surface worldwide in arid semiarid regions evapotranspiration et is the most important component of the hydrological cycle sun et al 2011 accounting for 95 of annual precipitation huxman et al 2005 evapotranspiration consists of two types of water vaporization zeng et al 2018 1 abiotic evaporation from open water rainfall interception and bare soil which is determined by water supply and 2 biotic transpiration through root uptake from the soil to the atmosphere via leaf stomata which is determined by combination of the water supply vegetation state and atmospheric demand changes in the rate of the abiotic process are attributed primarily to changes in water supply i e precipitation and soil moisture and atmospheric evaporative demand i e temperature radiation humidity and wind speed a et al 2018 the biotic process transpiration is controlled by the physiological properties of vegetation such as the leaf area index lai leaf mass density albedo surface roughness and rooting depth jung et al 2010 reported that limited soil water supply was the main reason for the decline in global land evapotranspiration on a short time scale 10 years in recent years 1998 2008 it has been forecasted that global scale climate change would lead to intensification of ecological droughts in drylands worldwide especially in the deep soil layer except for drylands in eastern asia the climate in this region would become wetter due to the overlap of warm wet seasons the soil wetting trend in the surface layer 10 cm in northern china has been monitored by remote sensing schlaepfer et al 2017 although it has been forecasted that deep soil under vegetation in eastern asia drylands would become wetter the actual trends of soil water content swc in the deep soil layer and its effects on ecohydrological processes are unclear because of the importance of northern china as a specific location and the paucity of studies it is urgent to know the characteristics of swc especially in the deep soil layer its responses to global climate change and its effects on et on a long time scale 1982 2013 30 years et showed a significant upward trend globally zhang et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 found that terrestrial et was dominated by transpiration while zhang et al 2015 reported that vegetation greening promoted multidecadal rises in global land et in the past 30 years vegetation greening of forests at high latitudes has been unequivocally observed zeng et al 2018 however grasslands in semi arid temperate climate zones which cover approximately 8 of the world s terrestrial land surface loveland et al 2000 have continuously degraded due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities liu and gong 2012 comparing two previous studies liu and gong 2012 schlaepfer et al 2017 there is the contradiction that increased swc will benefit vegetation but vegetation change is decreasing additionally dryland ecosystems are undergoing transitions from grassland dominance to tree dominance or vice versa briggs et al 2005 ripple and beschta 2012 sala and maestre 2014 such transitions can affect land cover distribution pattern ecosystem function and water use strategies knapp et al 2008 eldridge et al 2011 thus it is fundamental to understand the causes of such changes in vegetation vegetation responds to and influences on the water balance in ecosystems because of its capacity to access transport and transpire soil water in semi arid regions the most direct pathway of water transport is between root water uptake and et jian et al 2015 vegetation responses vary among plant functional types and depend on seasonal and soil depth dynamics of swc wang et al 2018a forests with deep roots are known to adapt their root patterns to the availability of deep soil water nepstad et al 1994 wan et al 2002 while grasses and shrubs have evolved strategies to cope with water shortages in the upper soil layers the interaction between swc and et via vegetation root uptake has been well modeled based on land surface models and ecohydrological models desborough 1997 milly 1997 kleidon and heimann 1998 zeng et al 1998 however such studies have often assumed that plants access water from all soil layers equally only measure to 20 cm soil depth feddes et al 2001 porporato et al 2001 or set the soil layers empirically which does not account for differences in root abundance among vertical soil layers under different vegetation cover types the overall aim of this study was to investigate changes in the interaction between vertical swc and et and how this relationship is affected by changes in vegetation against the background of climate change in this region the three specific objectives were as follows 1 to determine how vegetation and related environmental factors have changed in this specific region 2 to identify the relationship between vertical swc and et and the trends of changes in these factors and this relationship 3 to determine how vegetation and environmental factors affect the relationship between vertical swc and et 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in northeastern inner mongolia china 113

in microsoft excel 2011 table 2 3 results 3 1 significant increase in vegetation in forest grass transition zone the main vegetation types in the study area from west to east were typical grassland meadow steppe grassland forest transition and forest the average values of evi 2004 2017 p 2004 2015 and et 2004 2017 in the growing season increased from west to east respectively ranging from 0 01 to 0 42 from 214 to 604 mm year and from 138 to 659 mm year fig 3 the difference between p and et in the west area was positive while that in the east area was negative this means that the climate became wetter in the west and dryer in the east if ground water recharge was not taken into account in contrast to the distribution pattern of the above factors average t 2004 2015 decreased from west to east and ranged from 267 8 to 275 9 k because of the overlap of high t and low p water flux in the west must be limited by water supply the distribution pattern of swc was not consistent with that of evi p or t the highest swc was in the middle area in the forest grass transition zone most of the b evi values were greater than zero which meant the evi had increased over the latest 14 years in most areas the forest grass transition zone had the highest b evi values 0 05 0 18 the area with the largest decrease 36 b evi 0 36 was around the riparian zone the middle area of the steppe and eastern forest cover region showed a slight decrease in evi b evi 0 01 0 the slight decrease of eastern forest cover was due to the increase of swc from frozen soil melt the forest area is located in the southern badge of frozen soil region which was sensitive to temperature increase fig 4 with the temperature increase swc increase due to frozen soil melt result in the broken of water and energy balance for coniferous forest and lead to their decline or death because coniferous forest is tolerance for dry and cold condition other than wet and warm condition weng and zhou 2006 cheng and yan 2008 thus it is important to monitor the change of coniferous forest under climate change the et showed complex trends from 2004 to 2017 across the whole study area and varied among the different types of vegetation cover fig 4 however the area with largest decrease of et was the eastern forest with an average decline of 1 6 mm yr 1 from 2004 to 2017 b et 16 the pattern of increased swc was similar to the swc distribution pattern and the greatest increase in swc was in the forest grass transition zone so agriculture activities such as planting economic forest were suggested to be established in this region the activity not only used for the deep soil water but also declined the flood risk from frozen soil melt there was a trend of increasing p from 2004 to 2015 with the smallest increase in the west 4 1 mm year and the largest increase in the east 7 1 mm year the trends in t differed among different parts of the study area and t increased only at the eastern forest t tended to decrease in other areas and showed the greatest decrease in the middle area covered by the forest grass transition zone 3 2 spatiotemporal variations in relationship r between vertical swc and et correlation coefficient was used to detect the relationship between vertical swc and et as shown in fig 5 the effect of vertical swc on et were assessed based on a time series vertical swc data collected at 10 day intervals during the growing season may to october from the situ station during 2005 to 2008 and sampling data collected from 120 quadrats covering whole study area during 2016 and 2017 the et data were retrieved from modis data for the same period and the same location as the quadrats the correlation between swc and et decreased with depth and the sharp change point appeared at the 10 cm depth as shown in fig 5 all the correlation coefficients r were positive and decreased with depth the values of r in the top two layers 0 5 cm 5 10 cm reached statistical significance indicating that swc in the top two layers 0 5 5 10 cm significantly affected et in general correlations were strongest for the top layers because these layers are the most active in terms of biological and non biological activities there was a sudden increase in r in the deep layer 90 110 cm this could be the water uptake by deep roots because the biomass of deep roots was found to be greater at 70 100 cm depth than at 50 70 cm depth li et al 2016 the spatial stability of the relationship between vertical swc and et was analyzed based on field data which collected in august 2016 and august 2017 and covered the whole study area the profile of r values in the spatial analysis were consistent with those in the temporal analysis and decreased with depth the absolute values of r at specific depths 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm were similar however the absolute value of r in the bottom layer 80 cm showed a negative relationship this was due to the huge difference in swc between the top and bottom layers the profiles of r with depth indicated that a relationship between swc and et actually existed and significantly differed with depth the spatiotemporal pattern of the interaction between swc and et was analyzed based on the mean values of reanalyzed swc and et during 2004 to 2017 fig 6 from the temporal perspective the coefficient of determination r2 of swc to et varied except in 2013 and 2017 r2 decreased with time r2 was relatively higher before 2010 than after 2010 however r2 of surface layer in 2013 and deep layer in 2017 was much higher than in other years after 2010 in 2013 the determination of swc to et was greater in the surface layer r2 66 than in the deep layer r2 1 as opposite to 2013 the determination of swc to et in 2017 was lower in the surface layer r2 3 than in the deep layer r2 39 from the spatial perspective there were similar distribution patterns of r in the surface layer and deep layer and r values gradually increased from west to east ranging from 0 14 to 0 94 the areas with high r values were covered by forest this is because forests have the highest capacity for transpiration which is the main component of et the difference of r between the surface layer and deep layer d r indicated that swc controlled et to different degrees in the surface layer and deep layer fig 7 the distribution pattern of d r differed from which of r ignoring the uncertainties the pixels with positive d r values were mainly distributed in the western area around hulun lake this indicated that swc in the surface layer more strongly affected et than did swc in the deep layer the pixels with negative d r values accounting for 46 of total pixels were mainly distributed in the eastern area covered by forests interestingly the highest negative d r value was recorded in the forest grass transition zone rather than the forest zone generally forest has the highest capacity to uptake deep soil water for transpiration thus we calculated and plotted the distribution and trends of evi t p against r and d r at each pixel to detect their controlling factors 3 3 factors controlling distribution of r and d r the interaction between swc and et is determined by soil water supply atmospheric evaporative demand and the physiological properties of vegetation huang et al 2017 which are often represented by p t and evi respectively the averaged values of p t evi and the change slope b of p t evi at each pixel were extracted from grid files and plotted figs 8 and 9 the factors controlling r and d r and the extent of their control could be detected from these figures as shown in fig 8 both r 10 and r 100 correlation coefficients between swc and et in 10 cm soil layer and 100 cm layer respectively were positively related to evi av evi and annual average precipitation rate av p and negatively related to air temperature av t however the change slope of evi b evi and t b t showed no obvious effect on r 10 and r 100 this means the correlation between swc and et was determined by combination effect of evi p and t which is not sensitive to change of evi and t for p in the western area where water was a limitation factor for et and with slight increasing trend the increase of p stimulated the correlation of r while in the eastern area where water was relatively rich the big increase of p declined the correlation of r this is because the coniferous forest un tolerance for wet and warm condition the increase of p would lead to the disorder of water balance for coniferous forest and result in the death or decline of forest which reacting on the decrease of the correlation of r as shown in fig 9 the difference between r 10 and r 100 d r showed a non linear relationship with av evi av p and av t however vegetation change slope b evi and d r showed an obvious liner relationship in addition the obvious relationship started on the positive increase point b evi 0 the largest increase slope distributed in the forest grass transition zone where the vegetation development was under a transit process from shallow root to deep root the correlation coefficients of linear fit among r and their controlling factors are shown in table 3 from the perspective of correlation coefficients av t r 0 962 p 0 01 affected r 10 and r 100 more strongly than did av evi r 0 949 p 0 01 and av p r 0 945 p 0 01 however d r was most sensitive to vegetation change 4 discussions 4 1 uncertainties analysis the largest uncertainty in estimating the relationship between swc and et was derived from the large uncertainties of reanalysis data for vertical swc which affected the absolute values and magnitude of r for example the average r of swc et in surface layer 0 10 cm based on monitored data r 0 495 fig 3 was higher than that based on the reanalysis data r 0 436 in contrast the average r of swc et in the deep layer 10 cm based on site monitored data r 0 214 fig 3 was lower than that based on reanalysis data r 0 434 thus the difference in r d r between the surface layer and the deep layer was narrower when calculated from reanalysis data than when calculated from monitoring data fortunately the temporal and spatial trends in swc were the same in the monitoring data and the reanalysis data consequently the trends in the change of the spatial and temporal relationships r between swc and et were reasonable and believable even though the absolute values were not exactly accurate the collection of direct and serial measurements of swc can reduce the uncertainties in vertical swc data however such analyses are costly and unpractical especially for vertical deep swc the combination of remote sensing and process based land surface models can be a valuable approach for vertical deep swc estimation with lower uncertainties at the regional scale the other large uncertainty was from et in this study the uncertainties derived from monitored et based on the eddy covariance flux tower were not considered although they are commonly used as a benchmark to validate satellite based corresponding products natural vegetation often is less homogeneous than man made vegetation both vertically and horizontally so the vegetation characteristics at a flux site may not be representative of the vegetation of interest especially for a large region additionally the limited coverage area of the flux situ observation 100 m 100 m mismatched with the satellite based pixels 500 m 500 m or 1000 m 1000 m these factors resulted in uncertainties in the validation of satellite based products to a certain extent thirdly the scale mismatching of different source data may have introduced uncertainties into pixel scale based calculations due to different spatial and temporal resolutions of swc 2 2 daily et 500 m 500 m 8 days and p 2 2 3 h t 2 2 3 h and evi 500 m 500 m 16 days in this study we validated and adjusted the different sources data using site observed data all the spatial data were resampled and calculated with the same cell size as that of evi based on the nearest neighbor interpolation even though there were other uncertainties among evi precipitation and temperature together they make up a common and proven dataset that has been used for many other studies thus the uncertainties of these data were ignored 4 2 cooperative control of r under climate change other studies have focused on climate change vegetation greening and human activities all of which are factors that control changes in swc or et and affect their relationship teuling et al 2006 jin et al 2017 fang et al 2018 wang et al 2018b zeng et al 2018 climate change and anthropogenic disturbance have been shown to be responsible for temporal and spatial changes in et mao et al 2015 lehnert et al 2016 reported that climate variability rather than overstocking caused recent large scale vegetation cover changes in tibetan pastures jin et al 2017 suggested that the variations in annual et over the loess plateau were mainly attributed to vegetation changes rather than climate however the response of swc to et can differ due to the combination of variations in precipitation and et increasing et did not significantly increase soil water content in a wet and forest covered region where the increasing et was attributed to increased precipitation zeng et al 2018 concluded that in most non forested usually relatively dry regions such as the sahel western asia northern india the western united states and the mediterranean coast the pattern of precipitation was not identical to the pattern of the greening induced increased et they concluded that greening and the associated increasing et significantly decreased soil moisture and this led to moisture limitation that eventually halted greening induced intensification in the water cycle however few studies have focused on the relationship between vertical swc and et swc et and its variability and controlling factors in this study evi and precipitation were positively related to r both for the surface layer and the deep layer while temperature was negatively related to r firstly et is dominated by vegetation transpiration jasechko et al 2013 generally transpiration ability is positively related to evi and so evi must be positively related to r secondly the study area was a water limited ecosystem han et al 2018 water supply is the foundation for et and the ecosystem sun et al 2016 thus precipitation is also positively related to r vegetation and climate have complex and interactive effects on terrestrial et zhang et al 2015 consequently it is impossible to completely distinguish the effects of vegetation and climate change on et and induced variations in r because vegetation is also a response of the terrestrial ecosystem to climate change 4 3 vegetation driven decrease of d r and its ecological effects in this study d r represents the difference in the swc et correlation between the surface layer and the deep layer generally d r was positive because both evaporation and transpiration mainly occurred in the surface layer 10 cm which contained abundant vegetation roots zhang et al 2016 geris et al 2017 liu et al 2018 however there were about 46 pixels showing negative values that were mainly distributed in the forest grass transition zone this means that the effect of deep soil water on et was increased in this area to elucidate the factors affecting the change in d r we calculated and plotted the temporal trends in evi b evi precipitation b p and temperature b t with d r at each pixel only vegetation change showed a significant negative relationship with d r this result indicated that increase of vegetation increased the determination of deep swc to et and decreased the determination of surface swc to et vegetation increase meant an increase in root systems which led to an increased capability to take up and consume deep swc the vegetation increase mainly occurred in the forest grass transition zone and was due to shift from grassland cover to forest cover this shift to a vegetation type with a deep root system would result in increased consumption of deep soil water compared with that of native grasses in addition to increased deep swc consumption increased canopy and surface coverage systems can intercept more precipitation and directly return it to the atmosphere metzger et al 2017 on the other hand the increase in vegetation can lead to greater litter cover which reduces evaporation from surface soil fang et al 2016 firstly according to a previous study acharya et al 2017 deep swc is relatively stable it serves as a water sink and is seldom influenced by rainfall events however the variations in deep swc and the extent of its determination to et have intensified during the past 14 years which could induce shift in vegetation types over a short period increased water availability at depth would be expected with more cold season precipitation favoring woody and deep rooted species in the long term the increasing consumption of deep soil water by increasing vegetation could lead to more droughts in the deep soil layer water scarcity in deep soils is relevant for ecosystem functioning because soil moisture at depth is an important resource for deep rooted woody species during droughts this indicates for instance that the expected increased abundance of woody plants could be followed by an abundance of shrubs secondly the increase of swc could lead to death or decline of coniferous forest because it broke the water balances at coniferous forest cover region thirdly there was a significant increase of swc in forest grass transition zone which has stimulated the increase of natural vegetation so agriculture development such as planting economic forest could be established in this region the activity not only used up the deep soil water but also declined the flood risk from frozen soil melt 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the characteristics and changes in vertical swc and determined its effects on et in drylands correlation coefficients r were used to assess the correlation between vertical swc and et we explored the relationship between swc and et in both the surface layer r 10 and the deep layer r 100 the spatial pattern of difference d r between r 10 and r 100 and their controlling factors based on reanalyzed data and remote sensing data from 2004 to 2017 the correlation between swc and et decreased with depth and the the sharp decrease was at 10 cm depth the spatial distribution of correlation coefficient r between swc and et varied among different types of vegetation cover the distribution of r increased from the western typical steppe to the eastern forest forest covered areas had higher r values because they had the highest water uptake capacity however the difference between r 10 and r 100 d r showed a different spatial pattern and the lowest negative values of d r were in the forest grass transition zone where evi change slope was highest b evi 0 06 0 18 and reaching significant level p 0 05 the negative relationship between b evi and d r from 0 to 0 1 also indicated that the narrowed difference in r between the surface layer and deep layer was due to the vegetation increase the increase in deeper rooted vegetation resulted in deep swc being taken up into the atmosphere via transpiration thus the deep swc could become unstable and deep soil could become drier which is unsustainable for the ecosystem declaration of interest none

6419,a decrease in soil water content swc has been observed at the global scale and has led to a reduction in evapotranspiration et however the trend in swc in eastern asia differed from the global trend and this may be due to the overlapping of warm wet seasons because of the limitation of deep soil water content data especially in drylands changes in swc and the correlation between swc particularly deep swc and et remain poorly understood in this study spatial distribution of correlation coefficient r between swc and et were calculated based on reanalysis data and remote sensing data which were validated by in situ data 2004 2005 and sampling data 2016 2017 firstly the correlation between swc and et decreased with soil depth the depth of the sharp decrease was 10 cm based on in situ monitoring data 2005 2008 and spatial sampling data 2016 2017 secondly the spatial correlation between swc and et varied with different vegetation cover types the correlation increased from the western typical steppe to the eastern forest the highest values of r were in a forest covered area because it had the highest water uptake capacity however the difference between r 10 and r 100 d r showed a different spatial pattern and the lowest negative d r value was obtained from a forest grass transition zone in which the enhanced vegetation index showed a significant increasing trend the significant negative regression determination coefficient r2 0 9 p 0 01 between b evi 0 0 1 and d r indicated that the narrowed d r in the transition zone was due to the vegetation increase this meant that more deep soil water was taken up into the atmosphere thus the deep swc could become unstable and deep soil could become drier which would be unsustainable for the ecosystem abbreviations swc

arid semiarid regions evapotranspiration et is the most important component of the hydrological cycle sun et al 2011 accounting for 95 of annual precipitation huxman et al 2005 evapotranspiration consists of two types of water vaporization zeng et al 2018 1 abiotic evaporation from open water rainfall interception and bare soil which is determined by water supply and 2 biotic transpiration through root uptake from the soil to the atmosphere via leaf stomata which is determined by combination of the water supply vegetation state and atmospheric demand changes in the rate of the abiotic process are attributed primarily to changes in water supply i e precipitation and soil moisture and atmospheric evaporative demand i e temperature radiation humidity and wind speed a et al 2018 the biotic process transpiration is controlled by the physiological properties of vegetation such as the leaf area index lai leaf mass density albedo surface roughness and rooting depth jung et al 2010 reported that limited soil water supply was the main reason for the decline in global land evapotranspiration on a short time scale 10 years in recent years 1998 2008 it has been forecasted that global scale climate change would lead to intensification of ecological droughts in drylands worldwide especially in the deep soil layer except for drylands in eastern asia the climate in this region would become wetter due to the overlap of warm wet seasons the soil wetting trend in the surface layer 10 cm in northern china has been monitored by remote sensing schlaepfer et al 2017 although it has been forecasted that deep soil under vegetation in eastern asia drylands would become wetter the actual trends of soil water content swc in the deep soil layer and its effects on ecohydrological processes are unclear because of the importance of northern china as a specific location and the paucity of studies it is urgent to know the characteristics of swc especially in the deep soil layer its responses to global climate change and its effects on et on a long time scale 1982 2013 30 years et showed a significant upward trend globally zhang et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 found that terrestrial et was dominated by transpiration while zhang et al 2015 reported that vegetation greening promoted multidecadal rises in global land et in the past 30 years vegetation greening of forests at high latitudes has been unequivocally observed zeng et al 2018 however grasslands in semi arid temperate climate zones which cover approximately 8 of the world s terrestrial land surface loveland et al 2000 have continuously degraded due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities liu and gong 2012 comparing two previous studies liu and gong 2012 schlaepfer et al 2017 there is the contradiction that increased swc will benefit vegetation but vegetation change is decreasing additionally dryland ecosystems are undergoing transitions from grassland dominance to tree dominance or vice versa briggs et al 2005 ripple and beschta 2012 sala and maestre 2014 such transitions can affect land cover distribution pattern ecosystem function and water use strategies knapp et al 2008 eldridge et al 2011 thus it is fundamental to understand the causes of such changes in vegetation vegetation responds to and influences on the water balance in ecosystems because of its capacity to access transport and transpire soil water in semi arid regions the most direct pathway of water transport is between root water uptake and et jian et al 2015 vegetation responses vary among plant functional types and depend on seasonal and soil depth dynamics of swc wang et al 2018a forests with deep roots are known to adapt their root patterns to the availability of deep soil water nepstad et al 1994 wan et al 2002 while grasses and shrubs have evolved strategies to cope with water shortages in the upper soil layers the interaction between swc and et via vegetation root uptake has been well modeled based on land surface models and ecohydrological models desborough 1997 milly 1997 kleidon and heimann 1998 zeng et al 1998 however such studies have often assumed that plants access water from all soil layers equally only measure to 20 cm soil depth feddes et al 2001 porporato et al 2001 or set the soil layers empirically which does not account for differences in root abundance among vertical soil layers under different vegetation cover types the overall aim of this study was to investigate changes in the interaction between vertical swc and et and how this relationship is affected by changes in vegetation against the background of climate change in this region the three specific objectives were as follows 1 to determine how vegetation and related environmental factors have changed in this specific region 2 to identify the relationship between vertical swc and et and the trends of changes in these factors and this relationship 3 to determine how vegetation and environmental factors affect the relationship between vertical swc and et 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in northeastern inner mongolia china 113

monitoring data field sampling survey data remote sensing data and global reanalysis data the variables and their sources were shown in table 1 2 2 1 field sampling data field surveys were conducted to measure aboveground biomass agb of vegetation and swc at various vertical depths in 120 quadrats 1 m 1 m in august in both 2016 and 2017 in the study area the sampling quadrats were distributed at

in microsoft excel 2011 table 2 3 results 3 1 significant increase in vegetation in forest grass transition zone the main vegetation types in the study area from west to east were typical grassland meadow steppe grassland forest transition and forest the average values of evi 2004 2017 p 2004 2015 and et 2004 2017 in the growing season increased from west to east respectively ranging from 0 01 to 0 42 from 214 to 604 mm year and from 138 to 659 mm year fig 3 the difference between p and et in the west area was positive while that in the east area was negative this means that the climate became wetter in the west and dryer in the east if ground water recharge was not taken into account in contrast to the distribution pattern of the above factors average t 2004 2015 decreased from west to east and ranged from 267 8 to 275 9 k because of the overlap of high t and low p water flux in the west must be limited by water supply the distribution pattern of swc was not consistent with that of evi p or t the highest swc was in the middle area in the forest grass transition zone most of the b evi values were greater than zero which meant the evi had increased over the latest 14 years in most areas the forest grass transition zone had the highest b evi values 0 05 0 18 the area with the largest decrease 36 b evi 0 36 was around the riparian zone the middle area of the steppe and eastern forest cover region showed a slight decrease in evi b evi 0 01 0 the slight decrease of eastern forest cover was due to the increase of swc from frozen soil melt the forest area is located in the southern badge of frozen soil region which was sensitive to temperature increase fig 4 with the temperature increase swc increase due to frozen soil melt result in the broken of water and energy balance for coniferous forest and lead to their decline or death because coniferous forest is tolerance for dry and cold condition other than wet and warm condition weng and zhou 2006 cheng and yan 2008 thus it is important to monitor the change of coniferous forest under climate change the et showed complex trends from 2004 to 2017 across the whole study area and varied among the different types of vegetation cover fig 4 however the area with largest decrease of et was the eastern forest with an average decline of 1 6 mm yr 1 from 2004 to 2017 b et 16 the pattern of increased swc was similar to the swc distribution pattern and the greatest increase in swc was in the forest grass transition zone so agriculture activities such as planting economic forest were suggested to be established in this region the activity not only used for the deep soil water but also declined the flood risk from frozen soil melt there was a trend of increasing p from 2004 to 2015 with the smallest increase in the west 4 1 mm year and the largest increase in the east 7 1 mm year the trends in t differed among different parts of the study area and t increased only at the eastern forest t tended to decrease in other areas and showed the greatest decrease in the middle area covered by the forest grass transition zone 3 2 spatiotemporal variations in relationship r between vertical swc and et correlation coefficient was used to detect the relationship between vertical swc and et as shown in fig 5 the effect of vertical swc on et were assessed based on a time series vertical swc data collected at 10 day intervals during the growing season may to october from the situ station during 2005 to 2008 and sampling data collected from 120 quadrats covering whole study area during 2016 and 2017 the et data were retrieved from modis data for the same period and the same location as the quadrats the correlation between swc and et decreased with depth and the sharp change point appeared at the 10 cm depth as shown in fig 5 all the correlation coefficients r were positive and decreased with depth the values of r in the top two layers 0 5 cm 5 10 cm reached statistical significance indicating that swc in the top two layers 0 5 5 10 cm significantly affected et in general correlations were strongest for the top layers because these layers are the most active in terms of biological and non biological activities there was a sudden increase in r in the deep layer 90 110 cm this could be the water uptake by deep roots because the biomass of deep roots was found to be greater at 70 100 cm depth than at 50 70 cm depth li et al 2016 the spatial stability of the relationship between vertical swc and et was analyzed based on field data which collected in august 2016 and august 2017 and covered the whole study area the profile of r values in the spatial analysis were consistent with those in the temporal analysis and decreased with depth the absolute values of r at specific depths 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm were similar however the absolute value of r in the bottom layer 80 cm showed a negative relationship this was due to the huge difference in swc between the top and bottom layers the profiles of r with depth indicated that a relationship between swc and et actually existed and significantly differed with depth the spatiotemporal pattern of the interaction between swc and et was analyzed based on the mean values of reanalyzed swc and et during 2004 to 2017 fig 6 from the temporal perspective the coefficient of determination r2 of swc to et varied except in 2013 and 2017 r2 decreased with time r2 was relatively higher before 2010 than after 2010 however r2 of surface layer in 2013 and deep layer in 2017 was much higher than in other years after 2010 in 2013 the determination of swc to et was greater in the surface layer r2 66 than in the deep layer r2 1 as opposite to 2013 the determination of swc to et in 2017 was lower in the surface layer r2 3 than in the deep layer r2 39 from the spatial perspective there were similar distribution patterns of r in the surface layer and deep layer and r values gradually increased from west to east ranging from 0 14 to 0 94 the areas with high r values were covered by forest this is because forests have the highest capacity for transpiration which is the main component of et the difference of r between the surface layer and deep layer d r indicated that swc controlled et to different degrees in the surface layer and deep layer fig 7 the distribution pattern of d r differed from which of r ignoring the uncertainties the pixels with positive d r values were mainly distributed in the western area around hulun lake this indicated that swc in the surface layer more strongly affected et than did swc in the deep layer the pixels with negative d r values accounting for 46 of total pixels were mainly distributed in the eastern area covered by forests interestingly the highest negative d r value was recorded in the forest grass transition zone rather than the forest zone generally forest has the highest capacity to uptake deep soil water for transpiration thus we calculated and plotted the distribution and trends of evi t p against r and d r at each pixel to detect their controlling factors 3 3 factors controlling distribution of r and d r the interaction between swc and et is determined by soil water supply atmospheric evaporative demand and the physiological properties of vegetation huang et al 2017 which are often represented by p t and evi respectively the averaged values of p t evi and the change slope b of p t evi at each pixel were extracted from grid files and plotted figs 8 and 9 the factors controlling r and d r and the extent of their control could be detected from these figures as shown in fig 8 both r 10 and r 100 correlation coefficients between swc and et in 10 cm soil layer and 100 cm layer respectively were positively related to evi av evi and annual average precipitation rate av p and negatively related to air temperature av t however the change slope of evi b evi and t b t showed no obvious effect on r 10 and r 100 this means the correlation between swc and et was determined by combination effect of evi p and t which is not sensitive to change of evi and t for p in the western area where water was a limitation factor for et and with slight increasing trend the increase of p stimulated the correlation of r while in the eastern area where water was relatively rich the big increase of p declined the correlation of r this is because the coniferous forest un tolerance for wet and warm condition the increase of p would lead to the disorder of water balance for coniferous forest and result in the death or decline of forest which reacting on the decrease of the correlation of r as shown in fig 9 the difference between r 10 and r 100 d r showed a non linear relationship with av evi av p and av t however vegetation change slope b evi and d r showed an obvious liner relationship in addition the obvious relationship started on the positive increase point b evi 0 the largest increase slope distributed in the forest grass transition zone where the vegetation development was under a transit process from shallow root to deep root the correlation coefficients of linear fit among r and their controlling factors are shown in table 3 from the perspective of correlation coefficients av t r 0 962 p 0 01 affected r 10 and r 100 more strongly than did av evi r 0 949 p 0 01 and av p r 0 945 p 0 01 however d r was most sensitive to vegetation change 4 discussions 4 1 uncertainties analysis the largest uncertainty in estimating the relationship between swc and et was derived from the large uncertainties of reanalysis data for vertical swc which affected the absolute values and magnitude of r for example the average r of swc et in surface layer 0 10 cm based on monitored data r 0 495 fig 3 was higher than that based on the reanalysis data r 0 436 in contrast the average r of swc et in the deep layer 10 cm based on site monitored data r 0 214 fig 3 was lower than that based on reanalysis data r 0 434 thus the difference in r d r between the surface layer and the deep layer was narrower when calculated from reanalysis data than when calculated from monitoring data fortunately the temporal and spatial trends in swc were the same in the monitoring data and the reanalysis data consequently the trends in the change of the spatial and temporal relationships r between swc and et were reasonable and believable even though the absolute values were not exactly accurate the collection of direct and serial measurements of swc can reduce the uncertainties in vertical swc data however such analyses are costly and unpractical especially for vertical deep swc the combination of remote sensing and process based land surface models can be a valuable approach for vertical deep swc estimation with lower uncertainties at the regional scale the other large uncertainty was from et in this study the uncertainties derived from monitored et based on the eddy covariance flux tower were not considered although they are commonly used as a benchmark to validate satellite based corresponding products natural vegetation often is less homogeneous than man made vegetation both vertically and horizontally so the vegetation characteristics at a flux site may not be representative of the vegetation of interest especially for a large region additionally the limited coverage area of the flux situ observation 100 m 100 m mismatched with the satellite based pixels 500 m 500 m or 1000 m 1000 m these factors resulted in uncertainties in the validation of satellite based products to a certain extent thirdly the scale mismatching of different source data may have introduced uncertainties into pixel scale based calculations due to different spatial and temporal resolutions of swc 2 2 daily et 500 m 500 m 8 days and p 2 2 3 h t 2 2 3 h and evi 500 m 500 m 16 days in this study we validated and adjusted the different sources data using site observed data all the spatial data were resampled and calculated with the same cell size as that of evi based on the nearest neighbor interpolation even though there were other uncertainties among evi precipitation and temperature together they make up a common and proven dataset that has been used for many other studies thus the uncertainties of these data were ignored 4 2 cooperative control of r under climate change other studies have focused on climate change vegetation greening and human activities all of which are factors that control changes in swc or et and affect their relationship teuling et al 2006 jin et al 2017 fang et al 2018 wang et al 2018b zeng et al 2018 climate change and anthropogenic disturbance have been shown to be responsible for temporal and spatial changes in et mao et al 2015 lehnert et al 2016 reported that climate variability rather than overstocking caused recent large scale vegetation cover changes in tibetan pastures jin et al 2017 suggested that the variations in annual et over the loess plateau were mainly attributed to vegetation changes rather than climate however the response of swc to et can differ due to the combination of variations in precipitation and et increasing et did not significantly increase soil water content in a wet and forest covered region where the increasing et was attributed to increased precipitation zeng et al 2018 concluded that in most non forested usually relatively dry regions such as the sahel western asia northern india the western united states and the mediterranean coast the pattern of precipitation was not identical to the pattern of the greening induced increased et they concluded that greening and the associated increasing et significantly decreased soil moisture and this led to moisture limitation that eventually halted greening induced intensification in the water cycle however few studies have focused on the relationship between vertical swc and et swc et and its variability and controlling factors in this study evi and precipitation were positively related to r both for the surface layer and the deep layer while temperature was negatively related to r firstly et is dominated by vegetation transpiration jasechko et al 2013 generally transpiration ability is positively related to evi and so evi must be positively related to r secondly the study area was a water limited ecosystem han et al 2018 water supply is the foundation for et and the ecosystem sun et al 2016 thus precipitation is also positively related to r vegetation and climate have complex and interactive effects on terrestrial et zhang et al 2015 consequently it is impossible to completely distinguish the effects of vegetation and climate change on et and induced variations in r because vegetation is also a response of the terrestrial ecosystem to climate change 4 3 vegetation driven decrease of d r and its ecological effects in this study d r represents the difference in the swc et correlation between the surface layer and the deep layer generally d r was positive because both evaporation and transpiration mainly occurred in the surface layer 10 cm which contained abundant vegetation roots zhang et al 2016 geris et al 2017 liu et al 2018 however there were about 46 pixels showing negative values that were mainly distributed in the forest grass transition zone this means that the effect of deep soil water on et was increased in this area to elucidate the factors affecting the change in d r we calculated and plotted the temporal trends in evi b evi precipitation b p and temperature b t with d r at each pixel only vegetation change showed a significant negative relationship with d r this result indicated that increase of vegetation increased the determination of deep swc to et and decreased the determination of surface swc to et vegetation increase meant an increase in root systems which led to an increased capability to take up and consume deep swc the vegetation increase mainly occurred in the forest grass transition zone and was due to shift from grassland cover to forest cover this shift to a vegetation type with a deep root system would result in increased consumption of deep soil water compared with that of native grasses in addition to increased deep swc consumption increased canopy and surface coverage systems can intercept more precipitation and directly return it to the atmosphere metzger et al 2017 on the other hand the increase in vegetation can lead to greater litter cover which reduces evaporation from surface soil fang et al 2016 firstly according to a previous study acharya et al 2017 deep swc is relatively stable it serves as a water sink and is seldom influenced by rainfall events however the variations in deep swc and the extent of its determination to et have intensified during the past 14 years which could induce shift in vegetation types over a short period increased water availability at depth would be expected with more cold season precipitation favoring woody and deep rooted species in the long term the increasing consumption of deep soil water by increasing vegetation could lead to more droughts in the deep soil layer water scarcity in deep soils is relevant for ecosystem functioning because soil moisture at depth is an important resource for deep rooted woody species during droughts this indicates for instance that the expected increased abundance of woody plants could be followed by an abundance of shrubs secondly the increase of swc could lead to death or decline of coniferous forest because it broke the water balances at coniferous forest cover region thirdly there was a significant increase of swc in forest grass transition zone which has stimulated the increase of natural vegetation so agriculture development such as planting economic forest could be established in this region the activity not only used up the deep soil water but also declined the flood risk from frozen soil melt 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the characteristics and changes in vertical swc and determined its effects on et in drylands correlation coefficients r were used to assess the correlation between vertical swc and et we explored the relationship between swc and et in both the surface layer r 10 and the deep layer r 100 the spatial pattern of difference d r between r 10 and r 100 and their controlling factors based on reanalyzed data and remote sensing data from 2004 to 2017 the correlation between swc and et decreased with depth and the the sharp decrease was at 10 cm depth the spatial distribution of correlation coefficient r between swc and et varied among different types of vegetation cover the distribution of r increased from the western typical steppe to the eastern forest forest covered areas had higher r values because they had the highest water uptake capacity however the difference between r 10 and r 100 d r showed a different spatial pattern and the lowest negative values of d r were in the forest grass transition zone where evi change slope was highest b evi 0 06 0 18 and reaching significant level p 0 05 the negative relationship between b evi and d r from 0 to 0 1 also indicated that the narrowed difference in r between the surface layer and deep layer was due to the vegetation increase the increase in deeper rooted vegetation resulted in deep swc being taken up into the atmosphere via transpiration thus the deep swc could become unstable and deep soil could become drier which is unsustainable for the ecosystem declaration of interest none
