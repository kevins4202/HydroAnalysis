application of anammox process still faces obstacles such as long cell doubling time poor retention of biomass environmental sensitivity and contaminant inhibition recently biochar as a novel carrier with high specific surface area abundant functional groups and environmental friendliness has received cumulatively attention for promoting anammox process the current review compiles the preparation methods of biochar with pros and cons for biochar anammox system previous studies are systematically reviewed to clarify the role of biochar in facilitating anammox process in terms of shorting start up time improving nitrogen removal performance and alleviating contaminants inhibition the possible mechanisms are also comprehensively summarized and discussed including providing a habitat for microorganisms stimulating extracellular polymeric substances secretion facilitating extracellular electron transfer and promoting functional genes expression additionally this review proposed several promising strategies for standardization harmlessness and stabilization of biochar to help overcome the engineering challenges in application future research effort should include biochar modification and the development of composite carriers graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anammox biochar carrier extracellular electron transfer functional genes expression data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen pollution in water bodies is a global environmental concern which deteriorates water quality and endangers human health 1 in the past decades anammox as a promising nitrogen removal technology has attracted extensive attention for its remarkable low carbon characteristics 2 anaerobic ammonia oxidation bacteria anaob can directly oxidize ammonium to nitrogen gas using nitrite as an electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions eq 1 3 the catabolic process of anammox eq 2 can be explained by a set of three step

plants wwtps anammox can remarkably reduce oxygen and organic carbon demands by up to 60 and 100 respectively with a significant reduction in surplus sludge production 6 partial nitrification anammox pn a systems reduce costs and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 0 303 m3 and 1 72 kg equiv co2 m3 respectively 7 anammox has been widely used in treating wastewater with high ammonium and low c n ratio such as landfill leachate and sludge digestion liquid 8 9 as in 2014 there are over 100 full scale pn a installations in operation worldwide 75 of which are sidestream treatment of municipal wastewater 10 although previous studies have reported the potential of mainstream anammox treatment for municipal wastewater the application in full scale wwtps is still limited due to bottlenecks associated with long cell doubling time poor retention of biomass environmental sensitivity and contaminant inhibition 11 12 to achieve this goal numerous attempts including selecting suitable reactors such as up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb membrane bioreactor mbr and sequencing batch reactor sbr 13 14 adding exogenous additives such as specific metal ions e g fe2 mn2 zn2 and cu2 15 16 and intermediate hydrazine n2h4 17 have been made to shorten its start up time stabilize the nitrogen removal process and relieve inhibition however considering the cost and practical convenience adding carriers that provide attachment sites for anaob seems to be the superior method to improve anammox process 18 furthermore ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaob can grow harmonically on the carrier surface making one stage pn a feasible which is significant for mainstream anammox applications 19 various types of carriers have previously been investigated in wastewater treatment table 1 biochar seems to be a promising carrier because of the microporous structure and abundant surface functional groups 20 although plastic and sponge carriers have been practically available at wwtps due to low cost and long service life they are far less effective for promoting biological process than biochar 21 nonwoven fabric carriers have a small hollow area and are prone to blockage which limits the long term operation 22 gel carriers can significantly accelerate anammox acclimation and enhance the biomass retention but they are considered to have lower mechanical strength 23 compared with mineral carriers biochar exhibits better suitable environments for microbial attachment and growth 24 in addition despite similar structure and properties biochar has easy and inexpensive availability than other carbon materials e g activated carbon and graphene oxide 30 31 meanwhile biochar has drawbacks as well it tends to adsorb and migrate pollutants such as heavy metals and antibiotics while the polymer inert organic carriers mentioned above do not 27 biochar is a carbon rich product formed via thermochemical conversion of biomass under limited oxygen or anaerobic conditions 32 the easy availability of raw materials low production costs and environmental friendliness have made biochar a sustainable material 33 due to its large specific surface area and rich pore structure biochar is widely used to remove heavy metals organic pollutants and nutrients from wastewater 34 biochar is considered as an efficient biological carrier which can provide a habitat for microorganisms 35 compared with conventional carriers biochar has abundant oxygen containing functional groups which can participate in microbial metabolic reactions 36 for instance biochar can act as an electron shuttle to facilitate extracellular electron transfer eet during anaerobic digestion 37 in recent years an increasing number of studies have used biochar to enhance anammox process not only the anammox biochar amendment system meets the need for sustainable development but also has broad application potential 38 biochar has been mentioned in several previous reviews about the role of carrier in anammox process 21 39 40 however to our best knowledge there is no systematic review concerning the effects and mechanisms of biochar promoting anammox process this review evaluates the performance of biochar under various feedstocks and production conditions for enhancing anammox process and outlines the potential mechanisms from diverse aspects in addition this work would analyze practical deficiencies and propose new directions which aim at guiding the development and application of anammox enhancement by employing biochar 2 biochar as a cost effective carbon carrier biochar is a novel carbon carrier which has similar physical and chemical properties to other carbon materials such as activated carbon and reduced graphene oxide 41 42 biochar may act as a precursor matter to produce activated carbon by activation processes 43 however compared to activated carbon biochar has significant potential benefits in water treatment operations due to its environmental and economic benefits 44 the biochar production is less energy intensive reducing the cost from 1500 ton activated carbon to 245 ton biochar 45 biochar has negative greenhouse gas ghg emissions of 0 9 kg co2eq kg due to its carbon sequestration capacity while activated carbon is higher on ghg emissions of 6 6 kg co2eq kg 46 accordingly biochar is proposed to replace other carbon materials to achieve a more sustainable and low carbon economy 47 when used to stabilize the anammox process biochar is usually generated from slow pyrolysis of woody and herbaceous biomass the biomass was usually pyrolyzed at a temperature of 300 400 c and time ranging from 120 to 150 min fig 1 the feedstocks for biochar production are widely available and classified into three major categories 1 woody and herbaceous biomass 2 animal and human waste 3 biosolids sludge 48 biochar produced by woody and herbaceous biomass e g wood crop and bamboo has a large specific surface area strong ion exchangeability and rich surface functional groups which are mainly used in adsorption and redox reactions 49 for example woody biochar is rich in the functional groups such as benzene ring cooh and ch3 which can adsorb naphthalene c10h8 thus remove the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 50 animal and human waste biochar has higher ash content a large amount of nitrogen phosphorus potassium and other trace elements and is mainly used as fertilizer to improve soil by neutralizing ph enhancing microbial activity and providing nutrients for crop growth 51 sludge biochar can be used as a supplementary cementitious material for cement composite with higher heat release and compressive strength 52 however sludge biochar often comprises toxic constituents such as heavy metals and antibiotics posing negative effects on the biological process including anammox 53 the most common and traditional method of production is slow pyrolysis with a higher biochar yield and better homogeneity 54 the specific surface area bulk density and porosity of biochar increase significantly with an increase in pyrolysis temperature 55 the performance of biochar depends largely on its surface functional groups which change with pyrolysis temperature biochar has abundant redox functional groups mainly phenolic moieties at 400 c 56 aldehydes and ketones functionalities of poplar biochar are dominated at 300 to 500 c while a transformation from more aliphatic to more aromatic occurs at 550 to 650 c 20 biochar has the electron exchange capacity eec which is the sum of electron donating capacity edc and electron accepting capacity eac when the pyrolysis temperature is 300 400 c the edc is stronger than eac and biochar is more inclined to donate electrons when the pyrolysis temperature is 400 550 c the situation is reversed while the temperature is higher than 550 c biochar is dominated by graphitic structure both edc and eac are low 57 recently biochar has been widely used in redox systems due to its eec 58 3 effects of biochar on anammox process the effects of various biochar on anammox process have been previously demonstrated and are summarized in table 2 the anammox process is generally promoted by different biochar which is manifested in shortening start up time improving nitrogen removal performance and alleviating contaminants inhibition pyrolysis temperature and particle size of biochar seem to be the main factors determining its effect properties of biochar and its effect on anammox process are discussed in this section 3 1 shortening start up time anaob grow slowly with a maximum specific growth rate of 0 0027 h 1 and a doubling time of 11 days 3 the low cellular yield and long doubling time of anaob leads to a long start up time of the anammox process which limits its practical application 59 numerous efforts are being made to shorten the start up time of anammox process including the addition of biochar the start up time of anammox in the uasb reactor with bamboo charcoal was 85 days which was significantly shorter than that in the control reactor 117 days and the spherical plastic amendment reactor 97 days under the same conditions in that biochar addition significantly enriched anaob 60 besides due to the growth of anaob on the its surface the addition of bamboo charcoal can reduce the cultivated anammox seed sludge dosage by more than 50 in the start up process 61 however adams the enhancement effect of three biochar on anammox system 5 coconut shortened the start up time from 67 days to 46 days while peach and bamboo did not have an obvious effect this result may be related to the fact that the coconut they used indicated more surface functional groups such as oh aromatic oh and co which could provide extracellular electrons to anaob 65 3 2 improving nitrogen removal performance anammox biomass is easy to be washed out of the reactor resulting in an unstable nitrogen removal process 68 the addition of biochar can maximize retention of anammox biomass which is crucial to promoting process stability 69 besides anabolism of anammox produces nitrate resulting in a theoretical total nitrogen removal rate of only 88 8 70 biochar can synergize anammox and denitrification to further improve the total nitrogen removal rate different doses of biochar 3 14 g l 1 5 7 1 g g vss were added to the anammox system which all improved the nitrogen removal rate nrr and nitrogen removal efficiency nre the enhancement effect increased at 3 10 g biochar l and reached the plateau at 10 14 g l and 10 g l 5 1 g g vss was the optimal biochar dosage 62 xu et al 63 found that the effects of biochar with different particle sizes 10 30 μm sp 200 500 μm mp and 2 5 mm lp on anammox process are different and the average nitrogen removal efficiencies of anammox reactor amended with sp and mp biochar was 97 9 and 97 5 respectively which were significantly higher than that of lp biochar 87 9 and control 80 5 the prime reason is that the smaller the particle size the more obvious promotion of the electron transport ability of eps and functional genes expression in addition it seems that pyrolysis temperature has a great influence on the performance of biochar the nrr of uasb anammox system with a biochar pyrolysis temperature of 300 c with much electron donating groups was 95 4 while the total nitrogen removal rate of biochar pyrolysis temperature of 800 c that is graphitic structure was only 82 even lower than the control group 86 2 although the specific surface area of the latter is much higher than that of the latter 67 3 3 alleviating contaminants inhibition anaob are susceptible to various influencing factors such as temperature ph salinity high concentration substrates e g nitrite free ammonia fa and the presence of heavy metals organic matter and nanoparticles 71 72 the inhibition of anammox process can be alleviated by adding carriers and exogenous additives 73 74 it has been shown that biochar can alleviate cod and nitrite stress on anammox process when the influent cod n is lower than 0 5 or cod concentration is lower than 100 mg l nitrogen removal could be enhanced via the coexistence of anammox and denitrification 75 76 however a high cod concentration would cause aob to outcompete nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 77 distinct types of biochar bamboo coconut peach jujube litchi walnut and chinar on anammox process under two different cod loading rates were reported when cod concentration was 100 mg l ammonium and tn removal efficiencies in all biochar groups were higher than that in the control group while cod concentration increased to 150 mg l litchi and chinar could resist the inhibition with average ammonium removal efficiencies of 75 91 and 74 25 respectively which were higher than the control 72 34 66 guo et al 78 showed that the average ammonium removal efficiency was increased from 89 4 77 4 and 66 2 to 96 2 84 5 and 71 5 after adding 5 bamboo charcoal at cod concentrations of 50 100 and 150 mg l respectively and the maximum improved efficiency was 10 5 22 4 and 33 0 besides the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway of anaob can be stimulated by biochar when the influent cod n is 0 7 the specific anammox activity saa of control group decreased to 0 42 g n g vss d while the bamboo group 0 49 g n g vss d indicating that biochar can alleviate cod inhibition to a certain extent 79 nitrite is not only a substrate but also an inhibitor of anammox especially when ammonia is not available 80 biochar with different pyrolysis temperatures can alleviate nitrite stress in anammox process the total nitrogen removal rates of the control group and biochar groups with pyrolysis temperatures of 300 c 500 c and 800 c were 23 3 56 0 37 1 and 29 7 at nitrite concentration of 400 mg l respectively and 231 149 and 51 0 higher than that of the control group under 600 mg l nitrite because biochar could relive the suppression of membrane associated enzyme complexes for anammox electron transport chain 81 besides anammox activity and nitrogen elimination were not affected because of biochar when influent nitrite concentration is 500 mg l for the reason that biochar provides attachment sites to anaob 82 alleviating nitrite inhibition makes partial nitrification coupled anammox process available which is crucial to accomplish completely autotrophic nitrogen removal 4 mechanisms of biochar promoting anammox process the promoting effect of biochar on anammox could be explained from several different aspects fig 2 similar to other carriers biochar provides an attachment site for microorganism and creates a suitable microenvironment for their growth 83 further biochar can participate in the eet of microorganism due to its abundance of redox functional groups 84 the potential mechanisms of biochar promoting anammox process are summarized in this section 4 1 providing a habitat for microorganisms enrichment and retention of anaob biomass is the key to anammox due to its slow growth and environmental sensitivity 85 biochar has a large internal surface area and porous structure which can provide an attachment site for anaob 82 scanning electron microscope sem showed that the pore structure of bamboo charcoal was covered with lots of sludge 78 the addition of biochar leads to a denser surface structure of sludge a high density of anammox sludge was observed to be attached tightly to the grain biochar 86 spaghetti theory is proposed that around the biochar filamentous bacteria form a mesh in which anaob is trapped and retained to growth 61 the addition of biochar could optimize the distribution structure of bacteria due to the different do concentrations the carrier surface can be divided into anaerobic zone anoxic zone and aerobic zone 87 anaob preferentially grow on the surface of carrier while the denitrifying bacteria and aob which are aerobic bacteria are mainly developed as suspended biomass due to the limitation of oxygen delivery fig 3 88 for example anaob and denitrifying bacteria were enriched respectively and partial denitrification anammox was achieved by the addition of biochar 64 in addition the microporous structure of biochar can make the anaob and denitrifying bacteria in the inner layer possess stronger resist the disturbance capacity 89 the synergistic growth of different bacteria is beneficial to realizing one stage partial nitrification or partial denitrification coupled anammox 90 the optimum ph for the growth and activity of anaob is in the range of 7 2 7 6 91 the decrease in effluent ph indicates the deterioration of anammox process 92 biochar as a ph buffer may provide alkalinity for the anammox process 40 the alkali metal salts and alkali earth metal salts in the feedstocks are converted into carbonates during the pyrolysis process which makes the biochar has good alkalinity 93 carboxyl groups on the surface of biochar can absorb free h by protonation 94 4 2 stimulating extracellular polymeric substances secretion extracellular polymeric substances eps that are composed mainly of proteins pn polysaccharides ps as well as humic acids ha are secreted by bacteria and attached to the surface 95 eps is beneficial for sludge granulation biofilm formation and maintenance of structural stability 96 biochar with porous structure could improve the enzymatic activity and metabolism of the attached microorganisms and thus stimulate extracellular enzymes production that increases the eps content in granular sludge 97 and the electron transfer between biochar and cells induces the increase of redox active exoproteins in eps 98 additionally microorganisms might metabolize dissolved organic matter dom released from biochar into humic acids which are components of eps 99 biochar can promote pn secretion in eps and enhance pn ps value which is positively correlated with sludge stability 62 however some research results showed that biochar could not promote the secretion of total eps but stimulate the secretion of pn and greatly improve the pn ps value 67 xu et al 100 proposed that biochar mainly promoted the secretion of slime eps s eps where microbial metabolic activities were carried out the eps secretion of anammox sludge was particle size dependent and biochar with particle size of 10 30 μm had a significant promoting effect 63 when the anammox system is disturbed by external interference bacteria will accelerate the secretion of eps for self protection 101 biochar stimulated eps secretion and alleviated the stress effect of cod on anammox 78 the eps content is related to many factors such as water quality sludge morphology and operating conditions 96 therefore the effects of biochar on eps secretion often vary in different studies which requires further exploration 4 3 facilitating extracellular electron transfer eet plays a vital role in microbial metabolism and energy exchange with the environment which can be applied for biodegradation bioremediation and microbial fuel cells 102 104 so far two eet mechanistic pathways have been proposed 1 direct eet mediated by pili nanowires or cytochrome c cyt c which are located in the outer membrane 105 106 2 indirect eet mediated by redox shuttles such as flavins and other quinones 107 15 n labeling experiments revealed that anaob possess eet capability graphene oxide or electrodes in microbial electrolysis cells could act as insoluble extracellular electron acceptors 108 every microbial cell is surrounded by eps which are transient media to maintain a high concentration of electron shuttles 100 109 biochar has abundant carbon oxygen functional groups including electron donating moieties such as oh aromatic oh and co electron accepting moieties such as oco co and aromatic cc 110 which can act as both electron shuttle and electron acceptor donor in the eet of anammox process meanwhile cyt c in the outer membrane and some low molecular weight molecules flavin and quinones in eps can also be involved as electron transfer mediators 111 biochar with pyrolysis temperature of 300 400 c enriches reduced functional groups phenolic hydroquinone and has higher eec edc but lower eac which supports the metabolism of anammox cells by enhancing the eac of both the anammox biomass and eps 62 67 however the eac of biochar that pyrolysis temperature is higher than 500 c renders it an electron sink and may inhibit the anammox metabolism 67 biochar can further enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency by stimulated partial denitrification 64 and dnra pathway of anaob rather than denitrification at low cod n ratios 79 likewise ferric iron reduction coupled with anaerobic ammonium oxidation feammox can be facilitated by biochar as an electron shuttle 112 to conclude a possible mechanism of biochar in eet is proposed fig 4 in the eet of anammox process biochar can be used as an electron shuttle to facilitate electron transfer or directly provide electron to accelerate the metabolism of anammox meanwhile the relation between anammox and other biochemical processes e g pd dnra and feammox is strengthened by biochar 4 4 enriching anammox bacteria and promoting expression of functional genes the addition of biochar significantly affected the microbial community structure and diversity of anammox anaob such as candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia as well as the denitrifying bacteria such as denitratisoma are usually enriched with biochar addition 113 the relative abundance of ca brocadia in uasb reactor with 7 g l biochar was 7 5 which was much higher than that of 0 6 in control group 62 the abundance of candidatus brocadia and denimratisoma was similar in the reactor with biochar added at dna level while the abundance of candidatus brocadia was significantly increased in the reactor at rna level indicating that biochar promoted the metabolism of anaob 100 candidatus brocadia is the most common anaob with biochar amendment which may be related to their preference for growing on biofilm 114 unfortunately anaob have not been purified so far and there is usually a complete nitrogen cycle in anammox community 115 the microbial nitrogen cycling network mainly consists of six processes fig 5 nitrogen fixation nitrification denitrification anammox assimilation and ammonification 116 the abundance of bacteria depends on the expression of functional genes a series of nitrogen metabolism genes were detected in anammox system including hydrazine dehydrogenase gene hdh hydrazine synthase gene hzsa b c no forming nitrite reductase gene nirs k nitrate reductase gene narg h i napa nitric oxide reductase gene norb c nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz etc 117 118 biochar can affect the metabolism of anaob by regulating the expression of functional genes no forming nitrite reductase nirs k hydrazine synthase hzsa b c and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh are the key coding enzymes in anammox metabolism 119 the relative abundance of these three genes nir hzs and hdh was higher in the biochar group than in the control group further indicating that the addition of biochar promoted the anammox metabolic process 63 biochar significantly increased the abundance of nirs and nirk to alleviate the inhibition of high nitrite concentration on anammox process 81 besides the addition of biochar influences the abundance of genes related to other nitrogen removal pathways when c n was low the addition of biochar inhibited the expression of narg h i and norb c during denitrification but increased the abundance of napa b and nrfa h during assimilation 79 by contrast when cod concentration was high anammox related genes still dominated and biochar significantly promoted the expression of narg h i norb c and nosz during denitrification 66 78 in summary the addition of biochar enhanced the abundance of anammox functional genes but the variation of gene abundance during denitrification depends on cod concentration and functional gene in the main nitrogen conversion pathways is marked in fig 5 5 applications challenges and outlook among the various carriers for anammox process biochar is considered a more favorable one for applications due to its high specific surface area abundant surface functional groups and environmental friendliness there are several attempts to use biochar in applications it is reported that the main nitrogen removal pathway of landfill leachate treated by sequential batch biofilm reactor amended with zeolite and biochar carriers shifted from simultaneous nitrification denitrification to pn a 120 rambags et al 121 added woodchip and coconut husk biochar in mesoscale denitrification bioreactors anammox had the same rage of n removal rate to denitrification and appeared to become more dominant when carbon was limited constructed wetlands are widely applied in the tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater mainly to treat nitrate in effluent from wwtps 122 biochar not only enhanced denitrification in constructed wetlands but also promoted anammox process due to the low c n ratio 123 however most researches related to biochar anammox system have been conducted in laboratory scale simulated wastewater rather than real environment biochar has not yet been added to the anammox process for treating mainstream municipal wastewater for practical application adding biochar to promote anammox is faced with some potential defects the harmful components of biochar including its internal components and external pollutants adsorbed on the surface could inhibit the metabolism of anammox biochar derived from bamboo or oak contains large amounts of zn2 and mn2 which are easily released into the aquatic environment 124 the maximum adsorption capacity of rice husk biochar for cd2 was 93 50 mg g primarily attributed to cation exchange and precipitation 125 the antibiotics chlortetracycline ofloxacin and sulfadiazine in an aqueous solution were adsorbed by corncob biochar which can activate peroxymonosulfate pms 126 inorganic phosphorus released from the biochar may speed up the eutrophication 127 previous studies have also focused on the cytotoxicity of biochar which increases as the particle size decreases 128 micro biochar mb and nano biochar nb particles with lower carbon stability can be produced by preparation process or interaction with the environment 129 the support and stability of biochar as a carrier may be inadequate because of the mechanical strength required for applications additionally mb and nb for their high mobility can promote the facilitate migration of contaminants 130 despite the challenges the promise of biochar based anammox process in wwtps remains feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions determine the physical and chemical properties of biochar and thus the performance most of the biochar currently used to facilitate the anammox process is produced from woody or herbaceous biomass during a slow pyrolysis process at 300 to 400 c and a standard technique could be made to guide researchers who want to employ biochar to promote anammox process it is necessary to seriously evaluate the biochar for its harmful components adsorption capacity for pollutants and its decomposition capacity which may be harmful to the anammox process and the water environment the performance of biochar in anammox process should be explored by using actual wastewater with more complicated components as influent in addition considering the requirements of the wwtps on the carrier the stability sustainability and regeneration of biochar also need further investigations in the pilot scale furthermore metal modification can significantly improve the properties of carbon materials compared with activated carbon the start up time of anammox system is further shortened by fe modified activated carbon mainly because fe can promote the growth of anaob 131 both the fe and zn modified biochar have the greater specific surface area and more abundant surface function groups resulting in stronger eec 132 likewise composite carriers tend to perform better by optimizing the effectiveness of each component for example hydrogel biochar can hold strong through cross linking structure thus avoiding the loss of biochar 133 in the future biochar modification and composite carriers should be considered to further promote anammox process 6 conclusion this review presents biochar as a novel carrier which has been extensively studied for promoting anammox process biochar produced by slow pyrolysis of woody and herbaceous biomass is usually used due to its significant economic and environmental advantages when the pyrolysis temperature is 300 400 c and the pyrolysis time is 120 150 min biochar has the optimal performance because of the maximum edc by adding biochar to anammox process shorting start up time improving nitrogen removal performance and alleviating contaminants inhibition could be achieved the possible mechanisms involve providing a habitat for microorganisms stimulating eps secretion facilitating eet enriching anaob and promoting functional genes expression however large scale application of biochar in anammox process remains challenging and more attention should be paid to the secondary pollutants in biochar as well as the stability of biochar as a carrier in addition future researches could focus on biochar modification and composite carrier declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

plants wwtps anammox can remarkably reduce oxygen and organic carbon demands by up to 60 and 100 respectively with a significant reduction in surplus sludge production 6 partial nitrification anammox pn a systems reduce costs and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 0 303 m3 and 1 72 kg equiv co2 m3 respectively 7 anammox has been widely used in treating wastewater with high ammonium and low c n ratio such as landfill leachate and sludge digestion liquid 8 9 as in 2014 there are over 100 full scale pn a installations in operation worldwide 75 of which are sidestream treatment of municipal wastewater 10 although previous studies have reported the potential of mainstream anammox treatment for municipal wastewater the application in full scale wwtps is still limited due to bottlenecks associated with long cell doubling time poor retention of biomass environmental sensitivity and contaminant inhibition 11 12 to achieve this goal numerous attempts including selecting suitable reactors such as up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb membrane bioreactor mbr and sequencing batch reactor sbr 13 14 adding exogenous additives such as specific metal ions e g fe2 mn2 zn2 and cu2 15 16 and intermediate hydrazine n2h4 17 have been made to shorten its start up time stabilize the nitrogen removal process and relieve inhibition however considering the cost and practical convenience adding carriers that provide attachment sites for anaob seems to be the superior method to improve anammox process 18 furthermore ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaob can grow harmonically on the carrier surface making one stage pn a feasible which is significant for mainstream anammox applications 19 various types of carriers have previously been investigated in wastewater treatment table 1 biochar seems to be a promising carrier because of the microporous structure and abundant surface functional groups 20 although plastic and sponge carriers have been practically available at wwtps due to low cost and long service life they are far less effective for promoting biological process than biochar 21 nonwoven fabric carriers have a small hollow area and are prone to blockage which limits the long term operation 22 gel carriers can significantly accelerate anammox acclimation and enhance the biomass retention but they are considered to have lower mechanical strength 23 compared with mineral carriers biochar exhibits better suitable environments for microbial attachment and growth 24 in addition despite similar structure and properties biochar has easy and inexpensive availability than other carbon materials e g activated carbon and graphene oxide 30 31 meanwhile biochar has drawbacks as well it tends to adsorb and migrate pollutants such as heavy metals and antibiotics while the polymer inert organic carriers mentioned above do not 27 biochar is a carbon rich product formed via thermochemical conversion of biomass under limited oxygen or anaerobic conditions 32 the easy availability of raw materials low production costs and environmental friendliness have made biochar a sustainable material 33 due to its large specific surface area and rich pore structure biochar is widely used to remove heavy metals organic pollutants and nutrients from wastewater 34 biochar is considered as an efficient biological carrier which can provide a habitat for microorganisms 35 compared with conventional carriers biochar has abundant oxygen containing functional groups which can participate in microbial metabolic reactions 36 for instance biochar can act as an electron shuttle to facilitate extracellular electron transfer eet during anaerobic digestion 37 in recent years an increasing number of studies have used biochar to enhance anammox process not only the anammox biochar amendment system meets the need for sustainable development but also has broad application potential 38 biochar has been mentioned in several previous reviews about the role of carrier in anammox process 21 39 40 however to our best knowledge there is no systematic review concerning the effects and mechanisms of biochar promoting anammox process this review evaluates the performance of biochar under various feedstocks and production conditions for enhancing anammox process and outlines the potential mechanisms from diverse aspects in addition this work would analyze practical deficiencies and propose new directions which aim at guiding the development and application of anammox enhancement by employing biochar 2 biochar as a cost effective carbon carrier biochar is a novel carbon carrier which has similar physical and chemical properties to other carbon materials such as activated carbon and reduced graphene oxide 41 42 biochar may act as a precursor matter to produce activated carbon by activation processes 43 however compared to activated carbon biochar has significant potential benefits in water treatment operations due to its environmental and economic benefits 44 the biochar production is less energy intensive reducing the cost from 1500 ton activated carbon to 245 ton biochar 45 biochar has negative greenhouse gas ghg emissions of 0 9 kg co2eq kg due to its carbon sequestration capacity while activated carbon is higher on ghg emissions of 6 6 kg co2eq kg 46 accordingly biochar is proposed to replace other carbon materials to achieve a more sustainable and low carbon economy 47 when used to stabilize the anammox process biochar is usually generated from slow pyrolysis of woody and herbaceous biomass the biomass was usually pyrolyzed at a temperature of 300 400 c and time ranging from 120 to 150 min fig 1 the feedstocks for biochar production are widely available and classified into three major categories 1 woody and herbaceous biomass 2 animal and human waste 3 biosolids sludge 48 biochar produced by woody and herbaceous biomass e g wood crop and bamboo has a large specific surface area strong ion exchangeability and rich surface functional groups which are mainly used in adsorption and redox reactions 49 for example woody biochar is rich in the functional groups such as benzene ring cooh and ch3 which can adsorb naphthalene c10h8 thus remove the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 50 animal and human waste biochar has higher ash content a large amount of nitrogen phosphorus potassium and other trace elements and is mainly used as fertilizer to improve soil by neutralizing ph enhancing microbial activity and providing nutrients for crop growth 51 sludge biochar can be used as a supplementary cementitious material for cement composite with higher heat release and compressive strength 52 however sludge biochar often comprises toxic constituents such as heavy metals and antibiotics posing negative effects on the biological process including anammox 53 the most common and traditional method of production is slow pyrolysis with a higher biochar yield and better homogeneity 54 the specific surface area bulk density and porosity of biochar increase significantly with an increase in pyrolysis temperature 55 the performance of biochar depends largely on its surface functional groups which change with pyrolysis temperature biochar has abundant redox functional groups mainly phenolic moieties at 400 c 56 aldehydes and ketones functionalities of poplar biochar are dominated at 300 to 500 c while a transformation from more aliphatic to more aromatic occurs at 550 to 650 c 20 biochar has the electron exchange capacity eec which is the sum of electron donating capacity edc and electron accepting capacity eac when the pyrolysis temperature is 300 400 c the edc is stronger than eac and biochar is more inclined to donate electrons when the pyrolysis temperature is 400 550 c the situation is reversed while the temperature is higher than 550 c biochar is dominated by graphitic structure both edc and eac are low 57 recently biochar has been widely used in redox systems due to its eec 58 3 effects of biochar on anammox process the effects of various biochar on anammox process have been previously demonstrated and are summarized in table 2 the anammox process is generally promoted by different biochar which is manifested in shortening start up time improving nitrogen removal performance and alleviating contaminants inhibition pyrolysis temperature and particle size of biochar seem to be the main factors determining its effect properties of biochar and its effect on anammox process are discussed in this section 3 1 shortening start up time anaob grow slowly with a maximum specific growth rate of 0 0027 h 1 and a doubling time of 11 days 3 the low cellular yield and long doubling time of anaob leads to a long start up time of the anammox process which limits its practical application 59 numerous efforts are being made to shorten the start up time of anammox process including the addition of biochar the start up time of anammox in the uasb reactor with bamboo charcoal was 85 days which was significantly shorter than that in the control reactor 117 days and the spherical plastic amendment reactor 97 days under the same conditions in that biochar addition significantly enriched anaob 60 besides due to the growth of anaob on the its surface the addition of bamboo charcoal can reduce the cultivated anammox seed sludge dosage by more than 50 in the start up process 61 however adams the enhancement effect of three biochar on anammox system 5 coconut shortened the start up time from 67 days to 46 days while peach and bamboo did not have an obvious effect this result may be related to the fact that the coconut they used indicated more surface functional groups such as oh aromatic oh and co which could provide extracellular electrons to anaob 65 3 2 improving nitrogen removal performance anammox biomass is easy to be washed out of the reactor resulting in an unstable nitrogen removal process 68 the addition of biochar can maximize retention of anammox biomass which is crucial to promoting process stability 69 besides anabolism of anammox produces nitrate resulting in a theoretical total nitrogen removal rate of only 88 8 70 biochar can synergize anammox and denitrification to further improve the total nitrogen removal rate different doses of biochar 3 14 g l 1 5 7 1 g g vss were added to the anammox system which all improved the nitrogen removal rate nrr and nitrogen removal efficiency nre the enhancement effect increased at 3 10 g biochar l and reached the plateau at 10 14 g l and 10 g l 5 1 g g vss was the optimal biochar dosage 62 xu et al 63 found that the effects of biochar with different particle sizes 10 30 μm sp 200 500 μm mp and 2 5 mm lp on anammox process are different and the average nitrogen removal efficiencies of anammox reactor amended with sp and mp biochar was 97 9 and 97 5 respectively which were significantly higher than that of lp biochar 87 9 and control 80 5 the prime reason is that the smaller the particle size the more obvious promotion of the electron transport ability of eps and functional genes expression in addition it seems that pyrolysis temperature has a great influence on the performance of biochar the nrr of uasb anammox system with a biochar pyrolysis temperature of 300 c with much electron donating groups was 95 4 while the total nitrogen removal rate of biochar pyrolysis temperature of 800 c that is graphitic structure was only 82 even lower than the control group 86 2 although the specific surface area of the latter is much higher than that of the latter 67 3 3 alleviating contaminants inhibition anaob are susceptible to various influencing factors such as temperature ph salinity high concentration substrates e g nitrite free ammonia fa and the presence of heavy metals organic matter and nanoparticles 71 72 the inhibition of anammox process can be alleviated by adding carriers and exogenous additives 73 74 it has been shown that biochar can alleviate cod and nitrite stress on anammox process when the influent cod n is lower than 0 5 or cod concentration is lower than 100 mg l nitrogen removal could be enhanced via the coexistence of anammox and denitrification 75 76 however a high cod concentration would cause aob to outcompete nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 77 distinct types of biochar bamboo coconut peach jujube litchi walnut and chinar on anammox process under two different cod loading rates were reported when cod concentration was 100 mg l ammonium and tn removal efficiencies in all biochar groups were higher than that in the control group while cod concentration increased to 150 mg l litchi and chinar could resist the inhibition with average ammonium removal efficiencies of 75 91 and 74 25 respectively which were higher than the control 72 34 66 guo et al 78 showed that the average ammonium removal efficiency was increased from 89 4 77 4 and 66 2 to 96 2 84 5 and 71 5 after adding 5 bamboo charcoal at cod concentrations of 50 100 and 150 mg l respectively and the maximum improved efficiency was 10 5 22 4 and 33 0 besides the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway of anaob can be stimulated by biochar when the influent cod n is 0 7 the specific anammox activity saa of control group decreased to 0 42 g n g vss d while the bamboo group 0 49 g n g vss d indicating that biochar can alleviate cod inhibition to a certain extent 79 nitrite is not only a substrate but also an inhibitor of anammox especially when ammonia is not available 80 biochar with different pyrolysis temperatures can alleviate nitrite stress in anammox process the total nitrogen removal rates of the control group and biochar groups with pyrolysis temperatures of 300 c 500 c and 800 c were 23 3 56 0 37 1 and 29 7 at nitrite concentration of 400 mg l respectively and 231 149 and 51 0 higher than that of the control group under 600 mg l nitrite because biochar could relive the suppression of membrane associated enzyme complexes for anammox electron transport chain 81 besides anammox activity and nitrogen elimination were not affected because of biochar when influent nitrite concentration is 500 mg l for the reason that biochar provides attachment sites to anaob 82 alleviating nitrite inhibition makes partial nitrification coupled anammox process available which is crucial to accomplish completely autotrophic nitrogen removal 4 mechanisms of biochar promoting anammox process the promoting effect of biochar on anammox could be explained from several different aspects fig 2 similar to other carriers biochar provides an attachment site for microorganism and creates a suitable microenvironment for their growth 83 further biochar can participate in the eet of microorganism due to its abundance of redox functional groups 84 the potential mechanisms of biochar promoting anammox process are summarized in this section 4 1 providing a habitat for microorganisms enrichment and retention of anaob biomass is the key to anammox due to its slow growth and environmental sensitivity 85 biochar has a large internal surface area and porous structure which can provide an attachment site for anaob 82 scanning electron microscope sem showed that the pore structure of bamboo charcoal was covered with lots of sludge 78 the addition of biochar leads to a denser surface structure of sludge a high density of anammox sludge was observed to be attached tightly to the grain biochar 86 spaghetti theory is proposed that around the biochar filamentous bacteria form a mesh in which anaob is trapped and retained to growth 61 the addition of biochar could optimize the distribution structure of bacteria due to the different do concentrations the carrier surface can be divided into anaerobic zone anoxic zone and aerobic zone 87 anaob preferentially grow on the surface of carrier while the denitrifying bacteria and aob which are aerobic bacteria are mainly developed as suspended biomass due to the limitation of oxygen delivery fig 3 88 for example anaob and denitrifying bacteria were enriched respectively and partial denitrification anammox was achieved by the addition of biochar 64 in addition the microporous structure of biochar can make the anaob and denitrifying bacteria in the inner layer possess stronger resist the disturbance capacity 89 the synergistic growth of different bacteria is beneficial to realizing one stage partial nitrification or partial denitrification coupled anammox 90 the optimum ph for the growth and activity of anaob is in the range of 7 2 7 6 91 the decrease in effluent ph indicates the deterioration of anammox process 92 biochar as a ph buffer may provide alkalinity for the anammox process 40 the alkali metal salts and alkali earth metal salts in the feedstocks are converted into carbonates during the pyrolysis process which makes the biochar has good alkalinity 93 carboxyl groups on the surface of biochar can absorb free h by protonation 94 4 2 stimulating extracellular polymeric substances secretion extracellular polymeric substances eps that are composed mainly of proteins pn polysaccharides ps as well as humic acids ha are secreted by bacteria and attached to the surface 95 eps is beneficial for sludge granulation biofilm formation and maintenance of structural stability 96 biochar with porous structure could improve the enzymatic activity and metabolism of the attached microorganisms and thus stimulate extracellular enzymes production that increases the eps content in granular sludge 97 and the electron transfer between biochar and cells induces the increase of redox active exoproteins in eps 98 additionally microorganisms might metabolize dissolved organic matter dom released from biochar into humic acids which are components of eps 99 biochar can promote pn secretion in eps and enhance pn ps value which is positively correlated with sludge stability 62 however some research results showed that biochar could not promote the secretion of total eps but stimulate the secretion of pn and greatly improve the pn ps value 67 xu et al 100 proposed that biochar mainly promoted the secretion of slime eps s eps where microbial metabolic activities were carried out the eps secretion of anammox sludge was particle size dependent and biochar with particle size of 10 30 μm had a significant promoting effect 63 when the anammox system is disturbed by external interference bacteria will accelerate the secretion of eps for self protection 101 biochar stimulated eps secretion and alleviated the stress effect of cod on anammox 78 the eps content is related to many factors such as water quality sludge morphology and operating conditions 96 therefore the effects of biochar on eps secretion often vary in different studies which requires further exploration 4 3 facilitating extracellular electron transfer eet plays a vital role in microbial metabolism and energy exchange with the environment which can be applied for biodegradation bioremediation and microbial fuel cells 102 104 so far two eet mechanistic pathways have been proposed 1 direct eet mediated by pili nanowires or cytochrome c cyt c which are located in the outer membrane 105 106 2 indirect eet mediated by redox shuttles such as flavins and other quinones 107 15 n labeling experiments revealed that anaob possess eet capability graphene oxide or electrodes in microbial electrolysis cells could act as insoluble extracellular electron acceptors 108 every microbial cell is surrounded by eps which are transient media to maintain a high concentration of electron shuttles 100 109 biochar has abundant carbon oxygen functional groups including electron donating moieties such as oh aromatic oh and co electron accepting moieties such as oco co and aromatic cc 110 which can act as both electron shuttle and electron acceptor donor in the eet of anammox process meanwhile cyt c in the outer membrane and some low molecular weight molecules flavin and quinones in eps can also be involved as electron transfer mediators 111 biochar with pyrolysis temperature of 300 400 c enriches reduced functional groups phenolic hydroquinone and has higher eec edc but lower eac which supports the metabolism of anammox cells by enhancing the eac of both the anammox biomass and eps 62 67 however the eac of biochar that pyrolysis temperature is higher than 500 c renders it an electron sink and may inhibit the anammox metabolism 67 biochar can further enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency by stimulated partial denitrification 64 and dnra pathway of anaob rather than denitrification at low cod n ratios 79 likewise ferric iron reduction coupled with anaerobic ammonium oxidation feammox can be facilitated by biochar as an electron shuttle 112 to conclude a possible mechanism of biochar in eet is proposed fig 4 in the eet of anammox process biochar can be used as an electron shuttle to facilitate electron transfer or directly provide electron to accelerate the metabolism of anammox meanwhile the relation between anammox and other biochemical processes e g pd dnra and feammox is strengthened by biochar 4 4 enriching anammox bacteria and promoting expression of functional genes the addition of biochar significantly affected the microbial community structure and diversity of anammox anaob such as candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia as well as the denitrifying bacteria such as denitratisoma are usually enriched with biochar addition 113 the relative abundance of ca brocadia in uasb reactor with 7 g l biochar was 7 5 which was much higher than that of 0 6 in control group 62 the abundance of candidatus brocadia and denimratisoma was similar in the reactor with biochar added at dna level while the abundance of candidatus brocadia was significantly increased in the reactor at rna level indicating that biochar promoted the metabolism of anaob 100 candidatus brocadia is the most common anaob with biochar amendment which may be related to their preference for growing on biofilm 114 unfortunately anaob have not been purified so far and there is usually a complete nitrogen cycle in anammox community 115 the microbial nitrogen cycling network mainly consists of six processes fig 5 nitrogen fixation nitrification denitrification anammox assimilation and ammonification 116 the abundance of bacteria depends on the expression of functional genes a series of nitrogen metabolism genes were detected in anammox system including hydrazine dehydrogenase gene hdh hydrazine synthase gene hzsa b c no forming nitrite reductase gene nirs k nitrate reductase gene narg h i napa nitric oxide reductase gene norb c nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz etc 117 118 biochar can affect the metabolism of anaob by regulating the expression of functional genes no forming nitrite reductase nirs k hydrazine synthase hzsa b c and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh are the key coding enzymes in anammox metabolism 119 the relative abundance of these three genes nir hzs and hdh was higher in the biochar group than in the control group further indicating that the addition of biochar promoted the anammox metabolic process 63 biochar significantly increased the abundance of nirs and nirk to alleviate the inhibition of high nitrite concentration on anammox process 81 besides the addition of biochar influences the abundance of genes related to other nitrogen removal pathways when c n was low the addition of biochar inhibited the expression of narg h i and norb c during denitrification but increased the abundance of napa b and nrfa h during assimilation 79 by contrast when cod concentration was high anammox related genes still dominated and biochar significantly promoted the expression of narg h i norb c and nosz during denitrification 66 78 in summary the addition of biochar enhanced the abundance of anammox functional genes but the variation of gene abundance during denitrification depends on cod concentration and functional gene in the main nitrogen conversion pathways is marked in fig 5 5 applications challenges and outlook among the various carriers for anammox process biochar is considered a more favorable one for applications due to its high specific surface area abundant surface functional groups and environmental friendliness there are several attempts to use biochar in applications it is reported that the main nitrogen removal pathway of landfill leachate treated by sequential batch biofilm reactor amended with zeolite and biochar carriers shifted from simultaneous nitrification denitrification to pn a 120 rambags et al 121 added woodchip and coconut husk biochar in mesoscale denitrification bioreactors anammox had the same rage of n removal rate to denitrification and appeared to become more dominant when carbon was limited constructed wetlands are widely applied in the tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater mainly to treat nitrate in effluent from wwtps 122 biochar not only enhanced denitrification in constructed wetlands but also promoted anammox process due to the low c n ratio 123 however most researches related to biochar anammox system have been conducted in laboratory scale simulated wastewater rather than real environment biochar has not yet been added to the anammox process for treating mainstream municipal wastewater for practical application adding biochar to promote anammox is faced with some potential defects the harmful components of biochar including its internal components and external pollutants adsorbed on the surface could inhibit the metabolism of anammox biochar derived from bamboo or oak contains large amounts of zn2 and mn2 which are easily released into the aquatic environment 124 the maximum adsorption capacity of rice husk biochar for cd2 was 93 50 mg g primarily attributed to cation exchange and precipitation 125 the antibiotics chlortetracycline ofloxacin and sulfadiazine in an aqueous solution were adsorbed by corncob biochar which can activate peroxymonosulfate pms 126 inorganic phosphorus released from the biochar may speed up the eutrophication 127 previous studies have also focused on the cytotoxicity of biochar which increases as the particle size decreases 128 micro biochar mb and nano biochar nb particles with lower carbon stability can be produced by preparation process or interaction with the environment 129 the support and stability of biochar as a carrier may be inadequate because of the mechanical strength required for applications additionally mb and nb for their high mobility can promote the facilitate migration of contaminants 130 despite the challenges the promise of biochar based anammox process in wwtps remains feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions determine the physical and chemical properties of biochar and thus the performance most of the biochar currently used to facilitate the anammox process is produced from woody or herbaceous biomass during a slow pyrolysis process at 300 to 400 c and a standard technique could be made to guide researchers who want to employ biochar to promote anammox process it is necessary to seriously evaluate the biochar for its harmful components adsorption capacity for pollutants and its decomposition capacity which may be harmful to the anammox process and the water environment the performance of biochar in anammox process should be explored by using actual wastewater with more complicated components as influent in addition considering the requirements of the wwtps on the carrier the stability sustainability and regeneration of biochar also need further investigations in the pilot scale furthermore metal modification can significantly improve the properties of carbon materials compared with activated carbon the start up time of anammox system is further shortened by fe modified activated carbon mainly because fe can promote the growth of anaob 131 both the fe and zn modified biochar have the greater specific surface area and more abundant surface function groups resulting in stronger eec 132 likewise composite carriers tend to perform better by optimizing the effectiveness of each component for example hydrogel biochar can hold strong through cross linking structure thus avoiding the loss of biochar 133 in the future biochar modification and composite carriers should be considered to further promote anammox process 6 conclusion this review presents biochar as a novel carrier which has been extensively studied for promoting anammox process biochar produced by slow pyrolysis of woody and herbaceous biomass is usually used due to its significant economic and environmental advantages when the pyrolysis temperature is 300 400 c and the pyrolysis time is 120 150 min biochar has the optimal performance because of the maximum edc by adding biochar to anammox process shorting start up time improving nitrogen removal performance and alleviating contaminants inhibition could be achieved the possible mechanisms involve providing a habitat for microorganisms stimulating eps secretion facilitating eet enriching anaob and promoting functional genes expression however large scale application of biochar in anammox process remains challenging and more attention should be paid to the secondary pollutants in biochar as well as the stability of biochar as a carrier in addition future researches could focus on biochar modification and composite carrier declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12771,the application of calcium hypochlorite ch in waste activated sludge was treatment for enhancing the anaerobic digestion performance has been widely investigated in recent years however the underlying mechanisms for ch affecting the biomethane yield during sludge anaerobic digestion are still largely unknown this work explored the impacts of ch with different contents on anaerobic methane generation from sludge as well as the relevant mechanisms experimental results showed that the biomethane production firstly increased from 164 8 4 2 to 220 5 6 2 ml g vss volatile suspended solids with ch content raised from 0 to 1 0 g l which then started to decrease with further increased ch content mechanism analysis demonstrated that ch efficiently disintegrated sludge flocs producing more biodegradable organics for anaerobic digestion beyond that the biodegradability of recalcitrant humus and lignocellulose substances was enhanced by ch treatment as higher methane yields were attained from ch treated model substrates when compared with the control microbial community analysis indicated that most of the functional microbes were enriched after ch treatment with the total abundance detected to be 17 72 and 25 20 in control and ch pretreated reactors respectively economic calculations demonstrated that the benefit of the ch based method efficaciously covered the cost indicating that the balance between economy and technology was achieved graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords calcium hypochlorite waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion methane production data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction how to dispose the hugely generated waste activated sludge was from sewage treatment plants stps has become a thorny problem to the operators in recent years anaerobic digestion seems to be the answer by which was can be well stabilized and several bioproducts can be recycled 1 2 however the anaerobic digestion efficiency of sludge is usually very low which is mainly caused by two factors 1 the insufficient disintegration effect 2 the abundantly existed recalcitrant substances such as humus and lignocellulose that are rarely utilized by anaerobes in other words sludge anaerobic digestion performance could be largely promoted if these factors are optimized many pretreatment methods for enhancing sludge disintegration efficiency have been proposed in last decade including chemical 3 physical 4 biological 5 and combined 6 methods calcium hypochlorite ch oxidization is a chemical method for sludge treatment by which the sludge flocs can be efficiently destructed causing the enhancement of disintegration effect for instance liang et al 7 reported that sludge eps extracellular polymeric substances structure was effectively disrupted by ch pretreatment at 5 to 100 mg g dry solids ds dosage range and the protein and polysaccharide contents in liquid phase were both significantly enhanced as a result the research of zhang et al 8 indicated that the contents of dissolved carbohydrate and protein were gradually enhanced when ch dosage increased from 0 to 0 2 g g total suspended solids tss and volatile fatty acids vfas were largely produced from ch treated sludge samples in anaerobic fermentation our previously published work showed that except for vfas the hydrogen yield from sludge was also markedly promoted by ch in anaerobic fermentation process 9 wu et al 10 reported that sludge anaerobic digestion performance was enhanced for largely increased disintegration effect by ch treatment and the biomethane production was significantly enhanced by 59 7 when ch content was 0 24 g g volatile solids vs yu et al 11 reported that sludge soluble chemical oxygen demand scod content was sufficiently promoted by ch treatment producing more substrates for anaerobic digestion and the methanation rate was promoted by 51 57 at ch content of 0 1 g g tss the humus and lignocellulose substances typically account for respectively 15 28 and 14 44 of total organics in sludge 12 13 which are rarely utilized in traditional anaerobic digestion process there are some methods reported to be efficient to enhance the biodegradability of these recalcitrant substances among which chemical oxidization method has attracted great attentions 14 15 in treatment process the structures of humus and lignocellulose can be destructed resulting in the decrease of polymerization degree and generation of easily biodegraded substrates for example wang et al 16 reported that the biomethane productions from humic acid fulvic acid hemicellulose lignin and cellulose were all significantly promoted by calcium peroxide pretreatment which was mainly because of that these substances were partly degraded in treatment process and some biodegradable products were generated song et al 17 adopted hydrogen peroxide to pretreat rice straw and found that the internal cellulose hemicellulose and lignin were all largely degraded after pretreatment causing 88 0 increase of biomethane yield in subsequent anaerobic digestion process michalska et al 18 utilized fenton s reagent to pretreat three plant species sorghum moensch sida hermaphrodita and miscanthus giganteus which contained abundant lignocellulose with the delignification degree measured to be respectively 48 1 62 3 and 30 3 after pretreatment and the methane yields were all largely enhanced in consequence in addition the oxidants ozone and peracetic acid were also reported to be efficient in increasing the biodegradability of lignocellulose substances 19 21 according to the analysis above the humus and lignocellulose substances may be also well degraded by ch because the hypochlorous acid with strong oxidability can be generated when ch is added into aqueous solution eq 1 hence except for the increase of disintegration efficiency proved by previous studies 10 11 we hypothesized that another important reason for ch pretreatment promoting sludge methane production is the enhanced biodegradability of recalcitrant substances which has not been investigated till now 1 clo h 2 o oh hclo the target of the study is therefore to reveal how dose ch affect sludge anaerobic digestion system from the perspectives of both sludge disintegration and recalcitrant substances degradation firstly the methane yields from sludge by ch treatment at the contents of 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 25 g l were investigated after that the underlying mechanisms were explored through eps and microbial cells destruction variations of organics biodegradability recalcitrant substances degradation and shift of microbial community finally economic analysis of the ch pretreatment technology was conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and ch the was was obtained from bailonggang stp in shanghai china before applied for anaerobic digestion the was was filtered by a sieve 2 0 2 0 mm to remove impurities and the main properties are exhibited in table 1 ch in solid state 65 purity was acquired from shanghai aladdin company in china 2 2 pretreatment and batch methane producing experiment in this test 6 serum bottles v 500 ml were adopted as anaerobic reactors firstly each reactor received 150 ml was as the digestion substrate then different amounts of ch were dosed into the reactors to obtain the concentration gradient of 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 25 g l after stirred for 12 h using a magnetic stirrer to mix the reagent and was well each reactor was inoculated with 150 ml inoculum that obtained from a long term operated sludge anaerobic digestor and the main properties are provided in table 1 at last each reactor was flushed with nitrogen gas for 3 min then sealed by a rubber stopper and placed in an air bath shaker 35 c 150 rpm for anaerobic digestion the methane yield was daily detected in the whole anaerobic digestion process according to that demonstrated in our previous study 22 2 3 evaluating the impacts of ch on sludge disintegration and biodegradability of dissolved organics when sludge pretreatments were completed the scod soluble protein and carbohydrate contents in the reactors with diverse ch concentrations were measured based on the previously published methods 23 25 most organics in sludge exist in the eps including tb eps and lb eps that tightly and lightly bound with microbial cells respectively these two kinds of eps in different sludge samples with or without ch treatment were extracted by a heat method 26 in addition the destruction of microbial cells after ch treatment was revealed by detecting the releases of dna and lactate dehydrogenase ldh which were two frequently utilized indicators reflecting the integrity of sludge microbes 27 except for biodegradable substances such as protein and carbohydrate many recalcitrant organics are also released into sludge liquor in disintegration process the biodegradability of sludge liquor with or without pretreatment was evaluated by detecting the excitation emission matrix eem spectra through a fluorescence spectrometer hitachi f 7000 japan the operational procedures and data processing method were consistent with that reported in our previous work 28 2 4 revealing the impacts of ch on the biodegradability of humus and lignocellulose humus and lignocellulose are the main recalcitrant organics contained in sludge as shown in table 1 and are difficultly utilized by anaerobes during anaerobic digestion five batch tests using different model substances were performed to explore the effect of ch on the degradation and biodegradability of these recalcitrant organics named as test i to v respectively test i this test contained three anaerobic reactors each with a working volume of 500 ml firstly each reactor received 150 ml the same synthetic wastewater with 1147 mg l humic acid served as the only component which was consistent with that detected in raw was table 1 then different amounts of ch were dosed into the reactors to obtain the concentration gradient of 0 0 5 and 1 0 g l afterwards each reactor was stirred at 600 rpm for 12 h and immediately inoculated with 150 ml digested sludge at last each of the reactors was flushed with n2 and sealed for anaerobic digestion according to that demonstrated in section 2 2 methane productions in different reactors with or without pretreatment were daily measured in whole 10 days reaction by which the impacts of ch on humic acid biodegradability were reflected test ii the operations were the same as that conducted in test i except that humic acid was replaced by 752 mg l fulvic acid test iii this test was conducted by the same procedures demonstrated in test i apart from that 845 mg l lignin alkali substituted humic acid as the model substrate test iv all operations of the test were in accord with test i apart from that humic acid was replaced by 1075 mg l carboxymethylcellulose sodium to be the model substrate test v the test was conducted by the same procedures with test i except that 530 mg l xylan substituted humic acid to be the solo digestion substrate 2 5 analytical methods sludge vss and tss were measured according to the literature 25 the concentrations of humus and lignocellulose substances were measured by the same method conducted in our previous work 22 the ldh content was detected based on the method demonstrated in our previous work 9 and the dna was detected according to that reported in the literature 29 the generation of oh and cl radicals in ch treatment process was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance epr technology the ultraviolet uv absorption spectra of recalcitrant substances at 200 400 nm wavelength range were measured using an uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa and the degradation products of cellulose were detected by a gc ms instrument agilent 7890a 5975c usa methane contents and total biogas productions were measured according to that illustrated in our previous study 22 the methane production potential b0 and hydrolysis rate k under different conditions were evaluated using the first order kinetic model

515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 were the primers for both bacteria and archaea based on a similarity of 97 the sequencing results were divided to be a set of operational taxonomic units otus for each anaerobic reactor with or without the addition of ch three parallel samples were taken and the results of microbial abundance were presented as average values of three samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of methane generation by ch treatment at different dosages fig 1a shows the cumulative methane yields from the digestors with or without ch pretreatment no significant increase was observed in each reactor after 30 days illustrating that the anaerobic reactions were completed and maximum values were attained under different conditions the maximum methane production firstly increased from 164 8 4 2 to 220 5 6 2 ml g vss when ch content increased from 0 to 1 0 g l which then decreased to 206 3 5 5 ml g vss with the further increase of ch dosage to 1 25 g l the results indicated that 1 0 g l was the optimal ch dosage for sludge anaerobic digestion by which a 33 8 increase in methane production was achieved fig 1b further presents the fitted curves of the first order kinetic model and the simulated parameters are shown in table 2 the two parameters b0 and k both significantly changed with increased ch contents for example the b0 represented for methane production potential was firstly enhanced from 179 5 1 8 to 232 9 3 8 ml g vss and then decreased to 220 7 3 0 ml g vss with ch content increased from 0 to 1 25 g l the k value referred to hydrolysis rate showed similar variation trend which was promoted from 0 088 0 002 to 0 112 0 004 d 1 with the increase of ch dosage from 0 to 1 0 g l while further increased ch dosage of 1 25 g l resulted in the decrease of k to 0 102 0 003 d 1 though decreasing trends were observed in both b0 and k at high ch content of 1 25 g l the values of 220 7 3 0 ml g vss and 0 102 0 003 d 1 were still significantly higher than that without ch treatment p values were respectively 0 007 and 0 003 the results above indicated that sludge methane production potential and hydrolysis rate were both sufficiently enhanced by ch treatment resulting in the increase of practical methane yield 3 2 impacts of ch on the disintegration of sludge flocs a majority of organic substances in sludge exist in eps and microbial cells which can t be utilized by anaerobes unless are released into the liquid phase through disintegration process fig 2a shows the destruction of eps when pretreated by ch with different contents it was observed that the cod content of tb eps gradually reduced from 2548 to 1575 mg l when ch dosage enhanced from 0 to 1 25 g l while the cod content of lb eps accordingly enhanced from 320 to 563 mg l with promoted ch contents the total concentrations of two eps categories were then calculated which decreased from 2868 mg l in control reactor to respectively 2725 2561 2367 2212 and 2138 mg l when pretreated by 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 or 1 25 g l ch suggesting that some of the organics in eps were liberated into the liquid phase the damage of microbial cells by ch treatment was then investigated through the release of dna and ldh and the results are presented in fig 2b the relative release of dna and ldh were respectively 112 and 187 by 0 5 g l ch treatment which increased to respectively 134 and 355 when ch dosage enhanced to 1 0 g l suggesting that sludge microbes were largely ruptured by ch pretreatment and the cracking effect showed positive correlation with ch contents based on above experimental data sludge disintegration was largely accelerated by ch pretreatment as eps and microbes were both effectively destructed in treatment process as shown in eq 1 many oh can be generated from the reaction of ch and sludge water which were reported to be efficient in disintegrating sludge flocs structure 31 32 in ch treatment process the oh and cl radicals might be produced eqs 2 and 3 epr technology was utilized to detect oh and cl radicals production with different ch contents and the results are presented in fig s1 the intensities of both oh and cl were observably promoted with increased ch dosages demonstrating that these two radicals were largely produced in ch oxidization process which were obviously conducive to sludge disintegration according to above analysis sludge flocs structure was efficiently destroyed by ch which might result in the release of internal organics 2 hclo e oh cl 3 hclo e oh cl 3 3 impacts of ch on the concentration and biodegradability of dissolved organics scod concentrations of sludge samples treated by different doses of ch are depicted in fig 3a which gradually enhanced from 115 to 1048 mg l with ch dosage raised from 0 to 1 25 g l indicating that the concentration of dissolved organics was enhanced with the addition of ch as the primary biodegradable organics in sludge protein and carbohydrate were also largely released into the liquid phase when treated by ch fig 3b the results indicated that more dissolved organics especially the biodegradable protein and carbohydrate that can be easily utilized by microbes for methane production were generated from sludge disintegration by ch treatment eem fluorescence technology was then adopted to reflect the biodegradability of dissolved organics under different conditions the results in fig 4 shows that the percent fluorescence responses of region ii iii and v pii n piii n and pv n which represented for non biodegradable substances were all distinctly reduced when treated by ch especially at 1 0 g l dosage in contrast the piv n value that represented for easily biodegraded polysaccharide was markedly promoted from 54 57 in the control to 66 81 and 75 24 in 0 5 and 1 0 g l ch treated reactors respectively fig 4 the results above suggested that the proportion of non biodegradable organics in liquid phase was decreased while biodegradable organics increased by ch treatment which means the biodegradability of dissolved organics was enhanced when treated by ch 3 4 impacts of ch on the biodegradability of humus and lignocellulose substances as shown in table 1 the recalcitrant humus and lignocellulose were largely detected in the raw sludge these substances are usually difficultly utilized by sludge microbes during anaerobic digestion for the poor biodegradability as seen from fig 5 the degradation rates of humic acid fulvic acid lignin cellulose and hemicellulose were respectively 22 5 17 3 5 3 30 9 and 33 2 in the control after anaerobic digestion which means only a small part of recalcitrant substances were adopted as digestion substrates when pretreated by ch the degradation efficiencies of these substances were all enhanced in 0 5 g l ch pretreated reactor the degradation rates of humic acid fulvic acid lignin cellulose and hemicellulose were 34 7 23 1 12 5 48 4 and 55 1 respectively which further enhanced to respectively 52 5 38 8 21 7 60 6 and 72 5 when ch dosage increased to 1 0 g l the data suggested that more recalcitrant substances were consumed when treated by ch which means their biodegradability might be enhanced in ch treatment process to verify whether ch possesses the ability to degrade humus and lignocellulose substances and promote their biodegradability several batch tests using model substances were conducted the degradation of model humus and lignocellulose by ch treatment was firstly explored using uv absorption spectrum technology as depicted in fig s2 the absorbances of ch treated samples were generally lower than the control for example the absorption of humic acid at 260 nm which represented for c c of aromatic ring 33 was reduced from 0 629 to 0 539 after 1 0 g l ch pretreatment indicating that the aromatic c c was partly degraded when treated by ch meanwhile the absorption of humic acid at 240 250 nm that referred to polycyclic compounds was also distinctly reduced by ch treatment which means that the recalcitrant cyclic organic structure was destructed when ch occurred similar results were perceived on other substances fig s2 and the structural changes might bring about the increase of their digestion potentials table 3 further shows the main degradation products of cellulose by 1 0 g l ch treatment there were 23 degradation products being measured among which the alkane like substances accounted for the largest proportion followed by the aldehyde like phenol like ester like and ketone like substances the previous study reported that phenol like substances were probably generated from the destruction of aromatic ring 34 which confirmed our deduction from uv absorption analysis that the aromatic ring in these recalcitrant substrates was largely degraded by ch treatment the ester like substances were reported to be produced from the decomposition of macromolecular substrates 35 the further decomposition of fatty acid esters can produce fatty acids and alcohols which can be both utilized as substrates for methane generation 36 the results indicated that the structure of cellulose was destructed when treated by ch and some biodegradable products were produced as a result fig 6 shows the cumulative methane yields from model substances with different ch contents in which the productions from ch pretreated samples were generally higher than that of the control during entire anaerobic digestion process for instance the methane production in the 0 g l ch pretreated digestor of humic acid group was only 4 72 ml on 10 d digestion which then increased to 5 71 and 7 33 ml in 0 5 and 1 0 g l ch pretreated reactors respectively fig 6a indicating that the biodegradability of humic acid was promoted by ch similar results were found in other model substances fig 6b e which confirmed the stimulative efficacy of ch on recalcitrant substances biodegradability 3 5 shifts of microbial community structure by ch pretreatment functional microbes play vital roles in sludge anaerobic digestion and their abundances are closely related to methane generation performance the microbial communities in digestors with or without ch pretreatment were therefore detected to understand the microcosmic mechanisms for ch enhancing the biomethane production fig s3 depicts the microbial otus in control and ch pretreated digesters it was observed that the total otus reduced from 2508 in the control to 2260 in ch treated digestor which means the diversity of microbial community was decreased by ch treatment as presented in fig 2b many microbes in sludge were killed when treated by ch causing the decrease of microbial diversity in subsequent anaerobic digestion process fig 7 depicts the microbial community structures in the two digesters with or without ch treatment at genus level some microbial species involved in anaerobic digestion were found in both two reactors with the abundances varied a lot under different conditions the three species norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 norank f caldilineaceae and leptolinea are all responsible for the hydrolysis of macromolecular organics 28 37 and their total abundance was enhanced from 5 51 in the control to 6 45 in ch treated digestor besides hydrolytic species there were several acidogens detected in both control and ch treated digesters including blvii28 wastewater sludge group norank f cloacimonadaceae romboutsia smithella unclassifed f anaerolineaceae norank f norank o saccharimonadales exilispira norank f anaerolineaceae and longilinea among them blvii28 wastewater sludge group can ferment carbohydrate to produce h2 and acetate 38 and the abundances were 0 94 and 1 67 in control and ch treated digestors respectively the genera norank f cloacimonadaceae and smithella can both utilize propionate to produce acetic acid 39 40 were respectively enriched from 1 47 and 0 70 in the control to 3 69 and 1 28 in ch pretreated reactor romboutsia a vfas producer with glucose served as the substrate 41 was enriched by 1 96 after ch treatment the genera unclassifed f anaerolineaceae norank f anaerolineaceae and longilinea can all degrade carbohydrates for vfas production 25 42 and their abundances were respectively enhanced from 0 90 1 33 and 2 03 in the control to 0 93 1 58 and 2 42 in ch treated digestor the norank f norank o saccharimonadales a specie that can utilize various of substrates to produce vfas was enriched from 0 53 to 0 79 by ch treatment exilispira was closely related to medium chain fatty acids mcfas generation in anaerobic digestion process 43 and the abundances were 0 90 and 0 93 in control and ch treated digestors respectively further calculation showed that the total abundance of acidogens was enhanced from 9 82 in the control to 16 87 in ch pretreated digestor the largely generated hydrogen and acetic acid in acidification process can be adopted to produce methane by different kinds of methanogens two methanogenic species methanosaeta and methanolinea were measured in both two digestors the abundances of these two methanogens were both decreased by ch treatment with the total values calculated to be 2 39 and 1 88 in control and ch treated digestors respectively methanogens are very sensitive to adverse environment 44 45 which could be the possible reason for the decreased abundance when treated by ch in terms of the above analysis though the abundance of methanogen were decreased the decreasing extent was largely lower than the increase of hydrolytic and acidogenic microbes and the total abundance of all functional microbes participated in sludge anaerobic digestion including hydrolytic microbes acidogens and methanogens was enhanced from 17 72 in the control to 25 20 in ch treated digestor the results demonstrated that the microbial community structure in ch treated digestor was more beneficial to sludge anaerobic digestion which was an important factor for the promoted methane yield fig 1 3 6 economic analysis of ch pretreatment method economic rationality including two factors of investment and production must be considered when technologies are applied in engineering practice the economic analysis of the ch based method was conducted according to the references and the results obtained in this work 46 47 from table 4 the benefit of methane and chemical cost were 63 01 and 52 08 t tss respectively which means the production surpassed the investment and the net benefit was calculated to be 10 93 t tss this result suggested that the ch based technology well achieved the balance between economy and efficacy making it possible for putting into large scale application based on the same method the net benefits of several commonly used chemical oxidants including sodium persulfate calcium peroxide and potassium ferrate in sludge pretreatment were investigated 16 22 48 as presented in table s3 the net benefit of sodium persulfate calcium peroxide and potassium ferrate oxidization methods were calculated to be 72 90 96 64 and 458 82 t tss respectively suggesting that the productions of these methods cannot cover the investments and extra cost is needed in the treatment process it is worth noting that ch oxidization method attained higher benefit than sodium persulfate calcium peroxide and potassium ferrate despite the increase of methane production was not the highest among these oxidants which is mainly due to the low price of ch agent the advantage in economy of ch pretreatment method brings about enormous potential for industrialized application compared with other methods 4 conclusion in this work the impact of ch on sludge anaerobic digestion system as well as underlying mechanisms was systematically studied the biomethane yield showed a first increase and then decrease trend when ch dosage increased from 0 to 1 25 g l with a maximum yield of 220 5 6 2 ml g vss attained under 1 0 g l ch condition which was 33 8 higher than the control group mechanism study demonstrated that ch not only enhanced sludge disintegration efficiency but also promoted the biodegradability of dissolved organics especially for the recalcitrant humus and lignocellulose substances microbial community analysis indicated that functional microbes were largely enriched in ch treated digestor economic analysis demonstrated that the balance between economy and efficacy was achieved by ch pretreatment method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

12771,the application of calcium hypochlorite ch in waste activated sludge was treatment for enhancing the anaerobic digestion performance has been widely investigated in recent years however the underlying mechanisms for ch affecting the biomethane yield during sludge anaerobic digestion are still largely unknown this work explored the impacts of ch with different contents on anaerobic methane generation from sludge as well as the relevant mechanisms experimental results showed that the biomethane production firstly increased from 164 8 4 2 to 220 5 6 2 ml g vss volatile suspended solids with ch content raised from 0 to 1 0 g l which then started to decrease with further increased ch content mechanism analysis demonstrated that ch efficiently disintegrated sludge flocs producing more biodegradable organics for anaerobic digestion beyond that the biodegradability of recalcitrant humus and lignocellulose substances was enhanced by ch treatment as higher methane yields were attained from ch treated model substrates when compared with the control microbial community analysis indicated that most of the functional microbes were enriched after ch treatment with the total abundance detected to be 17 72 and 25 20 in control and ch pretreated reactors respectively economic calculations demonstrated that the benefit of the ch based method efficaciously covered the cost indicating that the balance between economy and technology was achieved graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords calcium hypochlorite waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion methane production data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction how to dispose the hugely generated waste activated sludge was from sewage treatment plants stps has become a thorny problem to the operators in recent years anaerobic digestion seems to be the answer by which was can be well stabilized and several bioproducts can be recycled 1 2 however the anaerobic digestion efficiency of sludge is usually very low which is mainly caused by two factors 1 the insufficient disintegration effect 2 the abundantly existed recalcitrant substances such as humus and lignocellulose that are rarely utilized by anaerobes in other words sludge anaerobic digestion performance could be largely promoted if these factors are optimized many pretreatment methods for enhancing sludge disintegration efficiency have been proposed in last decade including chemical 3 physical 4 biological 5 and combined 6 methods calcium hypochlorite ch oxidization is a chemical method for sludge treatment by which the sludge flocs can be efficiently destructed causing the enhancement of disintegration effect for instance liang et al 7 reported that sludge eps extracellular polymeric substances structure was effectively disrupted by ch pretreatment at 5 to 100 mg g dry solids ds dosage range and the protein and polysaccharide contents in liquid phase were both significantly enhanced as a result the research of zhang et al 8 indicated that the contents of dissolved carbohydrate and protein were gradually enhanced when ch dosage increased from 0 to 0 2 g g total suspended solids tss and volatile fatty acids vfas were largely produced from ch treated sludge samples in anaerobic fermentation our previously published work showed that except for vfas the hydrogen yield from sludge was also markedly promoted by ch in anaerobic fermentation process 9 wu et al 10 reported that sludge anaerobic digestion performance was enhanced for largely increased disintegration effect by ch treatment and the biomethane production was significantly enhanced by 59 7 when ch content was 0 24 g g volatile solids vs yu et al 11 reported that sludge soluble chemical oxygen demand scod content was sufficiently promoted by ch treatment producing more substrates for anaerobic digestion and the methanation rate was promoted by 51 57 at ch content of 0 1 g g tss the humus and lignocellulose substances typically account for respectively 15 28 and 14 44 of total organics in sludge 12 13 which are rarely utilized in traditional anaerobic digestion process there are some methods reported to be efficient to enhance the biodegradability of these recalcitrant substances among which chemical oxidization method has attracted great attentions 14 15 in treatment process the structures of humus and lignocellulose can be destructed resulting in the decrease of polymerization degree and generation of easily biodegraded substrates for example wang et al 16 reported that the biomethane productions from humic acid fulvic acid hemicellulose lignin and cellulose were all significantly promoted by calcium peroxide pretreatment which was mainly because of that these substances were partly degraded in treatment process and some biodegradable products were generated song et al 17 adopted hydrogen peroxide to pretreat rice straw and found that the internal cellulose hemicellulose and lignin were all largely degraded after pretreatment causing 88 0 increase of biomethane yield in subsequent anaerobic digestion process michalska et al 18 utilized fenton s reagent to pretreat three plant species sorghum moensch sida hermaphrodita and miscanthus giganteus which contained abundant lignocellulose with the delignification degree measured to be respectively 48 1 62 3 and 30 3 after pretreatment and the methane yields were all largely enhanced in consequence in addition the oxidants ozone and peracetic acid were also reported to be efficient in increasing the biodegradability of lignocellulose substances 19 21 according to the analysis above the humus and lignocellulose substances may be also well degraded by ch because the hypochlorous acid with strong oxidability can be generated when ch is added into aqueous solution eq 1 hence except for the increase of disintegration efficiency proved by previous studies 10 11 we hypothesized that another important reason for ch pretreatment promoting sludge methane production is the enhanced biodegradability of recalcitrant substances which has not been investigated till now 1 clo h 2 o oh hclo the target of the study is therefore to reveal how dose ch affect sludge anaerobic digestion system from the perspectives of both sludge disintegration and recalcitrant substances degradation firstly the methane yields from sludge by ch treatment at the contents of 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 25 g l were investigated after that the underlying mechanisms were explored through eps and microbial cells destruction variations of organics biodegradability recalcitrant substances degradation and shift of microbial community finally economic analysis of the ch pretreatment technology was conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and ch the was was obtained from bailonggang stp in shanghai china before applied for anaerobic digestion the was was filtered by a sieve 2 0 2 0 mm to remove impurities and the main properties are exhibited in table 1 ch in solid state 65 purity was acquired from shanghai aladdin company in china 2 2 pretreatment and batch methane producing experiment in this test 6 serum bottles v 500 ml were adopted as anaerobic reactors firstly each reactor received 150 ml was as the digestion substrate then different amounts of ch were dosed into the reactors to obtain the concentration gradient of 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 25 g l after stirred for 12 h using a magnetic stirrer to mix the reagent and was well each reactor was inoculated with 150 ml inoculum that obtained from a long term operated sludge anaerobic digestor and the main properties are provided in table 1 at last each reactor was flushed with nitrogen gas for 3 min then sealed by a rubber stopper and placed in an air bath shaker 35 c 150 rpm for anaerobic digestion the methane yield was daily detected in the whole anaerobic digestion process according to that demonstrated in our previous study 22 2 3 evaluating the impacts of ch on sludge disintegration and biodegradability of dissolved organics when sludge pretreatments were completed the scod soluble protein and carbohydrate contents in the reactors with diverse ch concentrations were measured based on the previously published methods 23 25 most organics in sludge exist in the eps including tb eps and lb eps that tightly and lightly bound with microbial cells respectively these two kinds of eps in different sludge samples with or without ch treatment were extracted by a heat method 26 in addition the destruction of microbial cells after ch treatment was revealed by detecting the releases of dna and lactate dehydrogenase ldh which were two frequently utilized indicators reflecting the integrity of sludge microbes 27 except for biodegradable substances such as protein and carbohydrate many recalcitrant organics are also released into sludge liquor in disintegration process the biodegradability of sludge liquor with or without pretreatment was evaluated by detecting the excitation emission matrix eem spectra through a fluorescence spectrometer hitachi f 7000 japan the operational procedures and data processing method were consistent with that reported in our previous work 28 2 4 revealing the impacts of ch on the biodegradability of humus and lignocellulose humus and lignocellulose are the main recalcitrant organics contained in sludge as shown in table 1 and are difficultly utilized by anaerobes during anaerobic digestion five batch tests using different model substances were performed to explore the effect of ch on the degradation and biodegradability of these recalcitrant organics named as test i to v respectively test i this test contained three anaerobic reactors each with a working volume of 500 ml firstly each reactor received 150 ml the same synthetic wastewater with 1147 mg l humic acid served as the only component which was consistent with that detected in raw was table 1 then different amounts of ch were dosed into the reactors to obtain the concentration gradient of 0 0 5 and 1 0 g l afterwards each reactor was stirred at 600 rpm for 12 h and immediately inoculated with 150 ml digested sludge at last each of the reactors was flushed with n2 and sealed for anaerobic digestion according to that demonstrated in section 2 2 methane productions in different reactors with or without pretreatment were daily measured in whole 10 days reaction by which the impacts of ch on humic acid biodegradability were reflected test ii the operations were the same as that conducted in test i except that humic acid was replaced by 752 mg l fulvic acid test iii this test was conducted by the same procedures demonstrated in test i apart from that 845 mg l lignin alkali substituted humic acid as the model substrate test iv all operations of the test were in accord with test i apart from that humic acid was replaced by 1075 mg l carboxymethylcellulose sodium to be the model substrate test v the test was conducted by the same procedures with test i except that 530 mg l xylan substituted humic acid to be the solo digestion substrate 2 5 analytical methods sludge vss and tss were measured according to the literature 25 the concentrations of humus and lignocellulose substances were measured by the same method conducted in our previous work 22 the ldh content was detected based on the method demonstrated in our previous work 9 and the dna was detected according to that reported in the literature 29 the generation of oh and cl radicals in ch treatment process was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance epr technology the ultraviolet uv absorption spectra of recalcitrant substances at 200 400 nm wavelength range were measured using an uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa and the degradation products of cellulose were detected by a gc ms instrument agilent 7890a 5975c usa methane contents and total biogas productions were measured according to that illustrated in our previous study 22 the methane production potential b0 and hydrolysis rate k under different conditions were evaluated using the first order kinetic model based on the procedures conducted in our previous work 30 microbial communities in different reactors were detected on tenth day of anaerobic digestion using illumina miseq sequencing technique and

fitted curves of the first order kinetic model and the simulated parameters are shown in table 2 the two parameters b0 and k both significantly changed with increased ch contents for example the b0 represented for methane production potential was firstly enhanced from 179 5 1 8 to 232 9 3 8 ml g vss and then decreased to 220 7 3 0 ml g vss with ch content increased from 0 to 1 25 g l the k value referred to hydrolysis rate showed similar variation trend which was promoted from 0 088 0 002 to 0 112 0 004 d 1 with the increase of ch dosage from 0 to 1 0 g l while further increased ch dosage of 1 25 g l resulted in the decrease of k to 0 102 0 003 d 1 though decreasing trends were observed in both b0 and k at high ch content of 1 25 g l the values of 220 7 3 0 ml g vss and 0 102 0 003 d 1 were still significantly higher than that without ch treatment p values were respectively 0 007 and 0 003 the results above indicated that sludge methane production potential and hydrolysis rate were

of these substances were all enhanced in 0 5 g l ch pretreated reactor the degradation rates of humic acid fulvic acid lignin cellulose and hemicellulose were 34 7 23 1 12 5 48 4 and 55 1 respectively which further enhanced to respectively 52 5 38 8 21 7 60 6 and 72 5 when ch dosage increased to 1 0 g l the data suggested that more recalcitrant substances were consumed when treated by ch which means their biodegradability might be enhanced in ch treatment process to verify whether ch possesses the ability to degrade humus and lignocellulose substances and promote their biodegradability several batch tests using model substances were conducted the degradation of model humus and lignocellulose by ch treatment was firstly explored using uv absorption spectrum technology as depicted in fig s2 the absorbances of ch treated samples were generally lower than the control for example the absorption of humic acid at 260 nm which represented for c c of aromatic ring 33 was reduced from 0 629 to 0 539 after 1 0 g l ch pretreatment indicating that the aromatic c c was partly degraded when treated by ch meanwhile the absorption of humic acid at 240 250 nm that referred to polycyclic compounds was also distinctly reduced by ch treatment which means that the recalcitrant cyclic organic structure was destructed when ch occurred similar results were perceived on other substances fig s2 and the structural changes might bring about the increase of their digestion potentials table 3 further shows the main degradation products of cellulose by 1 0 g l ch treatment there were 23 degradation products being measured among which the alkane like substances accounted for the largest proportion followed by the aldehyde like phenol like ester like and ketone like substances the previous study reported that phenol like substances were probably generated from the destruction of aromatic ring 34 which confirmed our deduction from uv absorption analysis that the aromatic ring in these recalcitrant substrates was largely degraded by ch treatment the ester like substances were reported to be produced from the decomposition of macromolecular substrates 35 the further decomposition of fatty acid esters can produce fatty acids and alcohols which can be both utilized as substrates for methane generation 36 the results indicated that the structure of cellulose was destructed when treated by ch and some biodegradable products were produced as a result fig 6 shows the cumulative methane yields from model substances with different ch contents in which the productions from ch pretreated samples were generally higher than that of the control during entire anaerobic digestion process for instance the methane production in the 0 g l ch pretreated digestor of humic acid group was only 4 72 ml on 10 d digestion which then increased to 5 71 and 7 33 ml in 0 5 and 1 0 g l ch pretreated reactors respectively fig 6a indicating that the biodegradability of humic acid was promoted by ch similar results were found in other model substances fig 6b e which confirmed the stimulative efficacy of ch on recalcitrant substances biodegradability 3 5 shifts of microbial community structure by ch pretreatment functional microbes play vital roles in sludge anaerobic digestion and their abundances are closely related to methane generation performance the microbial communities in digestors with or without ch pretreatment were therefore detected to understand the microcosmic mechanisms for ch enhancing the biomethane production fig s3 depicts the microbial otus in control and ch pretreated digesters it was observed that the total otus reduced from 2508 in the control to 2260 in ch treated digestor which means the diversity of microbial community was decreased by ch treatment as presented in fig 2b many microbes in sludge were killed when treated by ch causing the decrease of microbial diversity in subsequent anaerobic digestion process fig 7 depicts the microbial community structures in the two digesters with or without ch treatment at genus level some microbial species involved in anaerobic digestion were found in both two reactors with the abundances varied a lot under different conditions the three species norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 norank f caldilineaceae and leptolinea are all responsible for the hydrolysis of macromolecular organics 28 37 and their total abundance was enhanced from 5 51 in the control to 6 45 in ch treated digestor besides hydrolytic species there were several acidogens detected in both control and ch treated digesters including blvii28 wastewater sludge group norank f cloacimonadaceae romboutsia smithella unclassifed f anaerolineaceae norank f norank o saccharimonadales exilispira norank f anaerolineaceae and longilinea among them blvii28 wastewater sludge group can ferment carbohydrate to produce h2 and acetate 38 and the abundances were 0 94 and 1 67 in control and ch treated digestors respectively the genera norank f cloacimonadaceae and smithella can both utilize propionate to produce acetic acid 39 40 were respectively enriched from 1 47 and 0 70 in the control to 3 69 and 1 28 in ch pretreated reactor romboutsia a vfas producer with glucose served as the substrate 41 was enriched by 1 96 after ch treatment the genera unclassifed f anaerolineaceae norank f anaerolineaceae and longilinea can all degrade carbohydrates for vfas production 25 42 and their abundances were respectively enhanced from 0 90 1 33 and 2 03 in the control to 0 93 1 58 and 2 42 in ch treated digestor the norank f norank o saccharimonadales a specie that can utilize various of substrates to produce vfas was enriched from 0 53 to 0 79 by ch treatment exilispira was closely related to medium chain fatty acids mcfas generation in anaerobic digestion process 43 and the abundances were 0 90 and 0 93 in control and ch treated digestors respectively further calculation showed that the total abundance of acidogens was enhanced from 9 82 in the control to 16 87 in ch pretreated digestor the largely generated hydrogen and acetic acid in acidification process can be adopted to produce methane by different kinds of methanogens two methanogenic species methanosaeta and methanolinea were measured in both two digestors the abundances of these two methanogens were both decreased by ch treatment with the total values calculated to be 2 39 and 1 88 in control and ch treated digestors respectively methanogens are very sensitive to adverse environment 44 45 which could be the possible reason for the decreased abundance when treated by ch in terms of the above analysis though the abundance of methanogen were decreased the decreasing extent was largely lower than the increase of hydrolytic and acidogenic microbes and the total abundance of all functional microbes participated in sludge anaerobic digestion including hydrolytic microbes acidogens and methanogens was enhanced from 17 72 in the control to 25 20 in ch treated digestor the results demonstrated that the microbial community structure in ch treated digestor was more beneficial to sludge anaerobic digestion which was an important factor for the promoted methane yield fig 1 3 6 economic analysis of ch pretreatment method economic rationality including two factors of investment and production must be considered when technologies are applied in engineering practice the economic analysis of the ch based method was conducted according to the references and the results obtained in this work 46 47 from table 4 the benefit of methane and chemical cost were 63 01 and 52 08 t tss respectively which means the production surpassed the investment and the net benefit was calculated to be 10 93 t tss this result suggested that the ch based technology well achieved the balance between economy and efficacy making it possible for putting into large scale application based on the same method the net benefits of several commonly used chemical oxidants including sodium persulfate calcium peroxide and potassium ferrate in sludge pretreatment were investigated 16 22 48 as presented in table s3 the net benefit of sodium persulfate calcium peroxide and potassium ferrate oxidization methods were calculated to be 72 90 96 64 and 458 82 t tss respectively suggesting that the productions of these methods cannot cover the investments and extra cost is needed in the treatment process it is worth noting that ch oxidization method attained higher benefit than sodium persulfate calcium peroxide and potassium ferrate despite the increase of methane production was not the highest among these oxidants which is mainly due to the low price of ch agent the advantage in economy of ch pretreatment method brings about enormous potential for industrialized application compared with other methods 4 conclusion in this work the impact of ch on sludge anaerobic digestion system as well as underlying mechanisms was systematically studied the biomethane yield showed a first increase and then decrease trend when ch dosage increased from 0 to 1 25 g l with a maximum yield of 220 5 6 2 ml g vss attained under 1 0 g l ch condition which was 33 8 higher than the control group mechanism study demonstrated that ch not only enhanced sludge disintegration efficiency but also promoted the biodegradability of dissolved organics especially for the recalcitrant humus and lignocellulose substances microbial community analysis indicated that functional microbes were largely enriched in ch treated digestor economic analysis demonstrated that the balance between economy and efficacy was achieved by ch pretreatment method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

12772,efficient nitrogen n removal from mariculture wastewater is one of the important measures to protect the marine ecological environment a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr inoculating heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hnad bacteria was set and the effects of chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn cod tn ratios on n removal performance enzymatic activity biofilm characteristics and microbial community were discussed results showed that a more stable n removal performance was obtained in the mbbr process inoculating hnad bacteria under low cod tn ratio compared with the conventional mbbr the removal efficiency of nitrate nitrogen no3 n declined with cod tn ratio decrease and protein pn and polysaccharide ps concentration decreased from 284 3 and 37 1 mg g vss 1 to 42 9 and 14 4 mg g vss 1 with low ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite reductase nir and nitrate reductase nr activities sequencing analysis revealed that strain zobellella b307 became the dominant microorganism the relatively abundance is 2 33 5 60 and its relatively abundance and the functional genes related to n metabolism reduced from 15 38 to 9 66 and 0 61 to 0 55 with cod tn ratio decrease to explain the reason for the decrease of n removal efficiency this study can provide a deep insight into n removal mechanism of the reactor inoculating hnad bacteria under different cod tn ratios keywords mariculture wastewater hnad cod tn ratio functional genes prediction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased demand for seafood leads to the continuous growth for aquaculture production at an annual rate of 7 5 since 1970 which is expected to reach 102 mt in 2025 1 the fast growing mariculture industry in the world inevitably brings a large amount of mariculture wastewater which contains large amounts of inorganic nitrogen compounds organic matters and hypersaline 2 meanwhile this wastewater is characterized by high salinity 30 35 and low nutrient concentrations chemical oxygen demand cod 50 120 mg l 1 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 6 13 mg l 1 3 excess mariculture wastewater discharge will result in multiple threats to human health and the marine ecological environment 4 which are creating an urgent need to properly treat mariculture wastewater prior to discharge compared to some physical and chemical methods e g precipitation ozone oxidation and electrochemical oxidation biological treatments were generally taken into consideration for mariculture wastewater treatment on the economic efficiency and eco friendliness 5 previous studies proved that different types of biofilm technologies were effective methods to treat mariculture wastewater such as biofilter 6 constructed wetland 7 8 and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr 7 9 mbbr is regarded as a high quality technology for its moderate cost and simple operation 10 however the weak denitrification efficiency limits its application to the increasingly stringent wastewater discharge standards in addition high salinity mariculture wastewater could seriously inhibit nitrifying bacteria activity resulting in a significant decrease in nitrification rate 11 the above reasons limit the application of mbbr in mariculture wastewater treatment recently tremendous efforts have been invested to improve nitrogen n removal efficiency of mbbr such as optimizing the operating conditions combining mbbr with other processes and carrier surface modification 12 14 with the renovation or upgrading of these technologies the extra land and increased cost of treatment are always necessary in a biological treatment process the high pollutant removal efficiency is closely related to high activity degrading microorganisms 15 introducing some bacterial strains with strong adaptability and specific functions into biological treatment system is conducive to enriching specific functional species changing microbial community structure and enhancing pollutants removal efficiency 16 recently heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hnad bacteria could simultaneously perform nitrification and denitrification and it was investigated as potential microorganisms for inoculation due to its high conversion efficiency 59 in addition hnad bacteria as a kind of heterotrophic bacteria have higher denitrification performance and growth rates than autotrophic nitrifying bacteria especially under high salinity condition 17 at present many hnad bacteria have been screened and identified from fresh water or sludge such as pseudomonas mendocina ihb602 alcaligenes faecalis nr and pseudomonas stutzeri rch2 18 20 mbbr is highly dependent on the biofilm ecosystem on the moving biological carrier and the physiochemical properties of biofilm play a key role in determining the successful operation of a biofilm reactor 10 for example the organic matter and n removal performance of mbbr are closely associated with the corresponding microbial enzymatic activities of biofilm 21 extracellular polymeric substances eps are the major component of biofilm over 90 to promote the biofilm formation and keep the biofilm structure stability 22 previous studies found that the production and composition of eps are related to the performance of wastewater treatment system 23 in addition mbbr is a microbial driven process in which the bacterial community composition might be responsible for its performance and operation while for bacteria picrust is preferred to explore the change of microbial functional categories in mbbr reactor 2 many factors were found to be linked to variation of biofilm including the influent cod total nitrogen tn ratio oxygen temperature and so on the cod tn ratio in mariculture wastewater will be obviously different due to different aquaculture organisms and cultured modes which is a vital operating parameter to determine the amount of available carbon and significantly impact the microbial community and performance of the mbbr reactor 24 25 however regarding the effect of cod tn ratio on the mbbr with hnad bioaugmentation to treat mariculture wastewater was inadequate therefore it is essential to investigate the biofilm characteristics key enzymatic activity microbial community and metabolic functions under different cod tn ratios in this study a strain zobellella b307 of highly efficient hnad ability the average nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n removal ratio was 6 4 and 8 8 mg l h 1 and strong salt tolerance the high growth and nitrogen removal efficiency at the salinity of 0 65 was successfully proliferated in mbbr and showed high removal efficiency for treating mariculture wastewater the objectives of this research object were 1 to explore the effect of cod tn ratios on pollutant removal performance of mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium 2 to elucidate the effect of the cod tn ratio decrease on the key enzymatic activity and biofilm characteristics of reactor 3 to investigate the variations of microbial community structure and metabolic functions as the cod tn ratio decrease 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus two parallel lab scale mbbr reactors n mbbr is the control reactor without strain zobellella b307 inoculation b mbbr bioaugmented with strain zobellella b307 were constructed fig 1 the aerobic tank the working volume of 10 l and the length width height is 500 mm 100 mm 200 mm was fitted with k3 cylindrical hollow filler the filling ratio was 40 and operated with 8 h hydraulic retention time hrt air was introduced into the reactor with a rate of 1 l min 1 through the air diffuser the dissolved oxygen do of aerobic tank was maintained for 4 mg l 1 2 2 bacterium and synthetic mariculture wastewater strain zobellella b307 genbank mf407315 was previously isolated from the sediments of jiaozhou bay shandong china the synthetic mariculture wastewater was prepared according to chen et al 26 the constituent of synthetic mariculture wastewater per l fed into the mbbr reactor were conducted as follows nh4cl 18 mg nano2 3 mg nano3 30 mg kh2po4 15 mg sodium carbonate 130 mg and sodium acetate 210 mg 157 5 mg 105 mg 52 5 mg the concentrated seawater was added to maintain the salinity at 30 1 this composition mimics synthetic wastewater characteristics corresponding to an initial nh4 n no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n concentration throughout the study period were 4 7 0 47 0 6 0 08 and4 9 0 47 mg l 1 respectively the volumetric loading rates of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 0 14 0 02 0 15 kg m3 d respectively in experimental operational phases the cod concentration of influent were 163 8 1 3 122 1 1 2 84 5 1 2 and 42 7 1 4 mg l 1 corresponding to cod tn ratio at 16 12 8 and 4 respectively and the volumetric loading rates of cod was 4 89 3 66 2 52 1 26 kg m3 d 2 3 operation strategy during the start up process 500 ml activated sludge was added into both reactors as the initial inoculum activated sludge was obtained from the sludge export in tuandao wastewater treatment plant qingdao china the start up process was carried out under aeration conditions and the dissolved oxygen do was maintained for 4 mg l 1 meanwhile both reactors were operated in batch mode influent exchange ratio is 50 and influent salinity increased from 5 at a rate of 1 per day in this period the nh4 n no3 n no2 n and cod concentration of the synthetic mariculture wastewater was 4 7 0 47 0 6 0 08 4 9 0 47 and 163 8 1 3 mg l 1 which was the same as that of the continuous mode after completing the 26 d acclimation period a thin yellowish brown biofilm appeared on the filler and the removal efficiency of pollutants was relatively stable then b mbbr was inoculated with functional strain zobellella b307 the methods of inoculation are as follows the expanded culture medium was mixed with k3 hollow filler the filling ratio was 40 exchange rate of culture solution was 50 per day and grew on a rotary shaker at 130 rpm and 30 c for 30 d to allow for biofilm formation the expanded culture medium contained the following components per l deionized water nacl 5 g kh2po4 1 5 g mgso4 7h2o 0 01 g na2hpo4 7 9 g c6h5na3o7 5 96 g nano3 0 4268 g nh4cl 0 2686 g and trace element solution 2 ml trace element solution per l deionized water znso4 2 2 g cacl2 5 5 g na2edta 63 70 g mncl2 4h2o 5 06 g feso4 7h2o 5 0 g cuso4 5h2o 1 57 g na2moo4 4h2o 1 1 g and cocl2 6h2o 1 61 g after that a 200 ml medium mixed with enrichment suspension and carrier of strain zobellella b307 was seeded for b mbbr after inoculating the strains zobellella b307 into b mbbr both reactors were operated in continuous mode for 10 d and a long term running test was carried out in the experimental stage four operational phases were involved phase i cod tn ratio 16 from day 1 to 20 phase ii cod tn ratio 12 from day 21 to 40 phase iii cod tn ratio 8 from day 41 to 60 phase iv cod tn ratio 4 day 61 to 80 sodium acetate was reduced accordingly to decrease the cod concentration of influent to adjust the influent cod tn ratio in four phases with the cod tn ratios of 16 12 and 8 and 4 2 4 analytical methods the influent and effluent quality of cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were detected every 2 days according to the standard methods 27 biofilm samples were collected at the end of each operational phase to measure key enzymatic activity eps and excitation emission matrices eem ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrite reductase nir nitrate reductase nr were measured according to a previous description 21 measurement of protein pn and polysaccharide ps was conducted through lowry method and phenol sulfuric acid method described by zhang et al 28 29 the eem was recorded by a fluorescence spectrophotometer fs5 spectrophotometer edinburgh uk following the procedures 30 one way analysis of variance anova was performed and differences were considered significant when p 0 05 2 5 microbial community analysis biofilm samples under influent cod tn ratio of 16 8 and 4 were obtained from the mbbr reactor with the inoculation of hnad bacteria at the end of the operation which were named cn16 cn8 and cn4 then the power soil dna isolation kit mobio carlsbad usa was used to extract dna the forward primer and the reverse primer were 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 338f was 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 907r the purified dna was used for high throughput pyrosequencing of 16s rrna bacterial genes novogene technology co ltd beijing china according to the standard protocol moreover the picrust was adopted to predict the impact of cod tn ratio on the metabolic pathways of mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium with different cod tn ratios the variations of organic pollutants and n removal performances under different cod tn ratios 16 12 8 and 4 are shown in fig 2 bioaugmentation with strain zobellella b307 brought a remarkable promotion for cod and n removal efficiency cod 95 57 nh4 n 94 44 no3 n 85 67 for treating mariculture wastewater as the influent cod tn ratio decreased the effluent cod concentration fluctuated little and did not exceed 10 mg l 1 which implied that the stable and efficient removal of organic pollutants could still be achieved during the whole experiment during cod tn ratio deceased from 16 to 4 nh4 n removal efficiency had no obvious change 94 4 91 7 which meant that the cod tn ratio had little influence on nh4 n removal an obvious impact on no3 n removal one way anova p 0 05 was observed in response to the influent cod tn ratio decrease carbon source is a crucial energy and electron source for heterotrophic bacteria the no3 n removal efficiency decreased which might due to insufficient supply of carbon source used for denitrification process 31 performances comparison between the conventional mbbr and the mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium under different cod tn ratios are shown in fig 3 for cod and nh4 n removal it was observed that both reactors exhibited higher removal efficiency under different cod tn ratios nevertheless as cod tn ratio decreased the significantly higher no3 n and no2 n removal performances were obtained in b mbbr one way anova p 0 05 which demonstrated the superiority of mbbr inoculating hnad bacteria in treating mariculture wastewater this result indicated that adding the hnad bacteria into mbbr system could ensure a more stable removal performance with changes of the influent cod tn ratio 3 2 changes in enzymes activities with different cod tn ratios the n removal corresponding enzymatic activity under different cod tn ratios was analyzed to elucidate the change of n removal performance fig 4 as the decrease of cod tn ratio the gradual decrease of amo activities suggested that lower cod concentration would inhibit the nitrifying enzymatic activity which consisted of the nh4 n removal efficiency different from traditional autotrophic nitrifying bacteria the biochemical process of hnad is unique and amo nr nir and hydroxylamine oxidase hao play a key role in the process of n conversion 32 insufficient carbon source would inhibit the amo activities of hnad process and further influence the nh4 n removal unlike amo as key nitrification enzymes nor activities gradually increase with the decrease of cod tn ratio indicating that lower cod n ratio would promote the activity of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria the inhibition of denitrification was also confirmed by the variation of nr and nir activities under low cod tn ratio with the decline of influent carbon source concentration the decrease of nr and nir activities was observed nir and nr are the key enzymes for the processes of no2 n reduction and nitrate reduction 16 this downtrend might because that the insufficient influent carbon source inhibited heterotrophic bacteria growth overall the decrease of influent carbon source concentration has a negative impact on the corresponding microbial enzymatic activities in nitrification and denitrification processes resulting in decreased n removal performance 3 3 eps characters with different cod tn ratios as shown in fig 5 the contents of ps and pn were significant affected by the influent cod tn ratio one way anova p 0 05 the highest content of pn 284 3 mg g 1 ss was observed in cod tn ratio of 16 subsequently the content of eps and pn in biofilm gradually decreased with the decline of influent cod concentration in contrary as the decrease of cod tn ratio the content of ps showed an initial increase from 37 1 to 58 7 mg g vss 1 but gradually decreased previous studies found that the production and composition of eps related to nutrient levels of substrate 33 additionally the microorganisms would degrade the eps as carbon resource under starvation which leads to the eps content reduction this downtrend consisted of previous research 34 which also showed a decline of active biomass on biofilm with the cod tn decrease besides the higher pn content in eps during the experimental period could be attributed to the vital role of pn in biofilm stability and structure 35 to elucidate the relationship between the eps characteristics and cod tn ratios the organic components in eps change under different cod tn ratio were determined by eem fluorescence spectroscopy fig 6 the eem spectra were mainly divided by tyrosine like aromatic proteins i tryptophan like aromatic proteins ii fulvic acid iii soluble metabolites iv and humic like fluorescence v 36 37 three main peaks 230 475 485 nm fulvic acid ex em 280 345 355 nm soluble metabolites and ex em 225 330 340 aromatic proteins were identified in eps there are no obvious differences in peak position which indicated that the substances within eps samples were identical however the cod tn ratio decrease led to the shifts of eps compositions within the eps the formation of fulvic acid like substances was hypothesized to be related to biological activity 38 as the cod tn ratio decreased the fulvic acid like substances fluorescence intensities decreased which was correspond to the decline of influent organic matter and biological activity besides the soluble metabolites fluorescence intensities decreased indicated that the decline of source concentration inhibited bacterial metabolic activity related to hnad efficiency 36 39 3 4 microbial community structure with different cod tn ratios 3 4 1 microbial diversity to analyze the bacterial community compositions under different cod tn ratios high throughput sequencing technique was conducted the goods coverage index of both samples exceeded 99 table 1 revealing that the results basically covered the majority of the bacterial in each sample which was also proved by rarefaction curves fig 7a operational taxonomic units otu overlap analysis fig 7b showed the share otu under different cod tn ratio was about 476 indicated that a certain number of bacteria always existed in mbbr system with hnad bioaugmentation moreover with the decrease of cod tn ratio the shannon simpson chao1 and ace index values gradually decreased which was consistent with previous results of cod tn ratio effect in high saline wastewater treatment 40 generally the chao1 indexes and the ace indexes values could reflect the bacterial richness and the shannon and simpson index values were used to estimate community diversity the larger shannon simpson chao1 and ace index values show higher bacterial richness and the bacterial diversity of the microbial community 41 the shannon simpson chao1 and ace index values gradually decreased which could be attributed to the inhibition of the growth of heterotrophic bacteria owing to the reduction of influent carbon source concentration 16 40 3 4 2 structural analysis of microbial community the changes in bacterial community composition were analyzed to evaluate the influence of cod tn ratios on mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium fig 8 like many bio treatment systems 16 42 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were dominant in reactor with a total effective sequence of 55 1 60 0 which was detected to be related to n removal it was reported that a number of members of firmicutes and actinobacteria were well known degraders of complex organic matters ps and pn 43 44 given the coinciding increases of firmicutes and actinobacteria with the reduction of ps and pn under the decrease cod tn ratio these phyla may be involved in degrading extracellular matrix by further analyzing the microbial communities at the genus level more detailed differences with the change of cod tn ratio could be observed fig 8b as the inoculation of bioaugmentation the relative abundance of zobellella b307 were 2 33 5 60 and 3 21 under all cod tn ratios although strain zobellella b307 was not dominant in b mbbr it could remain in b mbbr and play a role in n removal even under low cod tn ratio condition many kinds of functional bacteria have been applied in bioreactors in previous studies 45 46 but it was difficult to determine the role of those for the competition between inoculated bacteria and indigenous strains which would make the inoculum not easily remain in the reactor 47 the microbial community result further demonstrated that the strain zobellella b307 could remain in b mbbr which may be due to excellent competition of zobellella in previous study zobellella was found to be the most important aerobic denitrifier in constructed wetland system 48 twelve functional bacteria related to denitrification denitrifying bacteria and hnad bacteria were identified in the system fig 8c six dominant hn ad genera paracoccus azoarcus rhodococcus zobellella marinobacter and gordonia were discovered 49 52 58 as the cod tn ratios decrease the total abundance of hnad decreased slightly i e 15 38 10 00 and 9 66 coinciding with the decrease of n removal efficiency in addition to this bacteria related to denitrification were also observed sulfurimonas xanthomarina sulfurovum marinicella denitromonas and pseudoxanthomonas 42 53 55 the total abundance of denitrifying bacteria was 6 82 3 19 and 2 58 with the decline of cod tn ratio respectively hnad bacteria and other bacteria related to denitrification coexisted in the n removal system however the abundance of bacteria related to denitrification was lower than that of hnad bacteria during the decrease of cod tn ratio implying that hnad was the dominant pathway for n removal when the cod tn ratio decreased to 4 hnad bacteria in the reactor still maintained a relatively high abundance 9 66 which indicated a stronger tolerance of hnad bacteria to insufficient carbon chen et al 26 also found the similar result that the total abundance of hnad exhibited relative stability range from 20 33 to 11 20 during cod tn ratio deceased from 15 to 4 in addition in previous studies it was found that hnad bacteria have strong adaptability to different carbon sources cod tn ratios ph salinity and temperature and maintain high n removal efficiency 56 all these may contribute to a more stable removal efficiency of mbbr inoculating hnad bacteria than conventional mbbr under low cod tn ratio as indicated in section 3 1 3 5 functional genes prediction with different cod tn ratios variation of the potential functions of bacterial microbiota analysis using the kegg database can provide in depth and detailed analysis of these functional traits for the impacts of cod tn ratio at the level 1 of pathways modules the main dominant functional categories were carbohydrate metabolism 46 4 46 8 genetic information processing 21 2 22 6 environmental information processing 12 9 13 7 and cellular processes 7 5 7 8 fig 9a carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were the key metabolic modes of microorganisms accounting for 9 indicating that organic compounds and ammonia utilization were the mainly carbon source and n source for microbial cell metabolism 49 50 carbohydrate metabolism plays key roles in degradation of complex organics 57 and the relative abundance of carbohydrate metabolism decreases with the decrease of cod tn ratio however the relative abundances of amino acid and energy metabolism increased these outcomes were a response of microorganisms under the condition of insufficient carbon source they would decompose eps as energy as mentioned in section 3 3 in addition the genes related to transcription replication and repair declined indicating bacterial activity and biomass decreased under the low cod tn ratio condition in energy metabolism the decrease of cod tn ratio resulted in a decrease trends for the main functional metabolic pathways such as carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism similar to the abundance of n removal functional bacteria the abundance related to n metabolism was reduced from 0 61 to 0 55 with the reduction of influent carbon source which further explained the reason of decrease n removal efficiency within the amino acid metabolism with reduction of influent cod concentration the relative abundances of lysine degradation phenylalanine metabolism and histidine metabolism were the main functions and showed an increase trend fig 9e microorganisms would promote degrade pn into small molecular substances under carbon source deficiency condition 33 the decline of cod tn ratio probably stimulated these amino acid metabolism subcategories which was conducive to utilizing amino acids as carbon source and energy under starvation 4 conclusion an economical and efficient mbbr mariculture wastewater system inoculating hnad bacterium strain zobellella b307 was established and evaluated for pollutant removal with different cod tn ratios by inoculating hnad bacteria mbbr achieved a more stable nutrients removal performance under low influent cod tn ratio microbiological analysis indicated that the decline of cod tn ratio could not affect the abundance of inoculation strain zobellella b307 however the abundance of identified hnad bacteria other denitrifying bacteria and functional genes involved in n metabolism decreased gradually which led to the n removal efficiency decline this study will contribute to a further understanding the effect of cod tn ratio on the pollutant removal performance in a biological treatment system for mariculture wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12772,efficient nitrogen n removal from mariculture wastewater is one of the important measures to protect the marine ecological environment a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr inoculating heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hnad bacteria was set and the effects of chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn cod tn ratios on n removal performance enzymatic activity biofilm characteristics and microbial community were discussed results showed that a more stable n removal performance was obtained in the mbbr process inoculating hnad bacteria under low cod tn ratio compared with the conventional mbbr the removal efficiency of nitrate nitrogen no3 n declined with cod tn ratio decrease and protein pn and polysaccharide ps concentration decreased from 284 3 and 37 1 mg g vss 1 to 42 9 and 14 4 mg g vss 1 with low ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite reductase nir and nitrate reductase nr activities sequencing analysis revealed that strain zobellella b307 became the dominant microorganism the relatively abundance is 2 33 5 60 and its relatively abundance and the functional genes related to n metabolism reduced from 15 38 to 9 66 and 0 61 to 0 55 with cod tn ratio decrease to explain the reason for the decrease of n removal efficiency this study can provide a deep insight into n removal mechanism of the reactor inoculating hnad bacteria under different cod tn ratios keywords mariculture wastewater hnad cod tn ratio functional genes prediction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased demand for seafood leads to the continuous growth for aquaculture production at an annual rate of 7 5 since 1970 which is expected to reach 102 mt in 2025 1 the fast growing mariculture industry in the world inevitably brings a large amount of mariculture wastewater which contains large amounts of inorganic nitrogen compounds organic matters and hypersaline 2 meanwhile this wastewater is characterized by high salinity 30 35 and low nutrient concentrations chemical oxygen demand cod 50 120 mg l 1 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 6 13 mg l 1 3 excess mariculture wastewater discharge will result in multiple threats to human health and the marine ecological environment 4 which are creating an urgent need to properly treat mariculture wastewater prior to discharge compared to some physical and chemical methods e g precipitation ozone oxidation and electrochemical oxidation biological treatments were generally taken into consideration for mariculture wastewater treatment on the economic efficiency and eco friendliness 5 previous studies proved that different types of biofilm technologies were effective methods to treat mariculture wastewater such as biofilter 6 constructed wetland 7 8 and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr 7 9 mbbr is regarded as a high quality technology for its moderate cost and simple operation 10 however the weak denitrification efficiency limits its application to the increasingly stringent wastewater discharge standards in addition high salinity mariculture wastewater could seriously inhibit nitrifying bacteria activity resulting in a significant decrease in nitrification rate 11 the above reasons limit the application of mbbr in mariculture wastewater treatment recently tremendous efforts have been invested to improve nitrogen n removal efficiency of mbbr such as optimizing the operating conditions combining mbbr with other processes and carrier surface modification 12 14 with the renovation or upgrading of these technologies the extra land and increased cost of treatment are always necessary in a biological treatment process the high pollutant removal efficiency is closely related to high activity degrading microorganisms 15 introducing some bacterial strains with strong adaptability and specific functions into biological treatment system is conducive to enriching specific functional species changing microbial community structure and enhancing pollutants removal efficiency 16 recently heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hnad bacteria could simultaneously perform nitrification and denitrification and it was investigated as potential microorganisms for inoculation due to its high conversion efficiency 59 in addition hnad bacteria as a kind of heterotrophic bacteria have higher denitrification performance and growth rates than autotrophic nitrifying bacteria especially under high salinity condition 17 at present many hnad bacteria have been screened and identified from fresh water or sludge such as pseudomonas mendocina ihb602 alcaligenes faecalis nr and pseudomonas stutzeri rch2 18 20 mbbr is highly dependent on the biofilm ecosystem on the moving biological carrier and the physiochemical properties of biofilm play a key role in determining the successful operation of a biofilm reactor 10 for example the organic matter and n removal performance of mbbr are closely associated with the corresponding microbial enzymatic activities of biofilm 21 extracellular polymeric substances eps are the major component of biofilm over 90 to promote the biofilm formation and keep the biofilm structure stability 22 previous studies found that the production and composition of eps are related to the performance of wastewater treatment system 23 in addition mbbr is a microbial driven process in which the bacterial community composition might be responsible for its performance and operation while for bacteria picrust is preferred to explore the change of microbial functional categories in mbbr reactor 2 many factors were found to be linked to variation of biofilm including the influent cod total nitrogen tn ratio oxygen temperature and so on the cod tn ratio in mariculture wastewater will be obviously different due to different aquaculture organisms and cultured modes which is a vital operating parameter to determine the amount of available carbon and significantly impact the microbial community and performance of the mbbr reactor 24 25 however regarding the effect of cod tn ratio on the mbbr with hnad bioaugmentation to treat mariculture wastewater was inadequate therefore it is essential to investigate the biofilm characteristics key enzymatic activity microbial community and metabolic functions under different cod tn ratios in this study a strain zobellella b307 of highly efficient hnad ability the average nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n removal ratio was 6 4 and 8 8 mg l h 1 and strong salt tolerance the high growth and nitrogen removal efficiency at the salinity of 0 65 was successfully proliferated in mbbr and showed high removal efficiency for treating mariculture wastewater the objectives of this research object were 1 to explore the effect of cod tn ratios on pollutant removal performance of mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium 2 to elucidate the effect of the cod tn ratio decrease on the key enzymatic activity and biofilm characteristics of reactor 3 to investigate the variations of microbial community structure and metabolic functions as the cod tn ratio decrease 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus two parallel lab scale mbbr reactors n mbbr is the control reactor without strain zobellella b307 inoculation b mbbr bioaugmented with strain zobellella b307 were constructed fig 1 the aerobic tank the working volume of 10 l and the length width height is 500 mm 100 mm 200 mm was fitted with k3 cylindrical hollow filler the filling ratio was 40 and operated with 8 h hydraulic retention time hrt air was introduced into the reactor with a rate of 1 l min 1 through the air diffuser the dissolved oxygen do of aerobic tank was maintained for 4 mg l 1 2 2 bacterium and synthetic mariculture wastewater strain zobellella b307 genbank mf407315 was previously isolated from the sediments of jiaozhou bay shandong china the synthetic mariculture wastewater was prepared according to chen et al 26 the constituent of synthetic mariculture wastewater per l fed into the mbbr reactor were conducted as follows nh4cl 18 mg nano2 3 mg nano3 30 mg kh2po4 15 mg sodium carbonate 130 mg and sodium acetate 210 mg 157 5 mg 105 mg 52 5 mg the concentrated seawater was added to maintain the salinity at 30 1 this composition mimics synthetic wastewater characteristics corresponding to an initial nh4 n no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n concentration throughout the study period were 4 7 0 47 0 6 0 08 and4 9 0 47 mg l 1 respectively the volumetric loading rates of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 0 14 0 02 0 15 kg m3 d respectively in experimental operational phases the cod concentration of influent were 163 8 1 3 122 1 1 2 84 5 1 2 and 42 7 1 4 mg l 1 corresponding to cod tn ratio at 16 12 8 and 4 respectively and the volumetric loading rates of cod was 4 89 3 66 2 52 1 26 kg m3 d 2 3 operation strategy during the start up process 500 ml activated sludge was added into both reactors as the initial inoculum activated sludge was obtained from the sludge export in tuandao wastewater treatment plant qingdao china the start up process was carried out under aeration conditions and the dissolved oxygen do was maintained for 4 mg l 1 meanwhile both reactors were operated in batch mode influent exchange ratio is 50 and influent salinity increased from 5 at a rate of 1 per day in this period the nh4 n no3 n no2 n and cod concentration of the synthetic mariculture wastewater was 4 7 0 47 0 6 0 08 4 9 0 47 and 163 8 1 3 mg l 1 which was the same as that of the continuous mode after completing the 26 d acclimation period a thin yellowish brown biofilm appeared on the filler and the removal efficiency of pollutants was relatively stable then b mbbr was inoculated with functional strain zobellella b307 the methods of inoculation are as follows the expanded culture medium was mixed with k3 hollow filler the filling ratio was 40 exchange rate of culture solution was 50 per day and grew on a rotary shaker at 130 rpm and 30 c for 30 d to allow for biofilm formation the expanded culture medium contained the following components per l deionized water nacl 5 g kh2po4 1 5 g mgso4 7h2o 0 01 g na2hpo4 7 9 g c6h5na3o7 5 96 g nano3 0 4268 g nh4cl 0 2686 g and trace element solution 2 ml trace element solution per l deionized water znso4 2 2 g cacl2 5 5 g na2edta 63 70 g mncl2 4h2o 5 06 g feso4 7h2o 5 0 g cuso4 5h2o 1 57 g na2moo4 4h2o 1 1 g and cocl2 6h2o 1 61 g after that a 200 ml medium mixed with enrichment suspension and carrier of strain zobellella b307 was seeded for b mbbr after inoculating the strains zobellella b307 into b mbbr both reactors were operated in continuous mode for 10 d and a long term running test was carried out in the experimental stage four operational phases were involved phase i cod tn ratio 16 from day 1 to 20 phase ii cod tn ratio 12 from day 21 to 40 phase iii cod tn ratio 8 from day 41 to 60 phase iv cod tn ratio 4 day 61 to 80 sodium acetate was reduced accordingly to decrease the cod concentration of influent to adjust the influent cod tn ratio in four phases with the cod tn ratios of 16 12 and 8 and 4 2 4 analytical methods the influent and effluent quality of cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were detected every 2 days according to the standard methods 27 biofilm samples were collected at the end of each operational phase to measure key enzymatic activity eps and excitation emission matrices eem ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrite reductase nir nitrate reductase nr were measured according to a previous description 21 measurement of protein pn and polysaccharide ps was conducted through lowry method and phenol sulfuric acid method described by zhang et al 28 29 the eem was recorded by a fluorescence spectrophotometer fs5 spectrophotometer edinburgh uk following the procedures 30 one way analysis of variance anova was performed and differences were considered significant when p 0 05 2 5 microbial community analysis biofilm samples under influent cod tn ratio of 16 8 and 4 were obtained from the mbbr reactor with the inoculation of hnad bacteria at the end of the operation which were named cn16 cn8 and cn4 then the power soil dna isolation kit mobio carlsbad usa was used to extract dna the forward primer and the reverse primer were 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 338f was 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 907r the purified dna was used for high throughput pyrosequencing of 16s rrna bacterial genes novogene technology co ltd beijing china according to the standard protocol moreover the picrust was adopted to predict the impact of cod tn ratio on the metabolic pathways of mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium with different cod tn ratios the variations of organic pollutants and n removal performances under different cod tn ratios 16 12 8 and 4 are shown in fig 2 bioaugmentation with strain zobellella b307 brought a remarkable promotion for cod and n removal efficiency cod 95 57 nh4 n 94 44 no3 n 85 67 for treating mariculture wastewater as the influent cod tn ratio decreased the effluent cod concentration fluctuated little and did not exceed 10 mg l 1 which implied that the stable and efficient removal of organic pollutants could still be achieved during the whole experiment during cod tn ratio deceased from 16 to 4 nh4 n removal efficiency had no obvious change 94 4 91 7 which meant that the cod tn ratio had little influence on nh4 n removal an obvious impact on no3 n removal one way anova p 0 05 was observed in response to the influent cod tn ratio decrease carbon source is a crucial energy and electron source for heterotrophic bacteria the no3 n removal efficiency decreased which might due to insufficient supply of carbon source used for denitrification process 31 performances comparison between the conventional mbbr and the mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium under different cod tn ratios are shown in fig 3 for cod and nh4 n removal it was observed that both reactors exhibited higher removal efficiency under different cod tn ratios nevertheless as cod tn ratio decreased the significantly higher no3 n and no2 n removal performances were obtained in b mbbr one way anova p 0 05 which demonstrated the superiority of mbbr inoculating hnad bacteria in treating mariculture wastewater this result indicated that adding the hnad bacteria into mbbr system could ensure a more stable removal performance with changes of the influent cod tn ratio 3 2 changes in enzymes activities with different cod tn ratios the n removal corresponding enzymatic activity under different cod tn ratios was analyzed to elucidate the change of n removal performance fig 4 as the decrease of cod tn ratio the gradual decrease of amo activities suggested that lower cod concentration would inhibit the nitrifying enzymatic activity which consisted of the nh4 n removal efficiency different from traditional autotrophic nitrifying bacteria the biochemical process of hnad is unique and amo nr nir and hydroxylamine oxidase hao play a key role in the process of n conversion 32 insufficient carbon source would inhibit the amo activities of hnad process and further influence the nh4 n removal unlike amo as key nitrification enzymes nor activities gradually increase with the decrease of cod tn ratio indicating that lower cod n ratio would promote the activity of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria the inhibition of denitrification was also confirmed by the variation of nr and nir activities under low cod tn ratio with the decline of influent carbon source concentration the decrease of nr and nir activities was observed nir and nr are the key enzymes for the processes of no2 n reduction and nitrate reduction 16 this downtrend might because that the insufficient influent carbon source inhibited heterotrophic bacteria growth overall the decrease of influent carbon source concentration has a negative impact on the corresponding microbial enzymatic activities in nitrification and denitrification processes resulting in decreased n removal performance 3 3 eps characters with different cod tn ratios as shown in fig 5 the contents of ps and pn were significant affected by the influent cod tn ratio one way anova p 0 05 the highest content of pn 284 3 mg g 1 ss was observed in cod tn ratio of 16 subsequently the content of eps and pn in biofilm gradually decreased with the decline of influent cod concentration in contrary as the decrease of cod tn ratio the content of ps showed an initial increase from 37 1 to 58 7 mg g vss 1 but gradually decreased previous studies found that the production and composition of eps related to nutrient levels of substrate 33 additionally the microorganisms would degrade the eps as carbon resource under starvation which leads to the eps content reduction this downtrend consisted of previous research 34 which also showed a decline of active biomass on biofilm with the cod tn decrease besides the higher pn content in eps during the experimental period could be attributed to the vital role of pn in biofilm stability and structure 35 to elucidate the relationship between the eps characteristics and cod tn ratios the organic components in eps change under different cod tn ratio were determined by eem fluorescence spectroscopy fig 6 the eem spectra were mainly divided by tyrosine like aromatic proteins i tryptophan like aromatic proteins ii fulvic acid iii soluble metabolites iv and humic like fluorescence v 36 37 three main peaks 230 475 485 nm fulvic acid ex em 280 345 355 nm soluble metabolites and ex em 225 330 340 aromatic proteins were identified in eps there are no obvious differences in peak position which indicated that the substances within eps samples were identical however the cod tn ratio decrease led to the shifts of eps compositions within the eps the formation of fulvic acid like substances was hypothesized to be related to biological activity 38 as the cod tn ratio decreased the fulvic acid like substances fluorescence intensities decreased which was correspond to the decline of influent organic matter and biological activity besides the soluble metabolites fluorescence intensities decreased indicated that the decline of source concentration inhibited bacterial metabolic activity related to hnad efficiency 36 39 3 4 microbial community structure with different cod tn ratios 3 4 1 microbial diversity to analyze the bacterial community compositions under different cod tn ratios high throughput sequencing technique was conducted the goods coverage index of both samples exceeded 99 table 1 revealing that the results basically covered the majority of the bacterial in each sample which was also proved by rarefaction curves fig 7a operational taxonomic units otu overlap analysis fig 7b showed the share otu under different cod tn ratio was about 476 indicated that a certain number of bacteria always existed in mbbr system with hnad bioaugmentation moreover with the decrease of cod tn ratio the shannon simpson chao1 and ace index values gradually decreased which was consistent with previous results of cod tn ratio effect in high saline wastewater treatment 40 generally the chao1 indexes and the ace indexes values could reflect the bacterial richness and the shannon and simpson index values were used to estimate community diversity the larger shannon simpson chao1 and ace index values show higher bacterial richness and the bacterial diversity of the microbial community 41 the shannon simpson chao1 and ace index values gradually decreased which could be attributed to the inhibition of the growth of heterotrophic bacteria owing to the reduction of influent carbon source concentration 16 40 3 4 2 structural analysis of microbial community the changes in bacterial community composition were analyzed to evaluate the influence of cod tn ratios on mbbr inoculating hnad bacterium fig 8 like many bio treatment systems 16 42 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were dominant in reactor with a total effective sequence of 55 1 60 0 which was detected to be related to n removal it was reported that a number of members of firmicutes and actinobacteria were well known degraders of complex organic matters ps and pn 43 44 given the coinciding increases of firmicutes and actinobacteria with the reduction of ps and pn under the decrease cod tn ratio these phyla may be involved in degrading extracellular matrix by further analyzing the microbial communities at the genus level more detailed differences with the change of cod tn ratio could be observed fig 8b as the inoculation of bioaugmentation the relative abundance of zobellella b307 were 2 33 5 60 and 3 21 under all cod tn ratios although strain zobellella b307 was not dominant in b mbbr it could remain in b mbbr and play a role in n removal even under low cod tn ratio condition many kinds of functional bacteria have been applied in bioreactors in previous studies 45 46 but it was difficult to determine the role of those for the competition between inoculated bacteria and indigenous strains which would make the inoculum not easily remain in the reactor 47 the microbial community result further demonstrated that the strain zobellella b307 could remain in b mbbr which may be due to excellent competition of zobellella in previous study zobellella was found to be the most important aerobic denitrifier in constructed wetland system 48 twelve functional bacteria related to denitrification denitrifying bacteria and hnad bacteria were identified in the system fig 8c six dominant hn ad genera paracoccus azoarcus rhodococcus zobellella marinobacter and gordonia were discovered 49 52 58 as the cod tn ratios decrease the total abundance of hnad decreased slightly i e 15 38 10 00 and 9 66 coinciding with the decrease of n removal efficiency in addition to this bacteria related to denitrification were also observed sulfurimonas xanthomarina sulfurovum marinicella denitromonas and pseudoxanthomonas 42 53 55 the total abundance of denitrifying bacteria was 6 82 3 19 and 2 58 with the decline of cod tn ratio respectively hnad bacteria and other bacteria related to denitrification coexisted in the n removal system however the abundance of bacteria related to denitrification was lower than that of hnad bacteria during the decrease of cod tn ratio implying that hnad was the dominant pathway for n removal when the cod tn ratio decreased to 4 hnad bacteria in the reactor still maintained a relatively high abundance 9 66 which indicated a stronger tolerance of hnad bacteria to insufficient carbon chen et al 26 also found the similar result that the total abundance of hnad exhibited relative stability range from 20 33 to 11 20 during cod tn ratio deceased from 15 to 4 in addition in previous studies it was found that hnad bacteria have strong adaptability to different carbon sources cod tn ratios ph salinity and temperature and maintain high n removal efficiency 56 all these may contribute to a more stable removal efficiency of mbbr inoculating hnad bacteria than conventional mbbr under low cod tn ratio as indicated in section 3 1 3 5 functional genes prediction with different cod tn ratios variation of the potential functions of bacterial microbiota analysis using the kegg database can provide in depth and detailed analysis of these functional traits for the impacts of cod tn ratio at the level 1 of pathways modules the main dominant functional categories were carbohydrate metabolism 46 4 46 8 genetic information processing 21 2 22 6 environmental information processing 12 9 13 7 and cellular processes 7 5 7 8 fig 9a carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were the key metabolic modes of microorganisms accounting for 9 indicating that organic compounds and ammonia utilization were the mainly carbon source and n source for microbial cell metabolism 49 50 carbohydrate metabolism plays key roles in degradation of complex organics 57 and the relative abundance of carbohydrate metabolism decreases with the decrease of cod tn ratio however the relative abundances of amino acid and energy metabolism increased these outcomes were a response of microorganisms under the condition of insufficient carbon source they would decompose eps as energy as mentioned in section 3 3 in addition the genes related to transcription replication and repair declined indicating bacterial activity and biomass decreased under the low cod tn ratio condition in energy metabolism the decrease of cod tn ratio resulted in a decrease trends for the main functional metabolic pathways such as carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism similar to the abundance of n removal functional bacteria the abundance related to n metabolism was reduced from 0 61 to 0 55 with the reduction of influent carbon source which further explained the reason of decrease n removal efficiency within the amino acid metabolism with reduction of influent cod concentration the relative abundances of lysine degradation phenylalanine metabolism and histidine metabolism were the main functions and showed an increase trend fig 9e microorganisms would promote degrade pn into small molecular substances under carbon source deficiency condition 33 the decline of cod tn ratio probably stimulated these amino acid metabolism subcategories which was conducive to utilizing amino acids as carbon source and energy under starvation 4 conclusion an economical and efficient mbbr mariculture wastewater system inoculating hnad bacterium strain zobellella b307 was established and evaluated for pollutant removal with different cod tn ratios by inoculating hnad bacteria mbbr achieved a more stable nutrients removal performance under low influent cod tn ratio microbiological analysis indicated that the decline of cod tn ratio could not affect the abundance of inoculation strain zobellella b307 however the abundance of identified hnad bacteria other denitrifying bacteria and functional genes involved in n metabolism decreased gradually which led to the n removal efficiency decline this study will contribute to a further understanding the effect of cod tn ratio on the pollutant removal performance in a biological treatment system for mariculture wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12773,electrodialysis draws recent attention toward valorization of biogas slurry especially in terms of inorganic nutrient selectivity nevertheless wide application of this process is impeded by organic fouling of anion exchange membrane aem dealing with such a complex stream which lacks of a systematic investigation so far herein aem fouling by real biogas slurry under varying current density was delicately evaluated in terms of transmembrane electrical potential and membrane bulk resistance beyond the conventional monitoring on dilute conductivity and solution ph for this desalination process our results showed that tmep of the target aem was very sensitive to the applied current but a negligible variation of desalination rate and solution ph indicated a limited occurrence of water splitting then the existence of apolar and large sized foulant in biogas slurry probably the detected humic like substances and few salt crystals from the membranes together suggested that organic fouling was mainly responsible for the fouling issue finally eis data revealed rm as the main component of membrane resistance for the fouled membrane indicating a non negligible internal fouling which was also positively related to the applied current our result implied operating electrodialysis at a lower current density for biogas slurry is recommended from the perspective of membrane fouling mitigation and operation cost optimization in pursuit of long term efficacy for nutrient recovery and valorization graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords organic fouling ion exchange membrane fouling indicator biogas slurry valorization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biogas slurry a product from fermentation of bio material is rich in various inorganic nutrients such as phosphorus nitrogen as well as potassium and thus been considered potential fertilizer or even soil conditioners 1 2 so far a variety of technologies have been developed for polishing biogas slurry including chemical precipitation 3 4 adsorption processes 5 6 donnan dialysis 7 stripping 8 biominerals 9 10 etc noteworthy alternative candidates of less chemical consumption more cost effectiveness and less negative impact on nutrient compositions clearly draw recent interest 11 electrodialysis ed is one such typical example which would migrate the ionic components out of biogas slurry under an electrical gradient through the delicately arrayed ion exchange membranes 12 15 the performance of ed could be easily adjusted by the electrical input yet at negligible cost of chemicals and varying fertilizers have been successfully produced by conventional electrodialysis 16 17 selective electrodialysis 12 or bipolar membrane electrodialysis 18 recently concentrated liquid product up to ammonium of 7100 300 mg l and potassium of 2490 40 mg l has been achieved at an affordable energy consumption 16 however inevitable membrane fouling poses an un negligible hurdle for nutrient recovery from wastewater by ed resulting into a raised energy costs and declined recovery efficiency during a long operation 13 scaling issue toward cation exchange membrane cem in ed is relatively less reported dealing with the biogas slurry likely due to a moderate ph environment for such stream i e a controlled ion activity product for certain salt and or successful mitigation via polarization reversal 19 unlikely a large quantity of organic substances such as proteins humic substances microorganisms and even antibiotics has been reported to contribute to a great fouling propensity to anion exchange membrane aem 20 22 the organic foulant adhered to the membrane not only served as emerging detrimental contaminant to cause eco environmental risks 23 but also induced a degraded conductivity and ion exchange capacity of aems 24 unfortunately whether aem fouling could be quantitatively associated to the applied electrical condition such that it would be also easily mitigated in a delicate ed operation is unclear in fact despite that the recovery performance of ed and its fouling phenomenon has been well explored in previous studies a systematic investigation on fouling behavior of aem in desalting the slurry biogas is scare particularly in terms of fouling extents severity of external or internal types under varying electrical driving force thus organic fouling behavior of aem under different current densities during ed treatment of biogas slurry was herein investigated mass transfer hindrance of aem was indicated by transmembrane electric potential and water splitting phenomenon was identified by ph variation of both concentrate and dilute compartment not only the membrane surface morphology and foulant were characterized electrochemical properties regarding the membrane bulk referring to internal fouling and fouling layer referring to external fouling were distinguished and quantified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the outcome of this work would insight to develop a tailored operation mode toward more efficient and sustainable desalination performance in future ed practice for valorization of biogas slurry 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials amv and cmv selemion japan as commercial anion and cation exchange membrane were used in this study and their main

respectively during desalination a transmembrane electric potential tmep of the investigated aem was monitored by the electrochemical workstation squidstat admiral us and conductivity of the dilute solution as well as ph value in both concentrate and dilute were monitored by a conductivity meter fe38 mettler toledo us and a ph meter hi 9811 hanna italy respectively 2 3 characterization of biogas slurry the dom i e dissolved organic matter isolation of biogas slurry based on hydrophobicity using dax 8 resin followed by xad 4 resins in series was preformed fig s2 28 first of all the 40 diluted biogas slurry with a volume of 100 ml was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and then the filtrate was acidified to ph of 2 with 6 mol l hydrochloric acid with assistance of a peristaltic pump the as obtained sample was passed through the column of dax 8 resin at a flow rate of 1 5 ml min and the effluent was passed through the column of xad 4 resin afterwards 0 1 mol l naoh with a volume of 22 ml and 18 5 ml were used to backwashed the columns of dax 8 and xad 4 resins respectively until the ph of the eluent increased sharply the eluates were neutralized using 0 1 hcl immediately to avoid the oxidation of dom the hydrophobic component hpo fraction of dom was quantitatively adsorbed onto dax 8 resin and the transphilic component tpi fraction of dom was adsorbed onto xad 4 resin the hydrophilic components hpi referred to that spiked in final effluent after xad 4 resin in addition biogas slurry was also analyzed by three dimensional 3d fluorescence spectroscopy fls1000 edinburgh

partially for immediate analysis by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis with the other air dried for subsequent characterization the eis measurements were carried out in a home made four electrode system as shown in fig 1b more detailed in our previous work 27 and electrolyte solution of 0 1 m nacl during the measurement an alternating current of 3 ma was applied in the frequency range of 103 10 2 hz the electrochemical resistance of the membrane was obtained by subtracting the summed resistance membrane and solution rm s with the solution resistance rs determined without aem

fouling experiments were determined toc lcph cpn shimadzu japan to further explore the main components of the fouling 1 4 of the fouled membrane i e size about 2 5 cm 2 5 cm was immersed in sulfuric acid ph 2 of 10 ml volume and sonicated for 3 h to dissolve the foulants on the membrane into the cleaning solution then three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem was applied to analyze the cleaning solution as mentioned in above section 3 results and discussion 3 1 ed performance desalination experiments were carried out at current densities of 96 a m2 168 a m2 and 196 a m2 when nacl i e conductivity equal to biogas slurry present in dilute the desalination rate was 0 0289 ms cm min and 0 0449 ms cm min at 96 a m2 and 192 a m2 respectively however in case of biogas slurry a slightly decreased desalination rates of 0 0248 and 0 0407 ms cm min were found fig 2a such results indicate the ion migrations were weakly affected regarding biogas slurry treatment the recovery efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus which have been well studied in previous work 13 16 24 was not illustrated here for fouling behavior of the aem was our objective the variation of stack voltage during desalination of biogas slurry is shown in fig 2b at 96 a m2 the system voltage was relatively stable at 15 7 v then at a higher current density of 168 a m2 the system voltage was 16 2 v initially and started to quickly increase from 60 min reaching 23 3 v at the ending point at 196 a m2 stack voltage grew dramatically even earlier from 10 min with initial value of 17 7 v and finally reached 27 v at 120 min furthermore tmep variation of aem i e located between dilute and concentrate compartment is shown in fig 2c specifically at 96 a m2 tmep of aem was stable at ca 0 14 v indicating no obvious mass transfer hindrance however with increasing current density tmep value grew significantly at 168 a m2 tmep increased and finally reached to 6 86 v after 150 min whereas at 192 a m2 tmep increased rapidly from the beginning and finally reached to 10 v at ca 120 min note that when nacl present in dilute the system voltage and the tmep of aem were relatively stable without observed increase in each case fig s3a b d e in addition the increasing profile of stack voltage and temp of aem were close in value at each case fig 2b c indicating that tmep of aem played a crucial role in the overall behavior previous reports show rapid growth of tmep could be due to severe current transfer hindrance 30 31 in reference 31 a fixed current density of 30 a m2 83 3 ilim induced tmep increase of ca 1 v with 300 mg l apam present in 0 05 m nacl in our recent work a shape tmep increase of ca 10 v was observed at 96 a m2 43 ilim in terms of 100 mg l sds present in 0 1 m nacl 25 comparably ed treatment of biogas slurry induced a similar sharp increase of tmep here at 168 a m2 75 ilim and 192 a m2 88 ilim implying a relatively moderate fouling potential between apam and sds to testify if mass transfer hindrance induced a water splitting for current transfer ph variation in dilute and concentrate solution was monitored and illustrated in fig 2d the initial ph of dilute solution was ca 8 8 indicating slight alkalinity of biogas slurry there was a slight increase of concentrate ph within initial 10 min while no significant ph variation was observed afterwards moreover a close ph value of dilute and concentrate solution i e 8 8 were observed regardless of current conditions such a quick ph variation in concentrate was likely due to the transfer of alkaline anions probably carbonate bicarbonate evidenced by the high alkalinity in table 1 across the aem while no further ph variation suggested that water splitting did not occur in fact in an additional test we found ph for nacl solution concentrate in this work was very sensitive to h and oh despite that biogas slurry dilute solution possessed certain buffer capacity to acid and alkali as shown in fig s4 accordingly the negligible ph variation in concentrate ruled out of the occurrence of water splitting in line with the nearly constant desalination rate and abundance of remained salt which could serve as current carrier in dilute in fig 2a note such a data disagreed with the study with sds apam and bsa as target which induced significant water splitting 27 32 we assume that the specific properties of the foulant may be responsible for the different mass transfer phenomenon where the organic substance in biogas slurry likely resulted into a loose adhesion onto the membrane yet not a dense charge barrier for salt transfer during ed to this end it is hypothesized that a significantly higher resistor from an accumulated exterior fouling layer explained the high voltage of the aem fig 1c such a fouling layer consisted of organic compounds of less conductivity compared to aem itself and it was unable to stop the ion transfer so as to clearly decrease the desalination rate the above speculation was further confirmed in following sections 3 2 surface morphology of aem and eem spectra of cleaning solution fraction analysis of organic matter in the biogas slurry in fig 3a showed a high percentage up to 84 of hydrophobic organic substance hpo combined with a low zeta potential of biogas slurry approximating to zero table 1 an un negligible amount of apolar organic compound was assumed to exist in biogas slurry besides size distribution data indicates a high presence of large sized substances fig 3b then it was reasonable to conclude that these substances despite of less electrical mobility could attach onto the membrane surface under convection driven transfer due to an electros osmosis effect in ed 33 34 to confirm the existence of aem fouling surface morphology of fouled membrane on the dilute side was captured as shown in fig 3c f clearly it can be seen that loading density of the foulant was positively correlated with current with invisible inorganic crystal element scanning showed inorganic elements such as mg2 ca2 present in biogas slurry was not detected on the membrane surface despite that a slightly decreased content of c n and cl and increased content of o was found these four elements remain main compositions accounting for 85 4 4 2 3 5 and 6 9 respectively available for the fouled membrane under 192 a m2 table s2 finally together with invisible crystalized substance our results imply organic fouling as main type of aem fouling moreover cleaning solution of fouled membrane was analyzed by eem fluorescence spectroscopy to clarify the potential organic foulant as shown in fig 4a c data of raw biogas slurry shown in fig s5 it was found that fluorescence peaks were always present at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 330 nm em 425 nm whose intensity increased with current density applied besides at low current density 96 a m2 there is another fluorescence peak located at ex 270 nm em 310 nm with low intensity fig 4a the significant fluorescence peaks at ex 330 nm em 425 nm indicate that the main organic components in the cleaning solution were humic substances 20 35 37 whose accumulation on fouled membrane increased with current density in addition the fluorescence peaks at ex 270 nm em 310 nm at low current density fig 4a was attributed to proteinaceous substances 35 37 this is consistent with recent study of zhan where tyrosine like and humic like substances fouled aem gradually during electrodialysis reversal treatment of pig manure digestate 24 unexpectedly no protein related fluorescence peaks appeared at high current density fig 4b c such a result could likely be attributed to low content of protein substances and the significantly suppression by the presence of humic substances 38 overall spectrum analysis of the cleaning solution showed that humic substances and protein substances were the main organic components of the foulants where humic substances gave a dominant contribution 3 3 eis analysis of fouled membrane eis is a powerful and non invasive technique to investigate the properties of multilayer surfaces 39 regarding aem eis could measure the resistance of the membrane and solution rm s at high frequency and respond to the electrochemical information of the boundary layer i e electric diffusion layer fouling layer and diffusion boundary layer at medium and low frequencies 32 we employed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis to quantify fouling degree of varying fouled membranes under each current the unstable nyquist plots of freshly fouled membrane were observed fig s6 probably due to the weak adherence of the foulant after 12 h soaked in electrolyte eis measurements were performed again and the stable nyquist plots in fig 5 were obtained compared with that of virgin membrane the stabled nyquist plots exhibited a larger intersection with the x axis and larger radius of the semicircle which positively correlated with current density the equivalent circuits shown in fig 5 29 32 were used to fit the nyquist plots of virgin and fouled membranes and the main fitting results were illustrated in fig 6 raw data in table 2 herein the constant phase elements cpe were used for both the electric double layer edl and the diffusion boundary layer dbl which is non ideal capacitors 40 specifically the herein n values of cpe for dbl were always 1 likely due to the uneven roughness of the membrane interface 41 in terms of fouled membranes the resistance and y value of cpe of edl and dbl all increased slightly compared with virgin membrane besides the resistance r and y for dbl were larger than those for edl regardless of virgin and fouled membranes which may be owning to the larger thickness of dbl 29 41 considering the fact that mass transport was usually associated with electrical resistance in these charged systems the variation of resistance for the corresponding layer was further discussed clearly rm was the main contributor to membrane resistance regardless of fouled membranes and its value increased from 8 06 ω cm2 12 2 ω cm2 to 19 8 ω cm2 with current density compared with that of virgin one i e 3 4 ω cm2 rm of fouled membranes increased by 1 4 times 2 6 times and 4 8 times respectively indicating that the resistance of membrane bulk was sensitive to membrane fouling interestingly the in situ tmep results implied an important impact of external fouling accumulated onto aem during the ed process fig 2 whereas the herein off line eis analysis suggested the membrane internal fouling was very significant such a seemingly contradictory likely originate from the two different analytical approaches in fact eis analysis was not in situ here and its final result was after long term stabilization not the fresh one as that in tmep analysis referring to fig s6 where some loose external fouling deposition could have been detached from the aem in addition an obvious positive correlation between the membrane bulk resistance and current density was found fig s7 showed ca 3 of the organic carbon migrated to concentrate compartment which further confirmed the penetration of organic solute across the dense membrane matrix one could also speculate that some organic matter may be stuck inside the membrane void spaces due to steric hindrance resulting into a significant increase in rm again a larger value of rm indicates severe internal fouling of aem caused by biogas slurry consistent with our previous study for aem fouling by organic solute of high molecule weight 27 our result about a serious internal fouling of aem disagrees with the conclusion by zhan et al 24 where organic foulants were considered to be only in the support layer other than deep into the interior of the membrane based on data via infrared spectra of limited analysis depth this could be attributed to the different tools taken for membrane fouling investigation and our analysis dimension via eis involves a full thickness analysis such that subtle signal of internal fouling could be captured then value of rp far less than rm was found 0 12 ω cm2 0 09 ω cm2 and 1 26 ω cm2 respectively only non negligible at the highest current despite of visible external fouling formed on the membrane surface fig 3 the limited resistance of the external layer could be attribute to desorption of the foulant which was not strongly adhered to membrane fig s6 finally rdbl and redl slightly increased after fouling due to the accumulation of foulants on membrane interface surface 42 43 on the one hand the negatively charged organic compounds in biogas slurry likely occupied part of the exchangeable sites of aem which increased the resistance of edl on the other hand a more tortuous path way for counter ions due to fouling layer and a stronger repulsion between the negatively charged foulants and counter ions e g cl induced a thicker dbl resulting in an increase in its resistances 30 3 4 discussing on applied current density toward biogas slurry valorization in ed fouling behaviors of aem under varying current density during electrodialysis of biogas slurry has been explored as above then a spearman analysis was performed regarding the correlation of applied current conditions and membrane fouling responses i e tmep rm and eem intensity of cleaning solution data shown in table 3 it can be clear seen that all correlation coefficient shows a large value of above 0 89 suggesting a highly proportional relationship between aem fouling and current applied in ed in real practice a higher operating current is often selected in order to improve nutrient recovery efficiency however as our results suggested this may pose a great risk of membrane fouling along with a compromise phenomenon including declined desalination rate increased membrane resistance by adhesion and penetration etc on the other hand a low current possibly means low recovery or an increased cost of membrane investment therefore in order to better deal with the trade off effect between operation efficiency and total cost increased by membrane fouling or surface area investment an appropriate current selection is non ignorable considering the unneglectable content of organic foulant in such stream and the presence of both the polar and apolar substances our main suggestion would be a careful operation of ed under a suppressed current in particular our results suggested that the applied current below 43 ilim is relatively recommended in terms of a stable long term operation whereas ed should be very carefully operated given a higher applied current e g more alarming signal at current density between 43 and 75 even more occurrence of significant fouling at current density above 75 although the organic matter in the biogas slurry caused the occurrence of aem fouling our results showed that a controlled applied current could effectively alleviate the fouling however operating the ed process at a low operating current didn t mean free of concern considering the subtle increase of rm captured by eis therefore antifouling strategies such as pretreatment membrane cleaning ought to be well developed for long term efficacy of biogas slurry valorization in ed 4 conclusion in this study fouling behavior of aem during electrodialysis of biogas slurry was systematically investigated in a tailored stack the results showed that the biogas slurry with complex components tend to induce organic fouling of aem which was not accurately responded by the desalination rate thus electrochemical monitoring and analysis approaches were applied to unravel the fouling trends when the applied current exceeded 50 ilim both tmep of the target aem and the system voltage increased significantly further eem analysis pointed out humic like substances and proteins as main foulants with the former in a major role eis measurements successfully revealed that rm is the main contribution of membrane resistance for the fouled membrane indicating a non negligible internal fouling spearman analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the applied current density and the aem fouling behavior i e the higher the current density the more serious the electrical response finally it is recommended to operate the electrodialysis of biogas slurry at a lower current density e g below 75 ilim from the perspective of membrane fouling mitigation and operation cost optimization in pursuit of long term efficacy for nutrient recovery and valorization

12773,electrodialysis draws recent attention toward valorization of biogas slurry especially in terms of inorganic nutrient selectivity nevertheless wide application of this process is impeded by organic fouling of anion exchange membrane aem dealing with such a complex stream which lacks of a systematic investigation so far herein aem fouling by real biogas slurry under varying current density was delicately evaluated in terms of transmembrane electrical potential and membrane bulk resistance beyond the conventional monitoring on dilute conductivity and solution ph for this desalination process our results showed that tmep of the target aem was very sensitive to the applied current but a negligible variation of desalination rate and solution ph indicated a limited occurrence of water splitting then the existence of apolar and large sized foulant in biogas slurry probably the detected humic like substances and few salt crystals from the membranes together suggested that organic fouling was mainly responsible for the fouling issue finally eis data revealed rm as the main component of membrane resistance for the fouled membrane indicating a non negligible internal fouling which was also positively related to the applied current our result implied operating electrodialysis at a lower current density for biogas slurry is recommended from the perspective of membrane fouling mitigation and operation cost optimization in pursuit of long term efficacy for nutrient recovery and valorization graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords organic fouling ion exchange membrane fouling indicator biogas slurry valorization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biogas slurry a product from fermentation of bio material is rich in various inorganic nutrients such as phosphorus nitrogen as well as potassium and thus been considered potential fertilizer or even soil conditioners 1 2 so far a variety of technologies have been developed for polishing biogas slurry including chemical precipitation 3 4 adsorption processes 5 6 donnan dialysis 7 stripping 8 biominerals 9 10 etc noteworthy alternative candidates of less chemical consumption more cost effectiveness and less negative impact on nutrient compositions clearly draw recent interest 11 electrodialysis ed is one such typical example which would migrate the ionic components out of biogas slurry under an electrical gradient through the delicately arrayed ion exchange membranes 12 15 the performance of ed could be easily adjusted by the electrical input yet at negligible cost of chemicals and varying fertilizers have been successfully produced by conventional electrodialysis 16 17 selective electrodialysis 12 or bipolar membrane electrodialysis 18 recently concentrated liquid product up to ammonium of 7100 300 mg l and potassium of 2490 40 mg l has been achieved at an affordable energy consumption 16 however inevitable membrane fouling poses an un negligible hurdle for nutrient recovery from wastewater by ed resulting into a raised energy costs and declined recovery efficiency during a long operation 13 scaling issue toward cation exchange membrane cem in ed is relatively less reported dealing with the biogas slurry likely due to a moderate ph environment for such stream i e a controlled ion activity product for certain salt and or successful mitigation via polarization reversal 19 unlikely a large quantity of organic substances such as proteins humic substances microorganisms and even antibiotics has been reported to contribute to a great fouling propensity to anion exchange membrane aem 20 22 the organic foulant adhered to the membrane not only served as emerging detrimental contaminant to cause eco environmental risks 23 but also induced a degraded conductivity and ion exchange capacity of aems 24 unfortunately whether aem fouling could be quantitatively associated to the applied electrical condition such that it would be also easily mitigated in a delicate ed operation is unclear in fact despite that the recovery performance of ed and its fouling phenomenon has been well explored in previous studies a systematic investigation on fouling behavior of aem in desalting the slurry biogas is scare particularly in terms of fouling extents severity of external or internal types under varying electrical driving force thus organic fouling behavior of aem under different current densities during ed treatment of biogas slurry was herein investigated mass transfer hindrance of aem was indicated by transmembrane electric potential and water splitting phenomenon was identified by ph variation of both concentrate and dilute compartment not only the membrane surface morphology and foulant were characterized electrochemical properties regarding the membrane bulk referring to internal fouling and fouling layer referring to external fouling were distinguished and quantified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the outcome of this work would insight to develop a tailored operation mode toward more efficient and sustainable desalination performance in future ed practice for valorization of biogas slurry 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials amv and cmv selemion japan as commercial anion and cation exchange membrane were used in this study and their main characteristics are listed in table s1 real biogas slurry after in situ precipitation and ultrafiltration from agricultural company shunwo co ltd china was used as feed solution main solution characteristics detailed in table 1 analytical grades of sodium chloride nacl and sodium sulfate na2so4 chuandong chemicial china and de ionized di water resistivity 18 25 mω cm were used to prepare the relevant electrolyte solutions respectively 2 2 electrodialysis operation electrodialysis experiments were performed using a six compartment setup as shown in fig 1a with the target membrane coupon separating the dilute feed and concentrate detailed in our previous study 27 raw biogas slurry and 0 3 m nacl i e conductivity close to that of biogas slurry were used as dilute and concentrate solution respectively both electrode solution and buffer solution were 0 1 m na2so4 where buffer solution was set to prevent the dilute and concentrate from disturbance of the h and oh generated near the electrode the limiting current density was determined to be 222 a m2 in case of 0 3 m nacl as shown in fig s1 ed experiments were run at a constant current mode where different current densities were set i e 96 a m2 43 ilim 168 a m2 75 ilim and 196 a m2 88 ilim to explore their impact on fouling behaver flow rate was 150 ml min in dilute and concentrate and 200 ml min in electrode respectively during desalination a transmembrane electric potential tmep of the investigated aem was monitored by the electrochemical workstation squidstat admiral us and conductivity of the dilute solution as well as ph value in both concentrate and dilute were monitored by a conductivity meter fe38 mettler toledo us and a ph meter hi 9811 hanna italy respectively 2 3 characterization of biogas slurry the dom i e dissolved organic matter isolation of biogas slurry based on hydrophobicity using dax 8 resin followed by xad 4 resins in series was preformed fig s2 28 first of all the 40 diluted biogas slurry with a volume of 100 ml was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and then the filtrate was acidified to ph of 2 with 6 mol l hydrochloric acid with assistance of a peristaltic pump the as obtained sample was passed through the column of dax 8 resin at a flow rate of 1 5 ml min and the effluent was passed through the column of xad 4 resin afterwards 0 1 mol l naoh with a volume of 22 ml and 18 5 ml were used to backwashed the columns of dax 8 and xad 4 resins respectively until the ph of the eluent increased sharply the eluates were neutralized using 0 1 hcl immediately to avoid the oxidation of dom the hydrophobic component hpo fraction of dom was quantitatively adsorbed onto dax 8 resin and the transphilic component tpi fraction of dom was adsorbed onto xad 4 resin the hydrophilic components hpi referred to that spiked in final effluent after xad 4 resin in addition biogas slurry was also analyzed by three dimensional 3d fluorescence spectroscopy fls1000 edinburgh

partially for immediate analysis by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis with the other air dried for subsequent characterization the eis measurements were carried out in a home made four electrode system as shown in fig 1b more detailed in our previous work 27 and electrolyte solution of 0 1 m nacl during the measurement an alternating current of 3 ma was applied in the frequency range of 103 10 2 hz the electrochemical resistance of the membrane was obtained by subtracting the summed resistance membrane and solution rm s with the solution resistance rs determined without aem

electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectrometer sem eds quattro s thermo fisher us besides the content of total organic carbon toc in concentrate compartment at the end of each fouling experiments were determined toc lcph cpn shimadzu japan to further explore the main components of the fouling 1 4 of the fouled membrane i e size about 2 5 cm 2 5 cm was immersed in sulfuric acid ph 2 of 10 ml volume and sonicated for 3 h to dissolve the foulants on the membrane into the cleaning solution then three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem was applied to analyze the cleaning solution as mentioned in above section 3 results and discussion 3 1 ed performance desalination experiments were carried out at current densities of 96 a m2 168 a m2 and 196 a m2 when nacl i e conductivity equal to biogas slurry present in dilute the desalination rate was 0 0289 ms cm min and 0 0449 ms cm min at 96 a m2 and 192 a m2 respectively however in case of biogas slurry a slightly decreased desalination rates of 0 0248 and 0 0407 ms cm min were found fig 2a such results indicate the ion migrations were weakly affected regarding biogas slurry treatment the recovery efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus which have been well studied in previous work 13 16 24 was not illustrated here for fouling behavior of the aem was our objective the variation of stack voltage during desalination of biogas slurry is shown in fig 2b at 96 a m2 the system voltage was relatively stable at 15 7 v then at a higher current density of 168 a m2 the system voltage was 16 2 v

observed increase in each case fig s3a b d e in addition the increasing profile of stack voltage and temp of aem were close in value at each case fig 2b c indicating that tmep of aem played a crucial role in the overall behavior previous reports show rapid growth of tmep could be due to severe current transfer hindrance 30 31 in reference 31 a fixed current density of 30 a m2 83 3 ilim induced tmep increase of ca 1 v with 300 mg l apam present in 0 05 m nacl in our recent work a shape tmep increase of ca 10 v was observed at 96 a m2 43 ilim in terms of 100 mg l sds present in 0 1 m nacl 25 comparably ed treatment of biogas slurry induced a similar sharp increase of tmep here at 168 a m2 75 ilim and 192 a m2 88 ilim implying a relatively moderate fouling potential between apam and sds to testify if mass transfer hindrance induced a water splitting for current transfer ph variation in dilute and concentrate solution was monitored and illustrated in fig 2d the initial ph of dilute solution was ca 8 8 indicating slight alkalinity of biogas slurry there was a slight increase of concentrate ph within initial 10 min while no significant ph variation was observed afterwards moreover a close ph value of dilute and concentrate solution i e 8 8 were observed regardless of current conditions such a quick ph variation in concentrate was likely due to the transfer of alkaline anions probably carbonate bicarbonate evidenced by the high alkalinity in table 1 across the aem while no further ph variation suggested that water splitting did not occur in fact in an additional test we found ph for nacl solution concentrate in this work was very sensitive to h and oh despite that biogas slurry dilute solution possessed certain buffer capacity to acid and alkali as shown in fig s4

properties of the foulant may be responsible for the different mass transfer phenomenon where the organic substance in biogas slurry likely resulted into a loose adhesion onto the membrane yet not a dense charge barrier for salt transfer during ed to this end it is hypothesized that a significantly higher resistor from an accumulated exterior fouling layer explained the high voltage of the aem

above speculation was further confirmed in following sections 3 2 surface morphology of aem and eem spectra of cleaning solution fraction analysis of organic matter in the biogas slurry in fig 3a

explored as above then a spearman analysis was performed regarding the correlation of applied current conditions and membrane fouling responses i e tmep rm and eem intensity of cleaning solution data shown in table 3 it can be clear seen that all correlation coefficient shows a large value of above 0 89 suggesting a highly proportional relationship between aem fouling and current applied in ed in real practice a higher operating current is often selected in order to improve nutrient recovery efficiency however as our results suggested this may pose a great risk of membrane fouling along with a compromise phenomenon including declined desalination rate increased membrane resistance by adhesion and penetration etc on the other hand a low current possibly means low recovery or an increased cost of membrane investment therefore in order to better deal with the trade off effect between operation efficiency and total cost increased by membrane fouling or surface area investment an appropriate current selection is non ignorable considering the unneglectable content of organic foulant in such stream and the presence of both the polar and apolar substances our main suggestion would be a careful operation of ed under a suppressed current in particular our results suggested that the applied current below 43 ilim is relatively recommended in terms of a stable long term operation whereas ed should be very carefully operated given a higher applied current e g more alarming signal at current density between 43 and 75 even more occurrence of significant fouling at current density above 75 although the organic matter in the biogas slurry caused the occurrence of aem fouling our results showed that a controlled applied current could effectively alleviate the fouling however operating the ed process at a low operating current didn t mean free of concern considering the subtle increase of rm captured by eis therefore antifouling strategies such as pretreatment membrane cleaning ought to be well developed for long term efficacy of biogas slurry valorization in ed 4 conclusion in this study fouling behavior of aem during electrodialysis of biogas slurry was systematically investigated in a tailored stack the results showed that the biogas slurry with complex components tend to induce organic fouling of aem which was not accurately responded by the desalination rate thus electrochemical monitoring and analysis approaches were applied to unravel the fouling trends when the applied current exceeded 50 ilim both tmep of the target aem and the system voltage increased significantly further eem analysis pointed out humic like substances and proteins as main foulants with the former in a major role eis measurements successfully revealed that rm is the main contribution of membrane resistance for the fouled membrane indicating a non negligible internal fouling spearman analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the applied current density and the aem fouling behavior i e the higher the current density the more serious the electrical response finally it is recommended to operate the electrodialysis of biogas slurry at a lower current density e g below 75 ilim from the perspective of membrane fouling mitigation and operation cost optimization in pursuit of long term efficacy for nutrient recovery and valorization

12774,exploring an environmentally friendly and highly activation catalysts in the advanced oxidation processes aops basing on sulfate radicals so4 has shown great importance for the remediation of refractory contaminants herein fe3o4 wrapped zsm 5 fe3o4 zsm 5 was constructed as heterogeneous catalyst to remove ciprofloxacin cip via peroxymonosulfate pms activation in which performance kinetics and mechanism insight were investigated in depth the removal efficiency of cip reached 90 by fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts within 100 min reaction when the initial ph was 3 0 during the reaction so4 and ho were proved to be coexisted in reaction system and so4 played a critical role in cip degradation according to the radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements based on the catalyst characterization and langmuir hinshelwood adsorption kinetics analysis the synthesis of fe3o4 nanoparticles nps and zsm 5 accelerated the dispersion process and enhanced adsorption ability of fe3o4 nps which further promoted the local concentration of cip and pms on the surface in addition the cycling experiments and metal leaching tests demonstrated that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were stable and could be conveniently reused by magnetic separation in addition the impacts of coexisting irons cl so4 2 no3 hco3 confirmed that fe3o4 zsm 5 was still effective in real water this study demonstrated the promising prospect of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system in the application of degradation refractory organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fe3o4 zsm 5 ciprofloxacin peroxymonosulfate synergy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past decades the frequently and widely use of antibiotics causing serious damage to environment and aquatic ecosystem has attracted broad attention 1 3 ciprofloxacin cip is one of the second generation antibiotics which has exhibited obvious effect in curing the diseases of pneogaster and digestive system 1 4 because of the inadequate metabolism and decomposition of human body 50 70 of administered cip dose is excreted to the natural water through urine and feces 5 unluckily cip is persistent in the effluent impacted urban streams which cannot be removed availably by conventional wastewater treatments causing the occurrence of high cip concentration up to 0 12 mg l 1 in environmental water 6 generally advanced oxidation processes aops are regarded as one of the most effective ways for the destruction of pollutants 7 9 which are mainly contributed by the participation of reactive radicals including sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals ho 10 12 so4 possesses a stronger oxidation ability with a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 ev than ho 1 8 2 7 ev besides so4 maintains longer period and wider range of ph application which shows great application potential for the degradation of refractory organics 13 14 peroxymonosulfate pms as a primary oxidant to produce so4 could be easily activated for generating so4 due to its symmetric structure by diverse approaches such as heat 15 ultraviolet light 16 ultrasonication and transition metal catalysis previously studies investigated that transition metals e g ag ce3 mn3 fe3 fe2 co2 cu2 could activate pms owing to their capability of changing their oxidation states and chemical composition 17 of which iron has attracted tremendous attention due to cost effective low toxicity commercially available 18 especially fe3o4 is a promising practical fe based material which has shown high catalytic activity and possesses the excellent ability to activate pms 19 20 however the magnetic property of fe3o4 usually makes fe3o4 nanoparticles nps gather together in the aqueous solution which greatly covers up the fe3o4 nps active sites and hinders the direct contact of organic compounds in fe3o4 nps surface further limiting the reaction kinetics of fe3o4 nps and pms 21 therefore diffusion and reaction of pollutants on catalyst surface are considered as the speed limit step to heterogeneous catalytic oxidation 22 to better exert the reaction oxidation potency a regular method is proposed to promote the catalytic peculiarity of fe3o4 nps in reaction by combining fe3o4 nps with materials which hold superior specific surface area and rich pore structures to provide more reaction and adsorption sites 23 24 based on the above design zsm 5 is chosen as experimental target which has a stable five member ring molecular sieve catalyst with high si al ratio and has advantages of good water and thermal stability maintain the structure at 1200 c 25 organic amine cations in zsm 5 are prone to be modified by carboxylation to form good catalytic carriers 26 carbonylated zsm 5 can be polymerized with fe3o4 nps to form the stable pms heterogeneous activators in this work fe3o4 decorated zsm 5 catalysts were well synthesized and applied for the efficient removal of cip via activating pms the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the morphologies and magnetic properties of as prepared catalytic materials 2 obtain the optimal chemical compositions 3 determine the effects on cip degradation under various operation conditions including catalyst dosages pms dosages initial ph and water matrix components e g cl so4 2 no3 hco3 4 expound the inner reaction mechanism on catalyst surface and elucidate the superiority of fe3o4 zsm 5 relative to fe3o4 nps by langmuir hinshelwood l h model and epr tests this study provides a novel insight into investigating

40 min 0 4 g zsm 5 molecular sieve and 3 6 g sodium acetate were added into solution and kept stirring vigorously for another 40 min then the suspension was transferred to the autoclave placed in an oven and heated under hydrothermal conditions at 200 c for 8 h subsequently fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were washed by ethanol for several times finally fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were dried at 60 c overnight as a result fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts composites were obtained 2 3 samples characterization the catalyst morphologies of fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were identified by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and high resolution tem hr tem x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and eds mapping were conducted to analysis the basic element composition and the corresponding element concentration vibrating sample magnetometer vsm was carried out to determine the magnetic properties of fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts thermogravimetric analysis tga and brunauer emmett teller bet were performed to investigate the thermal stability and specific surface area respectively and the reactive oxygen species ross were investigated by epr tests 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was served as the radical spin trapping reagent to further confirm ross 2 4 experimental procedures in the typical procedures the tests of fe3o4 zsm 5 magnetic composites were studied via activating pms to degrade cip these degradation experiments were individually occurred in a series of conical flasks 250 ml with certain stirring speed 518 rpm at 25 c 25 mg fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts and 70 mg pms were thrown into 100 ml cip aqueous 30 umol l 1 then 1 ml experimental liquid was sampled at 0 5 10 15 30 60 and 100 min which was quickly quenched by 50 μl methanol to stop the reaction then samples were further filtered via a 0 45 μm millipore filter for hplc analysis besides experimental operating variables were also determined including fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts dosages

990afg china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalysts 3 1 1 sem the structural characterizations of fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts are presented in fig 1a and b the fe3o4 nps could aggregate into submicro scale quasi spherical particles with the diameter of 300 400 nm fig 1a discrete fe3o4 nps could be clearly observed with some pores and gaps which could increase the specific surface area fig 1b exhibited the emergence of the fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 molecular seize consisting of cubic non convex and sphere like particles from which we could see fe3o4 nps were well dispersed and uniformly distributed on zsm 5 surface the phenomenon was corresponded well to xrd analysis of zsm 5 fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts thus this result indicated that the fe3o4 nps were attached on zsm 5 surface 3 1 2 xrd fig 1c shows the xrd of zsm 5 fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts acquired from xrd rigaku smatlab se in the 2θ range of 10 to 80 six typical peaks were observed for zsm 5 at 2θ 23 2 23 4 24 0 30 0 35 1 and 45 5 respectively which were coincided with previous research 28 the xrd pattern of fe3o4 nps was made up of six peaks at 2θ angles 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 56 9 and 62 6 which were associated with the crystal planes of 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 respectively this result was fitted well with the reported data of yan et al jcpds 79 0419 21 the xrd pattern obtained for the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts exhibited ten characteristic peaks which were well consistent with characteristic peaks of fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 respectively suggesting the formation of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts 3 1 3 vsm fig 1d depicts the typical magnetic hysteresis loops of zsm 5 fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts the zsm 5 had slight magnetic hysteresis loops while fe3o4 nps had the typical superparamagnetic properties the hysteresis loops of fe3o4 nps exhibited an s shaped curve with saturation intensity of 0 208 emu mg 1 comparatively the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts showed relatively smaller magnetic properties with the saturation magnetization of 0 150 emu mg 1 confirming the excellent construction of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts in addition the left inset picture displayed that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were dispersed in water the right inset picture showed an external magnetic force thus fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts could be completely separated from water and be easy to recycle without filtration 3 1 4 bet the specific surface areas of fe3o4 nps zsm 5 and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were measured by bet analysis fig 1e and table s1 the results demonstrated that the average specific surface area of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst was significantly increased to 147 6 m2 g 1 compared to the corresponding value of fe3o4 nps 30 1 m2 g 1 which could be explained by the well attachment of fe3o4 nps onto the zsm 5 surface 386 2 m2 g 1 meanwhile according to the barrett joyner halenda bjh isotherm desorption curve average pore volume and average pore diameter of fe3o4 nps were 0 0666 cm3 g 1and 7 49 nm while the related value of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst decreased to 0 0499 cm3 g 1 and 4 92 nm respectively confirming that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst owned a superior performance on specific surface area and dispersion than fe3o4 nps 3 1 5 tga tga was performed to observe the thermostability of synthesized fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts as shown in fig 1f a slight weight loss approximately 1 95 was obtained below temperature of 170 7 c which could be primarily ascribed to the loss of moisture content adsorbed on the catalyst surface in addition the total weight was losing about 8 20 when the temperature was further elevated to 800 c manifesting that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst owned an excellent thermal stability 3 1 6 tem hr tem and eds mapping of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts the internal structure of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were monitored by using tem hr tem and eds mapping as shown in fig 1g fe3o4 nps tightly anchored on the surface of zsm 5 in addition evident interplanar spacing of 2 53 å was exhibited in fig 1h corresponding to 3 1 1 of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts simultaneously eds mapping results fig 1i m showed that o si al fe dispersed evenly in well synthesized fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts the results of tem hr tem and eds mapping were well conformed to the above sem and xrd results 3 2 advantages of the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system fig 2 shows the comparative results of cip removal efficiency obtained from fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts as well as pms fe3o4 pms zsm 5 pms and fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system there is a huge variation in the removal efficiency of different as prepared catalysts under the same conditions as shown in fig 2a with the existence of pms alone in the system only 47 0 cip was removed within 100 min while the degradation efficiency reached up to 57 4 and 70 4 after addition of zsm 5 and fe3o4 nps during the same reaction time respectively this result mainly ascribed to the adsorption of zsm 5 and the activation of pms by fe3o4 nps to generate free radicals e g so4 and ho fe3o4 nps could activate pms via the one electron transfer process to generate so4 and ho followed by eqs 1 3 besides it has been reported that fe3o4 nps had polyvalent character to favor the charge transfer process with pms whereas 92 2 cip was removed within 100 min via the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system the enhanced degradation efficiency proved that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts had the better catalytic performance compared to fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 alone the distinguished performance of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts could be attributed to two phenomena 1 the smaller particle size and a higher specific surface area table s1 led to the strong adsorption capacity for organic compounds 2 the larger specific surface area always meant more even dispersion of the active sites in the crystal structure which was conductive to the reaction with the organic compounds 29 moreover pseudo first order kinetics model was further applied to investigate the potential advantages of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system fig 2b the rate constants k obs of cip using as prepared catalysts changed from 0 013 min 1 with fe3o4 pms system to 0 015 min 1 applying fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system and finally reached to the maximum k obs value 0 026 min 1 in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system these results showed the joint action of fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 had remarkable promotion for the removal efficiencies of cip therefore from the perspective of catalysts cost and degradation efficiency fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were ideally selected for the further study 1 fe 2 hso 5 so 4 fe 3 oh 2 so 4 oh so 4 2 ho 3 so 4 ho hso 5 3 3 influences of experimental variables 3 3 1 fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst dosages fig 3a depicts the effect of catalyst dosages from 0 05 g to 0 35 g the result shows the removal efficiency slightly increased from 75 3 to 90 7 with the reaction of 100 min this phenomenon could be ascribed to the increase of the dosages of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts which commensurately offered more active site centers available for pms activation 30 the lager amount of active species e g so4 and ho were assumed to enhance the removal efficiency of cip 31 however when the dosages increased to 0 35 g the final removal ratio was almost unchanged the slow increment could be explained that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts might scavenge excess so4 and ho by the iron based complex on zsm 5 surface as eqs 4 5 described 21 which eliminated the additional active species based on the provided data 0 25 g was determined as the optimal catalyst dosage in the follow up study 4 fe 2 so 4 fe 3 so 4 2 5 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh 3 3 2 pms dosages fig 3b shows the effect of pms dosages on cip removal in the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system when pms dosages varied from 0 5 g l to 0 7 g l the enhancement of cip degradation efficiency was observed from 82 5 to 90 8 however the turning point appeared when the pms dosage up to 0 8 g l where the removal efficiency decreased to 84 5 this result could be explained as follow 1 cip would be directly oxidized by pms as the concentration of pms increased 2 more free radicals e g so4 and ho would be generated as the dosages of pms increased during the reaction of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system enhancing the removal efficiency of cip 3 with the excess addition of pms active species e g so4 and ho would be depleted by pms and or self combination eqs 6 7 21 from another perspective with the increase of the pms dosages the active sites of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts might be saturated which would limit the generation of active species 32 6 hso 5 ho so 5 h 2 o 7 hso 5 so 4 hso 4 so 5 3 3 3 effect of ph ph is a crucial operating parameter in the pms based oxidation processes 33 34 fig 3c shows the effect of ph 3 0 11 0 on the performance of cip removal based on sulfate radical oxidation activated by fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts the degradation rate of cip was highly ph dependent when the ph was adjusted from 3 0 to 5 2 and 7 0 the reaction rate dramatically increased from 0 027 min 1 to 0 114 min 1 and 0 203 min 1 respectively while the degradation ratio kept unchanged as 90 9 thereafter when the ph was further increased to 9 3 and 11 0 cip was completely degraded within 10 min indicated that fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system had better consequent in alkaline solution the huge promotion for cip degradation rate upon the alkaline condition could be primarily ascribed to pms alkaline activation superoxide radical o2 and single oxygen 1o2 was proven to largely produced in pms based system when solution was alkaline since the experiment was adjusted at ph 11 so5 2 was the dominated radical in pms activated system pk pms a1 0 and pk pms a2 9 23 which could be spontaneously transformed into o2 and 1o2 to effectively accelerate the cip removal process eqs 8 12 35 besides the base activation of pms in alkaline condition could also significantly accelerate the generation of free radicals e g so4 and ho which further enhanced the cip removal 36 furthermore pms activated ho might be depleted by h because h also served as ho quencher in the acid solution resulting in a relative low cip degradation efficiency compared to alkaline condition 37 kokate et al showed a similar experiment result that the maximum decolorization rate of acid orange 7 was achieved via the alkaline activation of pms at ph 10 38 thus the alkaline solutions are better for cip removal in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system 8 so 5 2 h

removal rate with temperature increasing the removal efficiencies were significantly improved from 58 to 100 while the solution temperature changed from 15 c to 30 c correspondingly the constants of reaction kinetics were calculated as 0 011 0 016 0 027 and 0 036 min 1 at 15 c 20 c 25 c 30 c respectively fig s4 the increase in temperature boosted the thermodynamics energy of reactants promoting the interaction between reaction involved molecules the linear relationship between lnk app and 1 t was calculated by the arrhenius equation the value of apparent activation energy ea in cip degradation by fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system was calculated as 59 3 kj mol fig s5 which was 1 41 times of standard value 42 1 kj mol based on the above data it was inferred that the process of pms activation was reacted over the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst surface rather than the diffusion process which played a key role in the cip degradation 3 4 effect of the authentic water constituents there are a wide variety of inorganic coexisting anions with a relative high concentration in authentic water which might influence the cip degradation thus several inorganic anions e g cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 were selected to investigate the practical application of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts in real water condition according to the standards for drinking water quality of china the concentrations of all anions were set as 3 mm in fig 4a after reaction of 60 min cip was degraded to 71 2 74 5 and 76 3 with the presence of cl so4 2 and no3 respectively obviously inorganic anions e g cl so4 2 no3 had slightly inhibiting effects on the cip degradation except hco3 this result could be explained by eqs 13 16 in which cl and no3 would react with so4 and ho to produce relatively low chemical reactivity intermediate radicals e g cl cl2 and no3 bocos et al 2017 subsequently a tiny amount of so4 and ho would non selectively attack inorganic anions of cl and no3 instead of cip resulting in the decrease of cip removal efficiency similar inhibitory effects were also observed in cufe2o4 pms o3 and uv pms systems 39 however the cip degradation rate dramatically increased from 0 026 to 2 055 min 1 when 0 3 mm hco3 was added to the solution there are two probable interpretations for this phenomenon the first interpretation is that hco3 can capture so4 and ho to yield co3 co3 is a highly selectivity oxidant with electrophilic characteristic which owned extreme high reaction rate 109 m 1 s 1 with electron abundant materials e g phenols aniline and nitrogen sulfate containing compound 40 the second interpretation is that pms has the asymmetrical molecular structure which can be easily activated into high reactivity anion radicals by hco3 41 13 no 3 so 4 so 4 2 no 3 k 5 5 10 4 m 1 s 1 14 no 3 oh oh no 3 k 5 5 10 4 m 1 s 1 15 cl so 4 so 4 2 cl k 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 16 cl oh oh cl k 3 0 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 5 determination of the major radical specials radical scavenging and epr dmpo tests were conducted to distinguish the major radicals involved in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system meoh was acted as an effective scavenger for both so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and ho 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 while tba was acted as an useful scavenger only for ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 42 in addition p bq and l histidine were used to explore the potential effect of superoxide radical and singlet oxygen radical fig 5a depicts that both p bq the molar ratio of p bq pms 10 1 and l histidine the molar ratio of l histidine pms 10 1 showed no inhibitory effect as the degradation efficiency of cip were 90 0 and 91 8 respectively this phenomenon indicated superoxide radical and singlet oxygen radical were not generated in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system during cip oxidation process in acidic solution however the addition of meoh the molar ratio of meoh pms 100 1 obviously decreased the removal efficiency from 92 2 to 47 0 while the addition of tba the molar ratio of tba pms 100 1 only decreased the removal efficiency from 92 2 to 75 5 respectively thus meoh exhibited better inhibitory effect comparing to tba at the same equivalent indicating that so4 and ho coexisted in reaction system and so4 played a more critical role in cip degradation to further confirm the existence of so4 and ho the result of epr dmpo tests were carried out in fig 5b the obvious signals peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were observed which validated that so4 and ho were simultaneously generated at the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system thus both ho and so4 could be regarded as the primary free radicals which contributed to the cip degradation in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system 3 6 the stability and reusability of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts to make allowances for the practical appliance of the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts it is vital to explore the stability and reusability of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts four consecutive cycles for the degradation of cip by fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system under the abovementioned conditions were conducted as shown in fig 6a a satisfactory cip removal result was observed after consecutive runs nearly completely degradation 92 2 of cip was observed in the 1st run while the degradation efficiency maintained at 85 6 in the 2nd run and slightly dropped to 72 1 and 69 0 in the 3rd and 4th runs without distilling water washing therefore fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts kept a gratifying activity for the activation of pms after four cycles according to the above results the slight decrease of cip degradation efficiency might owe to the consumption of active sites of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts besides cip molecular on fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts surface might probably hinder the mass transfer between catalysts and pms via adsorption process simultaneously the leaching concentrations of total iron were detected in fig 6b at the first two cycles the concentrations of total iron were measured as 637 μg l 1 and 549 μg l 1 which decreased dramatically to 143 μg l 1 and 86 μg l 1 in the remaining two cycles respectively the mass ratio of the released iron to the effective loaded iron increased from 6 8 to 16 3 after four cycles the leaching of total iron element was considered due to the dissolution of partial fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts during the reaction 43 in general these results indicated that the leaching amount of total iron maintained at an acceptable range and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts had shown a favorable reusability for pms activation 3 7 degradation mechanism generally the reaction rate of heterogeneous catalytic reaction was highly dependent on the surface adsorption capacity of heterogeneous catalyst to better elucidate the reaction mechanism of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system eley rideal e r model or the langmuir hinshelwood l h model are proceeded for the heterogeneous catalytic reaction the former is that only one oxidant is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and then directly reacts with the other reactant in solution and the latter is that all reactants are adsorbed on the catalyst surface and then react with each other 24 fig 7 illustrates the effect of pms and cip on the reaction rate of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system when the pms concentration increased the reaction rate k app was increased accordingly which was in great agreement with the l h model the k app values were calculated by eq 17 in supporting information 17 k app ks k cip n c cip n 1 k pms c pms m 1 k cip c cip n k pms c pms m 2 table 1 summarized the fitting parameters in the reaction the k pms of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms and fe3o4 pms were approximately 56 and 32 times higher than k cip which indicated that cip was more strongly oxidized by pms on the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts than adsorption in addition the k pms of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms was roughly 3 times higher than fe3o4 pms thus the combination of fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 simultaneously enhanced the catalyst surface adsorption of cip and pms fig 8a shows the xps images of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts before and after reaction exhibiting a further insight into the variation of catalyst element composition to facilize facilitate the exploration of reaction mechanism the fe 2p spectrum of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were assigned to two contribution peaks 712 0 ev and 725 0 ev which correspondingly represented the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively the 2p orbital of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts could likewise be separated into two component peaks at fe ii 710 4 ev and fe iii 712 3 ev besides the shake up satellite peak shifted from 719 0 ev to 718 4 ev for the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts was obtained according to the deconvolution results peak area of iron element was calculated to investigate the variation of chemical valence the proportion of fe ii and fe iii in total iron element were 59 0 and 57 9 before reaction respectively while the proportion of fe ii in total iron element was decreased to 42 1 after the reaction this result might be attributed to the electron transfer via the surface of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts during the pms based oxidation process the heterogeneous system based on sr aops is dominated by surface reaction and the reaction rate is primarily affected by several experimental factors such as pms concentrations and catalyst performance fig 8b demonstrates that the removal rate of heterogeneous catalyst system was constricted by the initial reaction over fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts surface firstly cip was absorbed to the surface of the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts by non electrostatic force due to the superior specific surface area of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts similarly pms was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst by overcoming the electrostatic force and being activated via electron transfer to react with cip according to the above kinetic analysis zsm 5 in fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts as an adsorbent for pms and cip could provide enough adsorption sites and enhances the probability of reaction occurrence due to its large specific surface area and highly porous structure secondly based on the catalyst properties zsm 5 was believed to supply better dispersion of iron element on the catalyst surface and thus increased the contact opportunities of surface active sites and oxides finally cip was degraded through a series of reactions by free radicals on the surface of the catalyst 4 conclusions in this study a highly dispersed nanocomposite fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were successfully synthesized via simple one step solvothermal process and created an effective way to provide more dispersion of fe3o4 nps to better activate pms for elimination of cip 90 cip was removed within 100 min via the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system comparing with various operation conditions the increase of catalyst dosages pms dosages temperature and corresponding basic conditions were prone to degrade cip which could be mainly ascribed to the more efficient activation of so4 and ho the catalyst characterization and kinetics analysis of the reaction process showed that zsm 5 improved the dispersion and adsorption properties of fe3o4 nps which promoted the local concentration of cip and pms on the surface and accelerated the oxidation in addition coexisting ions and cycling experiments confirmed that fe3o4 zsm 5 was highly adoptive in authentic water conditions and was suitable for practical application this work verifies the superiority of catalysts through l h model fitting which provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of environmentally friendly and highly pms

12774,exploring an environmentally friendly and highly activation catalysts in the advanced oxidation processes aops basing on sulfate radicals so4 has shown great importance for the remediation of refractory contaminants herein fe3o4 wrapped zsm 5 fe3o4 zsm 5 was constructed as heterogeneous catalyst to remove ciprofloxacin cip via peroxymonosulfate pms activation in which performance kinetics and mechanism insight were investigated in depth the removal efficiency of cip reached 90 by fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts within 100 min reaction when the initial ph was 3 0 during the reaction so4 and ho were proved to be coexisted in reaction system and so4 played a critical role in cip degradation according to the radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements based on the catalyst characterization and langmuir hinshelwood adsorption kinetics analysis the synthesis of fe3o4 nanoparticles nps and zsm 5 accelerated the dispersion process and enhanced adsorption ability of fe3o4 nps which further promoted the local concentration of cip and pms on the surface in addition the cycling experiments and metal leaching tests demonstrated that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were stable and could be conveniently reused by magnetic separation in addition the impacts of coexisting irons cl so4 2 no3 hco3 confirmed that fe3o4 zsm 5 was still effective in real water this study demonstrated the promising prospect of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system in the application of degradation refractory organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fe3o4 zsm 5 ciprofloxacin peroxymonosulfate synergy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past decades the frequently and widely use of antibiotics causing serious damage to environment and aquatic ecosystem has attracted broad attention 1 3 ciprofloxacin cip is one of the second generation antibiotics which has exhibited obvious effect in curing the diseases of pneogaster and digestive system 1 4 because of the inadequate metabolism and decomposition of human body 50 70 of administered cip dose is excreted to the natural water through urine and feces 5 unluckily cip is persistent in the effluent impacted urban streams which cannot be removed availably by conventional wastewater treatments causing the occurrence of high cip concentration up to 0 12 mg l 1 in environmental water 6 generally advanced oxidation processes aops are regarded as one of the most effective ways for the destruction of pollutants 7 9 which are mainly contributed by the participation of reactive radicals including sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals ho 10 12 so4 possesses a stronger oxidation ability with a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 ev than ho 1 8 2 7 ev besides so4 maintains longer period and wider range of ph application which shows great application potential for the degradation of refractory organics 13 14 peroxymonosulfate pms as a primary oxidant to produce so4 could be easily activated for generating so4 due to its symmetric structure by diverse approaches such as heat 15 ultraviolet light 16 ultrasonication and transition metal catalysis previously studies investigated that transition metals e g ag ce3 mn3 fe3 fe2 co2 cu2 could activate pms owing to their capability of changing their oxidation states and chemical composition 17 of which iron has attracted tremendous attention due to cost effective low toxicity commercially available 18 especially fe3o4 is a promising practical fe based material which has shown high catalytic activity and possesses the excellent ability to activate pms 19 20 however the magnetic property of fe3o4 usually makes fe3o4 nanoparticles nps gather together in the aqueous solution which greatly covers up the fe3o4 nps active sites and hinders the direct contact of organic compounds in fe3o4 nps surface further limiting the reaction kinetics of fe3o4 nps and pms 21 therefore diffusion and reaction of pollutants on catalyst surface are considered as the speed limit step to heterogeneous catalytic oxidation 22 to better exert the reaction oxidation potency a regular method is proposed to promote the catalytic peculiarity of fe3o4 nps in reaction by combining fe3o4 nps with materials which hold superior specific surface area and rich pore structures to provide more reaction and adsorption sites 23 24 based on the above design zsm 5 is chosen as experimental target which has a stable five member ring molecular sieve catalyst with high si al ratio and has advantages of good water and thermal stability maintain the structure at 1200 c 25 organic amine cations in zsm 5 are prone to be modified by carboxylation to form good catalytic carriers 26 carbonylated zsm 5 can be polymerized with fe3o4 nps to form the stable pms heterogeneous activators in this work fe3o4 decorated zsm 5 catalysts were well synthesized and applied for the efficient removal of cip via activating pms the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the morphologies and magnetic properties of as prepared catalytic materials 2 obtain the optimal chemical compositions 3 determine the effects on cip degradation under various operation conditions including catalyst dosages pms dosages initial ph and water matrix components e g cl so4 2 no3 hco3 4 expound the inner reaction mechanism on catalyst surface and elucidate the superiority of fe3o4 zsm 5 relative to fe3o4 nps by langmuir hinshelwood l h model and epr tests this study provides a novel insight into investigating

40 min 0 4 g zsm 5 molecular sieve and 3 6 g sodium acetate were added into solution and kept stirring vigorously for another 40 min then the suspension was transferred to the autoclave placed in an oven and heated under hydrothermal conditions at 200 c for 8 h subsequently fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were washed by ethanol for several times finally fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were dried at 60 c overnight as a result fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts composites were obtained 2 3 samples characterization the catalyst morphologies of fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were identified by field emission scanning

corresponding element concentration vibrating sample magnetometer vsm was carried out to determine the magnetic properties of fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts thermogravimetric analysis tga and brunauer emmett teller bet were performed to investigate the thermal stability and specific surface area respectively and the reactive oxygen species ross were investigated by epr tests 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was served as the radical spin trapping reagent to further confirm ross 2 4 experimental procedures in the typical procedures the tests of fe3o4 zsm 5 magnetic composites were studied via activating pms to degrade cip these degradation experiments were individually occurred in a series of conical flasks 250 ml with certain stirring speed 518 rpm at 25 c 25 mg fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts and 70 mg pms were thrown into 100 ml cip aqueous 30 umol l 1 then 1 ml experimental liquid was sampled at 0 5 10 15 30 60 and 100 min which was quickly quenched by 50 μl methanol to stop the reaction then samples were further filtered via a 0 45 μm millipore filter for hplc analysis besides experimental operating variables were also determined including fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts dosages

990afg china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalysts 3 1 1 sem the structural characterizations of fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts are presented in fig 1a and b the fe3o4 nps could aggregate into submicro scale quasi spherical particles with the diameter of 300 400 nm fig 1a discrete fe3o4 nps could be clearly observed with some pores and gaps which could increase the specific surface area fig 1b exhibited the emergence of the fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 molecular seize consisting of cubic non convex and sphere like particles from which we could see fe3o4 nps were well dispersed and uniformly distributed on zsm 5 surface the phenomenon was corresponded well to xrd analysis of zsm 5 fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts thus this result indicated that the fe3o4 nps were attached on zsm 5 surface 3 1 2 xrd fig 1c shows the xrd of zsm 5 fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts acquired from xrd rigaku smatlab se in the 2θ range of 10 to 80 six typical peaks were observed for zsm 5 at 2θ 23 2 23 4 24 0 30 0 35 1 and 45 5 respectively which were coincided with previous research 28 the xrd pattern of fe3o4 nps was made up of six peaks at 2θ angles 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 56 9 and 62 6 which were associated with the crystal planes of 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 respectively this result was fitted well with the reported data of yan et al jcpds 79 0419 21 the xrd pattern obtained for the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts exhibited ten characteristic peaks which were well consistent with characteristic peaks of fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 respectively suggesting the formation of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts 3 1 3 vsm fig 1d depicts the typical magnetic hysteresis loops of zsm 5 fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts the zsm 5 had slight magnetic hysteresis loops while fe3o4 nps had the typical superparamagnetic properties the hysteresis loops of fe3o4 nps exhibited an s shaped curve with saturation intensity of 0 208 emu mg 1 comparatively the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts showed relatively smaller magnetic properties with the saturation magnetization of 0 150 emu mg 1 confirming the excellent construction of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts in addition the left inset picture displayed that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were dispersed in water the right inset picture showed an external magnetic force thus fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts could be completely separated from water and be easy to recycle without filtration 3 1 4 bet the specific surface areas of fe3o4 nps zsm 5 and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were measured by bet analysis fig 1e and table s1 the results demonstrated that the average specific surface area of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst was significantly increased to 147 6 m2 g 1 compared to the corresponding value of fe3o4 nps 30 1 m2 g 1 which could be explained by the well attachment of fe3o4 nps onto the zsm 5 surface 386 2 m2 g 1 meanwhile according to the barrett joyner halenda bjh isotherm desorption curve average pore volume and average pore diameter of fe3o4 nps were 0 0666 cm3 g 1and 7 49 nm while the related value of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst decreased to 0 0499 cm3 g 1 and 4 92 nm respectively confirming that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst owned a superior performance on specific surface area and dispersion than fe3o4 nps 3 1 5 tga tga was performed to observe the thermostability of synthesized fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts as shown in fig 1f a slight weight loss approximately 1 95 was obtained below temperature of 170 7 c which could be primarily ascribed to the loss of moisture content adsorbed on the catalyst surface in addition the total weight was losing about 8 20 when the temperature was further elevated to 800 c manifesting that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst owned an excellent thermal stability 3 1 6 tem hr tem and eds mapping of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts the internal structure of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were monitored by using tem hr tem and eds mapping as shown in fig 1g fe3o4 nps tightly anchored on the surface of zsm 5 in addition evident interplanar spacing of 2 53 å was exhibited in fig 1h corresponding to 3 1 1 of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts simultaneously eds mapping results fig 1i m showed that o si al fe dispersed evenly in well synthesized fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts the results of tem hr tem and eds mapping were well conformed to the above sem and xrd results 3 2 advantages of the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system fig 2 shows the comparative results of cip removal efficiency obtained from fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts as well as pms fe3o4 pms zsm 5 pms and fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system there is a huge variation in the removal efficiency of different as prepared catalysts under the same conditions as shown in fig 2a with the existence of pms alone in the system only 47 0 cip was removed within 100 min while the degradation efficiency reached up to 57 4 and 70 4 after addition of zsm 5 and fe3o4 nps during the same reaction time respectively this result mainly ascribed to the adsorption of zsm 5 and the activation of pms by fe3o4 nps to generate free radicals e g so4 and ho fe3o4 nps could activate pms via the one electron transfer process to generate so4 and ho followed by eqs 1 3 besides it has been reported that fe3o4 nps had polyvalent character to favor the charge transfer process with pms whereas 92 2 cip was removed within 100 min via the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system the enhanced degradation efficiency proved that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts had the better catalytic performance compared to fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 alone the distinguished performance of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts could be attributed to two phenomena 1 the smaller particle size and a higher specific surface area table s1 led to the strong adsorption capacity for organic compounds 2 the larger specific surface area always meant more even dispersion of the active sites in the crystal structure which was conductive to the reaction with the organic compounds 29 moreover pseudo first order kinetics model was further applied to investigate the potential advantages of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system fig 2b the rate constants k obs of cip using as prepared catalysts changed from 0 013 min 1 with fe3o4 pms system to 0 015 min 1 applying fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system and finally reached to the maximum k obs value 0 026 min 1 in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system these results showed the joint action of fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 had remarkable promotion for the removal efficiencies of cip therefore from the perspective of catalysts cost and degradation efficiency fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were ideally selected for the further study 1 fe 2 hso 5 so 4 fe 3 oh 2 so 4 oh so 4 2 ho 3 so 4 ho hso 5 3 3 influences of experimental variables 3 3 1 fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst dosages fig 3a depicts the effect of catalyst dosages from 0 05 g to 0 35 g the result shows the removal efficiency slightly increased from 75 3 to 90 7 with the reaction of 100 min this phenomenon could be ascribed to the increase of the dosages of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts which commensurately offered more active site centers available for pms activation 30 the lager amount of active species e g so4 and ho were assumed to enhance the removal efficiency of cip 31 however when the dosages increased to 0 35 g the final removal ratio was almost unchanged the slow increment could be explained that fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts might scavenge excess so4 and ho by the iron based complex on zsm 5 surface as eqs 4 5 described 21 which eliminated the additional active species based on the provided data 0 25 g was determined as the optimal catalyst dosage in the follow up study 4 fe 2 so 4 fe 3 so 4 2 5 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh 3 3 2 pms dosages fig 3b shows the effect of pms dosages on cip removal in the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system when pms dosages varied from 0 5 g l to 0 7 g l the enhancement of cip degradation efficiency was observed from 82 5 to 90 8 however the turning point appeared when the pms dosage up to 0 8 g l where the removal efficiency decreased to 84 5 this result could be explained as follow 1 cip would be directly oxidized by pms as the concentration of pms increased 2 more free radicals e g so4 and ho would be generated as the dosages of pms increased during the reaction of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system enhancing the removal efficiency of cip 3 with the excess addition of pms active species e g so4 and ho would be depleted by pms and or self combination eqs 6 7 21 from another perspective with the increase of the pms dosages the active sites of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts might be saturated which would limit the generation of active species 32 6 hso 5 ho so 5 h 2 o 7 hso 5 so 4 hso 4 so 5 3 3 3 effect of ph ph is a crucial operating parameter in the pms based oxidation processes 33 34 fig 3c shows the effect of ph 3 0 11 0 on the performance of cip removal based on sulfate radical oxidation activated by fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts the degradation rate of cip was highly ph dependent when the ph was adjusted from 3 0 to 5 2 and 7 0 the reaction rate dramatically increased from 0 027 min 1 to 0 114 min 1 and 0 203 min 1 respectively while the degradation ratio kept unchanged as 90 9 thereafter when the ph was further increased to 9 3 and 11 0 cip was completely degraded within 10 min indicated that fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system had better consequent in alkaline solution the huge promotion for cip degradation rate upon the alkaline condition could be primarily ascribed to pms alkaline activation superoxide radical o2 and single oxygen 1o2 was proven to largely produced in pms based system when solution was alkaline since the experiment was adjusted at ph 11 so5 2 was the dominated radical in pms activated system pk pms a1 0 and pk pms a2 9 23 which could be spontaneously transformed into o2 and 1o2 to effectively accelerate the cip removal process eqs 8 12 35 besides the base activation of pms in alkaline condition could also significantly accelerate the generation of free radicals e g so4 and ho which further enhanced the cip removal 36 furthermore pms activated ho might be depleted by h because h also served as ho quencher in the acid solution resulting in a relative low cip degradation efficiency compared to alkaline condition 37 kokate et al showed a similar experiment result that the maximum decolorization rate of acid orange 7 was achieved via the alkaline activation of pms at ph 10 38 thus the alkaline solutions are better for cip removal in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system 8 so 5 2 h

removal rate with temperature increasing the removal efficiencies were significantly improved from 58 to 100 while the solution temperature changed from 15 c to 30 c correspondingly the constants of reaction kinetics were calculated as 0 011 0 016 0 027 and 0 036 min 1 at 15 c 20 c 25 c 30 c respectively fig s4 the increase in temperature boosted the thermodynamics energy of reactants promoting the interaction between reaction involved molecules the linear relationship between lnk app and 1 t was calculated by the arrhenius equation the value of apparent activation energy ea in cip degradation by fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system was calculated as 59 3 kj mol fig s5 which was 1 41 times of standard value 42 1 kj mol based on the above data it was inferred that the process of pms activation was reacted over the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalyst surface rather than the diffusion process which played a key role in the cip degradation 3 4 effect of the authentic water constituents there are a wide variety of inorganic coexisting anions with a relative high concentration in authentic water which might influence the cip degradation thus several inorganic anions e g cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 were selected to investigate the practical application of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts in real water condition according to the standards for drinking water quality of china the concentrations of all anions were set as 3 mm in fig 4a after reaction of 60 min cip was degraded to 71 2 74 5 and 76 3 with the presence of cl so4 2 and no3 respectively obviously inorganic anions e g cl so4 2 no3 had slightly inhibiting effects on the cip degradation except hco3 this result could be explained by eqs 13 16 in which cl and no3 would react with so4 and ho to produce relatively low chemical reactivity intermediate radicals e g cl cl2 and no3 bocos et al 2017 subsequently a tiny amount of so4 and ho would non selectively attack inorganic anions of cl and no3 instead of cip resulting in the decrease of cip removal efficiency similar inhibitory effects were also observed in cufe2o4 pms o3 and uv pms systems 39 however the cip degradation rate dramatically increased from 0 026 to 2 055 min 1 when 0 3 mm hco3 was added to the solution there are two probable interpretations for this phenomenon the first interpretation is that hco3 can capture so4 and ho to yield co3 co3 is a highly selectivity oxidant with electrophilic characteristic which owned extreme high reaction rate 109 m 1 s 1 with electron abundant materials e g phenols aniline and nitrogen sulfate containing compound 40 the second interpretation is that pms has the asymmetrical molecular structure which can be easily activated into high reactivity anion radicals by hco3 41 13 no 3 so 4 so 4 2 no 3 k 5 5 10 4 m 1 s 1 14 no 3 oh oh no 3 k 5 5 10 4 m 1 s 1 15 cl so 4 so 4 2 cl k 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 16 cl oh oh cl k 3 0 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 5 determination of the major radical specials radical scavenging and epr dmpo tests were conducted to distinguish the major radicals involved in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system meoh was acted as an effective scavenger for both so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and ho 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 while tba was acted as an useful scavenger only for ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 42 in addition p bq and l histidine were used to explore the potential effect of superoxide radical and singlet oxygen radical fig 5a depicts that both p bq the molar ratio of p bq pms 10 1 and l histidine the molar ratio of l histidine pms 10 1 showed no inhibitory effect as the degradation efficiency of cip were 90 0 and 91 8 respectively this phenomenon indicated superoxide radical and singlet oxygen radical were not generated in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system during cip oxidation process in acidic solution however the addition of meoh the molar ratio of meoh pms 100 1 obviously decreased the removal efficiency from 92 2 to 47 0 while the addition of tba the molar ratio of tba pms 100 1 only decreased the removal efficiency from 92 2 to 75 5 respectively thus meoh exhibited better inhibitory effect comparing to tba at the same equivalent indicating that so4 and ho coexisted in reaction system and so4 played a more critical role in cip degradation to further confirm the existence of so4 and ho the result of epr dmpo tests were carried out in fig 5b the obvious signals peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were observed which validated that so4 and ho were simultaneously generated at the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system thus both ho and so4 could be regarded as the primary free radicals which contributed to the cip degradation in fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system 3 6 the stability and reusability of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts to make allowances for the practical appliance of the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts it is vital to explore the stability and reusability of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts four consecutive cycles for the degradation of cip by fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system under the abovementioned conditions were conducted as shown in fig 6a a satisfactory cip removal result was observed after consecutive runs nearly completely degradation 92 2 of cip was observed in the 1st run while the degradation efficiency maintained at 85 6 in the 2nd run and slightly dropped to 72 1 and 69 0 in the 3rd and 4th runs without distilling water washing therefore fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts kept a gratifying activity for the activation of pms after four cycles according to the above results the slight decrease of cip degradation efficiency might owe to the consumption of active sites of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts besides cip molecular on fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts surface might probably hinder the mass transfer between catalysts and pms via adsorption process simultaneously the leaching concentrations of total iron were detected in fig 6b at the first two cycles the concentrations of total iron were measured as 637 μg l 1 and 549 μg l 1 which decreased dramatically to 143 μg l 1 and 86 μg l 1 in the remaining two cycles respectively the mass ratio of the released iron to the effective loaded iron increased from 6 8 to 16 3 after four cycles the leaching of total iron element was considered due to the dissolution of partial fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts during the reaction 43 in general these results indicated that the leaching amount of total iron maintained at an acceptable range and fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts had shown a favorable reusability for pms activation 3 7 degradation mechanism generally the reaction rate of heterogeneous catalytic reaction was highly dependent on the surface adsorption capacity of heterogeneous catalyst to better elucidate the reaction mechanism of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system eley rideal e r model or the langmuir hinshelwood l h model are proceeded for the heterogeneous catalytic reaction the former is that only one oxidant is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and then directly reacts with the other reactant in solution and the latter is that all reactants are adsorbed on the catalyst surface and then react with each other 24 fig 7 illustrates the effect of pms and cip on the reaction rate of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system when the pms concentration increased the reaction rate k app was increased accordingly which was in great agreement with the l h model the k app values were calculated by eq 17 in supporting information 17 k app ks k cip n c cip n 1 k pms c pms m 1 k cip c cip n k pms c pms m 2 table 1 summarized the fitting parameters in the reaction the k pms of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms and fe3o4 pms were approximately 56 and 32 times higher than k cip which indicated that cip was more strongly oxidized by pms on the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts than adsorption in addition the k pms of fe3o4 zsm 5 pms was roughly 3 times higher than fe3o4 pms thus the combination of fe3o4 nps and zsm 5 simultaneously enhanced the catalyst surface adsorption of cip and pms fig 8a shows the xps images of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts before and after reaction exhibiting a further insight into the variation of catalyst element composition to facilize facilitate the exploration of reaction mechanism the fe 2p spectrum of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were assigned to two contribution peaks 712 0 ev and 725 0 ev which correspondingly represented the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively the 2p orbital of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts could likewise be separated into two component peaks at fe ii 710 4 ev and fe iii 712 3 ev besides the shake up satellite peak shifted from 719 0 ev to 718 4 ev for the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts was obtained according to the deconvolution results peak area of iron element was calculated to investigate the variation of chemical valence the proportion of fe ii and fe iii in total iron element were 59 0 and 57 9 before reaction respectively while the proportion of fe ii in total iron element was decreased to 42 1 after the reaction this result might be attributed to the electron transfer via the surface of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts during the pms based oxidation process the heterogeneous system based on sr aops is dominated by surface reaction and the reaction rate is primarily affected by several experimental factors such as pms concentrations and catalyst performance fig 8b demonstrates that the removal rate of heterogeneous catalyst system was constricted by the initial reaction over fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts surface firstly cip was absorbed to the surface of the fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts by non electrostatic force due to the superior specific surface area of fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts similarly pms was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst by overcoming the electrostatic force and being activated via electron transfer to react with cip according to the above kinetic analysis zsm 5 in fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts as an adsorbent for pms and cip could provide enough adsorption sites and enhances the probability of reaction occurrence due to its large specific surface area and highly porous structure secondly based on the catalyst properties zsm 5 was believed to supply better dispersion of iron element on the catalyst surface and thus increased the contact opportunities of surface active sites and oxides finally cip was degraded through a series of reactions by free radicals on the surface of the catalyst 4 conclusions in this study a highly dispersed nanocomposite fe3o4 zsm 5 catalysts were successfully synthesized via simple one step solvothermal process and created an effective way to provide more dispersion of fe3o4 nps to better activate pms for elimination of cip 90 cip was removed within 100 min via the fe3o4 zsm 5 pms system comparing with various operation conditions the increase of catalyst dosages pms dosages temperature and corresponding basic conditions were prone to degrade cip which could be mainly ascribed to the more efficient activation of so4 and ho the catalyst characterization and kinetics analysis of the reaction process showed that zsm 5 improved the dispersion and adsorption properties of fe3o4 nps which promoted the local concentration of cip and pms on the surface and accelerated the oxidation in addition coexisting ions and cycling experiments confirmed that fe3o4 zsm 5 was highly adoptive in authentic water conditions and was suitable for practical application this work verifies the superiority of catalysts through l h model fitting which provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of environmentally friendly and highly pms
