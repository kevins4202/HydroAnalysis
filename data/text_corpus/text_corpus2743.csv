for biodiesel application herein the isolated microalga chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was cultured in primary treated wastewater ptww and secondary treated wastewater stww incorporated with zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps the characterizations of zno nps were performed by analytical technique and cytotoxicity assay of microalga against nanoparticles nps was carried out prior to the experiment the nutrient reduction rate of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and total organic carbon toc by microalga was found higher in ptww as compared to the stww when incorporated with the zno nps maximum biomass of 3 43 g l and 2 14 g l along with 1 9 and 1 5 folds increase in cellular lipid was recorded in the presence of ptww and stww respectively as compared to control bg 11 the cellular lipids were converted to fatty acid methyl esters fames by the process of transesterification and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the cells developed in ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps were recorded with a higher amount of saturated fatty acids sfa and monounsaturated fatty acids mufa with controlled polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa biofuel properties were found in accordance with american and european guidelines the present report suggested that the chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 zno nps association is capable of better nutrient removal from sewage wastewater therefore the nano bio hybrid opens a new paradigm for efficient wastewater treatment and consequent quality biodiesel production keywords microalgae sewage wastewater zno nanoparticles nutrient removal biofuel properties 1 introduction water is one of the most important resources of the earth but with the increase in population human activities led to a rise in biological and chemical contaminants in the water system and hamper the environment 1 till now wastewater treatment plants are majorly incipient to eradicate the contamination by various methods using radiations and chemicals which possess high energy costs and require additional hazard management 2 the conventional methods generally applied for sewage wastewater treatment is through trickling filters and activated sludge that efficiently removes the organic pollutants but ineffective for inorganic matters however there is a need to develop a cost effective approach to treat wastewater and achieve high nutrient recovery oxygenic photosynthetic algae have been considered as an environment friendly renewable source for wastewater treatment which simultaneously attributes for nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal along with co2 mitigation by converting solar energy into valuable biomass 3 the employment of wastewater resources including sewage municipal dairy effluents has been found appropriate for mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae by serving as the proficient medium for microalgal growth and lipid production towards biodiesel synthesis 4 in order to explore microalgae for biodiesel production inexpensive cultivation strategies are highly required ideal synthetic media known for microalgae growth are found expensive and cannot be feasible at a large scale hence there is a need for finding the replacement of synthetic media for biomass and lipid production that may produce cost effective biodiesel 5 the integration of wastewater treatment with microalgae cultivation is well accepted however the removal efficiency of the system must be enhanced to make the process feasible at a commercial level 4 recent literature reported that the cost associated with microalgae based wastewater treatment is lower than the conventional methods 6 8 the current advancement in nanoscale science engineering has facilitated the application of nanotechnology in wastewater treatment numerous studies have shown that nanoparticles nps have the vast capability and potential in wastewater treatment mainly with the help of adsorption and helps to breakdown the contaminants 9 several nanomaterials including titanium dioxide manganese oxide carbon nanotubes have proven effective role in the destruction of contaminants mainly due to their exceptionally high surface area and fast adsorption 10 zno is widely studied for wastewater treatment as they have a strong affinity for pollutants moreover they absorb visible light with high surface reactivity due to a large number of active sites that help them in the removal of contaminants from wastewater 11 zno nps are preferred over a similar type of metal oxide nps due to its wide bandgap 3 37 ev and high excitation binding energy 60 mev 12 that promotes its adhesive properties studies showed that zn and zno nps are having high adsorption characteristics owing to the presence of high surface energy that helps in the formation of stable hybrid material with surrounding cells 13 14 in the current scenario zno nps have become one of the most popular metal oxide nanoparticles due to their excellent biocompatibility low cost and less toxicity 15 it was studied that nanomaterials conjugated with microalgae was found more effective towards wastewater treatment and may promote microalgae growth 16 17 in the study of wahid et al 16 multi layer graphene algae hybrid material is more efficient for nitrate removal than a pristine microalgae cells but the growth was not enhanced under the same condition the bio nano composite synthesized of fe2o3 and microalgae was found effective for heavy metals removal from aqueous solution 17 size concentration and surface area of nanoparticles are important parameters in the selection of nanomaterials however sometimes they hamper the cellular activities and hence cytotoxic assay is required before their use 18 literature suggest that a large number of microalgae are known for wastewater treatment with integrated high lipid production 5 19 still few potential strains remained unexplored chlorosarcinopsis sp is a robust green microalga that has potential for nitrogen and phosphorous removal from wastewater 20 21 but the alga has not been investigated for the removal of a wide range of the micronutrients and lipid production for biodiesel application in this vein for the first time the formation of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 zno nps association is examined for the nutrient removal from wastewater the efficiency of microalgae chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 that was isolated from okhla sewage treatment plant ostp new delhi india was tested in association with zno nps for the treatment of ptww and stww with consecutive lipid production hence the main objectives of the current research were to examine the potential cytotoxicity of zno nps towards the isolated microalgae to analyze nutrient reduction in ptww and stww using microalgae zno nps association and to further explore the low cost suitable medium as a replacement for improved biodiesel application 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae isolation and identification the wastewater

intermittent shaking there was no external co2 bubbling supplemented in the entire cultivation system the biomass and lipid productivity were analyzed by the dcw and bligh and dyer method as described earlier 25 26 the physicochemical properties of wastewater including cod were determined by the open reflux method whereas the component was oxidized by potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 with silver nitrate agno3 that acted as a catalyst by following cpcb manual standard protocol of wastewater 31 apart from that tn was estimated by modified kjeldahl method adapted from the standard method 4500

biochemical estimation of novel microalga the genetic identification of the model strain was executed by the 18s rdna marker and further sequencing was performed the obtained sequence was analyzed with the presence of homologous sequence at gene bank national centre for biotechnology information ncbi using the blast tool which confirmed that the alga exhibited maximum homology with chlorosacinopsis sp km114872 1 the isolated microalga chlorosacinopsis sp mas04 belongs to the kingdom viridiplantae class chlorophyceae and order chlorosarcinales chlorosacinopsis sp mas04 is a green unicellular photosynthetic microorganism and generally found in freshwater bodies this genus is unique in the area of biodiesel application however few reports are known for the bioremediation purpose and antibacterial activity 20 21 the isolate was demonstrated for its morphometric characterization the microalga was visualized by confocal microscopy and sem as depicted in fig 1 according to fig 1a the microalga was expressed as uninucleate spherical having a broad range of cell diameter 2 5 μm the cell was surrounded by a thin mucilage layer with prominent chloroplasts a nucleus in the middle and possess multi zoosporic feature apart from that the most unique morphological characteristic of this monoalga attributed the cluster formation by dense colonies and such type of cellular behaviour is known as sarcinoid habitat 36 to record the cell surface morphology the sem image fig 1b was visualized with the cell diameter of 2 5 μm coincides as observed by confocal microscopy fig 1c illustrated the eds of our test microorganism to corroborate the elemental composition that shows the presence of potassium k chloride cl oxygen o sodium na the proximate analysis of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was described in table 1 where 2 02 of ash content and 2 75 of moisture content were obtained biochemical estimation reported the presence of lipid carbohydrate and protein with 19 56 21 respectively 3 2 cytotoxicity analysis of zno nps with chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 3 2 1 characterization of zno nps the preliminary characterization of zno nps was carried out before introducing them to the algal suspension sem image of zno nps was displayed in fig 2 a where the spherical nps with a smooth surface were observed in the agglomerated state the eds spectrum of zno nps fig 2b confirmed the presence of zn and o peaks with 61 23 and 23 85 respectively fig 2c shows the xrd pattern of zno nps peaks of particle reveal the formation of hexagonal wurtzite phase of zno nps which is in the agreement with jcpds file no 36 1451 37 the broadening of the peaks indicated the existence of small nanocrystals in the sample the sharp diffraction peaks designate the good crystallinity of zno nps 3 2 2 cytotoxicity assay in presence of zno nps the primary cytotoxicity was carried out with chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 at different concentrations of zno nps ranging from 1 mg l to 100 mg l as shown in fig 3 significant cell viability was observed when1 mg l 100 and 10 mg l 100 of zno nps were used in the cell culture until 96 h however by providing 50 mg l and 100 mg l of zno nps a decrease in cell viability was observed even at 6 h and the maximum cytotoxicity was seen at 96 h chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 showed compatibility with zno nps at lower concentrations while found intolerant at a very high concentration previous toxicity studies reported the growth inhibition of chlorella sp with 50 mg l of zno nps concentration 38 hence the algae cytotoxicity was attributed by the higher concentration of zno nps in aqueous solution for long term retention studies the algal growth and pigment assay were assessed for toxicity cell biomass was measured at varying concentrations of zno nps and expressed in fig 4 biomass production in presence of zno nps treatment exhibited the same trend with cell viability count results demonstrated the remarkable enhancement in cell density at a lower concentration of nps providing 1 mg l and 10 mg l of zno nps the maximum biomass attained was 0 43 and 0 69 g l respectively after 96 h exposure the sudden increase in the biomass after 48 h was seen which can be attributed to microalgae behaviour as algal cells start developing the specific transport system under stress condition for the uptake of nutrient and other substrates once the microalga acclimatizes in the provided condition the biomass was uplifted 39 a consistent increase in cell density was obtained as compared to control however it is worthy to note that the growth inhibition was perceived at the higher dosage of zno nps 50 mg l and 100 mg l the plausible mechanism behind nps mediated cell inhibition could be explained by reactive oxygen species ros the stress that causes lipid peroxidation and damages the cell organelles in presence of a high concentration of nps on contrary when provided with a lower concentration of zno nps the generated ros was captured by defensive enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat hence the biomass was elevated 40 sod catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide to h2o2 eq 19 19 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 however at higher concentrations of zno nps the oxidative stress induced by ros exceeds the scavenging capacity of enzymes oxidative damage occurred finally leading to cell growth inhibition 41 interestingly at 6 h the higher the concentration of 50 mg l and 100 mg l zno nps promoted cell biomass and then substantial inhibition was observed this is possibly due to the less accumulation of ros in the medium at an initial 6 h when provided with 50 100 mg l zno nps the role of ros depends on the pulse duration site of action and concentration of nanoparticles 42 at initial 6 h the generated ros was under the limit and the cell was well defended by defensive enzymes simultaneously the enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of nutrient and their uptake was highly active to increase the biomass level over time when ros accumulation has increased the reduction in cell growth was observed the high nps concentration slowly formed agglomerates which over time easily settled nps may entrap the algal cell and are accounted as toxic and the comparable observation was reported in studies of ji et al 43 the toxic effect linked to the attachment of nps on to the algal surface may destroy the cell surface architecture during the exposure of nps on microalgae irreversible damage may occur hence explains the different toxicity of nps through the exposure time whereas the cell viability slightly decreased at 6 h zone as it is known that cell viability only counts the viable cells and does not differentiate between dividing from non dividing cells the low ros concentration generated in cells act as a signalling molecule that regulates the cellular process which increases the biomass possibly protein and enzyme activity might have increased 44 hence in fig 4 the biomass is the cumulate of all the biochemical components noticeably a similar pattern was observed in photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoid content leading to cell proliferation at a lower dosage of zno nps fig 5 in the presence of nps the rubisco activity increases which directly affects the photosynthetic rate 45 hence explains the rise in photosynthetic pigment at higher concentration in initial 6 h also with the time progression the lower pigments concentration can be explained by the properties of nps which could wrap up the algal cells leading to the shading or they could enter the algal cells and attach on the mitochondria resulting in the reduction of cell photosynthesis when provided with the higher concentration of nps 46 whereas lower concentration 1 mg l and 10 mg l of zno nps proved beneficial for enhancement in pigments moreover variation in size structure surface area and opaqueness in the suspension of nps are considered the effective parameters for controlling toxicity there are handfuls of reports discussing the toxicity of nps towards microalgae nano mgo found to be toxic even at low concentration towards s obliquus 47 zno nps triggered the substantial cytotoxicity on microalgae s platensis 29 in the present study cytotoxicity assay confirms the lower concentration 10 mg l of zno nps delivers no toxic effect on microalga cells and helps in cell proliferation 3 3 cultivation of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 in ptww and stww incorporated with an optimized concentration of zno nps 3 3 1 characterization of ptww and stww with zno nps the wastewater collected from ostp i e ptww and stww were carrying a significant amount of n p c as indicated in table 2 and hence they were used as nutrient media for chlorosarcinopsissp mas04 the physicochemical characteristics including cod tn tp and toc were analyzed before and after cultivating the microalgae in ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps and the obtained data were compared for two media towards the response of microalgae zno nps association table 2 3 3 2 nutrient removal the maximum substrate degradation was measured as 85 in ptww supplemented with zno nps while 80 in stww with zno nps additionally cod reduction in ptww incorporated with zno nps specified that the microalgae not only utilize co2 but also they were able to consume organic carbon as a substrate for cellular growth 48 the mechanism underlying for the cod removal in wastewater is based on co oxidation of active oxides the reduction in cod was achieved due to the assimilation of carbon during microbial photosynthesis since microalgae cultivation requires copious carbon however reduction in cod also influenced by the type of microalgae and environmental conditions 3 49 the selected microalga chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was capable of growing in ptww and stww added with zno nps and heralded as mixotrophic cultivation due to the presence of a higher toc tn ratio in our present study chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was widely contributed to tn and tp removal from ptww and stww supplemented with zno nps signifying as a great potential for removal capability microalga facilitated the reduction of tn tp ratio from 9 71 1 7 01 1 and 8 33 1 6 65 1 when cultivated in ptww and stww respectively table 2 the tn removal rate of 8 7 mg l with an elimination efficiency of 87 20 was observed in ptww supplemented with zno nps that was found slightly lower in stww with zno nps literature depicted the tn was reduced to 36 when microalga chlorella sp was cultivated in effluents from primary settler 50 the tp removal by isolated microalga was recorded as 82 21 in ptww and 81 5 in stww provided with zno nps that was found much higher in contrast to previous work 50 51 where ptww and stww were used for microalgae cultivation the current study revealed that chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 also exhibited a higher removal rate of toc in ptww 97 5 and stww 95 3 when supplemented with zno nps hence we strongly believe that the maximum carbon removal efficiency from primary and secondary treated sewage wastewater integrated with zno nps supported the mixotrophic behaviour of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 similar observation was achieved by xiao et al 52 where 0 15 mm concentration of zno nps was found effective for phosphorous removal 62 by chlorella vulgaris in oecd medium another study reported that zno nps corresponds to the tn and soluble ortho phosphorous sop removal by 75 6 and 70 8 respectively from activated sludge 53 n p and c are important elements in microalgae and they have their specific function towards the architectural modulation of the cell membrane among them n acts as an indispensable nutrient for microalgae growth and metabolism nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase support the reduction of nitrate and nitrite for the ultimate conversion into amino acids 54 all forms of inorganic n lastly reduced to nh4 before they merged into amino acid finally glutamine synthase enables the conversion of nh4 into amino acid glutamine utilizing glutamate glu and adenosine triphosphate atp the role of glutamate causes 70 extra nh4 reduction eq 20 55 another important element is phosphorous that helps in the energy metabolism of microalgae which is present in nucleic acid lipids and proteins in course of the growth and development of microalgae inorganic phosphates like h2po4 and h2po4 2 have an indispensable role in microalgae cells p is required to assimilate adenosine diphosphate adp and atp nucleotides protein phospholipids used for carbohydrate metabolism po4 3 p accumulated as polyphosphate granules which allows the p removal besides precipitation is another major approach for p removal 56 carbon treated as a significant element and efficiently utilized in the form of carbonates as microalgae transport bicarbonates into the plasma membrane and chloroplast of the cell hence supporting the cellular proliferation 54 cellular respiration of microalgae results in carbon assimilation where organic carbon and oxygen used as electron donors and electron acceptors respectively microalgae has the potential to assimilate organic and inorganic carbon for growth hence resulting in the reduction of toc in growth media 3 the literature stated that the zno nps were found to be capable of removing various contaminants with high performance and selectivity it was suggested that the initial adsorption rate of zno nps was controlled with film diffusion followed by the pore diffusion surface hydroxyl groups of nanosized zno which proved to play a major role in adsorbing various elements 57 the algae zno nps association possibly enhances the adsorption of tn tp and toc on the cell surface and increased the assimilation of these nutrients by the cells also the metal oxides retain the minimal environmental impact and these are not involved in secondary pollution formation so they have been considered as sorbents to remove heavy metals 58 3 3 3 surface interaction of zno nps to algal cell introducing zno nps to the algae cell suspension triggered the adsorption on algae as indicated in fig 6 the charge neutralization and electrostatic interaction are predicted to occur between negatively charged microalga cells cooh and nh3 and positively charged zno nps fig 6a the extracellular products from microalgae mainly reside of monosaccharides or polysaccharides and fatty acids hence they could coat zno nps through electrostatic interaction as polysaccharides are sulfated and fatty acid is protonated at neutral ph 9 fig 6b confirms that in the presence of an organic solvent zno nps agglomerated and deposited on the algal surface which displayed damage to the cell membrane the formation of large aggregates of nps treated cells was a possibility due to the self protecting mechanism of algal cells such as secretion of exudates from stressed cells it is worthy to note that in the process of nutrient removal the zno nps were not discharged into water bodies as the particles were attached to microalga cells fig 6bdemonstrates the aggregation of zno nps on the surface of microalgae cells even after the lipid removal hence nps do not cause secondary pollution 3 3 4 biomass assimilation and lipid production under ptww and stww medium supplemented with zno nps the dynamic growth pattern of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 in photoautotrophy bg 11 demonstrated the maximum biomass production of 1 44 g l at the end of the exponential phase 18th day of time exposure as depicted in fig 7 moreover mixotrophy boosted the maximum biomass of 3 43 g l in ptww with zno nps followed by 2 14 g l in stww with zno nps on the 14th day of inoculation the biomass accumulation was much lower insole ptww 1 97 g l and stww 1 87 g l biomass productivity was calculated as 0 245 g l d and 0 153 g l d in ptww with zno nps and stww with zno nps respectively those were much higher than control 0 072 g l d fig 8 the composition of ptww and stww that possessed a suitable ratio of tc tn and tp might have supported the algal growth to prodigious level moreover the toc present may stimulate the organic carbon based metabolic pathway in microalgae under appropriate mixotrophic conditions the possible reason for the boosted biomass in presence of ptww with zno nps could be because these nps have a photocatalytic activity that helped in the degradation of the complex organic waste and other inorganic compounds to simpler ones hence nutrients are effortlessly available to microalgae 59 they may also trigger the digestive enzyme activity hence degraded the nutrients which are present in the surrounding and helped in easy uptake by the cell therefore we could envisage that our isolated microalga easily accustomed to functionalizing their metabolism by adapting the nutrients from ptww and stww in presence of zno nps in a significant manner the previous reports illustrated that microalgae were successfully grown under the mixotrophic mode of cultivation in presence of co2 and absorbed organic c which stimulated photosynthetic rate along with the formation of essential metabolites additionally photochemical reaction psi and psii promoted atp formation that could be able to improve the synthesis of organic substrate and help for microalgae growth by using wastewater 60 an earlier study documented that c as the organic nutrient source in ptww and acted as a substrate for mixotrophy in chlorella vulgaris which was mainly responsible for the highest biomass of 1 6 g l and 2 71 g l over 13 days of incubation period in ptww respectively 50 61 in our present work the microalgae chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was capable to grow in both ptww with zno nps and stww with zno nps where ptww with zno nps showed comparatively better yield due to higher amount of organic carbon consumption followed by adsorption of zno nps on the microalga cells moreover the n p ratio is responsible for microalgae cell proliferation that must range from 8 to 45 1 55 another study suggested that higher n p ratio but within the optimized range proved to be better for cell growth 51 in this regard the n p ratio in ptww was found 9 7 1 and in stww obtained 8 33 1 the ratio found suitable in both media but ptww performed better concerning cell proliferation the effect of wastewater used in the present work was further studied on microalgae lipid production the impact of nutrients present in ptww with zno nps and stww with zno nps on the lipid content of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was measured the maximum lipid productivity of 0 088 g l d and lipid content of 36 was achieved in ptww incorporated with zno nps that was significantly higher than the amount obtained in stww with zno nps 0 044 g l d 29 and control 0 013 g l d 19 fig 8 the comparative data of lipid production is represented in table 3 where the present studies are compared to related microalgae cells grown in the presence of primary and secondary treated wastewater in the study conducted by nagarajan et al 2020 6 stated the maximum biomass production 1 67 g l was obtained in presence of ptww in contrast the highest biomass attained in the present study was 2 folds higher in ptww incorporated with zno nps a study reported an enhanced biomass production of 0 19 g l lipid production of 0 057 g l and lipid content of 30 in stww 4 however the yield was quite higher in the present work furthermore in previous study nagabalaji et al 62 demonstrated that the cod elimination efficiency obtained in stww was 90 2 along with tn 68 6 and tp 71 5 when compared with our findings the removal efficiency of cod tn and tp were estimated as 80 85 2 and 81 5 respectively it is worth noticing that we obtained toc with the highest removal efficiency of 97 5 mg l in ptww and 95 3 mg l in stww whereas c content has not been generally considered in the previous studies at this stage confocal microscopy was applied to visualize the cellular lipid globules using nile red as a staining dye fluorescence images fig 9 supported the data obtained in fig 8 and table 3 as it represented the maximum lipid visualization in the cells cultivated in ptww followed by stww in presence of zno nps and lastly control bg11 the prevalence of the mixotrophic cultivation may result in carbohydrate accumulation through an inducible hexose that is responsible for the activation of acetyl coa for triggering the lipid biomolecules this activated acetyl coa convert into fatty acid and triglyceride tag which transport through the cytosol to form lipid granules 63 possibly the maximum lipid synthesis of chlorosarcinopsissp mas04 grown in ptww and stww integrated with zno nps could be ascribed due to the higher organic c supplementation as compared to control moreover the lower amount of n and p existed in ptww and stww might have affected carbon fixation which leads to upraise the production of fatty acids and converted fatty acid acyl coa to tag hence more lipid content was observed in presence of wastewater 64 another report also supported the availability of high c with lower tn and tp pronounced higher lipid assimilation 65 these results are in good agreement with earlier reports where mgso4 nps greatly promoted both biomass and lipid productivity under mixotrophic conditions 47 whereas in another report mg aminoclay enhanced the lipid productivity by 25 under the mixotrophic condition 66 the upsurge lipid accumulation in ptww might be due to the high ratio of c n p in ptww 65 7 9 7 1 in relative to stww 34 6 8 3 1 3 4 fames characterization for biodiesel application fame was obtained after transesterification reaction in the presence of acid catalyst 67 as given in eq 21 triacylglycerol methanol glycerolfatty acid methyl ester fame a comparative investigation of the fames profile obtained from chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 under photoautotrophic bg 11 and mixotrophic mode ptww and stww along with 10 mg l of zno nps were studied for biodiesel application and represented in fig 10 the fames profile obtained for chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 in photoautotrophic culture provided with bg 11 revealed the existence of palmitic acid c16 0 29 65 palmitoleic acid c16 1 3 22 7 10 hexadecenoic acid c16 2 4 5 margaric acid c17 0 3 4 stearic acid c18 0 5 43 oleic acid c18 1 5 linoleic acid c18 2 14 73 linolenic acid c18 3 11 2 and arachidic acid c20 0 5 5 fig 10a on the other hand the mixotrophic cultivation showed a remarkable increase in mainly c16 0 c18 1 and c18 2 with the occurrence of 40 88 19 4 17 06 in ptww supplemented with zno nps and 34 02 13 07 11 08 in stww with zno nps respectively fig 10b and fig 10c the varying ratio of c n p might be responsible for a change in the fatty acid profile of isolated microalga as compared to control pufa content was found lower in cells grown in the presence of ptww and stww in contrast to control the result indicated that higher amount of sfa and mufa and the lower amount of pufa promoted the biodiesel properties as the higher unsaturated bond was able to decrease the oil stability of biodiesel and higher saturated components promote biodiesel properties 68 the compositions of fames are greatly influencing the properties of biodiesel including cn sv iv lcsf cfpp and osi hence in the present study these parameters are calculated with the help of fames profile table 4 the value of cn was evaluated as 65 57 and 50 for ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps and control respectively which met the minimum limit as prescribed by european14214 and us standard 50 48 previous literature mentioned the cn as 56 7 for chlorella sp 51 the greater value of cn shows better combustion rate less nitrous oxide nox emission and easy start up of the engine 24 sv found to be 193 mg g 1 in ptww with zno nps which was comparable to the sv obtained in earlier cases of e gracilis 191 4 mg g 1 and chlorella sp 217 8 mg g 1 12 51 the iv of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was achieved as 64 11 g i2g 100 g 61 98 g i2g 100 g and 70 66 g i2g 100 g oil in ptww supplemented with zno nps stww with zno nps and control respectively it is a well known fact that iv is directly proportional to the double bond in fatty acid and this value could be used to quantify the amount of double bond present in the oil which reflected the susceptibility of oil to oxidation 28 all the above values attained much lower than the european standard value of 120 g i2g 100 g oil higher iv value may lead to the polymerization of glycerides and deposition of lubricants in the engine 70 lcsf values were recorded as 25 69 c and 25 82 c in ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps respectively the values were slightly lower than the value found in control 27 37 c the value of cfpp 69 51 c was relatively higher in the fames obtained from chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 but the value significantly decreased when the cells grown in the presence of ptww and stww supplemented with zno nps improving the quality of biodiesel the lcsf and cfpp are related to each other and signify a higher amount of sfa in biodiesel that governs the flow property of the fuel at lower temperatures according to standard guidelines cfpp is location and season dependent and varies across the globe the osi calculated for chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was 5 82 h in ptww zno nps supplemented medium whereas for stww with zno nps and control the values were obtained higher as 7 47 h and 8 56 h respectively consecutively the value of osi was directly influenced by the high amount of sfa the current values obtained were well above the minimum acceptable limit of 3 h according to astm d6751 02 hence all the fuel parameters discussed in table 3 lay within the range of international standards the result of the fames profile indicated the lipid produced from chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 in presence of ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps were suitable for biodiesel production thus the utilization of both ptww and stww associated with zno nps proved effective low cost suitable medium to replace the synthetic media bg 11 therefore the study suggested that microalgae chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 efficiently serve as a potential source under the integrated approach to strengthen the wastewater treatment and biodiesel production 3 5 practical implication and future prospect the novel nano bio hybrid process offers the potential application in wastewater treatment with simultaneously sustainable biodiesel production the designed process confirms the new trends of wastewater treatment for high nutrient recovery and better lipid productivity applicable for improved fame production the aforementioned nano bio strategy potentially opening the avenues for the utilization of renewable energy sources and can be utilized for wastewater purification this study brings a pioneer perspective for the development of a renewable energy process for the future however in the current study different parameters of zno nps is not examined for wastewater treatment also the nano biomaterial is explored for specifically for ptww and stww thus further studies are needed to design the optimization parameters like temperature ph and incubation time of nps with microalgae in wastewater for improved biodiesel production the surface area of nps is an important parameter in the application of forming the microbial association hence more studies required for increasing the surface area of nps that help in providing more effective wastewater treatment furthermore the techno economic analyses are needed to be focused on the scalability and sustainability of the proposed integrated work 4 conclusions the present study was aimed at developing a novel integration of microalga chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 with zno nps for wastewater treatment and biodiesel production by utilizing a nano bio approach the isolated microalga exhibited 97 5 87 20 82 21 removal efficiency for toc tn tp when grown in ptww in association with 10 mg l zno nps and presented with highest biomass production and lipid content of 3 43 g l 1 and 36 respectively the fames ranging between c16 c18 were significantly increased by providing microalgae zno association in ptww suggested better use of it for high quality biodiesel this is the first report that discusses the fames production from the potential microalgae chlorosarcinopsis sp in conjugation with zno nps this assimilation may serve as a promising solution to improve the sustainability of wastewater treatment plants along with a feasible biodiesel application hence a proper scale up technology with the reuse of nanomaterials is required with cost assessment

13715,present investigation highlighted the capability of microalgae cultivation in sewage wastewater integrated with nanomaterial addressing wastewater treatment and consequent improvement in lipid for biodiesel application herein the isolated microalga chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was cultured in primary treated wastewater ptww and secondary treated wastewater stww incorporated with zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps the characterizations of zno nps were performed by analytical technique and cytotoxicity assay of microalga against nanoparticles nps was carried out prior to the experiment the nutrient reduction rate of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and total organic carbon toc by microalga was found higher in ptww as compared to the stww when incorporated with the zno nps maximum biomass of 3 43 g l and 2 14 g l along with 1 9 and 1 5 folds increase in cellular lipid was recorded in the presence of ptww and stww respectively as compared to control bg 11 the cellular lipids were converted to fatty acid methyl esters fames by the process of transesterification and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the cells developed in ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps were recorded with a higher amount of saturated fatty acids sfa and monounsaturated fatty acids mufa with controlled polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa biofuel properties were found in accordance with american and european guidelines the present report suggested that the chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 zno nps association is capable of better nutrient removal from sewage wastewater therefore the nano bio hybrid opens a new paradigm for efficient wastewater treatment and consequent quality biodiesel production keywords microalgae sewage wastewater zno nanoparticles nutrient removal biofuel properties 1 introduction water is one of the most important resources of the earth but with the increase in population human activities led to a rise in biological and chemical contaminants in the water system and hamper the environment 1 till now wastewater treatment plants are majorly incipient to eradicate the contamination by various methods using radiations and chemicals which possess high energy costs and require additional hazard management 2 the conventional methods generally applied for sewage wastewater treatment is through trickling filters and activated sludge that efficiently removes the organic pollutants but ineffective for inorganic matters however there is a need to develop a cost effective approach to treat wastewater and achieve high nutrient recovery oxygenic photosynthetic algae have been considered as an environment friendly renewable source for wastewater treatment which simultaneously attributes for nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal along with co2 mitigation by converting solar energy into valuable biomass 3 the employment of wastewater resources including sewage municipal dairy effluents has been found appropriate for mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae by serving as the proficient medium for microalgal growth and lipid production towards biodiesel synthesis 4 in order to explore microalgae for biodiesel production inexpensive cultivation strategies are highly required ideal synthetic media known for microalgae growth are found expensive and cannot be feasible at a large scale hence there is a need for finding the replacement of synthetic media for biomass and lipid production that may produce cost effective biodiesel 5 the integration of wastewater treatment with microalgae cultivation is well accepted however the removal efficiency of the system must be enhanced to make the process feasible at a commercial level 4 recent literature reported that the cost associated with microalgae based wastewater treatment is lower than the conventional methods 6 8 the current advancement in nanoscale science engineering has facilitated the application of nanotechnology in wastewater treatment numerous studies have shown that nanoparticles nps have the vast capability and potential in wastewater treatment mainly with the help of adsorption and helps to breakdown the contaminants 9 several nanomaterials including titanium dioxide manganese oxide carbon nanotubes have proven effective role in the destruction of contaminants mainly due to their exceptionally high surface area and fast adsorption 10 zno is widely studied for wastewater treatment as they have a strong affinity for pollutants moreover they absorb visible light with high surface reactivity due to a large number of active sites that help them in the removal of contaminants from wastewater 11 zno nps are preferred over a similar type of metal oxide nps due to its wide bandgap 3 37 ev and high excitation binding energy 60 mev 12 that promotes its adhesive properties studies showed that zn and zno nps are having high adsorption characteristics owing to the presence of high surface energy that helps in the formation of stable hybrid material with surrounding cells 13 14 in the current scenario zno nps have become one of the most popular metal oxide nanoparticles due to their excellent biocompatibility low cost and less toxicity 15 it was studied that nanomaterials conjugated with microalgae was found more effective towards wastewater treatment and may promote microalgae growth 16 17 in the study of wahid et al 16 multi layer graphene algae hybrid material is more efficient for nitrate removal than a pristine microalgae cells but the growth was not enhanced under the same condition the bio nano composite synthesized of fe2o3 and microalgae was found effective for heavy metals removal from aqueous solution 17 size concentration and surface area of nanoparticles are important parameters in the selection of nanomaterials however sometimes they hamper the cellular activities and hence cytotoxic assay is required before their use 18 literature suggest that a large number of microalgae are known for wastewater treatment with integrated high lipid production 5 19 still few potential strains remained unexplored chlorosarcinopsis sp is a robust green microalga that has potential for nitrogen and phosphorous removal from wastewater 20 21 but the alga has not been investigated for the removal of a wide range of the micronutrients and lipid production for biodiesel application in this vein for the first time the formation of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 zno nps association is examined for the nutrient removal from wastewater the efficiency of microalgae chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 that was isolated from okhla sewage treatment plant ostp new delhi india was tested in association with zno nps for the treatment of ptww and stww with consecutive lipid production hence the main objectives of the current research were to examine the potential cytotoxicity of zno nps towards the isolated microalgae to analyze nutrient reduction in ptww and stww using microalgae zno nps association and to further explore the low cost suitable medium as a replacement for improved biodiesel application 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae isolation and identification the wastewater

with the presence of homologous sequence at gene bank national centre for biotechnology information ncbi using the blast tool which confirmed that the alga exhibited maximum homology with chlorosacinopsis sp km114872 1 the isolated microalga chlorosacinopsis sp mas04 belongs to the kingdom viridiplantae class chlorophyceae and order chlorosarcinales chlorosacinopsis sp mas04 is a green unicellular photosynthetic microorganism and generally found in freshwater bodies this genus is unique in the area of biodiesel application however few reports are known for the bioremediation purpose and antibacterial activity 20 21 the isolate was demonstrated for its morphometric characterization the microalga was visualized by confocal microscopy and sem as depicted in fig 1 according to fig 1a the microalga was expressed as uninucleate spherical having a broad range of cell diameter 2 5 μm the cell was surrounded by a thin mucilage layer with prominent chloroplasts a nucleus in the middle and possess multi zoosporic feature apart from that the most unique morphological characteristic of this monoalga attributed the cluster formation by dense colonies and such type of cellular behaviour is known as sarcinoid habitat 36 to record the cell surface morphology the sem image fig 1b was visualized with the cell diameter of 2 5 μm coincides as observed by confocal microscopy fig 1c illustrated the eds of our test microorganism to corroborate the elemental composition that shows the presence of potassium k chloride cl oxygen o sodium na the proximate analysis of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was described in table 1 where 2 02 of ash content and 2 75 of moisture content were obtained biochemical estimation reported the presence of lipid carbohydrate and protein with 19 56 21 respectively 3 2 cytotoxicity analysis of zno nps with chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 3 2 1 characterization of zno nps the preliminary characterization of zno nps was carried out before introducing them to the algal suspension sem image of zno nps was displayed in fig 2 a where the spherical nps with a smooth surface were observed in the agglomerated state the eds spectrum of zno nps fig 2b confirmed the presence of zn and o peaks with 61 23 and 23 85 respectively fig 2c shows the xrd pattern of zno nps peaks of particle reveal the formation of hexagonal wurtzite phase of zno nps which is in the agreement with jcpds file no 36 1451 37 the broadening of the peaks indicated the existence of small nanocrystals in the sample the sharp diffraction peaks designate the good crystallinity of zno nps 3 2 2 cytotoxicity assay in presence of zno nps the primary cytotoxicity was carried out with chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 at different concentrations of zno nps ranging from 1 mg l to 100 mg l as shown in fig 3 significant cell viability was observed when1 mg l 100 and 10 mg l 100 of zno nps were used in the cell culture until 96 h however by providing 50 mg l and 100 mg l of zno nps a decrease in cell viability was observed even at 6 h and the maximum cytotoxicity was seen at 96 h chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 showed compatibility with zno nps at lower concentrations while found intolerant at a very high concentration previous toxicity studies reported the growth inhibition of chlorella sp with 50 mg l of zno nps concentration 38 hence the algae cytotoxicity was attributed by the higher concentration of zno nps in aqueous solution for long term retention studies the algal growth and pigment assay were assessed for toxicity cell biomass was measured at varying concentrations of zno nps and expressed in fig 4 biomass production in presence of zno nps treatment exhibited the same trend with cell viability count results demonstrated the remarkable enhancement in cell density at a lower concentration of nps providing 1 mg l and 10 mg l of zno nps the maximum biomass attained was 0 43 and 0 69 g l respectively after 96 h exposure the sudden increase in the biomass after 48 h was seen which can be attributed to microalgae behaviour as algal cells start developing the specific transport system under stress condition for the uptake of nutrient and other substrates once the microalga acclimatizes in the provided condition the biomass was uplifted 39 a consistent increase in cell density was obtained as compared to control however it is worthy to note that the growth inhibition was perceived at the higher dosage of zno nps 50 mg l and 100 mg l the plausible mechanism behind nps mediated cell inhibition could be explained by reactive oxygen species ros the stress that causes lipid peroxidation and damages the cell organelles in presence of a high concentration of nps on contrary when provided with a lower concentration of zno nps the generated ros was captured by defensive enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat hence the biomass was elevated 40 sod catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide to h2o2 eq 19 19 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 however at higher concentrations of zno nps the oxidative stress induced by ros exceeds the scavenging capacity of enzymes oxidative damage occurred finally leading to cell growth inhibition 41 interestingly at 6 h the higher the concentration of 50 mg l and 100 mg l zno nps promoted cell biomass and then substantial inhibition was observed this is possibly due to the less accumulation of ros in the medium at an initial 6 h when provided with 50 100 mg l zno nps the role of ros depends on the pulse duration site of action and concentration of nanoparticles 42 at initial 6 h the generated ros was under the limit and the cell was well defended by defensive enzymes simultaneously the enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of nutrient and their uptake was highly active to increase the biomass level over time when ros accumulation has increased the reduction in cell growth was observed the high nps concentration slowly formed agglomerates which over time easily settled nps may entrap the algal cell and are accounted as toxic and the comparable observation was reported in studies of ji et al 43 the toxic effect linked to the attachment of nps on to the algal surface may destroy the cell surface architecture during the exposure of nps on microalgae irreversible damage may occur hence explains the different toxicity of nps through the exposure time whereas the cell viability slightly decreased at 6 h zone as it is known that cell viability only counts the viable cells and does not differentiate between dividing from non dividing cells the low ros concentration generated in cells act as a signalling molecule that regulates the cellular process which increases the biomass possibly protein and enzyme activity might have increased 44 hence in fig 4 the biomass is the cumulate of all the biochemical components noticeably a similar pattern was observed in photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoid content leading to cell proliferation at a lower dosage of zno nps fig 5 in the presence of nps the rubisco activity increases which directly affects the photosynthetic rate 45 hence explains the rise in photosynthetic pigment at higher concentration in initial 6 h also with the time progression the lower pigments concentration can be explained by the properties of nps which could wrap up the algal cells leading to the shading or they could enter the algal cells and attach on the mitochondria resulting in the reduction of cell photosynthesis when provided with the higher concentration of nps 46 whereas lower concentration 1 mg l and 10 mg l of zno nps proved beneficial for enhancement in pigments moreover variation in size structure surface area and opaqueness in the suspension of nps are considered the effective parameters for controlling toxicity there are handfuls of reports discussing the toxicity of nps towards microalgae nano mgo found to be toxic even at low concentration towards s obliquus 47 zno nps triggered the substantial cytotoxicity on microalgae s platensis 29 in the present study cytotoxicity assay confirms the lower concentration 10 mg l of zno nps delivers no toxic effect on microalga cells and helps in cell proliferation 3 3 cultivation of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 in ptww and stww incorporated with an optimized concentration of zno nps 3 3 1 characterization of ptww and stww with zno nps the wastewater collected from ostp i e ptww and stww were carrying a significant amount of n p c as indicated in table 2 and hence they were used as nutrient media for chlorosarcinopsissp mas04 the physicochemical characteristics including cod tn tp and toc were analyzed before and after cultivating the microalgae in ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps and the obtained data were compared for two media towards the response of microalgae zno nps association table 2 3 3 2 nutrient removal the maximum substrate degradation was measured as 85 in ptww supplemented with zno nps while 80 in stww with zno nps additionally cod reduction in ptww incorporated with zno nps specified that the microalgae not only utilize co2 but also they were able to consume organic carbon as a substrate for cellular growth 48 the mechanism underlying for the cod removal in wastewater is based on co oxidation of active oxides the reduction in cod was achieved due to the assimilation of carbon during microbial photosynthesis since microalgae cultivation requires copious carbon however reduction in cod also influenced by the type of microalgae and environmental conditions 3 49 the selected microalga chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was capable of growing in ptww and stww added with zno nps and heralded as mixotrophic cultivation due to the presence of a higher toc tn ratio in our present study chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was widely contributed to tn and tp removal from ptww and stww supplemented with zno nps signifying as a great potential for removal capability microalga facilitated the reduction of tn tp ratio from 9 71 1 7 01 1 and 8 33 1 6 65 1 when cultivated in ptww and stww respectively table 2 the tn removal rate of 8 7 mg l with an elimination efficiency of 87 20 was observed in ptww supplemented with zno nps that was found slightly lower in stww with zno nps literature depicted the tn was reduced to 36 when microalga chlorella sp was cultivated in effluents from primary settler 50 the tp removal by isolated microalga was recorded as 82 21 in ptww and 81 5 in stww provided with zno nps that was found much higher in contrast to previous work 50 51 where ptww and stww were used for microalgae cultivation the current study revealed that chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 also exhibited a higher removal rate of toc in ptww 97 5 and stww 95 3 when supplemented with zno nps hence we strongly believe that the maximum carbon removal efficiency from primary and secondary treated sewage wastewater integrated with zno nps supported the mixotrophic behaviour of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 similar observation was achieved by xiao et al 52 where 0 15 mm concentration of zno nps was found effective for phosphorous removal 62 by chlorella vulgaris in oecd medium another study reported that zno nps corresponds to the tn and soluble ortho phosphorous sop removal by 75 6 and 70 8 respectively from activated sludge 53 n p and c are important elements in microalgae and they have their specific function towards the architectural modulation of the cell membrane among them n acts as an indispensable nutrient for microalgae growth and metabolism nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase support the reduction of nitrate and nitrite for the ultimate conversion into amino acids 54 all forms of inorganic n lastly reduced to nh4 before they merged into amino acid finally glutamine synthase enables the conversion of nh4 into amino acid glutamine utilizing glutamate glu and adenosine triphosphate atp the role of glutamate causes 70 extra nh4 reduction eq 20 55 another important element is phosphorous that helps in the energy metabolism of microalgae which is present in nucleic acid lipids and proteins in course of the growth and development of microalgae inorganic phosphates like h2po4 and h2po4 2 have an indispensable role in microalgae cells p is required to assimilate adenosine diphosphate adp and atp nucleotides protein phospholipids used for carbohydrate metabolism po4 3 p accumulated as polyphosphate granules which allows the p removal besides precipitation is another major approach for p removal 56 carbon treated as a significant element and efficiently utilized in the form of carbonates as microalgae transport bicarbonates into the plasma membrane and chloroplast of the cell hence supporting the cellular proliferation 54 cellular respiration of microalgae results in carbon assimilation where organic carbon and oxygen used as electron donors and electron acceptors respectively microalgae has the potential to assimilate organic and inorganic carbon for growth hence resulting in the reduction of toc in growth media 3 the literature stated that the zno nps were found to be capable of removing various contaminants with high performance and selectivity it was suggested that the initial adsorption rate of zno nps was controlled with film diffusion followed by the pore diffusion surface hydroxyl groups of nanosized zno which proved to play a major role in adsorbing various elements 57 the algae zno nps association possibly enhances the adsorption of tn tp and toc on the cell surface and increased the assimilation of these nutrients by the cells also the metal oxides retain the minimal environmental impact and these are not involved in secondary pollution formation so they have been considered as sorbents to remove heavy metals 58 3 3 3 surface interaction of zno nps to algal cell introducing zno nps to the algae cell suspension triggered the adsorption on algae as indicated in fig 6 the charge neutralization and electrostatic interaction are predicted to occur between negatively charged microalga cells cooh and nh3 and positively charged zno nps fig 6a the extracellular products from microalgae mainly reside of monosaccharides or polysaccharides and fatty acids hence they could coat zno nps through electrostatic interaction as polysaccharides are sulfated and fatty acid is protonated at neutral ph 9 fig 6b confirms that in the presence of an organic solvent zno nps agglomerated and deposited on the algal surface which displayed damage to the cell membrane the formation of large aggregates of nps treated cells was a possibility due to the self protecting mechanism of algal cells such as secretion of exudates from stressed cells it is worthy to note that in the process of nutrient removal the zno nps were not discharged into water bodies as the particles were attached to microalga cells fig 6bdemonstrates the aggregation of zno nps on the surface of microalgae cells even after the lipid removal hence nps do not cause secondary pollution 3 3 4 biomass assimilation and lipid production under ptww and stww medium supplemented with zno nps the dynamic growth pattern of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 in photoautotrophy bg 11 demonstrated the maximum biomass production of 1 44 g l at the end of the exponential phase 18th day of time exposure as depicted in fig 7 moreover mixotrophy boosted the maximum biomass of 3 43 g l in ptww with zno nps followed by 2 14 g l in stww with zno nps on the 14th day of inoculation the biomass accumulation was much lower insole ptww 1 97 g l and stww 1 87 g l biomass productivity was calculated as 0 245 g l d and 0 153 g l d in ptww with zno nps and stww with zno nps respectively those were much higher than control 0 072 g l d fig 8 the composition of ptww and stww that possessed a suitable ratio of tc tn and tp might have supported the algal growth to prodigious level moreover the toc present may stimulate the organic carbon based metabolic pathway in microalgae under appropriate mixotrophic conditions the possible reason for the boosted biomass in presence of ptww with zno nps could be because these nps have a photocatalytic activity that helped in the degradation of the complex organic waste and other inorganic compounds to simpler ones hence nutrients are effortlessly available to microalgae 59 they may also trigger the digestive enzyme activity hence degraded the nutrients which are present in the surrounding and helped in easy uptake by the cell therefore we could envisage that our isolated microalga easily accustomed to functionalizing their metabolism by adapting the nutrients from ptww and stww in presence of zno nps in a significant manner the previous reports illustrated that microalgae were successfully grown under the mixotrophic mode of cultivation in presence of co2 and absorbed organic c which stimulated photosynthetic rate along with the formation of essential metabolites additionally photochemical reaction psi and psii promoted atp formation that could be able to improve the synthesis of organic substrate and help for microalgae growth by using wastewater 60 an earlier study documented that c as the organic nutrient source in ptww and acted as a substrate for mixotrophy in chlorella vulgaris which was mainly responsible for the highest biomass of 1 6 g l and 2 71 g l over 13 days of incubation period in ptww respectively 50 61 in our present work the microalgae chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was capable to grow in both ptww with zno nps and stww with zno nps where ptww with zno nps showed comparatively better yield due to higher amount of organic carbon consumption followed by adsorption of zno nps on the microalga cells moreover the n p ratio is responsible for microalgae cell proliferation that must range from 8 to 45 1 55 another study suggested that higher n p ratio but within the optimized range proved to be better for cell growth 51 in this regard the n p ratio in ptww was found 9 7 1 and in stww obtained 8 33 1 the ratio found suitable in both media but ptww performed better concerning cell proliferation the effect of wastewater used in the present work was further studied on microalgae lipid production the impact of nutrients present in ptww with zno nps and stww with zno nps on the lipid content of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was measured the maximum lipid productivity of 0 088 g l d and lipid content of 36 was achieved in ptww incorporated with zno nps that was significantly higher than the amount obtained in stww with zno nps 0 044 g l d 29 and control 0 013 g l d 19 fig 8 the comparative data of lipid production is represented in table 3 where the present studies are compared to related microalgae cells grown in the presence of primary and secondary treated wastewater in the study conducted by nagarajan et al 2020 6 stated the maximum biomass production 1 67 g l was obtained in presence of ptww in contrast the highest biomass attained in the present study was 2 folds higher in ptww incorporated with zno nps a study reported an enhanced biomass production of 0 19 g l lipid production of 0 057 g l and lipid content of 30 in stww 4 however the yield was quite higher in the present work furthermore in previous study nagabalaji et al 62 demonstrated that the cod elimination efficiency obtained in stww was 90 2 along with tn 68 6 and tp 71 5 when compared with our findings the removal efficiency of cod tn and tp were estimated as 80 85 2 and 81 5 respectively it is worth noticing that we obtained toc with the highest removal efficiency of 97 5 mg l in ptww and 95 3 mg l in stww whereas c content has not been generally considered in the previous studies at this stage confocal microscopy was applied to visualize the cellular lipid globules using nile red as a staining dye fluorescence images fig 9 supported the data obtained in fig 8 and table 3 as it represented the maximum lipid visualization in the cells cultivated in ptww followed by stww in presence of zno nps and lastly control bg11 the prevalence of the mixotrophic cultivation may result in carbohydrate accumulation through an inducible hexose that is responsible for the activation of acetyl coa for triggering the lipid biomolecules this activated acetyl coa convert into fatty acid and triglyceride tag which transport through the cytosol to form lipid granules 63 possibly the maximum lipid synthesis of chlorosarcinopsissp mas04 grown in ptww and stww integrated with zno nps could be ascribed due to the higher organic c supplementation as compared to control moreover the lower amount of n and p existed in ptww and stww might have affected carbon fixation which leads to upraise the production of fatty acids and converted fatty acid acyl coa to tag hence more lipid content was observed in presence of wastewater 64 another report also supported the availability of high c with lower tn and tp pronounced higher lipid assimilation 65 these results are in good agreement with earlier reports where mgso4 nps greatly promoted both biomass and lipid productivity under mixotrophic conditions 47 whereas in another report mg aminoclay enhanced the lipid productivity by 25 under the mixotrophic condition 66 the upsurge lipid accumulation in ptww might be due to the high ratio of c n p in ptww 65 7 9 7 1 in relative to stww 34 6 8 3 1 3 4 fames characterization for biodiesel application fame was obtained after transesterification reaction in the presence of acid catalyst 67 as given in eq 21 triacylglycerol methanol glycerolfatty acid methyl ester fame a comparative investigation of the fames profile obtained from chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 under photoautotrophic bg 11 and mixotrophic mode ptww and stww along with 10 mg l of zno nps were studied for biodiesel application and represented in fig 10 the fames profile obtained for chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 in photoautotrophic culture provided with bg 11 revealed the existence of palmitic acid c16 0 29 65 palmitoleic acid c16 1 3 22 7 10 hexadecenoic acid c16 2 4 5 margaric acid c17 0 3 4 stearic acid c18 0 5 43 oleic acid c18 1 5 linoleic acid c18 2 14 73 linolenic acid c18 3 11 2 and arachidic acid c20 0 5 5 fig 10a on the other hand the mixotrophic cultivation showed a remarkable increase in mainly c16 0 c18 1 and c18 2 with the occurrence of 40 88 19 4 17 06 in ptww supplemented with zno nps and 34 02 13 07 11 08 in stww with zno nps respectively fig 10b and fig 10c the varying ratio of c n p might be responsible for a change in the fatty acid profile of isolated microalga as compared to control pufa content was found lower in cells grown in the presence of ptww and stww in contrast to control the result indicated that higher amount of sfa and mufa and the lower amount of pufa promoted the biodiesel properties as the higher unsaturated bond was able to decrease the oil stability of biodiesel and higher saturated components promote biodiesel properties 68 the compositions of fames are greatly influencing the properties of biodiesel including cn sv iv lcsf cfpp and osi hence in the present study these parameters are calculated with the help of fames profile table 4 the value of cn was evaluated as 65 57 and 50 for ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps and control respectively which met the minimum limit as prescribed by european14214 and us standard 50 48 previous literature mentioned the cn as 56 7 for chlorella sp 51 the greater value of cn shows better combustion rate less nitrous oxide nox emission and easy start up of the engine 24 sv found to be 193 mg g 1 in ptww with zno nps which was comparable to the sv obtained in earlier cases of e gracilis 191 4 mg g 1 and chlorella sp 217 8 mg g 1 12 51 the iv of chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was achieved as 64 11 g i2g 100 g 61 98 g i2g 100 g and 70 66 g i2g 100 g oil in ptww supplemented with zno nps stww with zno nps and control respectively it is a well known fact that iv is directly proportional to the double bond in fatty acid and this value could be used to quantify the amount of double bond present in the oil which reflected the susceptibility of oil to oxidation 28 all the above values attained much lower than the european standard value of 120 g i2g 100 g oil higher iv value may lead to the polymerization of glycerides and deposition of lubricants in the engine 70 lcsf values were recorded as 25 69 c and 25 82 c in ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps respectively the values were slightly lower than the value found in control 27 37 c the value of cfpp 69 51 c was relatively higher in the fames obtained from chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 but the value significantly decreased when the cells grown in the presence of ptww and stww supplemented with zno nps improving the quality of biodiesel the lcsf and cfpp are related to each other and signify a higher amount of sfa in biodiesel that governs the flow property of the fuel at lower temperatures according to standard guidelines cfpp is location and season dependent and varies across the globe the osi calculated for chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 was 5 82 h in ptww zno nps supplemented medium whereas for stww with zno nps and control the values were obtained higher as 7 47 h and 8 56 h respectively consecutively the value of osi was directly influenced by the high amount of sfa the current values obtained were well above the minimum acceptable limit of 3 h according to astm d6751 02 hence all the fuel parameters discussed in table 3 lay within the range of international standards the result of the fames profile indicated the lipid produced from chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 in presence of ptww and stww incorporated with zno nps were suitable for biodiesel production thus the utilization of both ptww and stww associated with zno nps proved effective low cost suitable medium to replace the synthetic media bg 11 therefore the study suggested that microalgae chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 efficiently serve as a potential source under the integrated approach to strengthen the wastewater treatment and biodiesel production 3 5 practical implication and future prospect the novel nano bio hybrid process offers the potential application in wastewater treatment with simultaneously sustainable biodiesel production the designed process confirms the new trends of wastewater treatment for high nutrient recovery and better lipid productivity applicable for improved fame production the aforementioned nano bio strategy potentially opening the avenues for the utilization of renewable energy sources and can be utilized for wastewater purification this study brings a pioneer perspective for the development of a renewable energy process for the future however in the current study different parameters of zno nps is not examined for wastewater treatment also the nano biomaterial is explored for specifically for ptww and stww thus further studies are needed to design the optimization parameters like temperature ph and incubation time of nps with microalgae in wastewater for improved biodiesel production the surface area of nps is an important parameter in the application of forming the microbial association hence more studies required for increasing the surface area of nps that help in providing more effective wastewater treatment furthermore the techno economic analyses are needed to be focused on the scalability and sustainability of the proposed integrated work 4 conclusions the present study was aimed at developing a novel integration of microalga chlorosarcinopsis sp mas04 with zno nps for wastewater treatment and biodiesel production by utilizing a nano bio approach the isolated microalga exhibited 97 5 87 20 82 21 removal efficiency for toc tn tp when grown in ptww in association with 10 mg l zno nps and presented with highest biomass production and lipid content of 3 43 g l 1 and 36 respectively the fames ranging between c16 c18 were significantly increased by providing microalgae zno association in ptww suggested better use of it for high quality biodiesel this is the first report that discusses the fames production from the potential microalgae chlorosarcinopsis sp in conjugation with zno nps this assimilation may serve as a promising solution to improve the sustainability of wastewater treatment plants along with a feasible biodiesel application hence a proper scale up technology with the reuse of nanomaterials is required with cost assessment

in biodegradation of fipronil and resource recovery from the wastewater and soil system based on the effective degradation rate and kinetics under in vitro conditions this strain could be used for large scale treatment of fipronil contaminants in soil and water environments keywords fipronil degradation bacillussp fa3 immobilization resource recovery 1 introduction pesticides are widely used to control insect pests for different purposes 1 2 primary use of pesticides in agricultural sector is to protect crops from various insects 3 throughout the globe excessive use of pesticides has affected approximately 3 million human lives due to their inherent toxicity 4 5 this toxicity causes severe health problems in humans and other living organisms 6 7 in agricultural sector pesticides are not completely removed from the soil due to recalcitrant nature of these chemicals pesticides affect soil water and air in the environment due to their toxic nature as they persist for a long time in these systems 8 10 fipronil and its metabolites were found in soil water and plant tissues in the contaminated sites 11 residual fipronil has been reported in agricultural and flowering plants brassica plantago ipomoea and camellia 12 a higher concentration of fipronil can affect the agricultural soil by reducing the number of beneficial microorganisms the decline of these microbial strains might lead to less productivity of the profitable crops 13 thus reducing the level of fipronil in the environment is a significant concern throughout the world fipronil 5 amino1 2 6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethyl 4 phenyl trifluoromethysulfinyl h pyrazole 3 carbonitrile chemical formula c12h4cl2f6n4os is a phenylpyrazole pesticide and discovered by rhone poulenc a french chemical and pharmaceutical company in the year 1987 fipronil is applied to various crops as an insecticide and it can kill more than 250 pests it is highly toxic to zooplankton crustaceans bees termites rabbits and lizards traditionally various organochlorines carbamates and organophosphates are used to control agricultural insects 2 fipronil is a new generation insecticide and its mode of action is different from organochlorines organophosphates and pyrethroids 14 18 fipronil inhibits the function of the gamma amino butyric acid gaba receptor in insects by binding with gaba receptor which blocks the functions of the chloride ion channels and disrupt central nervous system cns previous studies have suggested that fipronil binds with gaba receptor in insects with higher affinity than vertebrates 19 fipronil induces apoptosis in drosophila melanogaster via the mitochondrial caspase dependent pathway 20 lethal effects of fipronil were also investigated in juvenile zebrafish danio rerio 21 it is shown to induce oxidative stress in brain and kidney cells of mice 22 due to its toxicity in water and soil environments degradation of fipronil residue is an important and persisting environmental issue fipronil can be degraded by chemical physical and microbial methods microbial methods are eco friendly and cost effective and microorganisms have the potential to degrade the residues of fipronil in soil and water environments bacterial strains belonging to streptomyces rochei 2 paracoccus sp 23 bacillus firmmus bacillus thuringiensis 24 25 bacillus spp 26 stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila 27 and the fungal strain aspergillus glaucus ajag1 28 has been reported to possess fipronil degradation potential in various natural environments biodegradation of fipronil was found to be the most effective way to remediate its residues from environment besides microorganisms earthworms eisenia feotida also contribute to fipronil degradation and remediation in soil 29 fipronil was degraded into desulfinyl sulfone and sulfide metabolites in a previous study 30 present work investigates the role of bacillus sp fa3 in fipronil degradation and resource recovery in a contaminated environment in this study fipronil degradation experiments were performed with the following objectives i to characterize the fipronil degrading bacteria isolated from contaminated agricultural fields ii to optimize the fipronil biodegradation in mineral salt medium using response surface methodology iii to analyze growth associated degradation of fipronil with bacterial strain fa3 iv to estimate

characterized using biochemical morphological and molecular tools 26 31 2 2 optimization of fipronil degradation and kinetics critical parameters used in degradation of fipronil with strain fa3 were optimized under laboratory conditions using statistically significant response surface methodology rsm technique 32 33 box behnken design was used to determine critical factors and their main and interactive influences on fipronil degradation 34 three important critical factors namely ph temperature and shaking speed were used in fipronil degradation experiment a total of 50 mg l 1 fipronil in

was calculated using the lowest significance differences lsd at p 0 05 to analyze the differences among treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacillus sp strain fa3 in fipronil degradation degradation results demonstrated that fa3 strain had potential to degrade fipronil in water and soil environments strain fa3 was isolated from contaminated agricultural fields 26 morphologically strain fa3 is a gram positive small rod shaped bacterium on the basis of the 16s rdna strain fa3 was characterized as bacillus sp and the sequence of the strain was deposited in genbank with accession number kt186612 to date very few reports have focused on the isolation and characterization of fipronil degrading bacterial strains soil samples used for the isolation of the strain fa3 contained residual fipronil in the range of 0 75 6 29 μg kg 1 of soil in a previous study the streptomyces rochei strain ajag7 was reported to be involved in fipronil degradation 2 bacillus thuringiensis bacillus firmus paracoccus sp and stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila were also investigated for their fipronil degradation potential 24 25 27 previous reports on these bacterial strains showed that these bacteria can degrade fipronil in water soil and contaminated sites indigenous soil water microbes degrade and transform fipronil in contaminated sites and reduce its biomagnification in food chains 24 25 study on fipronil degradation in sterilized and unsterilized soil had also confirmed higher degradation rate of fipronil in unsterilized soil 39 degradation potential of each microbe was assessed by its recovery from contaminated environments 29 3 2 optimization of fipronil degradation using box behnken design the process of fipronil biodegradation was optimized using box behnken design of response surface methodology rsm table 1 degradation of fipronil was different in all the 17 experiments and was in the range of 58 76 the model was proven to be reliable and accurate within the limits of the chosen factors temperature ph and shaking speed 3d view of optimized conditions and contour plot represented best degradation conditions for fipronil in mineral salt medium fig 1 a b c and d the center points in the contour plot and three graphs showed maximum fipronil degradation under the influence of critical parameters in an interactive manner significant statistical analyses and analysis of variance anova for the applied model were calculated using all the parameters table s1 determination coefficient r2 indicated that maximum responses were covered by the model and showed that the predicted values of the model were in good agreement with the experimental values the model for fipronil biodegradation was highly significant p 0 0001 indicating that the established quadratic model for degradation by strain fa3 was adequate and reliable in representing the actual relationship between the responses and variables the coded quadratic equation for fipronil degradation is described in eq 3 3 fipronil degradation 76 2 30 temperature 3 45 ph 1 67 shaking speed 0 45 temperature ph 2 25 temperature shaking speed 0 95 ph shaking speed 3 37 temperature2 4 92 ph2 0 020 shaking speed2 the optimized conditions for fipronil biodegradation using strain fa3 were temperature 32 c ph 7 0 and shaking speed 110 rpm the main purpose of using rsm was to evaluate the relationship between the predicted values of the dependent variable as well as the conditions of the dependent variables 40 box behnken is commonly used in industrial application because of its economical design moreover it requires only three levels for each factor 8 41 box behnken designs with critical factors such as ph temperature shaking speed inocula size and nutrient concentrations have been commonly used for the degradation of pesticides 8 34 42 in a previous research it was proven that rsm is a convenient and efficient system to investigate the optimum degradation conditions for pesticides using bacterial and fungal strains 42 the box behnken design was studied with stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila and it was found to be effective for fipronil degradation under in vitro conditions 27 therefore the results of rsm have significant application for fipronil and other pesticide degradation and can be used to enhance and optimize the degradation process 3 3 growth linked degradation of fipronil with fa3 relationship between growth of strain fa3 and fipronil degradation is presented in fig 2 fipronil biodegradation showed a set pattern with bacterial growth degradation increased gradually as the strain entered in logarithmic phase 4 5 days and stationary phase 7 8 days a decrease in degradation was observed when bacterial strain reached its death phase 12 days fa3 treatment degraded approximately 76 0 fipronil after 15 days of experimentation all the results showed a 0 05 level of significance gradual increase in the growth of fa3 was observed after 2 5 days with a gradual reduction in fipronil concentration bacterial growth was directly linked with fipronil degradation bacillus sp strain fa3 utilized fipronil as a sole source of carbon and energy previously various researchers have reported that in the absence of a carbon source bacterial strains use pesticides to fulfill their nutritional requirements 2 24 different microbes opt different metabolic pathways to degrade fipronil and other pesticides 4 25 these metabolic pathways are helpful in degrading fipronil and transforming it into other metabolites which can be less toxic to the environment 43 it was observed that the bacterial strain can degrade traces of fipronil in a liquid medium 3 4 degradation kinetics of fipronil strain fa3 was able to utilize fipronil in the concentration range of 50 mg l 1 to 900 mg l 1 the specific degradation rate constant q was calculated which showed a higher value at a low concentration and a lower value at a high concentration fig 3 kinetic parameters such as q max k s and k i were calculated for fipronil degradation with strain fa3 and the values were 1 4155 day 1 65 096 mg l 1 and 156 330 mg l 1 respectively bacterial growth was hindered at higher fipronil concentrations degradation kinetics of fipronil followed first order reaction kinetics the half life t 1 2 degradation constant k and determination coefficient r2 were 7 7 days 0 0891 day 1 and 0 921 day 1 respectively in msm medium inoculated with strain fa3 table 2 whereas t 1 2 in the abiotic control was 277 3 days suggesting that strain fa3 plays an effective role in fipronil degradation a significant decrease in t 1 2 of fipronil in the presence of strain fa3 makes fa3 a promising candidate for fipronil bioremediation from water and soil environments previously little information was available on the degradation and kinetics of fipronil in water and soil environments in a study fipronil degradation and kinetics studies were performed using bacillus thuringiensis these studies have found that in the presence of b thuringiensis t 1 2 of fipronil in clay loam soil reduced significantly 24 25 the results of this study also match closely with previous studies on degradation pattern and kinetics of fipronil and other pesticides 4 18 the half life of the pesticide can be reduced by effective bacterial treatments and a potential culture could be used to remove contaminants from the soil and water system at large scale 32 34 36 3 5 effect of immobilization on fipronil degradation immobilized bacillus sp strain fa3 with sodium alginate beads and agar discs showed enhanced fipronil degradation fipronil degradation of 44 7 and 56 7 using immobilized bacterial cells with sodium alginate beads was observed respectively after 5 and 10 days of the experiment the maximum degradation 77 0 was observed after 15 days of the experiment fig 4 in the agar discs an immobilization assay with the fa3 cells resulted in 43 0 48 0 and 78 0 fipronil degradation at 5 10 and 15 days of the experiment fipronil s degradation kinetics with the immobilized strain fa3 demonstrated the better efficiency of these treatments table 2 fipronil degradation with the immobilized assay followed first order reaction kinetics fipronil s t 1 2 in the control with sodium alginate was calculated to be 66 6 days and 7 4 days for fa3 under agar disc immobilization the t 1 2 was 55 0 days and 7 5 days for the control and fa3 treated samples respectively the k values for the sodium alginate treatment were 0 0104 day 1 and 0 0931 day 1 for the control and fa3 treatment whereas with the agar disc the k values were calculated as 0 0126 day 1 and 0 0927 day 1 for the control and fa3 treatments respectively the results of the immobilization assay showed that fa3 was more effective for fipronil degradation than the msm medium the region behind the increased degradation with sodium alginate and agar disc beads might be due to the increased surface area for nutritional uptake in the msm medium abiotic degradation also facilitated enhanced fipronil degradation with the sodium alginate and agar disc beads bead based immobilization was found to be effective for the degradation of pesticides in a liquid medium 37 the whole cell and enzymes were previously reported in an immobilization assay for pesticide degradation 42 44 for fipronil degradation immobilization was not previously reported but for another group of pesticides immobilization was shown to be an effective way to remove pesticides in a short timespan compared to a pure culture in an msm medium 37 alginate based beads were used for the degradation of organophosphate pesticides and were found to provide five times better degradation than free cells 45 moreover alginate beads were found suitable for wastewater treatment with a combination of bacterial treatments 46 47 3 6 bioremediation of fipronil in soil the results from the bioremediation of fipronil in soil suggested that the strain has the potential to degrade the fipronil after 5 days of soil experiments the strain fa3 degraded 34 8 of the fipronil an increment in degradation was observed after 10 days of experiment i e 47 5 the biodegradation efficiency of fipronil was 77 5 after 15 days of experiment when compared to the control tests significant bioremediation of fipronil with strain fa3 was achieved fig 5 in a previous study fipronil degradation was investigated in soil and an active actinomycetes strain ajag7 was able to efficiently degrade fipronil 2 similarly paracoccus sp was also able to degrade the fipronil in soil treatments however the authors reported that the residual fipronil concentrations could remain persist in the soil for up to 10 days 23 the results from previous studies clearly show that these fipronil degrading bacterial strains can also be used for large scale fipronil bioremediation projects these characteristics favors the strain fa3 obviously as a suitable biocatalyst for fipronil degradation from contaminated soil and wastewater 3 7 ft ir analysis of fipronil degradation with strain fa3 in control experiments ft ir analysis of fipronil showed major peaks at 918 3 n h 1033 8 c n 1376 n o 1444 8 c h 2252 1 c n 3006 8 c h alkanes and 3646 oh alcohol and phenol cm 1 fig 6 a and b fa3 treated fipronil showed different patterns of the peaks where stretching occured at 1039 6 c n aliphatic amines 1376 c h alkanes 1444 8 c h alkanes 1632 n h amines 2252 2 c n nitriles 2298 9 c n stretch 2939 6 c h alkanes 3006 8 c h stretch alkenes and 3450 oh phenol cm 1 ft ir analysis also confirmed that in fipronil degradation aromatic rings are cleaved and produce another metabolite production of new metabolite could be related to new peaks which appeared in fa3 treated samples ft ir spectrum of fipronil showed the presence of alkane ester phenol and alkene peaks in the fa3 treated samples these peaks showed similarity with fipronil and its intermediates appeared in metabolic pathway based on ft ir spectrum it was possible to demonstrate that strain fa3 could degrade fipronil to fipronil sulfone via oxidation reaction and fipronil sulfone can be transformed into non toxic intermediates such as benzaldehyde phenylmethylene hydrazine and 1 2 benzene dicarboxylic acid 2 ft ir based spectroscopic analyses have been used widely for the detection of pesticides under various treatments 28 37 48 the absorption patterns and peak intensities of fipronil were investigated for example in rat liver enzymes significant peak changes and corresponding bond stretching were observed under different doses of fipronil 48 49 in a previous study the ft ir spectra of fipronil and fipronil sulfone were recorded during degradation with aspergillus glaucus strain ajag1 ft ir spectrum was determined in a range of 4000 400 cm 1 using the kbr pellet method 28 3 8 recovery of fipronil from contaminated environments fipronil residues were recovered from msm and soil samples under various treatments using strain fa3 residual fipronil from the soil slurry samples and medium was recovered using organic solvents namely ethyl acetate acetone and acetonitrile maximum recovery of fipronil was obtained with the control abiotic condition whereas minimum recovery was observed with fa3 treatments in msm residual fipronil was in the range of 24 0 42 0 whereas in the soil slurry the residual fraction was 23 0 the immobilized beads showed enhanced fipronil degradation where the recovered fipronil was 22 0 the half life t 1 2 of the fa3 treated samples was significantly lower compared to the control due to the excessive use of fipronil in the environment the concentration of fipronil continues to increase in soil and water environments 50 therefore the recovery of fipronil from the environment is an important factor in contaminated soil fipronil residue is reported to be high in the top soil layers than in the lower layers 51 recovery of fipronil has also reported in contaminated water and soil environments 52 to detect the fipronil and its metabolites in the environment gas chromatography with electron capture detection gc ecd can be used after solid phase extraction from various contaminated environmental samples 53 4 conclusions the present study investigated fipronil degradation and its kinetics with strain fa3 strain fa3 was able to utilize fipronil as its sole carbon source for the growth and development under nutrient limiting conditions there was a significant reduction in the half life of fipronil due to the effect of bacterial strain fa3 furthermore cell immobilization with sodium alginate and an agar disc accelerated degradation in the msm medium the ft ir spectra revealed the structural changes during the degradation of fipronil considering the performance of the fa3 strain it could be used for the large scale treatment of contaminated water and soil environments the recovery of fipronil from each of the bacterial treatments showed the degradation patterns in the msm due to the large scale application of fipronil in soil and water environments strain fa3 could be

large scale treatment of fipronil contaminants in soil and water environments keywords fipronil degradation bacillussp fa3 immobilization resource recovery 1 introduction pesticides are widely used to control insect pests for different purposes 1 2 primary use of pesticides in agricultural sector is to protect crops from various insects 3 throughout the globe excessive use of pesticides has affected approximately 3 million human lives due to their inherent toxicity 4 5 this toxicity causes severe health problems in humans and other living organisms 6 7 in agricultural sector pesticides are not completely removed from the soil due to recalcitrant nature of these chemicals pesticides affect soil water and air in the environment due to their toxic nature as they persist for a long time in these systems 8 10 fipronil and its metabolites were found in soil water and plant tissues in the contaminated sites 11 residual fipronil has been reported in agricultural and flowering plants brassica plantago ipomoea and camellia 12 a higher concentration of fipronil can affect the agricultural soil by reducing the number of beneficial microorganisms the decline of these microbial strains might lead to less productivity of the profitable crops 13 thus reducing the level of fipronil in the environment is a significant concern throughout the world fipronil 5 amino1 2 6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethyl 4 phenyl trifluoromethysulfinyl h pyrazole 3 carbonitrile chemical formula c12h4cl2f6n4os is a phenylpyrazole pesticide and discovered by rhone poulenc a french chemical and pharmaceutical company in the year 1987 fipronil is applied to various crops as an insecticide and it can kill more than 250 pests it is highly toxic to zooplankton crustaceans bees termites rabbits and lizards traditionally various organochlorines carbamates and organophosphates are used to control agricultural insects 2 fipronil is a new generation insecticide and its mode of action is different from organochlorines organophosphates and pyrethroids 14 18 fipronil inhibits the function of the gamma amino butyric acid gaba receptor in insects by binding with gaba receptor which blocks the functions of the chloride ion channels and disrupt central nervous system cns previous studies have suggested that fipronil binds with gaba receptor in insects with higher affinity than vertebrates 19 fipronil induces apoptosis in drosophila melanogaster via the mitochondrial caspase dependent pathway 20 lethal effects of fipronil were also investigated in juvenile zebrafish danio rerio 21 it is shown to induce oxidative stress in brain and kidney cells of mice 22 due to its toxicity in water and soil environments degradation of fipronil residue is an important and persisting environmental issue fipronil can be degraded by chemical physical and microbial methods microbial methods are eco friendly and cost effective and microorganisms have the potential to degrade the residues of fipronil in soil and water environments bacterial strains belonging to streptomyces rochei 2 paracoccus sp 23 bacillus firmmus bacillus thuringiensis 24 25 bacillus spp 26 stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila 27 and the fungal strain aspergillus glaucus ajag1 28 has been reported to possess fipronil degradation potential in various natural environments biodegradation of fipronil was found to be the most effective way to remediate its residues from environment besides microorganisms earthworms eisenia feotida also contribute to fipronil degradation and remediation in soil 29 fipronil was degraded into desulfinyl sulfone and sulfide metabolites in a previous study 30 present work investigates the role of bacillus sp fa3 in fipronil degradation and resource recovery in a contaminated environment in this study fipronil degradation experiments were performed with the following objectives i to characterize the fipronil degrading bacteria isolated from contaminated agricultural fields ii to optimize the fipronil biodegradation in mineral salt medium using response surface methodology iii to analyze growth associated degradation of fipronil with bacterial strain fa3 iv to estimate

optimized under laboratory conditions using statistically significant response surface methodology rsm technique 32 33 box behnken design was used to determine critical factors and their main and interactive influences on fipronil degradation 34 three important critical factors namely ph temperature and shaking speed were used in fipronil degradation experiment a total of 50 mg l 1 fipronil in

ph2 0 020 shaking speed2 the optimized conditions for fipronil biodegradation using strain fa3 were temperature 32 c ph 7 0 and shaking speed 110 rpm the main purpose of using rsm was to evaluate the relationship between the predicted values of the dependent variable as well as the conditions of the dependent variables 40 box behnken is commonly used in industrial application because of its economical design moreover it requires only three levels for each factor 8 41 box behnken designs with critical factors such as ph temperature shaking speed inocula size and nutrient concentrations have been commonly used for the degradation of pesticides 8 34 42 in a previous research it was proven that rsm is a convenient and efficient system to investigate the optimum degradation conditions for pesticides using bacterial and fungal strains 42 the box behnken design was studied with stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila and it was found to be effective for fipronil degradation under in vitro conditions 27 therefore the results of rsm have significant application for fipronil and other pesticide degradation and can be used to enhance and optimize the degradation process 3 3 growth linked degradation of fipronil with fa3 relationship between growth of strain fa3 and fipronil degradation is presented in fig 2 fipronil biodegradation showed a set pattern with bacterial growth degradation increased gradually as the strain entered in logarithmic phase 4 5 days and stationary phase 7 8 days a decrease in degradation was observed when bacterial strain reached its death phase 12 days fa3 treatment degraded approximately 76 0 fipronil after 15 days of experimentation all the results showed a 0 05 level of significance gradual increase in the growth of fa3 was observed after 2 5 days with a gradual reduction in fipronil concentration bacterial growth was directly linked with fipronil degradation bacillus sp strain fa3 utilized fipronil as a sole source of carbon and energy previously various researchers have reported that in the absence of a carbon source bacterial strains use pesticides to fulfill their nutritional requirements 2 24 different microbes opt different metabolic pathways to degrade fipronil and other pesticides 4 25 these metabolic pathways are helpful in degrading fipronil and transforming it into other metabolites which can be less toxic to the environment 43 it was observed that the bacterial strain can degrade traces of fipronil in a liquid medium 3 4 degradation kinetics of fipronil strain fa3 was able to utilize fipronil in the concentration range of 50 mg l 1 to 900 mg l 1 the specific degradation rate constant q was calculated which showed a higher value at a low concentration and a lower value at a high concentration fig 3 kinetic parameters such as q max k s and k i were calculated for fipronil degradation with strain fa3 and the values were 1 4155 day 1 65 096 mg l 1 and 156 330 mg l 1 respectively bacterial growth was hindered at higher fipronil concentrations degradation kinetics of fipronil followed first order reaction kinetics the half life t 1 2 degradation constant k and determination coefficient r2 were 7 7 days 0 0891 day 1 and 0 921 day 1 respectively in msm medium inoculated with strain fa3 table 2 whereas t 1 2 in the abiotic control was 277 3 days suggesting that strain fa3 plays an effective role in fipronil degradation a significant decrease in t 1 2 of fipronil in the presence of strain fa3 makes fa3 a promising candidate for fipronil bioremediation from water and soil environments previously little information was available on the degradation and kinetics of fipronil in water and soil environments in a study fipronil degradation and kinetics studies were performed using bacillus thuringiensis these studies have found that in the presence of b thuringiensis t 1 2 of fipronil in clay loam soil reduced significantly 24 25 the results of this study also match closely with previous studies on degradation pattern and kinetics of fipronil and other pesticides 4 18 the half life of the pesticide can be reduced by effective bacterial treatments and a potential culture could be used to remove contaminants from the soil and water system at large scale 32 34 36 3 5 effect of immobilization on fipronil degradation immobilized bacillus sp strain fa3 with sodium alginate beads and agar discs showed enhanced fipronil degradation fipronil degradation of 44 7 and 56 7 using immobilized bacterial cells with sodium alginate beads was observed respectively after 5 and 10 days of the experiment the maximum degradation 77 0 was observed after 15 days of the experiment fig 4 in the agar discs an immobilization assay with the fa3 cells resulted in 43 0 48 0 and 78 0 fipronil degradation at 5 10 and 15 days of the experiment fipronil s degradation kinetics with the immobilized strain fa3 demonstrated the better efficiency of these treatments table 2 fipronil degradation with the immobilized assay followed first order reaction kinetics fipronil s t 1 2 in the control with sodium alginate was calculated to be 66 6 days and 7 4 days for fa3 under agar disc immobilization the t 1 2 was 55 0 days and 7 5 days for the control and fa3 treated samples respectively the k values for the sodium alginate treatment were 0 0104 day 1 and 0 0931 day 1 for the control and fa3 treatment whereas with the agar disc the k values were calculated as 0 0126 day 1 and 0 0927 day 1 for the control and fa3 treatments respectively the results of the immobilization assay showed that fa3 was more effective for fipronil degradation than the msm medium the region behind the increased degradation with sodium alginate and agar disc beads might be due to the increased surface area for nutritional uptake in the msm medium abiotic degradation also facilitated enhanced fipronil degradation with the sodium alginate and agar disc beads bead based immobilization was found to be effective for the degradation of pesticides in a liquid medium 37 the whole cell and enzymes were previously reported in an immobilization assay for pesticide degradation 42 44 for fipronil degradation immobilization was not previously reported but for another group of pesticides immobilization was shown to be an effective way to remove pesticides in a short timespan compared to a pure culture in an msm medium 37 alginate based beads were used for the degradation of organophosphate pesticides and were found to provide five times better degradation than free cells 45 moreover alginate beads were found suitable for wastewater treatment with a combination of bacterial treatments 46 47 3 6 bioremediation of fipronil in soil the results from the bioremediation of fipronil in soil suggested that the strain has the potential to degrade the fipronil after 5 days of soil experiments the strain fa3 degraded 34 8 of the fipronil an increment in degradation was observed after 10 days of experiment i e 47 5 the biodegradation efficiency of fipronil was 77 5 after 15 days of experiment when compared to the control tests significant bioremediation of fipronil with strain fa3 was achieved fig 5 in a previous study fipronil degradation was investigated in soil and an active actinomycetes strain ajag7 was able to efficiently degrade fipronil 2 similarly paracoccus sp was also able to degrade the fipronil in soil treatments however the authors reported that the residual fipronil concentrations could remain persist in the soil for up to 10 days 23 the results from previous studies clearly show that these fipronil degrading bacterial strains can also be used for large scale fipronil bioremediation projects these characteristics favors the strain fa3 obviously as a suitable biocatalyst for fipronil degradation from contaminated soil and wastewater 3 7 ft ir analysis of fipronil degradation with strain fa3 in control experiments ft ir analysis of fipronil showed major peaks at 918 3 n h 1033 8 c n 1376 n o 1444 8 c h 2252 1 c n 3006 8 c h alkanes and 3646 oh alcohol and phenol cm 1 fig 6 a and b fa3 treated fipronil showed different patterns of the peaks where stretching occured at 1039 6 c n aliphatic amines 1376 c h alkanes 1444 8 c h alkanes 1632 n h amines 2252 2 c n nitriles 2298 9 c n stretch 2939 6 c h alkanes 3006 8 c h stretch alkenes and 3450 oh phenol cm 1 ft ir analysis also confirmed that in fipronil degradation aromatic rings are cleaved and produce another metabolite production of new metabolite could be related to new peaks which appeared in fa3 treated samples ft ir spectrum of fipronil showed the presence of alkane ester phenol and alkene peaks in the fa3 treated samples these peaks showed similarity with fipronil and its intermediates appeared in metabolic pathway based on ft ir spectrum it was possible to demonstrate that strain fa3 could degrade fipronil to fipronil sulfone via oxidation reaction and fipronil sulfone can be transformed into non toxic intermediates such as benzaldehyde phenylmethylene hydrazine and 1 2 benzene dicarboxylic acid 2 ft ir based spectroscopic analyses have been used widely for the detection of pesticides under various treatments 28 37 48 the absorption patterns and peak intensities of fipronil were investigated for example in rat liver enzymes significant peak changes and corresponding bond stretching were observed under different doses of fipronil 48 49 in a previous study the ft ir spectra of fipronil and fipronil sulfone were recorded during degradation with aspergillus glaucus strain ajag1 ft ir spectrum was determined in a range of 4000 400 cm 1 using the kbr pellet method 28 3 8 recovery of fipronil from contaminated environments fipronil residues were recovered from msm and soil samples under various treatments using strain fa3 residual fipronil from the soil slurry samples and medium was recovered using organic solvents namely ethyl acetate acetone and acetonitrile maximum recovery of fipronil was obtained with the control abiotic condition whereas minimum recovery was observed with fa3 treatments in msm residual fipronil was in the range of 24 0 42 0 whereas in the soil slurry the residual fraction was 23 0 the immobilized beads showed enhanced fipronil degradation where the recovered fipronil was 22 0 the half life t 1 2 of the fa3 treated samples was significantly lower compared to the control due to the excessive use of fipronil in the environment the concentration of fipronil continues to increase in soil and water environments 50 therefore the recovery of fipronil from the environment is an important factor in contaminated soil fipronil residue is reported to be high in the top soil layers than in the lower layers 51 recovery of fipronil has also reported in contaminated water and soil environments 52 to detect the fipronil and its metabolites in the environment gas chromatography with electron capture detection gc ecd can be used after solid phase extraction from various contaminated environmental samples 53 4 conclusions the present study investigated fipronil degradation and its kinetics with strain fa3 strain fa3 was able to utilize fipronil as its sole carbon source for the growth and development under nutrient limiting conditions there was a significant reduction in the half life of fipronil due to the effect of bacterial strain fa3 furthermore cell immobilization with sodium alginate and an agar disc accelerated degradation in the msm medium the ft ir spectra revealed the structural changes during the degradation of fipronil considering the performance of the fa3 strain it could be used for the large scale treatment of contaminated water and soil environments the recovery of fipronil from each of the bacterial treatments showed the degradation patterns in the msm due to the large scale application of fipronil in soil and water environments strain fa3 could be helpful for resource recovery and sustainable development contribution of the authors this work was mainly planned by pb as wz and sc and experiments were done in the lab by pb the experimental data

13717,increasing population and urbanization bring along depletion of water resources with notable discharge of industrial and municipal wastewater which is rich in nutrients microalgae hold great promise for assimilating the nutrient compounds particularly the intricate nitrogen n and phosphorus p compounds from wastewater resulting in algal biomass enriched with various valuable biomolecules however development of strategies involving the cultivation of microalgae for wastewater treatment and production of commodity components is still in its infancy in this review the current status of microalgae mediated wastewater treatment the existing technological bottlenecks that hamper the effective use of photosynthetic microalgae and innovative solutions to obviate the shortcomings are discussed also this article highlights the potential use of genetic engineering technologies in overproducing algal biomolecules without impeding cellular biomass accumulation by regulating critical metabolic targets for the development of engineered algal strains in this context adaptive laboratory evolution ale could be the promising tool to further empower the engineered strains to mitigate the adverse effect from the wastewater cultivation medium in summary this review provides novel insights into the application of genetic engineering strategies for overproducing algal biomass and valuable biomolecules such as lipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids using wastewater in a cost effective manner keywords wastewater microalga adaptive laboratory evolution genetic engineering 1 introduction burgeoning industrialization and ever growing human population along with the incessant consumption of finite fossil fuels and depleting ground water resources result in remarkable emission of industrial and municipal wastewater ww which in turn bring on concurrent energy and water demand 1 significant part of the ww would be domestic ww the water rich in organic components which is largely released into the nearby waterbodies either treated or untreated 2 therefore the nutrients present in these waters remain largely unrecovered thereby contributing to eutrophication of water bodies 3 4 it has been speculated that nearly half the world could suffer from water deficit by 2025 and almost 75 of the world population could face freshwater scarcity by 2050 5 parallelly depleting fossil fuels reserves and its negative impact on environment and economy such as acid rain global warming increase in petrol prices have provided the impetus to explore the promising carbon neutral and renewable bioenergy sources 6 7 among the biological feedstocks assessed for the biofuel production photosynthetic microalgae have emerged as the promising system over terrestrial plants owing to their properties such as rapid growth rate higher photosynthetic rate and productivity non requirement of arable land and higher theoretical oil yield per capita 8 reasoning these inherent characteristics various research agencies have devoted tremendous efforts to improve the microalgal biofuel potential despite these attempts comprehensive strategy for the large scale production of microalgal biofuels in economically viable manner is yet to be developed among the formidable challenges that impede the commercial production of algal biofuels microalgal cultivation warrants large usage of water and nutrients which makes them unaffordable and crucial limiting parameters 9 these data highlight the necessity to develop a potential strategy to effectively utilize the ww as the water source for the cultivation of microalgae to overcome the potable water scarcity that exist all over the world 10 nevertheless there are also other techno biological obstacles that have to be tackled in order to cultivate microalgae in ww sustainable microalgal biomass has been regarded as the key factor that determines the large scale production of microalgal biomolecules in an economically feasible manner it is known that concurrent production of biomass and biomolecules is pivotal for large scale production of algal bioproducts as the overall yield is dependent on the total biomass production 11 in this regard research attempts have been devoted to formulate cost effective cultivation media and recruitment of superior algal species and strains that have the ability to proliferate in wws meanwhile microalgal growth in ww could be affected by various parameters such as microalgal species strains their capability to withstand a wide range of suboptimal conditions nutrient profile of the ww and cultivation conditions 12 recruitment of appropriate microalgal species strain having the potential to hyperaccumulate valuable biomolecules without compromising the growth and biomass accumulation is considered to be the prime factor for commercial applications however previous studies have shown that native wild type wt algal strains have exhibited slight reduction in growth rate and biocomponent production it is worth mentioning that scenedesmus strain sdec8 displayed higher growth which accumulated the biomass of 0 5 mg l than that of the strain scenedesmus sdec13 0 34 mg l cultivated in anaerobically digested effluent kitchen waste which stress on the importance of the strain selection for the large scale production of valuable compounds 13 in contrast addition of higher percentage of municipal waste by 80 and 100 in the cultivation medium inhibited growth rate of marine alga nannochloropsis sp a common oleaginous algal source for triacylglycerides tag thereby suggesting metabolic and physiological properties could be species specific 14 these reports have clearly indicated the importance of candidate algal strains that can accumulate valuable biomolecules even in affordable growth medium which can overcome the techno biological bottlenecks that hinder the commercial feasibility of microalgae based biomolecule production thus there exists a pressing need to develop the microalgal trait in order to cope with the suboptimal cultivation medium and to overproduce valuable biomolecules the objective of this review is to discuss the current status of the microalgal associated strategies that are used in ww treatment and to outline the drawbacks associated with the existing technologies this review also aims to emphasize the technological and biological breakthroughs that are needed for economically viable algal biomolecules production using ww the significance of algal strain improvement by systems approaches for hyperaccumulation of algal biocomponents without compromising cellular physiological properties are also highlighted together this review summarizes the critical factors that govern the algal based production of biomolecules using ww and the feasible strategies to remove the existing bottlenecks and also offers possible insights into the generation of potential engineered microalgal strains and novel combinatorial strategies using synthetic biology approaches for effective ww treatment 2 impact of the wastewater on the receiving ecosystems with the ever increasing urban population and rapid growth of restaurants all over the world discharge of kitchen waste into the environment has been continuously increasing thus emerged as the severe problem to the environment and public health due to the limited ww treatment plants 2 15 in china it was estimated that about 30 million tons of domestic waste has been generated and discharged 15 domestic ww is highly enriched with organic compounds possesses alkalinity and contains adequate nitrogenous materials which makes this aquatic medium an optimal nutrient source however due to its high moisture and nutrient content discharge of the untreated ww poses severe environmental and health problems 16 18 mostly these waters would be discharged to the waterbodies in either as treated or untreated form though the ww could be treated in the urban areas still the treatment plants release enormous amount of effluent water into the lotic ecosystems which becomes the major water source in the receiving water bodies 19 in addition burgeoning kitchen ww would be a burden to the limited ww treatment plants particularly in the cities with limited ww treatment plants in the cities 2 20 moreover the energy demand for the operation and maintenance of ww treatment plants has been dramatically increased 21 in some cases technical failure in the treatment plant could result in discharge of macerated ww into the ocean which resulted in the non native microbial population in antarctic ecosystem thereby significantly affecting the native population 22 thus the release of kitchen ww either in treated or untreated form could significantly increase the nutrient overload of the receiving water system causing significant environmental issues 23 impact of wastewater discharge into the environment on various systems have been provided in table 1 discharge of ww which is rich in particulate matter dissolved oxygen phosphorus nitrogen and organic content aggravates the water pollution causing serious ecological threats 37 various studies have documented the huge impact of domestic ww that were discharged into the lotic water systems on aquatic organisms and benthic microbial communities discharge of ww into donghu lake wuhan china showed surface water of this lake consists of more xenoestrogens the compounds which impact development and reproduction of organisms 38 duan et al 29 reported that effluent released ww treatment plant into the yangtze river posed a severe risk to the aquatic organisms discharge of untreated domestic ww into the fukuyama inner harbour hiroshima japan water body has been regarded the major source for deterioration of the benthic habitat environment 39 these reports clearly imply the ecological and environmental threats to the water bodies aquatic organisms and benthic microbial populations in response to the discharge of either treated or untreated ww thereby provoking the necessity to develop sustainable and biotechnological strategy in using or treating the ww 3 present status and drawbacks of using ww as water source for microalgae cultivation microalgae are the group of ubiquitous unicellular photosynthetic microphytes that have the potential to assimilate environmental inorganic carbon substrates and convert into organic components in the presence of light through photosynthesis and thus attract huge research interest in various commercial sectors as single cell green factories over the terrestrial plants 40 considering the nutrient rich nature of ww various studies have examined the feasibility of using them as the nutrient medium for microalgae and investigated their efficacy on producing valuable biomolecules and also for treating ww meanwhile the chemical composition of the ww is generally complex and unpredictable which might also contain pharmaceutical heavy metals organic and inorganic compounds thus the complete removal of these complex molecules warrants strategies besides the algal treatment such as bioelectrochemical systems and the green technology which could convert the chemical energy into electrical energy by using microbes as the catalysts 41 42 however microalgae are considered to be the potential systems to significantly reduce the level of nutrient load particularly to reduce the intricate chemical components from the ww particularly inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous remain as the intricate nutrients to be eliminated from the ww it is pertinent to mention that microalgae possess the have capacity to utilize these nutrient compounds for their growth photosynthetic and metabolic activities 12 earlier reports have demonstrated that remediation of organic and inorganic nutrients from the ww by microalgae have resulted in the production of biomass which could be used as the sustainable feedstock for the production of various biomolecules systematic studies have been carried out to investigate the efficacy of microalgae and also to develop a comprehensive strategy for ww treatment using microalgae over the last few decades chevalier and de la noüe 1985 demonstrated that immobilized scenedesmus obliquus in a carrageenan gel potentially assimilating phosphate and ammonium ions from a secondary effluent showed no variations in terms of nutrient consumption and growth between free and immobilized cells 43 hammouda et al 44 assessed the impact of chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp on removing nutrient components from domestic ww and showed that continuous culture resulted in efficient removal of nutrients and increased production of protein this observation was corroborated by increased cellular content of free amino acids even though the maximum efficiency of assimilation of nitrogenous compounds was obtained only after 42 days of treatment these reports have provided key insights for further development of potential strategies for treating ww using immobilized or free algal systems to not only treat ww for further applications and also to produce valuable biomolecules from microalgae consequently a copious amount of literature is now available on employing microalgae for ww treatment and also to produce valuable microalgal biomolecules leite et al 3 reported that fortification of the effluent with low nutrient load by supplementation with piggery ww and using the mixed ww source for cultivating chlorella sorokiniana resulted in enhanced the efficiency of nutrient removal as well as microalgal biomass production mixing of the ww from two different sources was accomplished by using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor operated with a treatment capacity of 650 l and a hydraulic retention time of 3 days however the data on growth rate and the adaptability of these algae in the ww are yet to be ascertained hariz et al 45 in their study with twin objectives attempted to treat palm oil mill effluent along with effective elimination of the emission of greenhouse gases from the conventional ponding treatment system by using heterotrophic scenedesmus sp and autotrophic chlorella sp in a sequential manner the results showed that preliminary treatment with the cultivation of scenedesmus resulted in the effective assimilation of organic carbon from the palm oil mill effluent pome and the resultant pome was found to be suitable for increased biomass production of chlorella increased biomass production by chlorella was found to be comparably more than that of scenedesmus which was cultivated during the first stage of the treatment after 25 days of continuous culture however cultivation for a longer period could impede the algal biomass production and consequently the productivity of the desired algal biomolecules this aspect remains as one of the critical factors that constrain microalgae for commercial exploitation and ww treatment slow growing oleaginous botryococcus braunii has been employed to treat the municipal ww which resulted in efficient nitrogen consumption by b braunii strain and interestingly the lipid content was also increased with altered fatty acid profile particularly rich in saturated fatty acids 46 the authors found that specific growth rate of b braunii was lower in both the influent and effluent sources as compared to optimal chu 13 growth medium in addition the molecular mechanisms underlying such lipogenic trait in the microalgal cells cultivated in the ww are yet to be explored further studies are needed to specifically identify the regulatory factors that are involved in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism application of microalgae for phycoremediation of ww and the earlier reported data are provided in table 2 amini et al 53 employed chlorella vulgaris and activated sludge as for the treatment of municipal ww in a sequential manner which resulted in efficient removal of nutrients on one hand microalgae without as resulted in efficient removal of nutrients from the cultivation medium up to 50 at the cost of microalgal growth on the other hand cultivation of as alone without microalgae resulted in lowest nutrient removal capability up to 30 these findings implied the potential of microalgae on efficiently removing nutrient components from the ww and also shed light on applying microalgae along with as on effectively treating municipal ww maaitah et al 54 cultivated c pyrenoidosa in the medium with olive mills discharged ww with lesser n and p and effluents of urban ww treatment plants with higher n and p which showed that different dilutions of olive mill ww resulted in different biochemical composition and altered cellular physiological properties sodium alginate immobilized nannochloropsis sp cells resulted in effective nutrient uptake from ww which resulted in reduced chemical oxygen demand and improved physiological and biochemical properties than that of the suspended free cells of nannochloropsis sp 48 the sodium alginate immobilization would have provided stability and protected the cells from the suboptimal environmental conditions that prevailed in the ww effluents and also exhibited enhanced nutrient uptake capability than that of the free cells there are only scanty reports available on aspects related to the limiting factors to obviate the existing bottlenecks on microalgal ww treatment and regarding the production of valuable biocomponents 4 limitation in providing adequate water and nutrients impedes large scale algal cultivation among the various formidable challenges related to sustainable cultivation of microalgae for commercial applications provision of adequate water and nutrients has been regarded the crucial limiting factors water consumption for the microalgal cultivation can be determined by two crucial quantitative parameters such as water demand and water footprint water demand is defined as the quantity of water needed for the direct microalgal cultivation process that possesses direct impact on economic and technological aspects of microalgal cultivation whereas water footprint is the policy tool which is known as the quantitative requirement for total freshwater sources to produce the particular product at a particular geographical location where the process is taking place thereby denoting the quantity of freshwater resource that the particular geographical system is deplete of the water water footprint is classified into three groups namely green water footprint blue water footprint and grey water footprint 55 56 accurate determination of water demand throughout the course of microalgal cultivation is hampered by various factors there exists a pressing need to develop a potential tool to determine the water demand for algal cultivation units particularly from the algal ponds in which the cultures are raised the routine method used to cultivate algae yang et al 57 investigated the water footprint and nutrients balance during the life cycle while studying the biofuel production by microalgae in open pond cultivation method this study illustrated the necessity of providing large quantities of water for the microalgal cultures and also implied the necessity of recycling the water or using sea water to obviate the exploitation of freshwater resources on other hand supplying the minimum quantity of water required for algal growth could be a challenging task based on the geographical location of the algal production unit for instance campbell et al 58 demonstrated the crucial role of the location for the establishment of algal cultivation unit which highlighted the usage of sea water in australia and found to be a promising strategy where the land and sea water is abundant but fresh water source is limited previous studies have shown that the approximate requirement of water for large scale cultivation of microalgae warranted huge amount of water for example production of 1 l microalgal biodiesel needed around 3365 l of water which proved that the microalgal cultivation for biofuels production as expensive and water intensive process 56 meanwhile to generate 1 kg of microalgal biomass through raceway ponds around 1 564 l of water was needed furthermore based on the geographical location of the microalgal cultivation unit provision of minimum water required to generate the adequate microalgal biomass was found to be more challenging particularly in water deficit regions 59 yang et al 57 comprehensively investigated the life cycle analysis and water footprint value of using c vulgaris for biofuel production the findings showed that around 3700 kg 0 33 kg and 0 71 kg of freshwater n and p respectively were warranted for production of 1 kg of biodiesel if the water was used without treatment or recycling besides the authors showed that recycling of the water subsequent to harvest decreased the usage of water and nutrient significantly the authors further commended the usage of photobioreactor in order to reduce the water evaporation loss and to increase biomass accumulation cultivation of b braunii as a biofilm reduced the water requirement to generate 1 kg of algal biomass by 45 than that of the algal raceway ponds 60 pandey et al 61 reported that generation of 8 kg of algal biomass and 1 3 kg of algal lipids required 10 000 l of tap water fortified with urea and single super phosphate from c sorokiniana however the reported biomass and lipid accumulation for this strain was found to be significantly higher and reached up to 1 02 0 02 g l and 174 1 9 6 mg l respectively than other strains such as selenastrum gracile scenedesmus acutus and c vulgaris which uncovered the importance of selecting the potential strain for the large scale production of algal biofuels 5 factors that impede large scale cultivation of microalgae using ww from the aforementioned fascinating features of microalgae it is quite clear that microalgae play an important role in reducing the nutrient load of the wastewater the nutrient assimilation in turn helps directly to microalgal growth and metabolic activities and making this bioproduction system effective and cheaper however techno biological barriers have to be overcome in order to exploit the full potential of microalgae on using ww as the affordable nutrient medium for microalgal cultivation production of microalgal biomass and biomolecules by using ww as the affordable cultivation medium has been considered important research areas for scaling up this technology to commercial scale expensive nature of the algal based biofuel products has been found to be due to the culture parameters including supply of water and nutrient components 62 although a copious literature is available on the effectiveness of the superior microalgal strains on remediating the nutrient load and to produce valuable metabolites from microalgae there are only few findings available on the molecular bottlenecks and the potential strategy to obviate the associated challenges impact of the suboptimal conditions imposed by the ww on microalgal physiological parameters are yet to be explored and comparative data on the cells grown in ww and conventional synthetic medium are found to be scarce 3 45 analyses of photosynthetic parameters of the algal cells grown in nutrient rich ww are of paramount importance as it directly indicates the algal growth and intracellular accumulation of key metabolic precursors which could be later catalysed into valuable biochemicals 63 selection of the microalgal strain that could concurrently increase the production of biomass and biochemicals withstand the extreme environmental and cultivation conditions and that increase the production of the targeted product 64 importantly comprehensive studies are warranted to investigate the genes and key metabolic pathways that underpin the uncompromised growth that govern the photosynthetic mechanisms nevertheless the data on such pivotal mechanisms and the mechanistic role of the identified molecular candidates remain largely obscured 65 thus there exists a pressing need to characterize the key molecular candidate gene s and its mechanistic role on orchestrating the crucial metabolic pathways to tackle these drawbacks that potentially hinder the commercial exploitation despite these tremendous research efforts that analysed the efficacy of microalgae using ww and also to reduce the nutrient load of the ww there nonetheless remain serious hinderances to achieve the commercially feasible production of microalgal biocomponents it is known that lack of chassis strain with the potential to concurrently overproduce algal biomass and lipid productivity is the crucial parameter that impedes the commercial application of microalgae in an attempt to enhance the lipogenic potential of microalgae researchers employed the algal cells to suboptimal conditions particularly nitrogen deprivation treatment which elicit the cells to hyperaccumulate energy reserve in the form of lipids but at the cost of algal biomass thereby reducing the overall lipid productivity and hampering the commercial exploitation of microalgae 66 67 in contrast lipid accumulation capability of wildtype wt microalgae under optimal conditions is lower to meet the commercial expectations particularly lack of industry suitable algal strain with promising oleaginicity growth rate ability to withstand adverse conditions and grow in cheaper cultivation medium are the serious constrains that impede the microalgal industry 68 ji et al 69 reported that growth rate of c vulgaris was significantly lower when cultivated in piggery waste however diluted ww has been shown to slightly alleviate the algal growth but not comparable to the synthetic medium furthermore the results showed that prolonged cultivation period up to 30 days was required to attain the significant biomass and lipid accumulation which exacerbate the overall yield and productivity of both algal biomass and biocomponents table 3 denotes the impact of different strategies on microalgal lipid productivity nwoba et al 79 assessed the growth rate of algal consortium in biocoil and compared it with the raceway pond system the results indicated that cell concentration of both the cultivation systems was found to decline till second day of the subculture and chlorella sp was found to be the most dominant algae followed by scenedesmus sp these results implied that the growth rate of selected microalgae could be species specific in contrast cultivation of c vulgaris c minutissima scenedesmus sp and chlorococcum sp in domestic ww proved that scenedesmus sp exhibited higher specific growth rate of 0 44 μ and biomass productivity of 61 4 mg l day among the tested algal species 78 photoautotrophic cultivation of endogenous and wt c vulgaris revealed the crucial factors that govern the viable application of microalgae for ww treatment could play the crucial role in governing the microalgal master that affect the growth microalgae in the brewery ww various studies have reported that growth and biomass production of the microalgae using ww as the cultivation medium showed high variation based on the algal strain nutrient content of the ww and the cultivation conditions 73 a few reports provided valuable clues in relation to the development of potential cultivation strategy for microalgae using ww and the regulatory factors governing the overproduction of microalgal biomolecules these reports also have uncovered that algal growth in the ww could be species specific and in most cases growth of the inoculated algal culture has been declining initially thereafter it gradually increased besides algal growth in the ww was found to be expectedly lesser than that cultivated in the control synthetic medium this trend usually limits the overall biomass production thereby reducing the overall productivity of the desired product from algal systems and hindering the commercial viability of microalgae therefore it is of paramount importance to improve the genetic trait of the wt strain in such a way to generate the chassis strain with increased photosynthetic and growth activities and to overproduce desired biomolecules using ww this has provided the impetus to identify and target the potential metabolic node s that underpin the intricate microalgal biochemical pathways without affecting cellular physiological characteristics 6 genetic engineering to augment commercially desirable features of microalgae grown in ww genetic engineering ge is a promising tool by targeted perturbation of key metabolic pathways either by overexpressing downregulating silencing the key gene s to alter the desired metabolite content without impairing the cellular physiological properties particularly there has been increasing interest to exploit the lipogenic potential of oleaginous microalgae due to the enormous application of microalgal lipids in the production of a wide array of valuable components such as triacylglycerides tag and polyunsaturated fatty acids this process with the identification of the potential genes with the aid of bioinformatics tools and with the advancement of nucleic acid sequencing technology the identified metabolic target would be cloned into the expression vector and subsequently transformed into the target microalgae the putative transgenic cells would be further confirmed by molecular analyses and analyzed for the improvement of phenotypic trait by evaluating the physiological and biochemical features fig 1 nevertheless owing to the complexities in oleochemical biosynthetic pathways unpredicted fatty acid profile of the accumulated lipids and lack of molecular transformation toolkits for most of the oleaginous species microalgal genetic engineering is still in its infancy the advent of bioinformatics tools and completely sequenced genome database has represented a significant progress in the microalgal genetic improvement 80 therefore comprehensive understanding of the biochemical pathways identification of crucial genes that govern the metabolic pathways and designing the robust genetic transformation tool box and selection of the potential target play a crucial role in microalgal genetic engineering for instance for biofuel production the algal strain should overproduce tag the potential metabolic precursor for biodiesel production via transesterification reaction which liberate mono alkyl fatty acid esters as the byproducts 81 nevertheless accumulation biosynthesis and fatty acid composition of tag have been regarded the strain specific biological phenomenon which is known to be governed by the genetic makeup of the specific microalgae given the potential of genetic engineering on empowering microalgae as the sustainable biological feedstock for overproducing the desired biochemicals without hampering cellular biomass various investigators have made tremendous research efforts to enhance microalgal lipogenic potential by biotechnology means however conventional genetic engineering strategies to enhance oleochemicals by perturbing the key metabolic gene of the target biochemical pathway have yielded inconsistent success due to the intricate nature of the most biochemical pathways in microalgae for example microalgal lipid overproduction requires a series of regulatory components such as provision of carbon metabolic precursors 81 reducing equivalents in the form of nadph as lipids are reduced molecules 66 inhibition of competing pathways 82 and enhanced production of rate limiting enzymes besides some reports have demonstrated the increased lipid content via genetic engineering but resulted in impaired growth rate of the transgenic organisms 82 thus generation of chassis strain by means of genetic engineering warrants the stringent recruitment of gene s that have the potential to govern the intricate biochemical pathways though the genetic engineering strategies have yielded inconsistent success various studies have identified and characterized the crucial molecular candidates underpinning the biochemical synthesis in microalgae and also exemplified the promising microalgal genetic engineering transformation toolkit 65 83 84 fig 2 these results have paved the way to develop the chassis strain with enhanced physiological properties and biochemical production using ww as the cultivation medium 6 1 ge strategies to enhance microalgal physiological parameters for ww cultivation microalgae are the potential candidates for assimilating the nutrient compounds present in the ww for their growth and consequently generate valuable biochemicals depend on the chosen microalgal strains however previous reports have documented the lag in the cells to adapt themselves in the adverse conditions and thus algal cells exhibit slightly reduced growth rate than that of the cells grown in the optimal medium 46 which implied the necessity to employ the microalgal cells with enhanced growth and photosynthetic activity in order to cope with the adverse conditions few reports have documented the impact of some key genes on enhancing the growth and photosynthetic activity thereby providing an insight into the scrutinization of the transgenic strain to be used for ww treatment heterologous expression of malic enzyme from the diatom resulted in elevated growth and chlorophyll fluorescence parameter which was in line with the increased lipid content in transgenic chlorella pyrenoidosa 86 overexpression of malonyl coa acyl carrier protein transacylase mcat gene enhanced the growth of the transgenic n oceanica possibly by increasing the fatty acids required for the photosynthetic apparatus thereby upholding the photoautotrophic growth of transgenic algae 87 congruently double transgenics expressing gpat1 and lpat1 resulted in the enhanced growth and photosynthetic efficiency in transgenic p tricornutum 67 heterologous expression of diatom glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase resulted in increased growth rate during stationary phase and photosynthetic efficiency in transgenic c pyrenoidosa 66 these data reinforced the potential of microalgal genetic engineering on enhancing cellular physiological properties and metabolite content by manipulating a key node of the target metabolic circuit in addition these results have also uncovered the necessity to recruit the potential metabolic target which could ameliorate the productivity of the desired metabolites in the ww without compromising cellular growth acclimation phase of the algal strain into the ww has been portrayed as the limiting factor that hinder the initial growth and overall biomass yield throughout the ww treatment process engineering the key lipogenic genes and lipid biosynthesis associated genes has resulted in enhance chlorophyll fluorescence parameter fv fm the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii and also considered to be the versatile parameter to assess the physiological stability of a particular cell without affected by photoinhibition 88 potentiating the transgenic strains to acclimate adverse conditions enhance cellular physiological properties and accumulate valuable biocomponents is the crucial trait bestowed by the introduced transgene s which has been regarded the hallmark of the success of ge experiments 6 2 environmental concerns associated with the application of ge strains though the efficacy of genetically engineered ge algal strain has been demonstrated previously in laboratory scale their trait and physiological characteristics in field or in open cultivation mode remains largely unknown 89 on the one hand advantages and ecological risks of ge plants have been well studied and discussed subsequently ge plants have been cultivated in millions of acres globally 90 on the other hand the ecological consequences of releasing ge microalgae are largely unknown since limited experiments have been carried out in outdoor cultivation of ge microalgae the phenotypic traits exhibited by ge algal strains might be unstable in open cultivation and will have unknown complex interactions with the native species 91 previously researchers have only predicted the ecological consequences and the expected outcomes of the cultivation of microalgae in the open environment 92 however there are very few reports on the experimental validation of cultivating ge algal strains in outdoor environment for instance hamilton et al 93 cultivated the ge p tricornutum in a closed system such as closed photobioreactor and a miniature raceway pond with artificial illumination with the capacity of 550 l and 1250 l respectively this pilot scale experimental analysis demonstrated a chassis strain and provided insight into the cultivation of ge strain for commercial application amidst szyjka et al 94 reported the cultivation of ge acutodesmus dimorphus strains in outdoor field trials approved by us environmental protection agency the a dimorphus strain overexpressing heterologous acyl carrier protein thioesterase and recombinant green fluorescent protein was cultivated in outdoor cultivation without any notable adverse ecological effects which demonstrated that ge algal strains could be cultivated effectively without outcompeting native strains and without any adverse effects on native algal strains these reports have implied that the ge algal strains could be employed for commercial production applications either in open or closed cultivation systems however there exists several challenges on cultivating ge algal strains in outdoor cultivation conditions such as possible environmental risks thus it warrants the systematic risk assessment in order to avoid the possible severe consequences in ecosystem 95 in this regard cultivation of ge strains in the closed systems such as photobioreactor would provide a potential solution by facilitating optimal conditions for algal proliferation with reduced contamination and also potentially obviate the ecological risks associated with the environmental release of ge algal strains 6 3 strategies to further potentiate ge algal strains adaptive laboratory evolution ale method has emerged as the promising technique to naturally screen the potent strain with improved biological and phenotypic traits by culturing the algal strains under a specific cultivation conditions for a prolonged culture period 96 various studies have subjected the cells to ale in order to enhance the microalgal trait chlorella sp strains were generated via ale by subjecting the cells under 10 and 20 carbon dioxide after 31 cycles which significantly increased the growth rate biomass and chlorophyll content possibly by the increased pigment content and the suitable chl a chl b ratio however co2 based ale strategy resulted in increased and decreased carbohydrate and lipid content respectively 97 this strategy might be potential for the hyperaccumulation of valuable carbohydrates from microalgae 98 but not for the production of oleochemicals long time exposure to light stress by combined blue and red led light in the photobioreactor for 16 cycles resulted in significant elevation of β carotene and lutein by 3 3 and 2 3 fold in evolved dunaliella salina 99 chlorella sp was subjected to 31 cycles under 500 mg l concentration of phenol which resulted in elevated resistance to higher phenol concentration under 500 mg l and the evolved strain could remove the phenol completely in the cultivation medium in 7 days 100 sun et al 101 developed the evolved schizochytrium sp strain via two factor ale strategy subjected to low temperature and high salinity stress for 30 adaptation cycles in an attempt to elevate the docosahexaenoic acid and neutral lipids respectively after the adaptation cycles the strains resulted in remarkable elevation of cellular biomass and dha accumulation besides the evolved strains have exhibited increased antioxidant potential though there are increasing reports available on the application of ale strategy to elevate the microalgal trait for commercial applications but only few reports have documented the molecular mechanisms underlying the improved phenotypic trait sun et al 102 examined the hyper salinity evolved schizochytrium sp strain by lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses which uncovered that ale using nacl 3 w v significantly increased lipid content and upregulated the genes involved in central carbon metabolic pathways long term cultivation of synechocystis sp under 3 nacl for about 10 months resulted in resistant to salinity stress and also altered the metabolomic profile in the evolved strain as revealed by the metabolomic analysis and the transcriptomic analysis showed ale strategy differentially expressed genes 103 these reports have advanced the current understanding of the ale strategy on algal strain improvement for various commercial applications however attempts to further improve the genetically engineered strain to achieve the maximum productivity are yet to be explored ale of the genetically engineered strain with enhanced lipid content enhanced growth and photosynthetic efficiency would be ideal to further enhance the lipogenic potential of the ge lipogenic strain as an attempt to uncover the maximum potential of the already improved lipogenic ge strain various combinatorial strategies have been employed such as subjecting the log phase grown ge strain to nitrogen deprivation condition the well established treatment for induce lipogenesis in algae for instances nannochloropsis sp overexpressing dgat2 which catalyses the final and committed step of tag biogenesis was subjected to the nitrogen deprivation and showed an increase of the lipid content by 129 104 similarly subjecting the transgenic algal strains to n deprivation resulted in notable enhancement of lipid content 66 67 105 however compromised algal productivity remains a limiting in terms of commercial aspects thus designing a strategy by subjecting the ge algal strain to ale might yield much better results given the established role of recombinant algal strain to concurrently overproduce algal biomass and biocomponents along with the demonstrated potential of ale on enhancing the algal productivity without impeding algal growth rate combinatorial approach of subjecting the ge strains to ale would yield promising results however it remains an untapped approach despite their commercial feasibility to this end wang et al 106 subjected the transgenic p tricornutum overexpressing mcat and desaturase 5b under hyposalinity stress for about 8 months yielded highest pufa titre and epa content was further increased in evolved strains besides adaptive evolution along with the provision of fulvic acid orchestrated the expression of key lipogenic genes involved in fatty acid tag and nadph biosynthesis this data provided potential insights into the wide application of ale of ge strains with commercial potential subsequently the above mentioned evolved p tricornutum strain was grown in kitchen ww and food wastes and its efficacy on producing valuable components from wastes was investigated for the first time the evolved strain was found to be grown well in kitchen ww as the water source and food waste hydrolysate as the nutrient sources which resulted in the highest record pufa accumulation by p tricornutum strain cultivated in organic food waste streams 1 this report uncovers the need for establishing the combinatorial strategy of subjecting the ge strains by ale which could be a promising strategy for concurrent hyperaccumulation of algal biomass and valuable biocomponents from waste streams 7 conclusions and future outlooks in the contemporary global scenario our environment is plagued by a range of global issues such as depleting energy reserves and water resources which are attributed to the anthropogenic activities despite the significant role of microalgae in remediating ww overproduction of biofuels and valuable commodity components and mitigation of greenhouse gas emission and production of algal biomolecules using ww as the cheap and sustainable water source is not yet practical over the past few decades many studies have undertaken on the production of various biomolecules from microalgae using ww as the nutrient medium the notable accomplishments have led to the cultivation of oleaginous and fast growing algal species in ww accumulation of valuable oleochemicals and significant removal of nutrient components from ww despite these impressive accomplishments the application of ww for microalgal cultivation in an economically feasible manner is yet to be explored the existing biological barriers that hamper the effective microalgal mediated remediation of ww include 1 lack of chassis microalgal strains with the potential to assimilate nutrients from ww 2 scrutinization of potential strain based on the nature and composition of ww 3 application of a suitable strain to produce valuable biochemicals without hampering overall productivity 4 designing a suitable cultivation conditions and selecting an ideal culture methods to favour the microalgal growth and most importantly 5 unavailability of comprehensive strategy to employ the genetically engineered algal strains for the commendable output to this end genetic improvement of microalgae which harbours the rational scrutinization of potential metabolic candidate that underpins crucial biochemical pathway s and its manipulation into the potential host organism is considered one of the promising solutions to obviate the existing bottlenecks in this review an overview on genetic engineering strategies for the improvement of microalgal genetic trait was provided that could produce valuable oleochemicals using ww besides this review describes the prerequisite for recruiting potential molecular candidate that possesses the potential to govern the crucial metabolic pathways to overproduce valuable biomolecules as discussed in this review ale approach has enabled us to generate the potential algal strain with improved genotypic trait particularly to cultivate in suboptimal conditions such as ww taken into account of ale and ge strategies the combinatorial approach will result in industry ready ge strain and generate the promising chassis algal strains even though such reports are scarce and such data will hold great promise for the production of valuable biochemicals from wastewater thus additional research efforts ought to be carried out to validate this combinatorial strategy for large scale cultivation in an

13717,increasing population and urbanization bring along depletion of water resources with notable discharge of industrial and municipal wastewater which is rich in nutrients microalgae hold great promise for assimilating the nutrient compounds particularly the intricate nitrogen n and phosphorus p compounds from wastewater resulting in algal biomass enriched with various valuable biomolecules however development of strategies involving the cultivation of microalgae for wastewater treatment and production of commodity components is still in its infancy in this review the current status of microalgae mediated wastewater treatment the existing technological bottlenecks that hamper the effective use of photosynthetic microalgae and innovative solutions to obviate the shortcomings are discussed also this article highlights the potential use of genetic engineering technologies in overproducing algal biomolecules without impeding cellular biomass accumulation by regulating critical metabolic targets for the development of engineered algal strains in this context adaptive laboratory evolution ale could be the promising tool to further empower the engineered strains to mitigate the adverse effect from the wastewater cultivation medium in summary this review provides novel insights into the application of genetic engineering strategies for overproducing algal biomass and valuable biomolecules such as lipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids using wastewater in a cost effective manner keywords wastewater microalga adaptive laboratory evolution genetic engineering 1 introduction burgeoning industrialization and ever growing human population along with the incessant consumption of finite fossil fuels and depleting ground water resources result in remarkable emission of industrial and municipal wastewater ww which in turn bring on concurrent energy and water demand 1 significant part of the ww would be domestic ww the water rich in organic components which is largely released into the nearby waterbodies either treated or untreated 2 therefore the nutrients present in these waters remain largely unrecovered thereby contributing to eutrophication of water bodies 3 4 it has been speculated that nearly half the world could suffer from water deficit by 2025 and almost 75 of the world population could face freshwater scarcity by 2050 5 parallelly depleting fossil fuels reserves and its negative impact on environment and economy such as acid rain global warming increase in petrol prices have provided the impetus to explore the promising carbon neutral and renewable bioenergy sources 6 7 among the biological feedstocks assessed for the biofuel production photosynthetic microalgae have emerged as the promising system over terrestrial plants owing to their properties such as rapid growth rate higher photosynthetic rate and productivity non requirement of arable land and higher theoretical oil yield per capita 8 reasoning these inherent characteristics various research agencies have devoted tremendous efforts to improve the microalgal biofuel potential despite these attempts comprehensive strategy for the large scale production of microalgal biofuels in economically viable manner is yet to be developed among the formidable challenges that impede the commercial production of algal biofuels microalgal cultivation warrants large usage of water and nutrients which makes them unaffordable and crucial limiting parameters 9 these data highlight the necessity to develop a potential strategy to effectively utilize the ww as the water source for the cultivation of microalgae to overcome the potable water scarcity that exist all over the world 10 nevertheless there are also other techno biological obstacles that have to be tackled in order to cultivate microalgae in ww sustainable microalgal biomass has been regarded as the key factor that determines the large scale production of microalgal biomolecules in an economically feasible manner it is known that concurrent production of biomass and biomolecules is pivotal for large scale production of algal bioproducts as the overall yield is dependent on the total biomass production 11 in this regard research attempts have been devoted to formulate cost effective cultivation media and recruitment of superior algal species and strains that have the ability to proliferate in wws meanwhile microalgal growth in ww could be affected by various parameters such as microalgal species strains their capability to withstand a wide range of suboptimal conditions nutrient profile of the ww and cultivation conditions 12 recruitment of appropriate microalgal species strain having the potential to hyperaccumulate valuable biomolecules without compromising the growth and biomass accumulation is considered to be the prime factor for commercial applications however previous studies have shown that native wild type wt algal strains have exhibited slight reduction in growth rate and biocomponent production it is worth mentioning that scenedesmus strain sdec8 displayed higher growth which accumulated the biomass of 0 5 mg l than that of the strain scenedesmus sdec13 0 34 mg l cultivated in anaerobically digested effluent kitchen waste which stress on the importance of the strain selection for the large scale production of valuable compounds 13 in contrast addition of higher percentage of municipal waste by 80 and 100 in the cultivation medium inhibited growth rate of marine alga nannochloropsis sp a common oleaginous algal source for triacylglycerides tag thereby suggesting metabolic and physiological properties could be species specific 14 these reports have clearly indicated the importance of candidate algal strains that can accumulate valuable biomolecules even in affordable growth medium which can overcome the techno biological bottlenecks that hinder the commercial feasibility of microalgae based biomolecule production thus there exists a pressing need to develop the microalgal trait in order to cope with the suboptimal cultivation medium and to overproduce valuable biomolecules the objective of this review is to discuss the current status of the microalgal associated strategies that are used in ww treatment and to outline the drawbacks associated with the existing technologies this review also aims to emphasize the technological and biological breakthroughs that are needed for economically viable algal biomolecules production using ww the significance of algal strain improvement by systems approaches for hyperaccumulation of algal biocomponents without compromising cellular physiological properties are also highlighted together this review summarizes the critical factors that govern the algal based production of biomolecules using ww and the feasible strategies to remove the existing bottlenecks and also offers possible insights into the generation of potential engineered microalgal strains and novel combinatorial strategies using synthetic biology approaches for effective ww treatment 2 impact of the wastewater on the receiving ecosystems with the ever increasing urban population and rapid growth of restaurants all over the world discharge of kitchen waste into the environment has been continuously increasing thus emerged as the severe problem to the environment and public health due to the limited ww treatment plants 2 15 in china it was estimated that about 30 million tons of domestic waste has been generated and discharged 15 domestic ww is highly enriched with organic compounds possesses alkalinity and contains adequate nitrogenous materials which makes this aquatic medium an optimal nutrient source however due to its high moisture and nutrient content discharge of the untreated ww poses severe environmental and health problems 16 18 mostly these waters would be discharged to the waterbodies in either as treated or untreated form though the ww could be treated in the urban areas still the treatment plants release enormous amount of effluent water into the lotic ecosystems which becomes the major water source in the receiving water bodies 19 in addition burgeoning kitchen ww would be a burden to the limited ww treatment plants particularly in the cities with limited ww treatment plants in the cities 2 20 moreover the energy demand for the operation and maintenance of ww treatment plants has been dramatically increased 21 in some cases technical failure in the treatment plant could result in discharge of macerated ww into the ocean which resulted in the non native microbial population in antarctic ecosystem thereby significantly affecting the native population 22 thus the release of kitchen ww either in treated or untreated form could significantly increase the nutrient overload of the receiving water system causing significant environmental issues 23 impact of wastewater discharge into the environment on various systems have been provided in table 1 discharge of ww which is rich in particulate matter dissolved oxygen phosphorus nitrogen and organic content aggravates the water pollution causing serious ecological threats 37 various studies have documented the huge impact of domestic ww that were discharged into the lotic water systems on aquatic organisms and benthic microbial communities discharge of ww into donghu lake wuhan china showed surface water of this lake consists of more xenoestrogens the compounds which impact development and reproduction of organisms 38 duan et al 29 reported that effluent released ww treatment plant into the yangtze river posed a severe risk to the aquatic organisms discharge of untreated domestic ww into the fukuyama inner harbour hiroshima japan water body has been regarded the major source for deterioration of the benthic habitat environment 39 these reports clearly imply the ecological and environmental threats to the water bodies aquatic organisms and benthic microbial populations in response to the discharge of either treated or untreated ww thereby provoking the necessity to develop sustainable and biotechnological strategy in using or treating the ww 3 present status and drawbacks of using ww as water source for microalgae cultivation microalgae are the group of ubiquitous unicellular photosynthetic microphytes that have the potential to assimilate environmental inorganic carbon substrates and convert into organic components in the presence of light through photosynthesis and thus attract huge research interest in various commercial sectors as single cell green factories over the terrestrial plants 40 considering the nutrient rich nature of ww various studies have examined the feasibility of using them as the nutrient medium for microalgae and investigated their efficacy on producing valuable biomolecules and also for treating ww meanwhile the chemical composition of the ww is generally complex and unpredictable which might also contain pharmaceutical heavy metals organic and inorganic compounds thus the complete removal of these complex molecules warrants strategies besides the algal treatment such as bioelectrochemical systems and the green technology which could convert the chemical energy into electrical energy by using microbes as the catalysts 41 42 however microalgae are considered to be the potential systems to significantly reduce the level of nutrient load particularly to reduce the intricate chemical components from the ww particularly inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous remain as the intricate nutrients to be eliminated from the ww it is pertinent to mention that microalgae possess the have capacity to utilize these nutrient compounds for their growth photosynthetic and metabolic activities 12 earlier reports have demonstrated that remediation of organic and inorganic nutrients from the ww by microalgae have resulted in the production of biomass which could be used as the sustainable feedstock for the production of various biomolecules systematic studies have been carried out to investigate the efficacy of microalgae and also to develop a comprehensive strategy for ww treatment using microalgae over the last few decades chevalier and de la noüe 1985 demonstrated that immobilized scenedesmus obliquus in a carrageenan gel potentially assimilating phosphate and ammonium ions from a secondary effluent showed no variations in terms of nutrient consumption and growth between free and immobilized cells 43 hammouda et al 44 assessed the impact of chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp on removing nutrient components from domestic ww and showed that continuous culture resulted in efficient removal of nutrients and increased production of protein this observation was corroborated by increased cellular content of free amino acids even though the maximum efficiency of assimilation of nitrogenous compounds was obtained only after 42 days of treatment these reports have provided key insights for further development of potential strategies for treating ww using immobilized or free algal systems to not only treat ww for further applications and also to produce valuable biomolecules from microalgae consequently a copious amount of literature is now available on employing microalgae for ww treatment and also to produce valuable microalgal biomolecules leite et al 3 reported that fortification of the effluent with low nutrient load by supplementation with piggery ww and using the mixed ww source for cultivating chlorella sorokiniana resulted in enhanced the efficiency of nutrient removal as well as microalgal biomass production mixing of the ww from two different sources was accomplished by using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor operated with a treatment capacity of 650 l and a hydraulic retention time of 3 days however the data on growth rate and the adaptability of these algae in the ww are yet to be ascertained hariz et al 45 in their study with twin objectives attempted to treat palm oil mill effluent along with effective elimination of the emission of greenhouse gases from the conventional ponding treatment system by using heterotrophic scenedesmus sp and autotrophic chlorella sp in a sequential manner the results showed that preliminary treatment with the cultivation of scenedesmus resulted in the effective assimilation of organic carbon from the palm oil mill effluent pome and the resultant pome was found to be suitable for increased biomass production of chlorella increased biomass production by chlorella was found to be comparably more than that of scenedesmus which was cultivated during the first stage of the treatment after 25 days of continuous culture however cultivation for a longer period could impede the algal biomass production and consequently the productivity of the desired algal biomolecules this aspect remains as one of the critical factors that constrain microalgae for commercial exploitation and ww treatment slow growing oleaginous botryococcus braunii has been employed to treat the municipal ww which resulted in efficient nitrogen consumption by b braunii strain and interestingly the lipid content was also increased with altered fatty acid profile particularly rich in saturated fatty acids 46 the authors found that specific growth rate of b braunii was lower in both the influent and effluent sources as compared to optimal chu 13 growth medium in addition the molecular mechanisms underlying such lipogenic trait in the microalgal cells cultivated in the ww are yet to be explored further studies are needed to specifically identify the regulatory factors that are involved in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism application of microalgae for phycoremediation of ww and the earlier reported data are provided in table 2 amini et al 53 employed chlorella vulgaris and activated sludge as for the treatment of municipal ww in a sequential manner which resulted in efficient removal of nutrients on one hand microalgae without as resulted in efficient removal of nutrients from the cultivation medium up to 50 at the cost of microalgal growth on the other hand cultivation of as alone without microalgae resulted in lowest nutrient removal capability up to 30 these findings implied the potential of microalgae on efficiently removing nutrient components from the ww and also shed light on applying microalgae along with as on effectively treating municipal ww maaitah et al 54 cultivated c pyrenoidosa in the medium with olive mills discharged ww with lesser n and p and effluents of urban ww treatment plants with higher n and p which showed that different dilutions of olive mill ww resulted in different biochemical composition and altered cellular physiological properties sodium alginate immobilized nannochloropsis sp cells resulted in effective nutrient uptake from ww which resulted in reduced chemical oxygen demand and improved physiological and biochemical properties than that of the suspended free cells of nannochloropsis sp 48 the sodium alginate immobilization would have provided stability and protected the cells from the suboptimal environmental conditions that prevailed in the ww effluents and also exhibited enhanced nutrient uptake capability than that of the free cells there are only scanty reports available on aspects related to the limiting factors to obviate the existing bottlenecks on microalgal ww treatment and regarding the production of valuable biocomponents 4 limitation in providing adequate water and nutrients impedes large scale algal cultivation among the various formidable challenges related to sustainable cultivation of microalgae for commercial applications provision of adequate water and nutrients has been regarded the crucial limiting factors water consumption for the microalgal cultivation can be determined by two crucial quantitative parameters such as water demand and water footprint water demand is defined as the quantity of water needed for the direct microalgal cultivation process that possesses direct impact on economic and technological aspects of microalgal cultivation whereas water footprint is the policy tool which is known as the quantitative requirement for total freshwater sources to produce the particular product at a particular geographical location where the process is taking place thereby denoting the quantity of freshwater resource that the particular geographical system is deplete of the water water footprint is classified into three groups namely green water footprint blue water footprint and grey water footprint 55 56 accurate determination of water demand throughout the course of microalgal cultivation is hampered by various factors there exists a pressing need to develop a potential tool to determine the water demand for algal cultivation units particularly from the algal ponds in which the cultures are raised the routine method used to cultivate algae yang et al 57 investigated the water footprint and nutrients balance during the life cycle while studying the biofuel production by microalgae in open pond cultivation method this study illustrated the necessity of providing large quantities of water for the microalgal cultures and also implied the necessity of recycling the water or using sea water to obviate the exploitation of freshwater resources on other hand supplying the minimum quantity of water required for algal growth could be a challenging task based on the geographical location of the algal production unit for instance campbell et al 58 demonstrated the crucial role of the location for the establishment of algal cultivation unit which highlighted the usage of sea water in australia and found to be a promising strategy where the land and sea water is abundant but fresh water source is limited previous studies have shown that the approximate requirement of water for large scale cultivation of microalgae warranted huge amount of water for example production of 1 l microalgal biodiesel needed around 3365 l of water which proved that the microalgal cultivation for biofuels production as expensive and water intensive process 56 meanwhile to generate 1 kg of microalgal biomass through raceway ponds around 1 564 l of water was needed furthermore based on the geographical location of the microalgal cultivation unit provision of minimum water required to generate the adequate microalgal biomass was found to be more challenging particularly in water deficit regions 59 yang et al 57 comprehensively investigated the life cycle analysis and water footprint value of using c vulgaris for biofuel production the findings showed that around 3700 kg 0 33 kg and 0 71 kg of freshwater n and p respectively were warranted for production of 1 kg of biodiesel if the water was used without treatment or recycling besides the authors showed that recycling of the water subsequent to harvest decreased the usage of water and nutrient significantly the authors further commended the usage of photobioreactor in order to reduce the water evaporation loss and to increase biomass accumulation cultivation of b braunii as a biofilm reduced the water requirement to generate 1 kg of algal biomass by 45 than that of the algal raceway ponds 60 pandey et al 61 reported that generation of 8 kg of algal biomass and 1 3 kg of algal lipids required 10 000 l of tap water fortified with urea and single super phosphate from c sorokiniana however the reported biomass and lipid accumulation for this strain was found to be significantly higher and reached up to 1 02 0 02 g l and 174 1 9 6 mg l respectively than other strains such as selenastrum gracile scenedesmus acutus and c vulgaris which uncovered the importance of selecting the potential strain for the large scale production of algal biofuels 5 factors that impede large scale cultivation of microalgae using ww from the aforementioned fascinating features of microalgae it is quite clear that microalgae play an important role in reducing the nutrient load of the wastewater the nutrient assimilation in turn helps directly to microalgal growth and metabolic activities and making this bioproduction system effective and cheaper however techno biological barriers have to be overcome in order to exploit the full potential of microalgae on using ww as the affordable nutrient medium for microalgal cultivation production of microalgal biomass and biomolecules by using ww as the affordable cultivation medium has been considered important research areas for scaling up this technology to commercial scale expensive nature of the algal based biofuel products has been found to be due to the culture parameters including supply of water and nutrient components 62 although a copious literature is available on the effectiveness of the superior microalgal strains on remediating the nutrient load and to produce valuable metabolites from microalgae there are only few findings available on the molecular bottlenecks and the potential strategy to obviate the associated challenges impact of the suboptimal conditions imposed by the ww on microalgal physiological parameters are yet to be explored and comparative data on the cells grown in ww and conventional synthetic medium are found to be scarce 3 45 analyses of photosynthetic parameters of the algal cells grown in nutrient rich ww are of paramount importance as it directly indicates the algal growth and intracellular accumulation of key metabolic precursors which could be later catalysed into valuable biochemicals 63 selection of the microalgal strain that could concurrently increase the production of biomass and biochemicals withstand the extreme environmental and cultivation conditions and that increase the production of the targeted product 64 importantly comprehensive studies are warranted to investigate the genes and key metabolic pathways that underpin the uncompromised growth that govern the photosynthetic mechanisms nevertheless the data on such pivotal mechanisms and the mechanistic role of the identified molecular candidates remain largely obscured 65 thus there exists a pressing need to characterize the key molecular candidate gene s and its mechanistic role on orchestrating the crucial metabolic pathways to tackle these drawbacks that potentially hinder the commercial exploitation despite these tremendous research efforts that analysed the efficacy of microalgae using ww and also to reduce the nutrient load of the ww there nonetheless remain serious hinderances to achieve the commercially feasible production of microalgal biocomponents it is known that lack of chassis strain with the potential to concurrently overproduce algal biomass and lipid productivity is the crucial parameter that impedes the commercial application of microalgae in an attempt to enhance the lipogenic potential of microalgae researchers employed the algal cells to suboptimal conditions particularly nitrogen deprivation treatment which elicit the cells to hyperaccumulate energy reserve in the form of lipids but at the cost of algal biomass thereby reducing the overall lipid productivity and hampering the commercial exploitation of microalgae 66 67 in contrast lipid accumulation capability of wildtype wt microalgae under optimal conditions is lower to meet the commercial expectations particularly lack of industry suitable algal strain with promising oleaginicity growth rate ability to withstand adverse conditions and grow in cheaper cultivation medium are the serious constrains that impede the microalgal industry 68 ji et al 69 reported that growth rate of c vulgaris was significantly lower when cultivated in piggery waste however diluted ww has been shown to slightly alleviate the algal growth but not comparable to the synthetic medium furthermore the results showed that prolonged cultivation period up to 30 days was required to attain the significant biomass and lipid accumulation which exacerbate the overall yield and productivity of both algal biomass and biocomponents table 3 denotes the impact of different strategies on microalgal lipid productivity nwoba et al 79 assessed the growth rate of algal consortium in biocoil and compared it with the raceway pond system the results indicated that cell concentration of both the cultivation systems was found to decline till second day of the subculture and chlorella sp was found to be the most dominant algae followed by scenedesmus sp these results implied that the growth rate of selected microalgae could be species specific in contrast cultivation of c vulgaris c minutissima scenedesmus sp and chlorococcum sp in domestic ww proved that scenedesmus sp exhibited higher specific growth rate of 0 44 μ and biomass productivity of 61 4 mg l day among the tested algal species 78 photoautotrophic cultivation of endogenous and wt c vulgaris revealed the crucial factors that govern the viable application of microalgae for ww treatment could play the crucial role in governing the microalgal master that affect the growth microalgae in the brewery ww various studies have reported that growth and biomass production of the microalgae using ww as the cultivation medium showed high variation based on the algal strain nutrient content of the ww and the cultivation conditions 73 a few reports provided valuable clues in relation to the development of potential cultivation strategy for microalgae using ww and the regulatory factors governing the overproduction of microalgal biomolecules these reports also have uncovered that algal growth in the ww could be species specific and in most cases growth of the inoculated algal culture has been declining initially thereafter it gradually increased besides algal growth in the ww was found to be expectedly lesser than that cultivated in the control synthetic medium this trend usually limits the overall biomass production thereby reducing the overall productivity of the desired product from algal systems and hindering the commercial viability of microalgae therefore it is of paramount importance to improve the genetic trait of the wt strain in such a way to generate the chassis strain with increased photosynthetic and growth activities and to overproduce desired biomolecules using ww this has provided the impetus to identify and target the potential metabolic node s that underpin the intricate microalgal biochemical pathways without affecting cellular physiological characteristics 6 genetic engineering to augment commercially desirable features of microalgae grown in ww genetic engineering ge is a promising tool by targeted perturbation of key metabolic pathways either by overexpressing downregulating silencing the key gene s to alter the desired metabolite content without impairing the cellular physiological properties particularly there has been increasing interest to exploit the lipogenic potential of oleaginous microalgae due to the enormous application of microalgal lipids in the production of a wide array of valuable components such as triacylglycerides tag and polyunsaturated fatty acids this process with the identification of the potential genes with the aid of bioinformatics tools and with the advancement of nucleic acid sequencing technology the identified metabolic target would be cloned into the expression vector and subsequently transformed into the target microalgae the putative transgenic cells would be further confirmed by molecular analyses and analyzed for the improvement of phenotypic trait by evaluating the physiological and biochemical features fig 1 nevertheless owing to the complexities in oleochemical biosynthetic pathways unpredicted fatty acid profile of the accumulated lipids and lack of molecular transformation toolkits for most of the oleaginous species microalgal genetic engineering is still in its infancy the advent of bioinformatics tools and completely sequenced genome database has represented a significant progress in the microalgal genetic improvement 80 therefore comprehensive understanding of the biochemical pathways identification of crucial genes that govern the metabolic pathways and designing the robust genetic transformation tool box and selection of the potential target play a crucial role in microalgal genetic engineering for instance for biofuel production the algal strain should overproduce tag the potential metabolic precursor for biodiesel production via transesterification reaction which liberate mono alkyl fatty acid esters as the byproducts 81 nevertheless accumulation biosynthesis and fatty acid composition of tag have been regarded the strain specific biological phenomenon which is known to be governed by the genetic makeup of the specific microalgae given the potential of genetic engineering on empowering microalgae as the sustainable biological feedstock for overproducing the desired biochemicals without hampering cellular biomass various investigators have made tremendous research efforts to enhance microalgal lipogenic potential by biotechnology means however conventional genetic engineering strategies to enhance oleochemicals by perturbing the key metabolic gene of the target biochemical pathway have yielded inconsistent success due to the intricate nature of the most biochemical pathways in microalgae for example microalgal lipid overproduction requires a series of regulatory components such as provision of carbon metabolic precursors 81 reducing equivalents in the form of nadph as lipids are reduced molecules 66 inhibition of competing pathways 82 and enhanced production of rate limiting enzymes besides some reports have demonstrated the increased lipid content via genetic engineering but resulted in impaired growth rate of the transgenic organisms 82 thus generation of chassis strain by means of genetic engineering warrants the stringent recruitment of gene s that have the potential to govern the intricate biochemical pathways though the genetic engineering strategies have yielded inconsistent success various studies have identified and characterized the crucial molecular candidates underpinning the biochemical synthesis in microalgae and also exemplified the promising microalgal genetic engineering transformation toolkit 65 83 84 fig 2 these results have paved the way to develop the chassis strain with enhanced physiological properties and biochemical production using ww as the cultivation medium 6 1 ge strategies to enhance microalgal physiological parameters for ww cultivation microalgae are the potential candidates for assimilating the nutrient compounds present in the ww for their growth and consequently generate valuable biochemicals depend on the chosen microalgal strains however previous reports have documented the lag in the cells to adapt themselves in the adverse conditions and thus algal cells exhibit slightly reduced growth rate than that of the cells grown in the optimal medium 46 which implied the necessity to employ the microalgal cells with enhanced growth and photosynthetic activity in order to cope with the adverse conditions few reports have documented the impact of some key genes on enhancing the growth and photosynthetic activity thereby providing an insight into the scrutinization of the transgenic strain to be used for ww treatment heterologous expression of malic enzyme from the diatom resulted in elevated growth and chlorophyll fluorescence parameter which was in line with the increased lipid content in transgenic chlorella pyrenoidosa 86 overexpression of malonyl coa acyl carrier protein transacylase mcat gene enhanced the growth of the transgenic n oceanica possibly by increasing the fatty acids required for the photosynthetic apparatus thereby upholding the photoautotrophic growth of transgenic algae 87 congruently double transgenics expressing gpat1 and lpat1 resulted in the enhanced growth and photosynthetic efficiency in transgenic p tricornutum 67 heterologous expression of diatom glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase resulted in increased growth rate during stationary phase and photosynthetic efficiency in transgenic c pyrenoidosa 66 these data reinforced the potential of microalgal genetic engineering on enhancing cellular physiological properties and metabolite content by manipulating a key node of the target metabolic circuit in addition these results have also uncovered the necessity to recruit the potential metabolic target which could ameliorate the productivity of the desired metabolites in the ww without compromising cellular growth acclimation phase of the algal strain into the ww has been portrayed as the limiting factor that hinder the initial growth and overall biomass yield throughout the ww treatment process engineering the key lipogenic genes and lipid biosynthesis associated genes has resulted in enhance chlorophyll fluorescence parameter fv fm the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii and also considered to be the versatile parameter to assess the physiological stability of a particular cell without affected by photoinhibition 88 potentiating the transgenic strains to acclimate adverse conditions enhance cellular physiological properties and accumulate valuable biocomponents is the crucial trait bestowed by the introduced transgene s which has been regarded the hallmark of the success of ge experiments 6 2 environmental concerns associated with the application of ge strains though the efficacy of genetically engineered ge algal strain has been demonstrated previously in laboratory scale their trait and physiological characteristics in field or in open cultivation mode remains largely unknown 89 on the one hand advantages and ecological risks of ge plants have been well studied and discussed subsequently ge plants have been cultivated in millions of acres globally 90 on the other hand the ecological consequences of releasing ge microalgae are largely unknown since limited experiments have been carried out in outdoor cultivation of ge microalgae the phenotypic traits exhibited by ge algal strains might be unstable in open cultivation and will have unknown complex interactions with the native species 91 previously researchers have only predicted the ecological consequences and the expected outcomes of the cultivation of microalgae in the open environment 92 however there are very few reports on the experimental validation of cultivating ge algal strains in outdoor environment for instance hamilton et al 93 cultivated the ge p tricornutum in a closed system such as closed photobioreactor and a miniature raceway pond with artificial illumination with the capacity of 550 l and 1250 l respectively this pilot scale experimental analysis demonstrated a chassis strain and provided insight into the cultivation of ge strain for commercial application amidst szyjka et al 94 reported the cultivation of ge acutodesmus dimorphus strains in outdoor field trials approved by us environmental protection agency the a dimorphus strain overexpressing heterologous acyl carrier protein thioesterase and recombinant green fluorescent protein was cultivated in outdoor cultivation without any notable adverse ecological effects which demonstrated that ge algal strains could be cultivated effectively without outcompeting native strains and without any adverse effects on native algal strains these reports have implied that the ge algal strains could be employed for commercial production applications either in open or closed cultivation systems however there exists several challenges on cultivating ge algal strains in outdoor cultivation conditions such as possible environmental risks thus it warrants the systematic risk assessment in order to avoid the possible severe consequences in ecosystem 95 in this regard cultivation of ge strains in the closed systems such as photobioreactor would provide a potential solution by facilitating optimal conditions for algal proliferation with reduced contamination and also potentially obviate the ecological risks associated with the environmental release of ge algal strains 6 3 strategies to further potentiate ge algal strains adaptive laboratory evolution ale method has emerged as the promising technique to naturally screen the potent strain with improved biological and phenotypic traits by culturing the algal strains under a specific cultivation conditions for a prolonged culture period 96 various studies have subjected the cells to ale in order to enhance the microalgal trait chlorella sp strains were generated via ale by subjecting the cells under 10 and 20 carbon dioxide after 31 cycles which significantly increased the growth rate biomass and chlorophyll content possibly by the increased pigment content and the suitable chl a chl b ratio however co2 based ale strategy resulted in increased and decreased carbohydrate and lipid content respectively 97 this strategy might be potential for the hyperaccumulation of valuable carbohydrates from microalgae 98 but not for the production of oleochemicals long time exposure to light stress by combined blue and red led light in the photobioreactor for 16 cycles resulted in significant elevation of β carotene and lutein by 3 3 and 2 3 fold in evolved dunaliella salina 99 chlorella sp was subjected to 31 cycles under 500 mg l concentration of phenol which resulted in elevated resistance to higher phenol concentration under 500 mg l and the evolved strain could remove the phenol completely in the cultivation medium in 7 days 100 sun et al 101 developed the evolved schizochytrium sp strain via two factor ale strategy subjected to low temperature and high salinity stress for 30 adaptation cycles in an attempt to elevate the docosahexaenoic acid and neutral lipids respectively after the adaptation cycles the strains resulted in remarkable elevation of cellular biomass and dha accumulation besides the evolved strains have exhibited increased antioxidant potential though there are increasing reports available on the application of ale strategy to elevate the microalgal trait for commercial applications but only few reports have documented the molecular mechanisms underlying the improved phenotypic trait sun et al 102 examined the hyper salinity evolved schizochytrium sp strain by lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses which uncovered that ale using nacl 3 w v significantly increased lipid content and upregulated the genes involved in central carbon metabolic pathways long term cultivation of synechocystis sp under 3 nacl for about 10 months resulted in resistant to salinity stress and also altered the metabolomic profile in the evolved strain as revealed by the metabolomic analysis and the transcriptomic analysis showed ale strategy differentially expressed genes 103 these reports have advanced the current understanding of the ale strategy on algal strain improvement for various commercial applications however attempts to further improve the genetically engineered strain to achieve the maximum productivity are yet to be explored ale of the genetically engineered strain with enhanced lipid content enhanced growth and photosynthetic efficiency would be ideal to further enhance the lipogenic potential of the ge lipogenic strain as an attempt to uncover the maximum potential of the already improved lipogenic ge strain various combinatorial strategies have been employed such as subjecting the log phase grown ge strain to nitrogen deprivation condition the well established treatment for induce lipogenesis in algae for instances nannochloropsis sp overexpressing dgat2 which catalyses the final and committed step of tag biogenesis was subjected to the nitrogen deprivation and showed an increase of the lipid content by 129 104 similarly subjecting the transgenic algal strains to n deprivation resulted in notable enhancement of lipid content 66 67 105 however compromised algal productivity remains a limiting in terms of commercial aspects thus designing a strategy by subjecting the ge algal strain to ale might yield much better results given the established role of recombinant algal strain to concurrently overproduce algal biomass and biocomponents along with the demonstrated potential of ale on enhancing the algal productivity without impeding algal growth rate combinatorial approach of subjecting the ge strains to ale would yield promising results however it remains an untapped approach despite their commercial feasibility to this end wang et al 106 subjected the transgenic p tricornutum overexpressing mcat and desaturase 5b under hyposalinity stress for about 8 months yielded highest pufa titre and epa content was further increased in evolved strains besides adaptive evolution along with the provision of fulvic acid orchestrated the expression of key lipogenic genes involved in fatty acid tag and nadph biosynthesis this data provided potential insights into the wide application of ale of ge strains with commercial potential subsequently the above mentioned evolved p tricornutum strain was grown in kitchen ww and food wastes and its efficacy on producing valuable components from wastes was investigated for the first time the evolved strain was found to be grown well in kitchen ww as the water source and food waste hydrolysate as the nutrient sources which resulted in the highest record pufa accumulation by p tricornutum strain cultivated in organic food waste streams 1 this report uncovers the need for establishing the combinatorial strategy of subjecting the ge strains by ale which could be a promising strategy for concurrent hyperaccumulation of algal biomass and valuable biocomponents from waste streams 7 conclusions and future outlooks in the contemporary global scenario our environment is plagued by a range of global issues such as depleting energy reserves and water resources which are attributed to the anthropogenic activities despite the significant role of microalgae in remediating ww overproduction of biofuels and valuable commodity components and mitigation of greenhouse gas emission and production of algal biomolecules using ww as the cheap and sustainable water source is not yet practical over the past few decades many studies have undertaken on the production of various biomolecules from microalgae using ww as the nutrient medium the notable accomplishments have led to the cultivation of oleaginous and fast growing algal species in ww accumulation of valuable oleochemicals and significant removal of nutrient components from ww despite these impressive accomplishments the application of ww for microalgal cultivation in an economically feasible manner is yet to be explored the existing biological barriers that hamper the effective microalgal mediated remediation of ww include 1 lack of chassis microalgal strains with the potential to assimilate nutrients from ww 2 scrutinization of potential strain based on the nature and composition of ww 3 application of a suitable strain to produce valuable biochemicals without hampering overall productivity 4 designing a suitable cultivation conditions and selecting an ideal culture methods to favour the microalgal growth and most importantly 5 unavailability of comprehensive strategy to employ the genetically engineered algal strains for the commendable output to this end genetic improvement of microalgae which harbours the rational scrutinization of potential metabolic candidate that underpins crucial biochemical pathway s and its manipulation into the potential host organism is considered one of the promising solutions to obviate the existing bottlenecks in this review an overview on genetic engineering strategies for the improvement of microalgal genetic trait was provided that could produce valuable oleochemicals using ww besides this review describes the prerequisite for recruiting potential molecular candidate that possesses the potential to govern the crucial metabolic pathways to overproduce valuable biomolecules as discussed in this review ale approach has enabled us to generate the potential algal strain with improved genotypic trait particularly to cultivate in suboptimal conditions such as ww taken into account of ale and ge strategies the combinatorial approach will result in industry ready ge strain and generate the promising chassis algal strains even though such reports are scarce and such data will hold great promise for the production of valuable biochemicals from wastewater thus additional research efforts ought to be carried out to validate this combinatorial strategy for large scale cultivation in an economically feasible manner declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

13718,natural minerals are used as sorbent in water treatment processes due to their high exchange and relatively low cost in this paper a pilot water treatment was conducted to explore the application of greensand in a fluidized bed column while the iron manganese and ammonium removal performances of two treatment processes including greensand filtration and potassium permanganate greensand filtration were evaluated the breakthrough curves were investigated to analyze the effect of variables such as bed height and inlet flow on the removal performance in addition to the physical properties of greensand the results showed that the effect of potassium permanganate on the outlet concentration of the fluidized bed was significant in terms of the breakthrough curves which led to the breakthrough points for iron and manganese it was found that adding potassium permanganate increased the equilibrium column capacity q e q from 5 18 mg g and 2 16 mg g to 12 70 mg g and 11 29 mg g for iron and manganese respectively so fe and mn outlet concentrations reached under the admissible maximum concentration of drinking water in the experiments without kmno4 iron removal was found to be caused by reductive dissolution and adsorption while adsorption was the only mechanism for manganese removal the findings indicated that ammonium removal was minimally influenced by kmno4 and ion exchange was the main mechanism for ammonium removal keywords adsorption iron manganese ammonium fluidized bed greensand 1 introduction heavy metals are not biodegradable and are accumulated in the tissues of living creatures and therefore they enter food chains and are adsorbed into human body for this reason they are distinguished from other toxic contaminants even a small amount of heavy metals can cause severe neurological or physiological injuries to human body 1 groundwater which is an important source of drinking water percolates through soil and rocks then some minerals are dissolved into water 2 consequently it generally includes iron and manganese as divalent ions 3 numerous reports on the presence of iron and manganese in potable groundwater in different countries including canada 4 egypt 5 and benin 6 have been presented rain surface and waste water filtration dissolving minerals from soil increase iron and manganese in groundwater sources 7 manganese can be present as a result of both natural sources and human activities such as mining and landfill leaching 8 the presence of iron is because of the corrosion of iron pipes during groundwater extraction and distribution in addition to industrial origins such as mining and iron and steel industry 7 9 ammonia nitrogen flows from municipal industrial and agricultural wastewater sites and in wastewater treatment it is produced by the enzymatic breakdown of urea proteins and other nitrogen containing materials this ammonia finally discharges into water sources 10 11 due to the extreme use of fertilizers in agriculture and animal wastes from animal farms there is a growth in nitrogen compounds in surface and ground water sources 12 nitrogen compounds are essential to all forms of living life but it is undesirable in drinking water because it is the main cause of eutrophication of water body 13 14 the presence of iron in water at high concentrations causes a reddish color taste and odor and also insoluble iron can be deposited on some surfaces such as clothing dishes glasses and water pipes the color created by the iron on clothing and dishes is not cleaned by soap and detergents and using bleaches can intensify the color iron deposition on the walls of water supply pipes decreases pressure and increases the cost of pumping and water distribution 7 the existence of manganese in water can cause hallucination forgetfulness and damage to nerves by influencing respiratory system and brain it can also lead to parkinson embolism and bronchitis and manganese in water can create purple black spots on surface 1 15 ammonium is a concern because of its high capacity for odor production negative effects on water quality and human health if it is consumed more than the specified amount it will have toxic and dangerous effects on human health 16 17 the form of nitrogen compounds in aqueous solutions is usually ammonium ion nh4 13 at ph greater than 8 nh4 ion is converted into nh3 and at very low ph h3o ions compete with nh4 ions for active sites in adsorbents and the amount of ammonium adsorption at ph smaller than 5 is low 18 19 therefore 5 ph 8 is the best range for ammonium adsorption based on world health organization the highest authorized standard values for iron manganese and ammonia in drinking water are 0 30 0 05 and 1 50 mg l ppm respectively 7 solid liquid fluidized beds have been widely used in process industries such as particle classification by size and density adsorption catalyst growth ion exchange catalytic breakage heat exchangers of automated cleaning liquid fluidized bed extraction functions and wastewater treatments 20 one of the advantages of fluidized beds compared to fixed beds is the fact that the intraparticle mass transfer resistance in fluidized beds is much lower it is easy to construct and run on fluidized beds and it is appropriate for the adsorption of soluble particles 21 unlike other beds the upward flow of liquid in fluidized beds produces uniform liquid distribution which eliminates or at least minimizes any tendency toward channeling or bulk circulation fluidized bed column is also used over a wide range of flow rates so the selection of optimum contact time or residence time of fluid and solid particles is possible 20 the most important uses of fluidized beds are backwashing downflow filters these kinds of filtrations need periodic backwashing to remove impurities which have filled the bed and may cause the clogging of the filter media 22 some problems regarding fixed and packed beds were reported such as slow reaction kinetics blocking and pore cementation of different media by metal oxide precipitates 23 but ammonium and metals removal in fluidized bed which has a continuous backwashing eliminates the mentioned problems especially in experiments with potassium permanganate in fact potassium permanganate causes not only the precipitation of adsorbed metal ions and removing them from sand particles but also the regeneration of greensand particles for more adsorption adsorption as a more practical technology is used to remove contaminants from natural water compared to other technologies such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration and electrodialysis 24 although there were different types of adsorbents greensand was used in this project greensand is a member of a group of minerals called illite which is a member of a wider mineral group called phyllosilicates whose specification is a continuous network of silicon tetrahedral the approximate formula of glauconite is k na fe3 al fe2 mg 2 si al 4o10 oh 2 actually greensand consists of a manganese oxide mnox coating on glauconite which is activated by potassium permanganate kmno4 25 manganese oxides are generally represented with the chemical formula of mnox because of multiple valance states of mn ions that may be exhibited in coating 26 it is a strong oxidant for iron and manganese on sand grains used as a filter to remove iron and manganese for many years when the oxidation capacity of the bed is low the greensand bed is regenerated by the help of potassium permanganate and the adsorbent enters the circuit these beds are suitable for water with high concentrations of iron and bicarbonate but if there are organic materials nitrogen or hydrogen sulfide in water the greensand filter should be regenerated after a short time 27 there are different physical configurations such as batch process continuous mixing tank fixed bed and fluidized bed for the adsorption process in the meantime the fluidized bed operations have the advantage that particles can move continuously with effective fluid mixing but there is also erosion and corrosion of particles in fluidized bed operations designing an excellent fluidized bed adsorption column needs the prediction of outlet concentrations time specifications and breakthrough curves 28 different sizes of sand particles present different behaviors and directly affect hydrodynamics of fluidized beds so the physical properties of the media such as density particle size and the surface characteristics of greensand influence the result of the fluidization 29 chen et al 2005 analyzed a solid liquid fluidized bed with pure iron adsorbent for nitrate removal the effectiveness of nitrate removal increased by increasing the amount of adsorbent the exhaustion point test was performed and the nitrate removal efficiency was about 85 90 for 25 hours 23 wang et al 2007 studied the removal of low concentration ammonia in water using na mordenite this study demonstrated that ammonia removal was not influenced by operating temperature the coexistence of ca2 and mg2 significantly decreased ammonia removal while the presence of coexistent cations such as na and k had little influence on ammonia uptake 30 mendieta et al 2009 investigated the removal of iron and manganese from aqueous solutions on the mexican clinoptilolite rich tuff in single and binary systems it was found that the maximum iron and manganese removal was at ph 6 and the removal of iron in single systems was higher than manganese 31 barlokova et al 2010 worked on the removal of iron and manganese from drinking water by natural adsorbents the aim of their paper was to compare activated natural zeolite clinoptilolite with activated filtration sand and birm the results showed that klinopur mn was a cost effective adsorbent suitable for the removal of iron and manganese moreover the amount of dissolved oxygen in the solution was one of the most important criteria for removal efficiency 32 huang et al 2010 studied ammonium removal from aqueous solutions by zeolite they investigated the presence of cations and anions on ammonium removal by conducting some batch experiments it was achieved that the value of the adsorbed ammonium decreased by the presence of cations in the solution the selectivity order for these competitive cations was na k ca2 mg2 33 kulkarni et al 2013 studied the adsorption of phenol from wastewater in fluidized bed using activated carbon as an adsorbent it was observed that the saturation percentage of adsorbent increased by increasing the inlet concentration also increasing the flow rate resulted in a better adsorption 34 stylianou et al 2015 investigated the removal efficiency of heavy metals using natural clinoptilolite in fixed and fluidized bed reactors it was concluded that by using the same relative volumetric flow rate fixed bed experiments had better results and in comparison to fixed bed the breakthrough points in fluidized bed were shifted to the left 35 hu et al 2019 investigated several treatment processes on manganese and arsenic removal from drinking water during two months of treatments it was observed that the highest removal of arsenic was 68 5 and manganese could be completely removed the process included ozonation and greensand filtration and finally the water was passed through an iron based granular sorbent 36 the objective of this study was to investigate the performance of a fluidized bed column with a greensand adsorbent for removing iron manganese and ammonium from drinking water the breakthrough studies were performed to evaluate the adsorbent performance in continuous fluidized bed operations by changing the operating conditions such as the inlet flow rate and the bed height the effect of adding potassium permanganate as an oxidant before the entrance of water to the bed was also evaluated in the breakthrough curves the adsorbent particles diameter was equal to 0 590 mm and the ph of water ranged from 7 to 8 in all experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the metal salts of feso4 7h2o and mnso4 h2o individually with deionized water were used to make a 1000 mg l iron and manganese stock solution and the ph of solution with 65 nitric acid hno3 became smaller than 2 nh4 2so4 with deionized water was used to make a 1000 mg l ammonium stock solution whose ph with sulfuric acid h2so4 became smaller than 2 a 1000 mg l kmno4 stock solution was made from the deionized water and stored in a dark glass container 2 2 preparation of adsorbent greensand was purchased from safab 1 1 www safabco ir company of iran first the greensand was passed through grain sieves and the mesh no 30 particles with a diameter of 0 590 mm was selected for the entire project a specific amount of greensand was poured in the fluidized bed column and before beginning the filtration process the deionized water was pumped inside the column for 15 minutes to wash the adsorbent in order to prevent possible errors due to the existence of dust in the adsorbent 2 3 greensand characterization greensand was characterized by using x ray diffraction xrd equipment xrd philips pw1730 xrd analysis was carried out to identify the mineral composition and crystalline materials of the greensand patterns were collected every 0 05 over the range of 4 85 80 00 2θ with cu kα radiation the morphological structure of the greensand was obtained using a scanning electron microscope sem which was conducted in a tescan mira 3 2 4 instrumentation the residual concentrations of fe mn and nh4 were analyzed by uv visible spectrophotometer model dr5000 hach at λ 510 λ 560 and λ 425 nm respectively a pm45 model of pentax centrifugal pump was used to charge the water through the column the maximum flow rate of the pump was 2 40 cubic meters per hour 2 5 column studies the fluidized bed of the project included a glass column with a 26 mm diameter and a 500 mm height and two fabric meshes were used at the entrance and end of the column to prevent the greensand outflow and also it had a 220 liter polyethylene storage tank and a pm45 model of pentax centrifugal pump the schematic of the project column is shown in fig 1 2 5 1 fluidized bed studies breakthrough curves are required to achieve the removal capacities in fluidized beds breakthrough curves are usually expressed in the form of ct c0 ratio in time c0 and ct are cations concentrations mg l in inlet and outlet flows respectively in this study the breakthrough point tb was defined as ct c0 0 1 and the exhaustion point te was defined as ct c0 0 9 37 breakthrough curve is almost an s shaped curve that can be divided into three parts breakthrough curves have the form of a concave profile in the first part of the bed the form of linear profile in the center of the bed and the form of convex profile in the column outlet 38 the maximum removal capacity of column qtotal mg for the inlet concentration c0 mg l and the flow rate q ml min by integrating the plot of the removed concentration cad mg l in time min which is obtained by eq 1 is equal to 37 1 q t o t a l q a 1000 q 0 t t o t a l c a d d t q 0 t t o t a l c 0 c e d t where ttotal q and a are the total flow time min the volumetric flow rate ml min and the area under the breakthrough curve respectively the equilibrium column capacity mg g is obtained by eq 2 where m is the dry absorbent mass g 39 2 q e q q t o t a l m the total amount of iron manganese and ammonium ions are delivered to the column system m t o t a l mg is also achieved from eq 3 39 3 m t o t a l c 0 q t t o t a l 1000 the column performance is evaluated by the total removal percentages of iron manganese and ammonium y which are the ratios of the total removed ions in the column to the total amount of ions delivered to the column y is obtained from eq 4 39 4 y q t o t a l m t o t a l 100 2 5 2 minimum fluidization velocity one of the most important and essential parameters in the hydrodynamic examinations of a fluidized bed is minimum fluidization velocity this velocity is a bed transfer point from fixed form to the fluidized form 40 the parameters which have effects on the minimum fluidization velocity can be classified into three general categories these three categories include the particle specifications of the bed such as type or density the shape and size of bed particles the specifications of the working fluid such as the fluid density and viscosity and the geometrical specifications of the bed many studies have been carried out in this field by different researchers and different relations have been presented to obtain this velocity most of these relations have been derived from the experimental methods 41 levenspiel has proposed eq 5 to calculate the minimum fluidization velocity 42 5 u m f d p 3 ρ s ρ w g 150 μ ε m f 3 φ 2 1 ε m f r e p mf 20 where rep mf is particle reynolds number in a fluidized bed and the reynolds number is defined as 42 6 r e p m f d p ρ w u m f μ where in the equation 5 and 6 the minimum fluidization velocity is u m f cm s the diameter of greensand particles is d p cm the water density is ρ w g cm3 the greensand density is ρ s g cm3 the bed porosity is ε the particle shape factor is equal to φ and the fluid viscosity is μ g cm s in order to calculate the minimum required flow rate q m cm3 s eq 7 is used where a cm2 is the column cross section 7 q m a u m f the minimum fluidization velocity u m f cm s the minimum required flow rate q m cm3 s and r e p m f were calculated which have been given in table 1 2 6 column experiment inside the 220 liter storage tank 200 liters of aqueous solution with the initial concentrations of 5 5 and 4 mg l were made from the iron manganese and ammonium respectively in the entire process the temperature of the storage water was 25 1 c and the water ph was controlled from 7 to 8 two different bed heights of 12 and 19 cm of the greensand adsorbent equal to the adsorbent amount of 60 and 100 g were selected respectively two different flow rates which were more than the minimum fluidized flow rate the minimum required flow rate for the fluidization of the adsorbent inside the column has been represented in table 1 which is equal to 105 ml min 340 and 640 ml min were analyzed after washing the greensand for 15 minutes by deionized water inside the fixed bed column the considered flow rate was adjusted and the water flow was pumped into the bed from the bottom of the column the outlet water was sampled at determined times to investigate the remaining concentrations of iron manganese and ammonium at the next stage besides adding iron manganese and ammonium to the water of storage tank the potassium permanganate with the concentration of 10 mg l was added and after mixing the water the storage tank was left for 15 min so that the oxidation process could occur and then the adsorption process in the fluidized bed could start like the previous stage the conditions and experimental stages of this study have been listed in table 2 at the exhaustion time of the greensand bed the feed stream is usually stopped and kmno4 is used to regenerate the media the bed is backwashed by deionized water then 100 g of greensand is dunked in 2 g l kmno4 solution for 30 40 minutes 43 but the regeneration and backwash of greensand were not done in our study 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the xrd pattern of greensand is shown in fig 2 the xrd pattern indicated the presence of quartz diopside feldspar and pyrolusite the peak observed in the area 2θ around 29 30 represents diopside which has dominated the sample as can be noted from fig 3 the sem investigation of the greensand reveals the existence of micaceous structures surface which is very rough and porous the grains that have cleavage have probably been driven from a mineral such as coarse grained feldspars or mica 44 the sample appears to have a bet surface area and a mean pore diameter of 11 2 m2 g and 25 nm respectively 3 2 effect of bed height fig 4 shows the effect of bed height z cm on the breakthrough curves of iron manganese and ammonium in terms of the ratio of the outlet concentration to input c c0 versus the operating time t min compared with packed bed systems where the fluid flow can be loaded into the column in either an upward or downward flow direction the feed continuously enters from the bottom of the column in the fluidized beds providing the expansion of the bed substances inside the column the bed expansion depends on the physical specifications of the adsorbent the distributor design the superficial velocity and the feed viscosity 45 these experiments were analyzed with two different values 60 and 100 g of the greensand in the first experiment 60 g the fixed bed height was 12 cm and in fluidized state and after the expansion the bed height reached 16 cm in the second experiment 100 g the fixed bed height was 19 cm and in the fluidized bed state and after the expansion the bed height reached 24 cm as can be seen an increase in the adsorbent amount decreased the slope of the breakthrough curves because when the bed height increased the contact time increased which provided the further removal of iron manganese and ammonium in this case the mass transfer zone was wider and therefore increased the time of reaching the exhaustion time te min in the column 46 in our study the exhaustion time and the removal percentage of iron manganese and ammonium increased with an increase in the adsorbent amount totally because of the low removal of iron manganese and ammonium in these experiments in two different bed heights the breakthrough time tb min was not achieved but the exhaustion time of iron increased from 330 to 460 minutes manganese exhaustion time increased from 300 to 390 minutes and the increase of ammonium was from 360 to 450 minutes by increasing the adsorbent amount the contact time between the adsorbate and the adsorbent increased on the other hand the surface area of the adsorbent increased which provided more binding sites for the adsorbent 47 the removal rate of iron was higher than manganese and ammonium so the sudden increase in mn and nh4 uptake capacity with the increase of bed height was due to the increase in the contact time 48 table 3 represents the comparison between experiments 1 and 2 and by increasing the bed height the removal percentage of iron manganese and ammonium increased to 41 74 27 26 and 35 95 respectively the operating time of experiment 2 increased and therefore the adsorbent was regenerated or exchanged later consequently the height 19 cm 100 g was selected for experiment 3 in the similar condition the removal percentages of manganese were low 16 96 and 27 26 when compared with iron 40 62 and 41 74 this difference was ascribed to the effect of reductive dissolution of the greensand because the reductive dissolution reduces the mno2 coating of the greensand to mn ⅱ and oxidizes fe ⅱ to fe ⅲ this reaction leads to iron precipitation so the iron removal increases the reductive dissolution reaction of mno2 by fe ⅲ is 49 1 mno2 s 2fe2 4h mn2 2fe3 2h2o in fact the electron transfer reaction follows the adsorption of fe ⅱ to mno2 surface of the greensand then the reduced manganese and oxidized iron are released into the solution 49 red particular matter was seen during backwash it shows that any active site of mno2 was dissolved by reductive dissolution 50 however the rough character of the greensand presented good active sites for chemical adsorption 51 the removal mechanism for manganese was the adsorption of mn ii onto the mno2 surface which was accompanied by the release of h as shown in the following reaction 2 2 mn2 mno oh 2 s mno2mno s 2h service time corresponded to the effluent concentration of 0 3 mg l for iron 0 05 mg l for manganese and 1 5 mg l for ammonium were adopted according to the drinking water standards as it is shown in table 3 ammonium concentration decreased below the drinking water standard and the service time was 120 minutes 3 3 effect of flow rate fig 5 shows the effect of flow rate q ml min on the breakthrough curves of iron manganese and ammonium in terms of the ratio of outlet concentration to input c c0 versus the operating time t min in this experiment the bed height was 19 cm 100 g and two different operating flow rates of 340 and 640 ml min whose equivalent velocities have been listed in table 2 were investigated by increasing the flow rate from 340 ml min to 640 ml min the bed expansion increased from 24 cm to 27 cm the curves represent that an increase in the flow rate increased the slope of the breakthrough curves in other words for passing a fixed volume of solution through the column the contact time increased as the flow rate decreased and eventually the exhaustion time as well increased at low flow rates there is enough time for the diffusion of ions into the internal pores of the adsorbent through intra particle diffusion as a result the adsorbed molecules are trapped in the adsorption sites inside the adsorbent 39 in high flow rate the residence time of solute in the column was not long enough for the adsorption or ion exchange to reach the equilibrium therefore before reaching the equilibrium the solution left the bed 52 because of the low iron manganese and ammonium removal the breakthrough time tb min was not achieved in two different flow rates by increasing the flow rate the exhaustion point of iron decreased from 420 minutes to 180 minutes manganese exhaustion point decreased from 390 minutes to 150 minutes and the decrease of ammonium was from 330 minutes to 210 minutes therefore by increasing the inlet flow rate in addition to shortening the exhaustion time the removal percentage and the equilibrium column capacity also decrease table 4 demonstrates a comparison between experiments 2 and 3 by increasing the flow rate the removal percentage of iron manganese and ammonium adsorption decreased to 21 92 14 57 and 24 50 respectively the operating time of adsorption for iron decreased from 570 minutes to 300 minutes it was from 540 minutes to 330 minutes for manganese and from 450 minutes to 300 minutes for ammonium glauconite has a high percentage of potassium 5 9 5 and removing ammonium by glauconite is an ion exchange process 53 based on the selective order among the cations k nh4 na ammonium removal through the ion exchange of potassium is insignificant because the preference of greensand is k 54 so the low removal of ammonium was due to high potassium content of greensand and fewer na sites in greensand 53 in binary systems iron and manganese compete for the active sites of adsorbent this competition leads to decreasing the removal of both metals according to the reaction 1 manganese leaching from the column is an effect of reductive dissolution so iron treatment decreases the manganese removal of greensand capability 50 on the simultaneous removal of iron manganese and ammonium the presence of ammonium decreases iron and manganese removal when the feed ammonium concentration is more than 3 mg l 55 based on the results in this stage the flow rate 340 ml min was selected for experiments 4 and 5 3 4 effect of potassium permanganate potassium permanganate kmno4 as an oxidant is more expensive than chlorine and ozone but it is efficient for the removal of iron and manganese and requires much less investment and primary equipment in this method the oxidation time of iron and manganese is very low about 5 minutes however the dose of potassium permanganate should be carefully controlled and if a very low amount of potassium permanganate is used it will not oxidize all iron and manganese 56 if potassium permanganate solution is more than the amount required for the soluble iron and manganese greensand is automatically regenerated with the additional potassium permanganate theoretically 1 ppm potassium permanganate oxidizes 1 06 ppm soluble iron or 0 5 ppm soluble manganese but in sandy bed filters the amount of potassium permanganate required for the complete oxidation of soluble iron and manganese is always lower than the stoichiometric amount and the produced mno2 participates in the oxidation reaction 8 therefore 10 ppm potassium permanganate was added to the storage tank and after mixing the tank the flow rate 340 ml min entered the greensand bed column after 15 minutes this experiments were examined with two different bed heights of 12 and 19 cm in two experiments 4 and 5 fig 6 represents the breakthrough curves of iron manganese and ammonium in terms of the ratio of the outlet concentration to the input c c0 versus the operating time t with the parameter of bed height change and the addition of potassium permanganate the process times in both experiments 4 and 5 were longer than the previous experiments representing that the addition of potassium permanganate delayed the time to regenerate as well as the exchange time of the adsorbent the breakthrough time was achieved for both iron and manganese in both experiments but the breakthrough time was not still achieved for ammonium the exhaustion time increased for all three parameters of iron manganese and ammonium in both experiments the exhaustion times of iron manganese and ammonium were found to be 720 660 and 210 minutes in experiment 4 respectively and in experiment 5 960 900 and 360 minutes were reached respectively compared to experiments 1 and 2 the exhaustion time increased more than twice for iron and manganese and a little increase was observed for ammonium the slope of the breakthrough curves increased with the decrease of the bed height and the curves moved to the left consequently when the operating time increased the slope of the curves decreased the data from table 5 represents that by increasing the bed height the removal percentages of iron and manganese had a slight difference in both experiments 4 and 5 furthermore the removal percentage of ammonium increased from 17 43 to 36 48 these results indicate that by adding potassium permanganate the parameter of the bed height does not have a significant effect on the removal percentage of iron and manganese but this parameter is the same as the previous experiments for ammonium by increasing the bed height the operating time for iron increased from 960 minutes to 1200 minutes it was from 960 to 1320 minutes for manganese and from 360 to 510 minutes for ammonium in comparison with the previous experiments 1 2 3 adding potassium permanganate to the process increased the removal percentages of manganese potassium permanganate enhanced manganese removal in the same conditions from 16 96 27 26 to 41 52 42 00 respectively it was due to the oxidation of soluble mn2 by kmno4 which is illustrated in reaction 3 and a successive mno2 coating on the surface of greensand 5 50 3 3mn2 2 kmno4 2 h2o 5 mno2 2 k 4h it is clear that potassium permanganate is essential for manganese removal and without it adsorption may be the only mechanism for removing manganese in greensand bed 57 oxidation of fe2 using kmno4 is illustrated in reaction 4 5 4 3 fe2 kmno4 7 h2o mno2 3 fe oh 3 k 5 h in experiment 5 the concentrations of iron and manganese decreased below the drinking water standards at the bed height of 19 cm and the service times have been shown in table 5 3 4 1 effect of potassium permanganate on equilibrium column capacity the removal performance of the greensand with potassium permanganate for fe and mn differed from that of nh4 greensand with potassium permanganate effectively removed fe and mn and the concentrations reached below drinking water standard so in order to compare the experiments with and without potassium permanganate the equilibrium column capacity q e q for iron manganese and ammonium in experiments 1 and 2 were compared with experiments 4 and 5 in fig 6 two different bed heights were 12 and 19 cm and the flow rates were 340 ml min in all 4 experiments as observed in fig 7 the equilibrium column capacity of iron with the bed height 12 cm were 5 18 mg g in the experiment without potassium permanganate and 12 70 mg g in the experiment with potassium permanganate this value increased from 4 05 mg g to 9 70 mg g with the bed height 19 cm and as demonstrated in the curve the curve of experiments with potassium permanganate moved upward in the curve of manganese by adding potassium permanganate in the bed height 12 cm the equilibrium column capacity of manganese increased from 2 16 mg g to 11 29 mg g and in the bed height 19 cm this value increased from 2 50 mg g to 9 42 mg g the difference between the equilibrium column capacities in both experiments represents the effect of potassium permanganate on the removal of manganese from the water the ammonium equilibrium column capacities are observed in two experiments with and without potassium permanganate unlike the iron and manganese curves two curves are were close to each other and in the bed height 12 cm this value reached from 1 10 mg g to 1 42 mg g and in the bed height 19 cm it reached from 2 20 mg g to 2 53 mg g which indicated the ineffectiveness of potassium permanganate on the removal of ammonium from drinking water 4 conclusion the study indicated that the greensand without potassium permanganate demonstrated higher uptake capacities toward fe ions compared to mn ions the removal percentages of iron and manganese in the bed height of 19 cm were 41 74 27 26 respectively this difference was because of the reductive dissolution of mno2 by fe while adsorption is the dominant mechanism for iron manganese and ammonium removal by adding potassium permanganate the breakthrough times were achieved in both bed heights 12 and 19 cm for iron and manganese unlike ammonium the equilibrium column capacity for iron and manganese increased markedly and with the bed height of 12 cm these values for iron manganese and ammonium were 12 70 11 29 and 1 42 mg g respectively in addition adding potassium permanganate could reduce iron and manganese concentrations to levels lower than the drinking water standards however ammonium removal did not have any significant improvement with potassium permanganate ammonium concentration reached below the drinking water standards by increasing the bed height and potassium permanganate slightly increased its service time from 120 to 150 minutes potassium permanganate oxidized adsorbed metal ions on the greensand and caused precipitation so it could easily regenerate the greensand particles for more adsorption consequently the operating time of experiments 5 for iron and manganese increased from 570 and 540 to 1200 and1320 minutes the minimum fluidization velocity and bed expansion of the greensand were investigated the minimum fluidized velocity was 0 33 cm s while the diameter of greensand particles was dm 0 059 cm the fixed bed height of 19 cm increased from 24 cm to 27 cm in the fluidized state when the flow rate increased from 340 ml min to 640 ml min declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to

13718,natural minerals are used as sorbent in water treatment processes due to their high exchange and relatively low cost in this paper a pilot water treatment was conducted to explore the application of greensand in a fluidized bed column while the iron manganese and ammonium removal performances of two treatment processes including greensand filtration and potassium permanganate greensand filtration were evaluated the breakthrough curves were investigated to analyze the effect of variables such as bed height and inlet flow on the removal performance in addition to the physical properties of greensand the results showed that the effect of potassium permanganate on the outlet concentration of the fluidized bed was significant in terms of the breakthrough curves which led to the breakthrough points for iron and manganese it was found that adding potassium permanganate increased the equilibrium column capacity q e q from 5 18 mg g and 2 16 mg g to 12 70 mg g and 11 29 mg g for iron and manganese respectively so fe and mn outlet concentrations reached under the admissible maximum concentration of drinking water in the experiments without kmno4 iron removal was found to be caused by reductive dissolution and adsorption while adsorption was the only mechanism for manganese removal the findings indicated that ammonium removal was minimally influenced by kmno4 and ion exchange was the main mechanism for ammonium removal keywords adsorption iron manganese ammonium fluidized bed greensand 1 introduction heavy metals are not biodegradable and are accumulated in the tissues of living creatures and therefore they enter food chains and are adsorbed into human body for this reason they are distinguished from other toxic contaminants even a small amount of heavy metals can cause severe neurological or physiological injuries to human body 1 groundwater which is an important source of drinking water percolates through soil and rocks then some minerals are dissolved into water 2 consequently it generally includes iron and manganese as divalent ions 3 numerous reports on the presence of iron and manganese in potable groundwater in different countries including canada 4 egypt 5 and benin 6 have been presented rain surface and waste water filtration dissolving minerals from soil increase iron and manganese in groundwater sources 7 manganese can be present as a result of both natural sources and human activities such as mining and landfill leaching 8 the presence of iron is because of the corrosion of iron pipes during groundwater extraction and distribution in addition to industrial origins such as mining and iron and steel industry 7 9 ammonia nitrogen flows from municipal industrial and agricultural wastewater sites and in wastewater treatment it is produced by the enzymatic breakdown of urea proteins and other nitrogen containing materials this ammonia finally discharges into water sources 10 11 due to the extreme use of fertilizers in agriculture and animal wastes from animal farms there is a growth in nitrogen compounds in surface and ground water sources 12 nitrogen compounds are essential to all forms of living life but it is undesirable in drinking water because it is the main cause of eutrophication of water body 13 14 the presence of iron in water at high concentrations causes a reddish color taste and odor and also insoluble iron can be deposited on some surfaces such as clothing dishes glasses and water pipes the color created by the iron on clothing and dishes is not cleaned by soap and detergents and using bleaches can intensify the color iron deposition on the walls of water supply pipes decreases pressure and increases the cost of pumping and water distribution 7 the existence of manganese in water can cause hallucination forgetfulness and damage to nerves by influencing respiratory system and brain it can also lead to parkinson embolism and bronchitis and manganese in water can create purple black spots on surface 1 15 ammonium is a concern because of its high capacity for odor production negative effects on water quality and human health if it is consumed more than the specified amount it will have toxic and dangerous effects on human health 16 17 the form of nitrogen compounds in aqueous solutions is usually ammonium ion nh4 13 at ph greater than 8 nh4 ion is converted into nh3 and at very low ph h3o ions compete with nh4 ions for active sites in adsorbents and the amount of ammonium adsorption at ph smaller than 5 is low 18 19 therefore 5 ph 8 is the best range for ammonium adsorption based on world health organization the highest authorized standard values for iron manganese and ammonia in drinking water are 0 30 0 05 and 1 50 mg l ppm respectively 7 solid liquid fluidized beds have been widely used in process industries such as particle classification by size and density adsorption catalyst growth ion exchange catalytic breakage heat exchangers of automated cleaning liquid fluidized bed extraction functions and wastewater treatments 20 one of the advantages of fluidized beds compared to fixed beds is the fact that the intraparticle mass transfer resistance in fluidized beds is much lower it is easy to construct and run on fluidized beds and it is appropriate for the adsorption of soluble particles 21 unlike other beds the upward flow of liquid in fluidized beds produces uniform liquid distribution which eliminates or at least minimizes any tendency toward channeling or bulk circulation fluidized bed column is also used over a wide range of flow rates so the selection of optimum contact time or residence time of fluid and solid particles is possible 20 the most important uses of fluidized beds are backwashing downflow filters these kinds of filtrations need periodic backwashing to remove impurities which have filled the bed and may cause the clogging of the filter media 22 some problems regarding fixed and packed beds were reported such as slow reaction kinetics blocking and pore cementation of different media by metal oxide precipitates 23 but ammonium and metals removal in fluidized bed which has a continuous backwashing eliminates the mentioned problems especially in experiments with potassium permanganate in fact potassium permanganate causes not only the precipitation of adsorbed metal ions and removing them from sand particles but also the regeneration of greensand particles for more adsorption adsorption as a more practical technology is used to remove contaminants from natural water compared to other technologies such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration and electrodialysis 24 although there were different types of adsorbents greensand was used in this project greensand is a member of a group of minerals called illite which is a member of a wider mineral group called phyllosilicates whose specification is a continuous network of silicon tetrahedral the approximate formula of glauconite is k na fe3 al fe2 mg 2 si al 4o10 oh 2 actually greensand consists of a manganese oxide mnox coating on glauconite which is activated by potassium permanganate kmno4 25 manganese oxides are generally represented with the chemical formula of mnox because of multiple valance states of mn ions that may be exhibited in coating 26 it is a strong oxidant for iron and manganese on sand grains used as a filter to remove iron and manganese for many years when the oxidation capacity of the bed is low the greensand bed is regenerated by the help of potassium permanganate and the adsorbent enters the circuit these beds are suitable for water with high concentrations of iron and bicarbonate but if there are organic materials nitrogen or hydrogen sulfide in water the greensand filter should be regenerated after a short time 27 there are different physical configurations such as batch process continuous mixing tank fixed bed and fluidized bed for the adsorption process in the meantime the fluidized bed operations have the advantage that particles can move continuously with effective fluid mixing but there is also erosion and corrosion of particles in fluidized bed operations designing an excellent fluidized bed adsorption column needs the prediction of outlet concentrations time specifications and breakthrough curves 28 different sizes of sand particles present different behaviors and directly affect hydrodynamics of fluidized beds so the physical properties of the media such as density particle size and the surface characteristics of greensand influence the result of the fluidization 29 chen et al 2005 analyzed a solid liquid fluidized bed with pure iron adsorbent for nitrate removal the effectiveness of nitrate removal increased by increasing the amount of adsorbent the exhaustion point test was performed and the nitrate removal efficiency was about 85 90 for 25 hours 23 wang et al 2007 studied the removal of low concentration ammonia in water using na mordenite this study demonstrated that ammonia removal was not influenced by operating temperature the coexistence of ca2 and mg2 significantly decreased ammonia removal while the presence of coexistent cations such as na and k had little influence on ammonia uptake 30 mendieta et al 2009 investigated the removal of iron and manganese from aqueous solutions on the mexican clinoptilolite rich tuff in single and binary systems it was found that the maximum iron and manganese removal was at ph 6 and the removal of iron in single systems was higher than manganese 31 barlokova et al 2010 worked on the removal of iron and manganese from drinking water by natural adsorbents the aim of their paper was to compare activated natural zeolite clinoptilolite with activated filtration sand and birm the results showed that klinopur mn was a cost effective adsorbent suitable for the removal of iron and manganese moreover the amount of dissolved oxygen in the solution was one of the most important criteria for removal efficiency 32 huang et al 2010 studied ammonium removal from aqueous solutions by zeolite they investigated the presence of cations and anions on ammonium removal by conducting some batch experiments it was achieved that the value of the adsorbed ammonium decreased by the presence of cations in the solution the selectivity order for these competitive cations was na k ca2 mg2 33 kulkarni et al 2013 studied the adsorption of phenol from wastewater in fluidized bed using activated carbon as an adsorbent it was observed that the saturation percentage of adsorbent increased by increasing the inlet concentration also increasing the flow rate resulted in a better adsorption 34 stylianou et al 2015 investigated the removal efficiency of heavy metals using natural clinoptilolite in fixed and fluidized bed reactors it was concluded that by using the same relative volumetric flow rate fixed bed experiments had better results and in comparison to fixed bed the breakthrough points in fluidized bed were shifted to the left 35 hu et al 2019 investigated several treatment processes on manganese and arsenic removal from drinking water during two months of treatments it was observed that the highest removal of arsenic was 68 5 and manganese could be completely removed the process included ozonation and greensand filtration and finally the water was passed through an iron based granular sorbent 36 the objective of this study was to investigate the performance of a fluidized bed column with a greensand adsorbent for removing iron manganese and ammonium from drinking water the breakthrough studies were performed to evaluate the adsorbent performance in continuous fluidized bed operations by changing the operating conditions such as the inlet flow rate and the bed height the effect of adding potassium permanganate as an oxidant before the entrance of water to the bed was also evaluated in the breakthrough curves the adsorbent particles diameter was equal to 0 590 mm and the ph of water ranged from 7 to 8 in all experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the metal salts of feso4 7h2o and mnso4 h2o individually with deionized water were used to make a 1000 mg l iron and manganese stock solution and the ph of solution with 65 nitric acid hno3 became smaller than 2 nh4 2so4 with deionized water was used to make a 1000 mg l ammonium stock solution whose ph with sulfuric acid h2so4 became smaller than 2 a 1000 mg l kmno4 stock solution was made from the deionized water and stored in a dark glass container 2 2 preparation of adsorbent greensand was purchased from safab 1 1 www safabco ir company of iran first the greensand was passed through grain sieves and the mesh no 30 particles with a diameter of 0 590 mm was selected for the entire project a specific amount of greensand was poured in the fluidized bed column and before beginning the filtration process the deionized water was pumped inside the column for 15 minutes to wash the adsorbent in order to prevent possible errors due to the existence of dust in the adsorbent 2 3 greensand characterization greensand was characterized by using x ray diffraction xrd equipment xrd philips pw1730 xrd analysis was carried out to identify the mineral composition and crystalline materials of the greensand patterns were collected every 0 05 over the range of 4 85 80 00 2θ with cu kα radiation the morphological structure of the greensand was obtained using a scanning electron microscope sem which was conducted in a tescan mira 3 2 4 instrumentation the residual concentrations of fe mn and nh4 were analyzed by uv visible spectrophotometer model dr5000 hach at λ 510 λ 560 and λ 425 nm respectively a pm45 model of pentax centrifugal pump was used to charge the water through the column the maximum flow rate of the pump was 2 40 cubic meters per hour 2 5 column studies the fluidized bed of the project included a glass column with a 26 mm diameter and a 500 mm height and two fabric meshes were used at the entrance and end of the column to prevent the greensand outflow and also it had a 220 liter polyethylene storage tank and a pm45 model of pentax centrifugal pump the schematic of the project column is shown in fig 1 2 5 1 fluidized bed studies breakthrough curves are required to achieve the removal capacities in fluidized beds breakthrough curves are usually expressed in the form of ct c0 ratio in time c0 and ct are cations concentrations mg l in inlet and outlet flows respectively in this study the breakthrough point tb was defined as ct c0 0 1 and the exhaustion point te was defined as ct c0 0 9 37 breakthrough curve is almost an s shaped curve that can be divided into three parts breakthrough curves have the form of a concave profile in the first part of the bed the form of linear profile in the center of the bed and the form of convex profile in the column outlet 38 the maximum removal capacity of column qtotal mg for the inlet concentration c0 mg l and the flow rate q ml min by integrating the plot of the removed concentration cad mg l in time min which is obtained by eq 1 is equal to 37 1 q t o t a l q a 1000 q 0 t t o t a l c a d d t q 0 t t o t a l c 0 c e d t where ttotal q and a are the total flow time min the volumetric flow rate ml min and the area under the breakthrough curve respectively the equilibrium column capacity mg g is obtained by eq 2 where m is the dry absorbent mass g 39 2 q e q q t o t a l m the total amount of iron manganese and ammonium ions are delivered to the column system m t o t a l mg is also achieved from eq 3 39 3 m t o t a l c 0 q t t o t a l 1000 the column performance is evaluated by the total removal percentages of iron manganese and ammonium y which are the ratios of the total removed ions in the column to the total amount of ions delivered to the column y is obtained from eq 4 39 4 y q t o t a l m t o t a l 100 2 5 2 minimum fluidization velocity one of the most important and essential parameters in the hydrodynamic examinations of a fluidized bed is minimum fluidization velocity this velocity is a bed transfer point from fixed form to the fluidized form 40 the parameters which have effects on the minimum fluidization velocity can be classified into three general categories these three categories include the particle specifications of the bed such as type or density the shape and size of bed particles the specifications of the working fluid such as the fluid density and viscosity and the geometrical specifications of the bed many studies have been carried out in this field by different researchers and different relations have been presented to obtain this velocity most of these relations have been derived from the experimental methods 41 levenspiel has proposed eq 5 to calculate the minimum fluidization velocity 42 5 u m f d p 3 ρ s ρ w g 150 μ ε m f 3 φ 2 1 ε m f r e p mf 20 where rep mf is particle reynolds number in a fluidized bed and the reynolds number is defined as 42 6 r e p m f d p ρ w u m f μ where in the equation 5 and 6 the minimum fluidization velocity is u m f cm s the diameter of greensand particles is d p cm the water density is ρ w g cm3 the greensand density is ρ s g cm3 the bed porosity is ε the particle shape factor is equal to φ and the fluid viscosity is μ g cm s in order to calculate the minimum required flow rate q m cm3 s eq 7 is used where a cm2 is the column cross section 7 q m a u m f the minimum fluidization velocity u m f cm s the minimum required flow rate q m cm3 s and r e p m f were calculated which have been given in table 1 2 6 column experiment inside the 220 liter storage tank 200 liters of aqueous solution with the initial concentrations of 5 5 and 4 mg l were made from the iron manganese and ammonium respectively in the entire process the temperature of the storage water was 25 1 c and the water ph was controlled from 7 to 8 two different bed heights of 12 and 19 cm of the greensand adsorbent equal to the adsorbent amount of 60 and 100 g were selected respectively two different flow rates which were more than the minimum fluidized flow rate the minimum required flow rate for the fluidization of the adsorbent inside the column has been represented in table 1 which is equal to 105 ml min 340 and 640 ml min were analyzed after washing the greensand for 15 minutes by deionized water inside the fixed bed column the considered flow rate was adjusted and the water flow was pumped into the bed from the bottom of the column the outlet water was sampled at determined times to investigate the remaining concentrations of iron manganese and ammonium at the next stage besides adding iron manganese and ammonium to the water of storage tank the potassium permanganate with the concentration of 10 mg l was added and after mixing the water the storage tank was left for 15 min so that the oxidation process could occur and then the adsorption process in the fluidized bed could start like the previous stage the conditions and experimental stages of this study have been listed in table 2 at the exhaustion time of the greensand bed the feed stream is usually stopped and kmno4 is used to regenerate the media the bed is backwashed by deionized water then 100 g of greensand is dunked in 2 g l kmno4 solution for 30 40 minutes 43 but the regeneration and backwash of greensand were not done in our study 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the xrd pattern of greensand is shown in fig 2 the xrd pattern indicated the presence of quartz diopside feldspar and pyrolusite the peak observed in the area 2θ around 29 30 represents diopside which has dominated the sample as can be noted from fig 3 the sem investigation of the greensand reveals the existence of micaceous structures surface which is very rough and porous the grains that have cleavage have probably been driven from a mineral such as coarse grained feldspars or mica 44 the sample appears to have a bet surface area and a mean pore diameter of 11 2 m2 g and 25 nm respectively 3 2 effect of bed height fig 4 shows the effect of bed height z cm on the breakthrough curves of iron manganese and ammonium in terms of the ratio of the outlet concentration to input c c0 versus the operating time t min compared with packed bed systems where the fluid flow can be loaded into the column in either an upward or downward flow direction the feed continuously enters from the bottom of the column in the fluidized beds providing the expansion of the bed substances inside the column the bed expansion depends on the physical specifications of the adsorbent the distributor design the superficial velocity and the feed viscosity 45 these experiments were analyzed with two different values 60 and 100 g of the greensand in the first experiment 60 g the fixed bed height was 12 cm and in fluidized state and after the expansion the bed height reached 16 cm in the second experiment 100 g the fixed bed height was 19 cm and in the fluidized bed state and after the expansion the bed height reached 24 cm as can be seen an increase in the adsorbent amount decreased the slope of the breakthrough curves because when the bed height increased the contact time increased which provided the further removal of iron manganese and ammonium in this case the mass transfer zone was wider and therefore increased the time of reaching the exhaustion time te min in the column 46 in our study the exhaustion time and the removal percentage of iron manganese and ammonium increased with an increase in the adsorbent amount totally because of the low removal of iron manganese and ammonium in these experiments in two different bed heights the breakthrough time tb min was not achieved but the exhaustion time of iron increased from 330 to 460 minutes manganese exhaustion time increased from 300 to 390 minutes and the increase of ammonium was from 360 to 450 minutes by increasing the adsorbent amount the contact time between the adsorbate and the adsorbent increased on the other hand the surface area of the adsorbent increased which provided more binding sites for the adsorbent 47 the removal rate of iron was higher than manganese and ammonium so the sudden increase in mn and nh4 uptake capacity with the increase of bed height was due to the increase in the contact time 48 table 3 represents the comparison between experiments 1 and 2 and by increasing the bed height the removal percentage of iron manganese and ammonium increased to 41 74 27 26 and 35 95 respectively the operating time of experiment 2 increased and therefore the adsorbent was regenerated or exchanged later consequently the height 19 cm 100 g was selected for experiment 3 in the similar condition the removal percentages of manganese were low 16 96 and 27 26 when compared with iron 40 62 and 41 74 this difference was ascribed to the effect of reductive dissolution of the greensand because the reductive dissolution reduces the mno2 coating of the greensand to mn ⅱ and oxidizes fe ⅱ to fe ⅲ this reaction leads to iron precipitation so the iron removal increases the reductive dissolution reaction of mno2 by fe ⅲ is 49 1 mno2 s 2fe2 4h mn2 2fe3 2h2o in fact the electron transfer reaction follows the adsorption of fe ⅱ to mno2 surface of the greensand then the reduced manganese and oxidized iron are released into the solution 49 red particular matter was seen during backwash it shows that any active site of mno2 was dissolved by reductive dissolution 50 however the rough character of the greensand presented good active sites for chemical adsorption 51 the removal mechanism for manganese was the adsorption of mn ii onto the mno2 surface which was accompanied by the release of h as shown in the following reaction 2 2 mn2 mno oh 2 s mno2mno s 2h service time corresponded to the effluent concentration of 0 3 mg l for iron 0 05 mg l for manganese and 1 5 mg l for ammonium were adopted according to the drinking water standards as it is shown in table 3 ammonium concentration decreased below the drinking water standard and the service time was 120 minutes 3 3 effect of flow rate fig 5 shows the effect of flow rate q ml min on the breakthrough curves of iron manganese and ammonium in terms of the ratio of outlet concentration to input c c0 versus the operating time t min in this experiment the bed height was 19 cm 100 g and two different operating flow rates of 340 and 640 ml min whose equivalent velocities have been listed in table 2 were investigated by increasing the flow rate from 340 ml min to 640 ml min the bed expansion increased from 24 cm to 27 cm the curves represent that an increase in the flow rate increased the slope of the breakthrough curves in other words for passing a fixed volume of solution through the column the contact time increased as the flow rate decreased and eventually the exhaustion time as well increased at low flow rates there is enough time for the diffusion of ions into the internal pores of the adsorbent through intra particle diffusion as a result the adsorbed molecules are trapped in the adsorption sites inside the adsorbent 39 in high flow rate the residence time of solute in the column was not long enough for the adsorption or ion exchange to reach the equilibrium therefore before reaching the equilibrium the solution left the bed 52 because of the low iron manganese and ammonium removal the breakthrough time tb min was not achieved in two different flow rates by increasing the flow rate the exhaustion point of iron decreased from 420 minutes to 180 minutes manganese exhaustion point decreased from 390 minutes to 150 minutes and the decrease of ammonium was from 330 minutes to 210 minutes therefore by increasing the inlet flow rate in addition to shortening the exhaustion time the removal percentage and the equilibrium column capacity also decrease table 4 demonstrates a comparison between experiments 2 and 3 by increasing the flow rate the removal percentage of iron manganese and ammonium adsorption decreased to 21 92 14 57 and 24 50 respectively the operating time of adsorption for iron decreased from 570 minutes to 300 minutes it was from 540 minutes to 330 minutes for manganese and from 450 minutes to 300 minutes for ammonium glauconite has a high percentage of potassium 5 9 5 and removing ammonium by glauconite is an ion exchange process 53 based on the selective order among the cations k nh4 na ammonium removal through the ion exchange of potassium is insignificant because the preference of greensand is k 54 so the low removal of ammonium was due to high potassium content of greensand and fewer na sites in greensand 53 in binary systems iron and manganese compete for the active sites of adsorbent this competition leads to decreasing the removal of both metals according to the reaction 1 manganese leaching from the column is an effect of reductive dissolution so iron treatment decreases the manganese removal of greensand capability 50 on the simultaneous removal of iron manganese and ammonium the presence of ammonium decreases iron and manganese removal when the feed ammonium concentration is more than 3 mg l 55 based on the results in this stage the flow rate 340 ml min was selected for experiments 4 and 5 3 4 effect of potassium permanganate potassium permanganate kmno4 as an oxidant is more expensive than chlorine and ozone but it is efficient for the removal of iron and manganese and requires much less investment and primary equipment in this method the oxidation time of iron and manganese is very low about 5 minutes however the dose of potassium permanganate should be carefully controlled and if a very low amount of potassium permanganate is used it will not oxidize all iron and manganese 56 if potassium permanganate solution is more than the amount required for the soluble iron and manganese greensand is automatically regenerated with the additional potassium permanganate theoretically 1 ppm potassium permanganate oxidizes 1 06 ppm soluble iron or 0 5 ppm soluble manganese but in sandy bed filters the amount of potassium permanganate required for the complete oxidation of soluble iron and manganese is always lower than the stoichiometric amount and the produced mno2 participates in the oxidation reaction 8 therefore 10 ppm potassium permanganate was added to the storage tank and after mixing the tank the flow rate 340 ml min entered the greensand bed column after 15 minutes this experiments were examined with two different bed heights of 12 and 19 cm in two experiments 4 and 5 fig 6 represents the breakthrough curves of iron manganese and ammonium in terms of the ratio of the outlet concentration to the input c c0 versus the operating time t with the parameter of bed height change and the addition of potassium permanganate the process times in both experiments 4 and 5 were longer than the previous experiments representing that the addition of potassium permanganate delayed the time to regenerate as well as the exchange time of the adsorbent the breakthrough time was achieved for both iron and manganese in both experiments but the breakthrough time was not still achieved for ammonium the exhaustion time increased for all three parameters of iron manganese and ammonium in both experiments the exhaustion times of iron manganese and ammonium were found to be 720 660 and 210 minutes in experiment 4 respectively and in experiment 5 960 900 and 360 minutes were reached respectively compared to experiments 1 and 2 the exhaustion time increased more than twice for iron and manganese and a little increase was observed for ammonium the slope of the breakthrough curves increased with the decrease of the bed height and the curves moved to the left consequently when the operating time increased the slope of the curves decreased the data from table 5 represents that by increasing the bed height the removal percentages of iron and manganese had a slight difference in both experiments 4 and 5 furthermore the removal percentage of ammonium increased from 17 43 to 36 48 these results indicate that by adding potassium permanganate the parameter of the bed height does not have a significant effect on the removal percentage of iron and manganese but this parameter is the same as the previous experiments for ammonium by increasing the bed height the operating time for iron increased from 960 minutes to 1200 minutes it was from 960 to 1320 minutes for manganese and from 360 to 510 minutes for ammonium in comparison with the previous experiments 1 2 3 adding potassium permanganate to the process increased the removal percentages of manganese potassium permanganate enhanced manganese removal in the same conditions from 16 96 27 26 to 41 52 42 00 respectively it was due to the oxidation of soluble mn2 by kmno4 which is illustrated in reaction 3 and a successive mno2 coating on the surface of greensand 5 50 3 3mn2 2 kmno4 2 h2o 5 mno2 2 k 4h it is clear that potassium permanganate is essential for manganese removal and without it adsorption may be the only mechanism for removing manganese in greensand bed 57 oxidation of fe2 using kmno4 is illustrated in reaction 4 5 4 3 fe2 kmno4 7 h2o mno2 3 fe oh 3 k 5 h in experiment 5 the concentrations of iron and manganese decreased below the drinking water standards at the bed height of 19 cm and the service times have been shown in table 5 3 4 1 effect of potassium permanganate on equilibrium column capacity the removal performance of the greensand with potassium permanganate for fe and mn differed from that of nh4 greensand with potassium permanganate effectively removed fe and mn and the concentrations reached below drinking water standard so in order to compare the experiments with and without potassium permanganate the equilibrium column capacity q e q for iron manganese and ammonium in experiments 1 and 2 were compared with experiments 4 and 5 in fig 6 two different bed heights were 12 and 19 cm and the flow rates were 340 ml min in all 4 experiments as observed in fig 7 the equilibrium column capacity of iron with the bed height 12 cm were 5 18 mg g in the experiment without potassium permanganate and 12 70 mg g in the experiment with potassium permanganate this value increased from 4 05 mg g to 9 70 mg g with the bed height 19 cm and as demonstrated in the curve the curve of experiments with potassium permanganate moved upward in the curve of manganese by adding potassium permanganate in the bed height 12 cm the equilibrium column capacity of manganese increased from 2 16 mg g to 11 29 mg g and in the bed height 19 cm this value increased from 2 50 mg g to 9 42 mg g the difference between the equilibrium column capacities in both experiments represents the effect of potassium permanganate on the removal of manganese from the water the ammonium equilibrium column capacities are observed in two experiments with and without potassium permanganate unlike the iron and manganese curves two curves are were close to each other and in the bed height 12 cm this value reached from 1 10 mg g to 1 42 mg g and in the bed height 19 cm it reached from 2 20 mg g to 2 53 mg g which indicated the ineffectiveness of potassium permanganate on the removal of ammonium from drinking water 4 conclusion the study indicated that the greensand without potassium permanganate demonstrated higher uptake capacities toward fe ions compared to mn ions the removal percentages of iron and manganese in the bed height of 19 cm were 41 74 27 26 respectively this difference was because of the reductive dissolution of mno2 by fe while adsorption is the dominant mechanism for iron manganese and ammonium removal by adding potassium permanganate the breakthrough times were achieved in both bed heights 12 and 19 cm for iron and manganese unlike ammonium the equilibrium column capacity for iron and manganese increased markedly and with the bed height of 12 cm these values for iron manganese and ammonium were 12 70 11 29 and 1 42 mg g respectively in addition adding potassium permanganate could reduce iron and manganese concentrations to levels lower than the drinking water standards however ammonium removal did not have any significant improvement with potassium permanganate ammonium concentration reached below the drinking water standards by increasing the bed height and potassium permanganate slightly increased its service time from 120 to 150 minutes potassium permanganate oxidized adsorbed metal ions on the greensand and caused precipitation so it could easily regenerate the greensand particles for more adsorption consequently the operating time of experiments 5 for iron and manganese increased from 570 and 540 to 1200 and1320 minutes the minimum fluidization velocity and bed expansion of the greensand were investigated the minimum fluidized velocity was 0 33 cm s while the diameter of greensand particles was dm 0 059 cm the fixed bed height of 19 cm increased from 24 cm to 27 cm in the fluidized state when the flow rate increased from 340 ml min to 640 ml min declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to

13719,industrial and manufacturing processes are major responsible for water pollution which has many environmental and health consequences the development of efficient green and eco friendly photocatalysis process to treat wastewater containing organic contaminants is highly desirable to solve significant water pollution problems herein the photoreactivity of alkaline based tio2 nanotubes tnts was investigated to catalyze the decomposition of green oxidants namely ferric chloride fecl3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to harvest free hydroxyl radicals oh and finally its significance for the remediation of phenol in visible light irradiation to our information this study first reported that alkaline based tnts photocatalyst could successfully activate felc3 and h2o2 and reduced phenol concentration up to 97 63 tnts were prepared via a hydrothermal process in an alkaline environment at 180 c for 24 h and characterized through xrd tem bet surface area drs and ftir analysis in adsorption mechanism pseudo first order and type 1 pseudo second order kinetics were proved as best owing to an excellent correlation between experimental and theoretical outcomes and highest r2 up to 0 997 langmuir and freundlich isotherms were more appropriate models due to their highest r2 up to 0 994 several thermodynamic parameters as enthalpy 53 84 kj mol entropy 173 87 kj mol k gibbs free energy 51 76 to 58 71 kj mol and activation energy 22 17 kj mol were recommended that phenol adsorption method is favourable and spontaneous in nature the rising temperature was more suitable for phenol removal onto alkaline based tnts keywords tio2 nanotubes hydrothermal process green oxidants photocatalysis adsorption mechanism 1 introduction in the last few years many artificial organic compounds have not been decomposed due to the remarkable development of the industry these compounds have a complex structure and are not easily degraded through microorganisms 1 when released they showed an important influence over the atmosphere phenolic compounds are greatly manufactured synthetically and utilized for the development of abundant products for different agricultural industrial and commercial applications it is utilized in pesticides paints petroleum refining resins textile pharmaceutical pulp and paper manufacturing industries 2 over a period these reliable and harmful chemicals collect in the edible materials and ultimately arrive into the body causing serious health problems such as cancer and endangering public health 3 an appropriate way to transform organic pollutants into harmless species is photocatalytic degradation and adsorption with low energy consumption 1 adsorption is known to be more favorable removal process due to simple and economical operation 4 this process can provide a better understanding of adsorption mechanisms through modeling 5 semiconductor nanomaterials are a promising option for eco friendly and low cost remediation systems in which chemicals energy sources and catalysts are non toxic economical and produce no secondary product compare to other semiconductors tio2 acts as a promising photocatalyst used in the photocatalysis system due to its chemical and biological inertness economical and long term stability against chemical and photo corrosion 5 7 it may serve as an ideal material in biological and medical science its biological properties are responsible for uv protection applications it is also successfully used for dental orthopedic and osteosynthesis applications 8 however its photocatalytic activity is intrinsically lower due to the limited specific surface area nevertheless the photogenerated electrons and holes in tio2 tend to a reunion thereby restraining remediation performance therefore it is highly necessary to develop a suitable photocatalytic degradation system to prevent the recombination rate of electrons and holes by modifying tio2 into other well crystalline morphology 1 9 kasuga with co workers have been conducting extensive research on tio2 nanotubes tnts since its discovery and inception in 1998 10 alkaline based hydrothermal template assisted and anodizing synthetic routes have considered as general approaches for the development of tnts hydrothermal preparation is a simple and low cost method and it is said that mass production is easy by this method tnts have been reported to expose exclusive consolidation of physiological and structural characteristics for example effective electronic conductivity with relatively higher surface area and aspect ratio 6 several efforts have been considered for understanding the mechanism of tnts formation during the hydrothermal treatment optimizing manufacturing conditions and studying the properties of tnts for the remediation of different organic pollutants through adsorption and photocatalysis 6 11 12 in most of the studies alkaline based tnts have been widely inspected for maximum photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue mb based on different organized parameters such as synthesis heating acid washing concentrations and calcination temperature while the adsorption studies have used for understanding the adsorption mechanism of mb through kinetics and isotherms modeling 10 13 16 for example shiping et al reported excellent adsorption and photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts for acid orange 7 dye in aqueous solution 6 ramin et al tested alkaline based tnts as a competent and economical adsorbent for the adsorption of basic violet 2 dye up to 75 63 from aqueous suspension 17 asma with co authors evaluated the photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts for the degradation of formic acid and adsorption studies used to understand the removal mechanism through kinetics and isotherms modeling 18 in another study daniela with co workers reported much higher photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts for the removal of rhodamine b dye up to 96 9 depending upon the synthesis temperature 19 similarly leonardo et al evaluated the photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts for indigo carmine dye with a maximum removal efficiency of 90 after 10 photocatalytic cycles 20 according to the above literature based information it can be analyzed that alkaline based tnts showed different removal behavior for different pollutants additionally the reconsolidation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes could be further abated through the addition of suitable green oxidants to generate more oh radicals and superoxide radicals o2 in photocatalysis system ultimately these powerful and stable radicals successfully destroy organic compounds into harmless carbon dioxide and water species by accepting the electrons 1 according to literature photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants has been successfully increased by the addition of several oxidizing agents as electrons acceptor namely fecl3 9 sodium nitrite nano2 21 h2o2 3 9 22 iron salt iii 23 persulphate ions and sodium carbonate 24 peroxomonosulfate and peroxodisulfate 25 they have a showed powerful capacity to adsorb the pollutant molecules and those occupied near to photocatalyst surface 23 their results revealed that they have a beneficial effect over the degradation rate for the removal of several pollutants the primary mechanism is the formation of oh and o2 radicals and the addition of oxidants can strongly prevent the recombination of electrons and holes thereby the oh and o2 radicals can react rapidly with most of the organic pollutant molecules and degraded into carbon dioxide and water 9 26 several studies revealed that fecl3 and h2o2 have also a great deal of influence over the photocatalysis system for the development of extra oh radicals which have caused an increasing attraction in recent years 9 27 however few studies have been reported for photocatalytic degradation of phenol under the influence of h2o2 with pure tio2 photocatalyst under uv irradiation and proved as the beneficial oxidant 26 28 30 nevertheless as far as we know that there is no research has done to investigate the influence of fecl3 and h2o2 for the destruction of essential compounds especially phenol in adsorption and photocatalysis mediated with alkaline based tnts photocatalyst which represents the novelty of present work the combined use of green oxidants based adsorption and photocatalysis systems could successfully enhance removal capabilities furthermore adsorption of phenol via alkaline based tnts can provide better understanding through kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics modeling in the present research anatase tnts were prepared according to literature via a simple hydrothermal process in the presence of an alkaline environment at 180 c for 24 h the as developed tnts were characterized through xrd tem bet surface area drs and ftir analysis phenol was used as a model pollutant for photocatalysis and adsorption studies fecl3 and h2o2 were introduced in the photocatalysis and adsorption systems along alkaline based tnts to produce extra oh and o2 radicals that would be more answerable to enhance the removal activities 2 experimental details 2 1 synthesis of alkaline based tnts all chemicals were procured from sigma aldrich malaysia commercially available tio2 p25 nanopowders having rutile 20 anatase 80 specific surface area 49 16 m2 g average particle size 21 nm and purity 99 5 the synthetic procedure was adopted according to past studies 15 anatase tnts were produced through a hydrothermal synthetic approach in which 1 0 g of tio2 p 25 was dropped into 10 m naoh with a volume of 10 ml under stirring it was shifted into a 50 ml autoclave of teflon lined the autoclave was put at 453 k for 24 h it was then cooled down to room temperature the obtained white slurry was washed with dilute acid and distilled water the finished sample was dried at 353 k for 4 h and then calcined at 523 k for 6 h 2 2 characterization of alkaline based tnts the crystalline structures of alkaline based tnts were characterized by x ray diffraction model bruker d8 worked through radiation of cu kα current of 40 milliamperes wavelength of 0 154056 nanometers and voltage of 40 kilovoltages the data was received ranging from 20 to 80 scanning with 4 min over 2θ values the morphology of alkaline based tnts was observed through transmission electron microscopy model zeiss libra 200 worked with 120 kilovoltages nitrogen physisorption method was adopted to evaluate the surface area and pore volume of alkaline based tnts model micrometrics asap 2000 and worked at 77 k degassed the material at 453 k for 24 h before characterized the optical characteristics of alkaline based tnts were evaluated through diffuse reflectance spectra model shimadzu uv 3150 nir and worked by using barium sulphate as background the chemical structure and functional groups of alkaline based tnts were characterized through fourier transform infrared model shimadzu 8400s operating range from 400 to 4000 of wavenumber and worked by using potassium bromide powder along with developed material 2 3 photocatalytic degradation of phenol the evaluation of phenol degradation was completed by using a batch photo reactor system with continuous stirring alkaline based tnts 1 0 g l were mixed into 250 ml aqueous solution of phenol with a known concentration of 50 ppm 0 5 ml of h2o2 30 wt and 1 0 ml of fecl3 3 0 wt were added into the final suspension the sample suspension was stirred in darkness inside the photoreactor for 60 min to attain the adsorption desorption isotherm conditions two cooling fans were employed over the photo reactor to sustain the temperature the sample suspension was continuously stirred at 450 rpm halogen lamp along with uv filter capacity 500 w wavelength 400 790 nm was employed for a visible light irradiation system and fitted over the top of experimental setup the ph of phenol suspension was adjusted up to 5 42 through hcl and naoh dilute solutions around 4 ml solution was sampled at various time duration and filter by using millipore filter 0 22 micro meter for analytical analysis 2 4 analytical analysis the absorption of phenol was detected at a wavelength of 270 nm through the uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3101 31 the degradation performance for phenol was calculated through the following formula 1 p h e n o l r e m o v a l c o c c o 100 where co initial phenol concentration and c final phenol concentration overall concentration of iron was determined through hach dr2010 portable data logging spectrophotometer by using 8008 method with ferrover iron regent powder pillows the concentration of fe iii ions was measured by using 110 phenanthroline method hach method 8146 by using ferrous ions regent powder pillows 32 similarly the concentration of h2o2 was measured through uv vis spectroscopy analysis 33 the ph of solutions was measured by using c932 consort ph meter 2 5 adsorption studies of phenol the evaluation of mechanism using alkaline based tnts as adsorbent was completed through the adsorption process in a batch system for this purpose alkaline based tnts 1 0 g l was mixed into 200 ml with known concentration of 50 ppm and continuously stirred at 200 rpm 0 5 ml of h2o2 30 wt and 1 0 ml of fecl3 3 0 wt were added into the final suspension the ph of phenol suspension was adjusted up to 5 42 by hcl and naoh dilute solutions kinetics and isotherms evaluation were completed ranging from 5 to 150 mg l of phenol concentrations while thermodynamics and activation energy studies were conducted ranging from 25 to 65 c the remaining adsorption amounts were calculated through the uv vis spectrometer after collecting the samples at different times the following equation was employed to estimate the adsorption capacities in which v and m are the volume of phenol solution and weight of alkaline based tnts respectively 2 q e c o c e v m 3 results and discussions 3 1 xrd analysis the crystalline structure of alkaline based tnts was confirmed through xrd characterization xrd patterns of alkaline based tnts and tio2 p 25 are discussed in fig s 1 a and b of supplementary information the results describe that the alkaline solution was completely oxidized into the starting material with the help of employed temperature to form the nanotubular structure the alkaline solution showed significant influence over the crystallinity and phase structure the major peaks were appeared at 2ɵ 24 67 and 48 32 and assigned to 101 and 200 crystal planes respectively this indicated that as produced tnts are in pure anatase nanostructures form 19 the main crystallographic parameters showed the several characteristics such as a tetragonal corresponds to the crystal structure b i41 a m d corresponds to space group c a b 3 8720 å and c 9 6160 å attributes to lattice parameters d 141 belongs to space group number e α β and γ obtained at 90 with jcpds 0f 21 1272 as can be seen that both rutile and brookite phases peaks were not generated with the required alkaline based tnts sample the extensive peaks in the produced samples are belong to monoclinic type sodium titanate nanoparticle na2ti3o7 in nanotube structures 16 the calcination temperature and acid washing with hcl are considered to be more important synthesis parameters for the development of anatase crystalline structure 34 in the present study the selected calcination temperature of 250 c and washing with hcl did not change or destroy the crystallinity of obtained products and hence nanotubes like morphology was maintained 3 2 tem analysis fig 1 discovers the surface morphology of alkaline based tnts the tem image confirmed that the obtained product was tubular the obtained tnts have a size of 100 200 nm a width of 8 10 nm an inner diameter of 4 6 nm an outer diameter of 15 nm and a wall thickness of 2 4 nm tem results show the formation of random and randomly oriented nanotubes several researchers have described the mechanism of tnts formation in alkaline solutions as follows tnps undergoes a fabrication of well defined crystalline morphology with the help of naoh molar suspension microcrystalline structure based tnps produced by the reaction of tnps and naoh dissolves with the arrangement of sodium trititanate sheets ti3o7 2 due to the unstable and high surface energy structure the resulting nanosheet grows with an increased tendency to curl and hence the development of a tubular morphology has occurred if the hydrogen deficiency exceeds surface ti3o7 2 it may contribute to enhance its activity to remove plate ti3o7 2 the result is a curved layer that creates a nanotube structure reducing the energy of the system 35 acid washing and calcination temperature are important parameters for the formation of tubular structures aggressive sodium na ions were intercepted between tnps spaces and purified with hcl with most na ions replaced by h ions 36 many researchers have synthesized similar tnts from tnps in alkaline solution 37 3 3 bet surface area and porosity analysis to investigate the pore structure of tnts a nitrogen n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm were recorded as shown in fig s 2 of supplementary information based upon the iupac classification system obtained isotherm is type iv this is because the tnts sample is mainly composed of mesopores 15 when tio2 p25 was transformed into nanotubes there was a significant increase for the specific surface area from 49 16 240 166 m2 g and pore volume from 0 092 to 1 011 cm3 g owing to the formation of nanotubular structure the higher pore size distribution of alkaline based tnts was also obtained up to 16 691 nm from the adsorption desorption isotherm considering the morphology of tnts described in tem image analysis this larger pore size distribution 10 nm can be attributed to the aggregation of the nanotubes at a lower calcination temperature of 250 c the pore size distribution of nanotubes was reported to be narrowed at a higher calcination temperature upto 700 c 38 the barrette joynere halenda technique was adopted to expose the pore size distribution as shown in fig s 2 b this revealed that a higher specific surface area and pore volume of tnts could be beneficial to the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation performance 3 4 ftir analysis the chemical structure and functional group of as developed tnts were confirmed through ftir analysis as shown in fig s 3 of supplementary information it can be analyzed that hydroxyl groups and the amount of water adsorbed were strongly observed at absorption peak of 3400 cm that would be directly associated with stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group oh because of water contents 39 the alkaline based tnts exhibited significantly higher contents of adsorbed water than that of tnps which could be due to its higher specific surface area pore diameter pore volume and pore size distribution properties the broad adsorption peak produced at 1637 cm 1 that corresponds to water tioh bending mode of stretching vibration 40 a comparatively sharp and significant spectrum zone ranging from 500 to 700 cm 1 belongs to the stretching vibration of the ti o ti group of tnps 41 another absorption peak produced at about 1070 cm and assigned to co stretching vibration 42 3 5 drs analysis drs analysis of as developed alkaline based tnts and tnps are presented in fig s 4 of supplementary information which revealed that alkaline based tnts generally exposed higher absorption in the visible zone than tnps the bandgap energy values of tnps are reported to be 3 21 ev which is calculated at 385 nm of absorption spectra 43 the following tauc plot equation is generally applied for determining optical properties of alkaline based tnts 44 3 α h ʋ a h ʋ e g n among them α absorption coefficient ʋ photon intensity h planks constant a constant factor eg bandgap energy and n ½ from straight line of intersections according to drs results the bandgap energy of alkaline based tnts is calculated to be 2 98 ev this bandgap energy is slightly lower than that of tnps this may be due to the lower calcination temperature which leads to the redshift to longer wavelength than tnps confirming narrow eg properties 37 the obtained narrow optical properties of alkaline based tnts are providing evidence of higher oxygen vacancy concentration 45 the calcination of nanotubes leads to blue shift at higher calcination temperature up to 700 c this result is in good agreement with xrd analysis revealing the anatase phase at a lower calcination temperature of 250 c these evaluations are strongly reliable to higher photocatalytic activity showed by alkaline based tnts in comparison with tnps which will be described later 4 photocatalytic degradation of phenol 4 1 photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts in fecl3 and h2o2 fig 2 shows the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of alkaline based tnts under green oxidants such as fecl3 and h2o2 in a visible light based photocatalysis system several photocatalytic degradation experiments such as without photocatalyst only visible light oxidants visible light tnps visible light tnts visible light and tnts oxidants visible light were performed the results showed that about 5 8 and 8 10 phenol was removed under dark and photolysis conditions respectively under h2o2 visible light and fecl3 visible light photodegradation processes about 15 19 and 12 15 of phenol was degraded respectively because of the development of powerful oh radicals alkaline based tnts showed higher photocatalytic removal efficiency of phenol up to 83 91 that of p25 nps this developed remediation activity of tnts was immensely appreciated by different factors namely nanotubular morphology higher specific surface area and least bandgap energy value this allowed them to better contact with phenol molecules and therefore produced higher removal performance therefore alkali based tnts is a light driven photocatalyst wherein highly active holes and electrons were stimulated in visible light treatment and finally migrate towards the active sites of photocatalyst surface over there they could contribute in developing the remediation activity of phenol here it is necessary to explain the need of both oxidizing agents along with photocatalyst under photocatalysis process the possible problem of applied p 25 tnps in the photocatalysis process is that it wastes intensity through the reconsolidation of holes pairs and electrons resulting in poor decomposition performance therefore it is very substantial to hinder the influence of hole pairs recombination by adding the appropriate electrons acceptor in a heterogeneous degradation process oxygen molecules could be a more advantageous electron acceptor to avoid the effect of hole reconsolidation rate but its role is not merely electron densification one method that researchers use to restrain electron hole incorporation is to improve electrons to the degradation reaction system the existence of oxidants for electron acceptors may behave as an electrons scavenger preventing the influence of reconsolidation of holes pairs with electrons and increasing the efficiency of the photolysis process 29 fecl3 and h2o2 show a substantial part in the photocatalytic remediation system through serving as an excellent electron receiver or can generate free oh radicals they have relatively a strong ability to produce more oh radicals that could be valuable to break down the bond of phenol molecules it could be believed that more oh radicals will increase the photocatalytic activity of photocatalyst the rate of degradation activity for phenol via applied alkaline based tnts was additionally obtained to be improved through the accession of h2o2 and fecl3 as green oxidants the remediation results in fig 2 revealed that with the accession of fecl3 and h2o2 the phenol removal efficiency was gradually enhanced up to 94 11 and 97 63 respectively as can be seen that h2o2 is found to be the most operative oxidants for maximum degradation of phenol this enhanced degradation of phenol might be due to the rapid reduction of the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons hole pairs over the surface of alkaline based tnts photocatalyst through the intensifying extra oh radicals and possible reaction between employed oxidants and photogenerated electrons inside the conduction band 29 the development of extra oh ions by the addition of oxidants showed the great capability to reduce the recombination influence of photoproduced electrons hole pairs into valance band which directly associated with degradation activity of photocatalysis 26 46 the possible effect of h2o2 over maximum degradation of phenol could be described by the development of oxidative action of oh species from oxygen photoreduction and h2o2 photodegradation over the surface of nanotubes under visible light system 47 furthermore h2o2 can also react with o radicals to promote the development of extra oh radicals therefore these observations revealed that alkaline based nanotubes h2o2 and visible light systems are highly essential for maximum degradation of phenol similarly the successful effect of fecl3 was also analyzed with alkaline based nanotubes photocatalyst under the visible light system and degradation of phenol was increased up to 94 11 which is higher than pure tio2 and alkaline based tnts samples the degradation process with the addition of fecl3 contained abundant oh radicals exhibiting higher phenol degradation performance the addition of fecl3 as iron species or h2o2 into the photoreaction process leads to an excellent generation of oh radicals from h2o2 which could improve the photocatalytic degradation performance 48 this is because an excess of fecl3 and h2o2 ions in the photocatalytic degradation process compete for the oh radicals along with phenol molecules and acts as hydroxyl radical scavenger that could improve the quantum harvest 49 the above conclusions revealed that alkaline based tnts in a well established photocatalysis system could successfully improve the phenol degradation rate with the existence of h2o2 and fecl3 as oxidants in the present research works intermediates substances are highlighted according to previous investigations fig 3 revealed proposed formation of intermediate substances during the photodegradation of phenol using alkaline based tnts as photocatalyst according to quantitative and qualitative analysis through gc ms method several intermediate products such as catechol hydroquinone o benzoquinone and p benzoquinone 50 based on substitution rules oh radicals successfully attacked the phenol molecules with higher probability in 2 and 4 position versus oh group of the aromatic ring several acids such as maleic acid formic acid oxalic acid and acetic acid are found to be persistent substances which are produced in larger proportion which are transferred into formic acid and oxalic acid as products which are directly decomposed into harmless carbon dioxide and water substances 4 2 proposed degradation mechanism of phenol the proposed degradation mechanism of phenol via employing alkaline based tnts under fecl3 and h2o2 is shown in fig 4 the above phenol degradation results revealed that alkaline based tnts play significant role in tnts oxidizing agents visible light photocatalysis processes the visible light could successfully progress the usage performance of employed oxidizing agents and promote the development of oh that is mainly accountable for the remediation of phenol from aqueous solution the degradation mechanism showed the powerful attraction between produced molecular oxygen and oh with photogenerated electrons and holes for determining the phenol removal percentage 51 52 the available photogenerated electrons could be allocated from alkaline based nanotubes to cb for the formation of superoxide radicals o2 by reaction with oxygen molecules on the other hand the holes were formed through the photocatalytic degradation process that has a strong activity to oxidize the harmful phenol molecules into harmless degraded species such as co2 and h2o the fecl3 and h2o2 were available in the aqueous phase while the phenol molecules were present in the organic phase in such a reaction system alkaline based tnts were available in the interface between aqueous and organic phase making a possibility for maximum degradation of phenol molecules over the alkaline based tnts surface by reacting with as produced extra oh radicals in the case of fecl3 as oxidants the extra electrons and holes can easily produce inside the cb and vb which could be more responsible to adsorb the phenol molecules over alkaline based tnts several species such as fe oh 2 fe oh 2 and fe oh 4 2 etc were produced as fe iii was introduced into water under visible light fe iii was photoinduced into fe ii ions via photogenerated electrons along with oh and ho2 species furthermore o2 as electron scavenger produced o2 and fe ii recycled to fe iii ions both produced oh and o2 radicals were responsible oxidative species for the degradation of phenol into degradation products such as co2 and h2o 53 the above explanation clearly revealed that the addition of both oxidants in the photocatalysis process could prove to be excellent accelerators for the development of extra oh radicals that are highly essential for higher degradation performance of employed photocatalyst in this respect various possible reaction routes have been suggested to initiate the oh radicals by the addition of both oxidants which can be explained in the following equations 4 t n t s a q h v t n t s h v b e c b a q o 2 h o o 2 h 5 h 2 o 2 o 2 o h o 2 o

i d a t i o n 4 3 langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetic studies the l h kinetic modeling is generally applied to describe the photocatalysis mechanism through rate setting step which involves the formation of oh radicals the following l h kinetic equations are useful to estimate leftover phenol concentration according to required remediation time and calculate the degradation rate 54 56 12 k c d c d t

get an exponential concentration over time it signifies the initial concentration of phenol co draw a graph between the degradation time t and ln co c and compute the constant values of k1 based on the slope the result indicates that the photodegradation mechanism for phenol molecules obey applied l h kinetic that is generally known as pseudo first order rate equation model compute the values of k1 according to the phenol experimental results as given in fig 5 the employed l h kinetic is shown to be the best and desirable model to speech the empirical results of phenol degradation onto alkaline based tnts due to higher r2 in the range from 0 917 to 0 989 the higher rate constant revealed the maximum degradation activity of the photocatalytic degradation process the substrate is adsorbed through a photocatalyst to maintain the adsorption equilibrium during the photocatalytic reaction at this point the rate of adsorption is faster than that of the reaction with electrons and holes which is called as a rate limiting step 57 table 1 4 4 comparison with literature in literature several studies have been reported for phenol degradation via employing various oxidizing agents for electrons acceptor during the photocatalysis system under light source as shown in table 2 it could be seen that h2o2 and fecl3 based photocatalysis processes provided the highest phenol degradation up to 99 9 as compared to other oxidizing agents while the pds based photocatalysis process showed the lowest phenol degradation up to 37 the photocatalytic removal percentage of phenol along several oxidizing agents based photocatalysis systems were testified between 37 99 9 phenol degradation over alkaline based tnts in the presence of fecl3 and h2o2 was also comparable with literature studies the small variation in phenol degradation via an established photocatalysis process may be due to the experimental conditions selected photocatalysts and experimental setup this revealed that alkaline based tnts also showed excellent photoreactivity to catalyze the decomposition of fecl3 and h2o2 to produce free hydroxyl radicals oh and subsequently its significance for the

in the presence of fecl3 and h2o2 oxidants for the removal of phenol the adsorption results revealed that tio2 showed the removal performance of phenol up to 47 87 while alkaline based tnts removed up to 65 71 on the other hand the removal performance of phenol was found to be increased by the addition of both oxidants the alkaline based tnts in the presence of fecl3 showed removal performance of phenol up to 75 67 which is much higher than pure tio2 and alkaline based tnts as adsorbents as can be seen that h2o2 is found to be the most operative oxidants for maximum adsorption of phenol up to 83 67 the maximum adsorption performance of alkaline based tnts in oxidants could be due to the ratio between the existing number of active sites over phenol molecules to the active sites over the adsorbent indeed in the presence of oxidants alkaline based tnts as adsorbent has the additional capability to react with the available number of active sites over the surface of phenol the addition of oxidants may enhance the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged of phenol molecules and adsorption sites of alkaline based tnts additionally other attraction forces such as van der waal may also responsible for the successful removal of phenol onto alkaline based tnts in the presence of oxidants and hence increased the adsorption of phenol 5 2 adsorption kinetic modeling adsorption kinetic studies could be selected to determine the rate of the removal process of pollutants through adsorption to determine the reaction pathway for this purpose several adsorption kinetic models are being studied to understand the adsorption kinetics 63 64 the linear equations of employed adsorption models are written in table 3 where k1 min 1 phenol adsorption rate constant for pseudo first order kinetics k2 min 1 pseudo second order adsorption rate constant qe mg g removal quantity of phenol at stability stage qt mg g removal quantity of phenol at any degradation time ci thickness of boundary layer ki intraparticle diffusion rate constant kinetic graphs are shown in fig 7 and their experimental results are shown in table 4 it would be seen that two adsorption models of pseudo first order and type i pseudo second order were scrutinized as prime equations with adequate competence because of r2 near to one additionally predicted and empirical phenol removal values showing sufficient correlation with a small difference revealing the fitness of both adsorption models the remaining other types of pseudo second order models exposed their inapplicability because of lower r2 in addition the prominent deviation between predicted and empirical values was also screening their unworkability the predicted values qe cal for pseudo first order and types of pseudo second order adsorption models progressively declined this could be attributable to the development of additional barriers on the active surface of alkaline based tnts at high phenol concentrations 65 the straight form of plotting for the intraparticle diffusion adsorption model is exposed in fig 6 c which established that the entire plot was a not capable to proceed throughout zero this would affirming that intraparticle diffusion is not rate governing step the larger ci outcomes associated with phenol concentration indicates that the boundary layer has a significant effect 66 67 5 3 adsorption equilibrium modeling when designing adsorption systems adsorption isotherm models are recognized to be essential considering that they contribute a convenient data related to the absorption distribution during the fluid and material phases over numerous concentrations for this purpose several isotherm models are employed for assessing the adsorption properties of adsorbent 68 69 the linear equations of different isotherms are written in table 5 where qm mg g extreme removal quantity of phenol qe mg g removal quantity of phenol at stability stage ce mg l concentration of phenol at stability stage kl langmuir isotherm constant n dimensionless factor kf freundlich isotherm constant kt temkin isotherm constant ε polanyi potential e mean adsorption energy kdr d r isotherm constant and ke elovich isotherm constant the isotherm graphs are shown in fig 8 and their results are given in table 6 the isotherm results show that adsorption isotherms namely langmuir and freundlich were found to be more applicable for justifying the phenol removal attitude over alkaline based tnts because their r2 of 0 994 and 0 991 respectively moreover the langmuir equilibrium process also contributes extreme adsorption competency up to 9 356 mg g in the case of freundlich equilibrium the value of n is smaller than which revealed the favorable removal process onto alkaline based tnts under used experimental conditions the remaining isotherm such as temkin d r and elovich models produced relatively lower r2 of 0 915 0 712 and 0 976 respectively than langmuir and freundlich isotherms this indicated that these isotherms are not suitable to demonstrate the phenol removal process over alkaline based tnts 5 4 adsorption thermodynamics modeling estimating whether the process is spontaneous requires thermodynamic considerations of the adsorption process the important thermodynamic parameters in which gibbs free energy change δgo enthalpy change δho and entropy change δso are computed by applying temperature based empirical results and given in table 7 the following equations are admirable to expose these parameters 15 δ g δ h t δ s 16 δ g r t l n k d 17 l o g k d δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 r t 18 k d q e c e among them kd distribution rate constant t k temperature of phenol suspension r j mol k universal gas constant the results illustrated that the photocatalytic degradation of phenol was gradually increased from 298 to 338 k via employing alkaline based tnts as adsorbent the use of alkaline based tnts adsorbent gives negative δgo this designates that the phenol adsorption is thought to be practical and spontaneous these outcomes are observable in almost everyone and the same spontaneity indicates the relative temperature at which adsorption occurs 65 the positively δho disclosed endothermic properties of the phenol removal process ratifying that the entire experimental study is widely accepted endothermic action can proceed by raising the temperature of phenol to the outer boundary layer so using more adsorbing pores in general the chemisorption values for δho are ranging from 80 to 200 kj mol and physisorption ranging from 2 1 to 20 9 kj mol 70 the positively δso approved a random increase in the liquid solid interface throughout absorption therefore this is a physical process involving electrostatic influence among phenol molecules and alkaline based tnts as adsorbent 5 5 activation energy analysis the activation energy of phenol removal mechanism was designed through the following arrhenius equation at different temperatures 71 19 k a e x p e a r t among them a arrhenius constant in g mgmin k rate constant in g mgmin and ea activation energy in kj mol the resulting ea predicts regarding removal mechanism in terms of chemisorption or physisorption processes fig 9 used to calculate the several thermodynamic parameters and activation energy values in general ea ranging from 0 to 40 kj mol showed a physisorption removal mechanism and ea ranging from 40 to 800 kj mol illustrated physisorption removal mechanism 72 ea for alkaline based tnts was obtained as 22 178 kj mol intensifying the physisorption process the results predict that alkaline based tnts as adsorbent revealed efficient phenol removal aptitude 6 conclusions in the present study two well known electron acceptors especially fecl3 and h2o2 have been successfully operated for the first time along alkaline based tnts in the photocatalysis system under a visible light source phenol was used as model organic pollutants the results showed that both oxidizing agents have strong capabilities to develop additional hydroxyl radicals to minimize the reconsolidation rate of photogenerated electrons and hole pairs the phenol removal efficiency was reported to be 94 11 and 97 63 in the existence of fecl3 and h2o2 respectively tnts were prepared according to literature via a simple hydrothermal process under an alkaline environment alkaline based tnts were characterized through several characterization techniques namely xrd tem bet surface area ftir and drs langmuir hinshelwood degradation rate kinetic model was practiced explaining phenol degradation under fecl3 and h2o2 using reaction rate constant two adsorption models of pseudo first order and type i pseudo second order were scrutinized as prime equations to explain adsorption mechanism with adequate competence because of higher r2 near to one in isotherm studies langmuir models and freundlich models were more applicable to phenol experimental results owing to higher r2 and supreme adsorption capacity up to 9 359 mg g several thermodynamic parameters discovered that the phenol adsorption system is suggested to be more favorable spontaneous and physical in nature the present research concludes that established green and eco friendly photocatalysis system via employing alkaline based tnts could be more feasible for the

13719,industrial and manufacturing processes are major responsible for water pollution which has many environmental and health consequences the development of efficient green and eco friendly photocatalysis process to treat wastewater containing organic contaminants is highly desirable to solve significant water pollution problems herein the photoreactivity of alkaline based tio2 nanotubes tnts was investigated to catalyze the decomposition of green oxidants namely ferric chloride fecl3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to harvest free hydroxyl radicals oh and finally its significance for the remediation of phenol in visible light irradiation to our information this study first reported that alkaline based tnts photocatalyst could successfully activate felc3 and h2o2 and reduced phenol concentration up to 97 63 tnts were prepared via a hydrothermal process in an alkaline environment at 180 c for 24 h and characterized through xrd tem bet surface area drs and ftir analysis in adsorption mechanism pseudo first order and type 1 pseudo second order kinetics were proved as best owing to an excellent correlation between experimental and theoretical outcomes and highest r2 up to 0 997 langmuir and freundlich isotherms were more appropriate models due to their highest r2 up to 0 994 several thermodynamic parameters as enthalpy 53 84 kj mol entropy 173 87 kj mol k gibbs free energy 51 76 to 58 71 kj mol and activation energy 22 17 kj mol were recommended that phenol adsorption method is favourable and spontaneous in nature the rising temperature was more suitable for phenol removal onto alkaline based tnts keywords tio2 nanotubes hydrothermal process green oxidants photocatalysis adsorption mechanism 1 introduction in the last few years many artificial organic compounds have not been decomposed due to the remarkable development of the industry these compounds have a complex structure and are not easily degraded through microorganisms 1 when released they showed an important influence over the atmosphere phenolic compounds are greatly manufactured synthetically and utilized for the development of abundant products for different agricultural industrial and commercial applications it is utilized in pesticides paints petroleum refining resins textile pharmaceutical pulp and paper manufacturing industries 2 over a period these reliable and harmful chemicals collect in the edible materials and ultimately arrive into the body causing serious health problems such as cancer and endangering public health 3 an appropriate way to transform organic pollutants into harmless species is photocatalytic degradation and adsorption with low energy consumption 1 adsorption is known to be more favorable removal process due to simple and economical operation 4 this process can provide a better understanding of adsorption mechanisms through modeling 5 semiconductor nanomaterials are a promising option for eco friendly and low cost remediation systems in which chemicals energy sources and catalysts are non toxic economical and produce no secondary product compare to other semiconductors tio2 acts as a promising photocatalyst used in the photocatalysis system due to its chemical and biological inertness economical and long term stability against chemical and photo corrosion 5 7 it may serve as an ideal material in biological and medical science its biological properties are responsible for uv protection applications it is also successfully used for dental orthopedic and osteosynthesis applications 8 however its photocatalytic activity is intrinsically lower due to the limited specific surface area nevertheless the photogenerated electrons and holes in tio2 tend to a reunion thereby restraining remediation performance therefore it is highly necessary to develop a suitable photocatalytic degradation system to prevent the recombination rate of electrons and holes by modifying tio2 into other well crystalline morphology 1 9 kasuga with co workers have been conducting extensive research on tio2 nanotubes tnts since its discovery and inception in 1998 10 alkaline based hydrothermal template assisted and anodizing synthetic routes have considered as general approaches for the development of tnts hydrothermal preparation is a simple and low cost method and it is said that mass production is easy by this method tnts have been reported to expose exclusive consolidation of physiological and structural characteristics for example effective electronic conductivity with relatively higher surface area and aspect ratio 6 several efforts have been considered for understanding the mechanism of tnts formation during the hydrothermal treatment optimizing manufacturing conditions and studying the properties of tnts for the remediation of different organic pollutants through adsorption and photocatalysis 6 11 12 in most of the studies alkaline based tnts have been widely inspected for maximum photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue mb based on different organized parameters such as synthesis heating acid washing concentrations and calcination temperature while the adsorption studies have used for understanding the adsorption mechanism of mb through kinetics and isotherms modeling 10 13 16 for example shiping et al reported excellent adsorption and photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts for acid orange 7 dye in aqueous solution 6 ramin et al tested alkaline based tnts as a competent and economical adsorbent for the adsorption of basic violet 2 dye up to 75 63 from aqueous suspension 17 asma with co authors evaluated the photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts for the degradation of formic acid and adsorption studies used to understand the removal mechanism through kinetics and isotherms modeling 18 in another study daniela with co workers reported much higher photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts for the removal of rhodamine b dye up to 96 9 depending upon the synthesis temperature 19 similarly leonardo et al evaluated the photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts for indigo carmine dye with a maximum removal efficiency of 90 after 10 photocatalytic cycles 20 according to the above literature based information it can be analyzed that alkaline based tnts showed different removal behavior for different pollutants additionally the reconsolidation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes could be further abated through the addition of suitable green oxidants to generate more oh radicals and superoxide radicals o2 in photocatalysis system ultimately these powerful and stable radicals successfully destroy organic compounds into harmless carbon dioxide and water species by accepting the electrons 1 according to literature photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants has been successfully increased by the addition of several oxidizing agents as electrons acceptor namely fecl3 9 sodium nitrite nano2 21 h2o2 3 9 22 iron salt iii 23 persulphate ions and sodium carbonate 24 peroxomonosulfate and peroxodisulfate 25 they have a showed powerful capacity to adsorb the pollutant molecules and those occupied near to photocatalyst surface 23 their results revealed that they have a beneficial effect over the degradation rate for the removal of several pollutants the primary mechanism is the formation of oh and o2 radicals and the addition of oxidants can strongly prevent the recombination of electrons and holes thereby the oh and o2 radicals can react rapidly with most of the organic pollutant molecules and degraded into carbon dioxide and water 9 26 several studies revealed that fecl3 and h2o2 have also a great deal of influence over the photocatalysis system for the development of extra oh radicals which have caused an increasing attraction in recent years 9 27 however few studies have been reported for photocatalytic degradation of phenol under the influence of h2o2 with pure tio2 photocatalyst under uv irradiation and proved as the beneficial oxidant 26 28 30 nevertheless as far as we know that there is no research has done to investigate the influence of fecl3 and h2o2 for the destruction of essential compounds especially phenol in adsorption and photocatalysis mediated with alkaline based tnts photocatalyst which represents the novelty of present work the combined use of green oxidants based adsorption and photocatalysis systems could successfully enhance removal capabilities furthermore adsorption of phenol via alkaline based tnts can provide better understanding through kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics modeling in the present research anatase tnts were prepared according to literature via a simple hydrothermal process in the presence of an alkaline environment at 180 c for 24 h the as developed tnts were characterized through xrd tem bet surface area drs and ftir analysis phenol was used as a model pollutant for photocatalysis and adsorption studies fecl3 and h2o2 were introduced in the photocatalysis and adsorption systems along alkaline based tnts to produce extra oh and o2 radicals that would be more answerable to enhance the removal activities 2 experimental details 2 1 synthesis of alkaline based tnts all chemicals were procured from sigma aldrich malaysia commercially available tio2 p25 nanopowders having rutile 20 anatase 80 specific surface area 49 16 m2 g average particle size 21 nm and purity 99 5 the synthetic procedure was adopted according to past studies 15 anatase tnts were produced through a hydrothermal synthetic approach in which 1 0 g of tio2 p 25 was dropped into 10 m naoh with a volume of 10 ml under stirring it was shifted into a 50 ml autoclave of teflon lined the autoclave was put at 453 k for 24 h it was then cooled down to room temperature the obtained white slurry was washed with dilute acid and distilled water the finished sample was dried at 353 k for 4 h and then calcined at 523 k for 6 h 2 2 characterization of alkaline based tnts the crystalline structures of alkaline based tnts were characterized by x ray diffraction model bruker d8 worked through radiation of cu kα current of 40 milliamperes wavelength of 0 154056 nanometers and voltage of 40 kilovoltages the data was received ranging from 20 to 80 scanning with 4 min over 2θ values the morphology of alkaline based tnts was observed through transmission electron microscopy model zeiss libra 200 worked with 120 kilovoltages nitrogen physisorption method was adopted to evaluate the surface area and pore volume of alkaline based tnts model micrometrics asap 2000 and worked at 77 k degassed the material at 453 k for 24 h before characterized the optical characteristics of alkaline based tnts were evaluated through diffuse reflectance spectra model shimadzu uv 3150 nir and worked by using barium sulphate as background the chemical structure and functional groups of alkaline based tnts were characterized through fourier transform infrared model shimadzu 8400s operating range from 400 to 4000 of wavenumber and worked by using potassium bromide powder along with developed material 2 3 photocatalytic degradation of phenol the evaluation of phenol degradation was completed by using a batch photo reactor system with continuous stirring alkaline based tnts 1 0 g l were mixed into 250 ml aqueous solution of phenol with a known concentration of 50 ppm 0 5 ml of h2o2 30 wt and 1 0 ml of fecl3 3 0 wt were added into the final suspension the sample suspension was stirred in darkness inside the photoreactor for 60 min to attain the adsorption desorption isotherm conditions two cooling fans were employed over the photo reactor to sustain the temperature the sample suspension was continuously stirred at 450 rpm halogen lamp along with uv filter capacity 500 w wavelength 400 790 nm was employed for a visible light irradiation system and fitted over the top of experimental setup the ph of phenol suspension was adjusted up to 5 42 through hcl and naoh dilute solutions around 4 ml solution was sampled at various time duration and filter by using millipore filter 0 22 micro meter for analytical analysis 2 4 analytical analysis the absorption of phenol was detected at a wavelength of 270 nm through the uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3101 31 the degradation performance for phenol was calculated through the following formula 1 p h e n o l r e m o v a l c o c c o 100 where co initial phenol concentration and c final phenol concentration overall concentration of iron was determined through hach dr2010 portable data logging spectrophotometer by using 8008 method with ferrover iron regent powder pillows the concentration of fe iii ions was measured by using 110 phenanthroline method hach method 8146 by using ferrous ions regent powder pillows 32 similarly the concentration of h2o2 was measured through uv vis spectroscopy analysis 33 the ph of solutions was measured by using c932 consort ph meter 2 5 adsorption studies of phenol the evaluation of mechanism using alkaline based tnts as adsorbent was completed through the adsorption process in a batch system for this purpose alkaline based tnts 1 0 g l was mixed into 200 ml with known concentration of 50 ppm and continuously stirred at 200 rpm 0 5 ml of h2o2 30 wt and 1 0 ml of fecl3 3 0 wt were added into the final suspension the ph of phenol suspension was adjusted up to 5 42 by hcl and naoh dilute solutions kinetics and isotherms evaluation were completed ranging from 5 to 150 mg l of phenol concentrations while thermodynamics and activation energy studies were conducted ranging from 25 to 65 c the remaining adsorption amounts were calculated through the uv vis spectrometer after collecting the samples at different times the following equation was employed to estimate the adsorption capacities in which v and m are the volume of phenol solution and weight of alkaline based tnts respectively 2 q e c o c e v m 3 results and discussions 3 1 xrd analysis the crystalline structure of alkaline based tnts was confirmed through xrd characterization xrd patterns of alkaline based tnts and tio2 p 25 are discussed in fig s 1 a and b of supplementary information the results describe that the alkaline solution was completely oxidized into the starting material with the help of employed temperature to form the nanotubular structure the alkaline solution showed significant influence over the crystallinity and phase structure the major peaks were appeared at 2ɵ 24 67 and 48 32 and assigned to 101 and 200 crystal planes respectively this indicated that as produced tnts are in pure anatase nanostructures form 19 the main crystallographic parameters showed the several characteristics such as a tetragonal corresponds to the crystal structure b i41 a m d corresponds to space group c a b 3 8720 å and c 9 6160 å attributes to lattice parameters d 141 belongs to space group number e α β and γ obtained at 90 with jcpds 0f 21 1272 as can be seen that both rutile and brookite phases peaks were not generated with the required alkaline based tnts sample the extensive peaks in the produced samples are belong to monoclinic type sodium titanate nanoparticle na2ti3o7 in nanotube structures 16 the calcination temperature and acid washing with hcl are considered to be more important synthesis parameters for the development of anatase crystalline structure 34 in the present study the selected calcination temperature of 250 c and washing with hcl did not change or destroy the crystallinity of obtained products and hence nanotubes like morphology was maintained 3 2 tem analysis fig 1 discovers the surface morphology of alkaline based tnts the tem image confirmed that the obtained product was tubular the obtained tnts have a size of 100 200 nm a width of 8 10 nm an inner diameter of 4 6 nm an outer diameter of 15 nm and a wall thickness of 2 4 nm tem results show the formation of random and randomly oriented nanotubes several researchers have described the mechanism of tnts formation in alkaline solutions as follows tnps undergoes a fabrication of well defined crystalline morphology with the help of naoh molar suspension microcrystalline structure based tnps produced by the reaction of tnps and naoh dissolves with the arrangement of sodium trititanate sheets ti3o7 2 due to the unstable and high surface energy structure the resulting nanosheet grows with an increased tendency to curl and hence the development of a tubular morphology has occurred if the hydrogen deficiency exceeds surface ti3o7 2 it may contribute to enhance its activity to remove plate ti3o7 2 the result is a curved layer that creates a nanotube structure reducing the energy of the system 35 acid washing and calcination temperature are important parameters for the formation of tubular structures aggressive sodium na ions were intercepted between tnps spaces and purified with hcl with most na ions replaced by h ions 36 many researchers have synthesized similar tnts from tnps in alkaline solution 37 3 3 bet surface area and porosity analysis to investigate the pore structure of tnts a nitrogen n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm were recorded as shown in fig s 2 of supplementary information based upon the iupac classification system obtained isotherm is type iv this is because the tnts sample is mainly composed of mesopores 15 when tio2 p25 was transformed into nanotubes there was a significant increase for the specific surface area from 49 16 240 166 m2 g and pore volume from 0 092 to 1 011 cm3 g owing to the formation of nanotubular structure the higher pore size distribution of alkaline based tnts was also obtained up to 16 691 nm from the adsorption desorption isotherm considering the morphology of tnts described in tem image analysis this larger pore size distribution 10 nm can be attributed to the aggregation of the nanotubes at a lower calcination temperature of 250 c the pore size distribution of nanotubes was reported to be narrowed at a higher calcination temperature upto 700 c 38 the barrette joynere halenda technique was adopted to expose the pore size distribution as shown in fig s 2 b this revealed that a higher specific surface area and pore volume of tnts could be beneficial to the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation performance 3 4 ftir analysis the chemical structure and functional group of as developed tnts were confirmed through ftir analysis as shown in fig s 3 of supplementary information it can be analyzed that hydroxyl groups and the amount of water adsorbed were strongly observed at absorption peak of 3400 cm that would be directly associated with stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group oh because of water contents 39 the alkaline based tnts exhibited significantly higher contents of adsorbed water than that of tnps which could be due to its higher specific surface area pore diameter pore volume and pore size distribution properties the broad adsorption peak produced at 1637 cm 1 that corresponds to water tioh bending mode of stretching vibration 40 a comparatively sharp and significant spectrum zone ranging from 500 to 700 cm 1 belongs to the stretching vibration of the ti o ti group of tnps 41 another absorption peak produced at about 1070 cm and assigned to co stretching vibration 42 3 5 drs analysis drs analysis of as developed alkaline based tnts and tnps are presented in fig s 4 of supplementary information which revealed that alkaline based tnts generally exposed higher absorption in the visible zone than tnps the bandgap energy values of tnps are reported to be 3 21 ev which is calculated at 385 nm of absorption spectra 43 the following tauc plot equation is generally applied for determining optical properties of alkaline based tnts 44 3 α h ʋ a h ʋ e g n among them α absorption coefficient ʋ photon intensity h planks constant a constant factor eg bandgap energy and n ½ from straight line of intersections according to drs results the bandgap energy of alkaline based tnts is calculated to be 2 98 ev this bandgap energy is slightly lower than that of tnps this may be due to the lower calcination temperature which leads to the redshift to longer wavelength than tnps confirming narrow eg properties 37 the obtained narrow optical properties of alkaline based tnts are providing evidence of higher oxygen vacancy concentration 45 the calcination of nanotubes leads to blue shift at higher calcination temperature up to 700 c this result is in good agreement with xrd analysis revealing the anatase phase at a lower calcination temperature of 250 c these evaluations are strongly reliable to higher photocatalytic activity showed by alkaline based tnts in comparison with tnps which will be described later 4 photocatalytic degradation of phenol 4 1 photocatalytic activity of alkaline based tnts in fecl3 and h2o2 fig 2 shows the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of alkaline based tnts under green oxidants such as fecl3 and h2o2 in a visible light based photocatalysis system several photocatalytic degradation experiments such as without photocatalyst only visible light oxidants visible light tnps visible light tnts visible light and tnts oxidants visible light were performed the results showed that about 5 8 and 8 10 phenol was removed under dark and photolysis conditions respectively under h2o2 visible light and fecl3 visible light photodegradation processes about 15 19 and 12 15 of phenol was degraded respectively because of the development of powerful oh radicals alkaline based tnts showed higher photocatalytic removal efficiency of phenol up to 83 91 that of p25 nps this developed remediation activity of tnts was immensely appreciated by different factors namely nanotubular morphology higher specific surface area and least bandgap energy value this allowed them to better contact with phenol molecules and therefore produced higher removal performance therefore alkali based tnts is a light driven photocatalyst wherein highly active holes and electrons were stimulated in visible light treatment and finally migrate towards the active sites of photocatalyst surface over there they could contribute in developing the remediation activity of phenol here it is necessary to explain the need of both oxidizing agents along with photocatalyst under photocatalysis process the possible problem of applied p 25 tnps in the photocatalysis process is that it wastes intensity through the reconsolidation of holes pairs and electrons resulting in poor decomposition performance therefore it is very substantial to hinder the influence of hole pairs recombination by adding the appropriate electrons acceptor in a heterogeneous degradation process oxygen molecules could be a more advantageous electron acceptor to avoid the effect of hole reconsolidation rate but its role is not merely electron densification one method that researchers use to restrain electron hole incorporation is to improve electrons to the degradation reaction system the existence of oxidants for electron acceptors may behave as an electrons scavenger preventing the influence of reconsolidation of holes pairs with electrons and increasing the efficiency of the photolysis process 29 fecl3 and h2o2 show a substantial part in the photocatalytic remediation system through serving as an excellent electron receiver or can generate free oh radicals they have relatively a strong ability to produce more oh radicals that could be valuable to break down the bond of phenol molecules it could be believed that more oh radicals will increase the photocatalytic activity of photocatalyst the rate of degradation activity for phenol via applied alkaline based tnts was additionally obtained to be improved through the accession of h2o2 and fecl3 as green oxidants the remediation results in fig 2 revealed that with the accession of fecl3 and h2o2 the phenol removal efficiency was gradually enhanced up to 94 11 and 97 63 respectively as can be seen that h2o2 is found to be the most operative oxidants for maximum degradation of phenol this enhanced degradation of phenol might be due to the rapid reduction of the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons hole pairs over the surface of alkaline based tnts photocatalyst through the intensifying extra oh radicals and possible reaction between employed oxidants and photogenerated electrons inside the conduction band 29 the development of extra oh ions by the addition of oxidants showed the great capability to reduce the recombination influence of photoproduced electrons hole pairs into valance band which directly associated with degradation activity of photocatalysis 26 46 the possible effect of h2o2 over maximum degradation of phenol could be described by the development of oxidative action of oh species from oxygen photoreduction and h2o2 photodegradation over the surface of nanotubes under visible light system 47 furthermore h2o2 can also react with o radicals to promote the development of extra oh radicals therefore these observations revealed that alkaline based nanotubes h2o2 and visible light systems are highly essential for maximum degradation of phenol similarly the successful effect of fecl3 was also analyzed with alkaline based nanotubes photocatalyst under the visible light system and degradation of phenol was increased up to 94 11 which is higher than pure tio2 and alkaline based tnts samples the degradation process with the addition of fecl3 contained abundant oh radicals exhibiting higher phenol degradation performance the addition of fecl3 as iron species or h2o2 into the photoreaction process leads to an excellent generation of oh radicals from h2o2 which could improve the photocatalytic degradation performance 48 this is because an excess of fecl3 and h2o2 ions in the photocatalytic degradation process compete for the oh radicals along with phenol molecules and acts as hydroxyl radical scavenger that could improve the quantum harvest 49 the above conclusions revealed that alkaline based tnts in a well established photocatalysis system could successfully improve the phenol degradation rate with the existence of h2o2 and fecl3 as oxidants in the present research works intermediates substances are highlighted according to previous investigations fig 3 revealed proposed formation of intermediate substances during the photodegradation of phenol using alkaline based tnts as photocatalyst according to quantitative and qualitative analysis through gc ms method several intermediate products such as catechol hydroquinone o benzoquinone and p benzoquinone 50 based on substitution rules oh radicals successfully attacked the phenol molecules with higher probability in 2 and 4 position versus oh group of the aromatic ring several acids such as maleic acid formic acid oxalic acid and acetic acid are found to be persistent substances which are produced in larger proportion which are transferred into formic acid and oxalic acid as products which are directly decomposed into harmless carbon dioxide and water substances 4 2 proposed degradation mechanism of phenol the proposed degradation mechanism of phenol via employing alkaline based tnts under fecl3 and h2o2 is shown in fig 4 the above phenol degradation results revealed that alkaline based tnts play significant role in tnts oxidizing agents visible light photocatalysis processes the visible light could successfully progress the usage performance of employed oxidizing agents and promote the development of oh that is mainly accountable for the remediation of phenol from aqueous solution the degradation mechanism showed the powerful attraction between produced molecular oxygen and oh with photogenerated electrons and holes for determining the phenol removal percentage 51 52 the available photogenerated electrons could be allocated from alkaline based nanotubes to cb for the formation of superoxide radicals o2 by reaction with oxygen molecules on the other hand the holes were formed through the photocatalytic degradation process that has a strong activity to oxidize the harmful phenol molecules into harmless degraded species such as co2 and h2o the fecl3 and h2o2 were available in the aqueous phase while the phenol molecules were present in the organic phase in such a reaction system alkaline based tnts were available in the interface between aqueous and organic phase making a possibility for maximum degradation of phenol molecules over the alkaline based tnts surface by reacting with as produced extra oh radicals in the case of fecl3 as oxidants the extra electrons and holes can easily produce inside the cb and vb which could be more responsible to adsorb the phenol molecules over alkaline based tnts several species such as fe oh 2 fe oh 2 and fe oh 4 2 etc were produced as fe iii was introduced into water under visible light fe iii was photoinduced into fe ii ions via photogenerated electrons along with oh and ho2 species furthermore o2 as electron scavenger produced o2 and fe ii recycled to fe iii ions both produced oh and o2 radicals were responsible oxidative species for the degradation of phenol into degradation products such as co2 and h2o 53 the above explanation clearly revealed that the addition of both oxidants in the photocatalysis process could prove to be excellent accelerators for the development of extra oh radicals that are highly essential for higher degradation performance of employed photocatalyst in this respect various possible reaction routes have been suggested to initiate the oh radicals by the addition of both oxidants which can be explained in the following equations 4 t n t s a q h v t n t s h v b e c b a q o 2 h o o 2 h 5 h 2 o 2 o 2 o h o 2 o

get an exponential concentration over time it signifies the initial concentration of phenol co draw a graph between the degradation time t and ln co c and compute the constant values of k1 based on the slope the result indicates that the photodegradation mechanism for phenol molecules obey applied l h kinetic that is generally known as pseudo first order rate equation model compute the values of k1 according to the phenol experimental results as given in fig 5 the employed l h kinetic is shown to be the best and desirable model to speech the empirical results of phenol degradation onto alkaline based tnts due to higher r2 in the range from 0 917 to 0 989 the higher rate constant revealed the maximum degradation activity of the photocatalytic degradation process the substrate is adsorbed through a photocatalyst to maintain the adsorption equilibrium during the photocatalytic reaction at this point the rate of adsorption is faster than that of the reaction with electrons and holes which is called as a rate limiting step 57 table 1 4 4 comparison with literature in literature several studies have been reported for phenol degradation via employing various oxidizing agents for electrons acceptor during the photocatalysis system under light source as shown in table 2 it could be seen that h2o2 and fecl3 based photocatalysis processes provided the highest phenol degradation up to 99 9 as compared to other oxidizing agents while the pds based photocatalysis process showed the lowest phenol degradation up to 37 the photocatalytic removal percentage of phenol along several oxidizing agents based photocatalysis systems were testified between 37 99 9 phenol degradation over alkaline based tnts in the presence of fecl3 and h2o2 was also comparable with literature studies the small variation in phenol degradation via an established photocatalysis process may be due to the experimental conditions selected photocatalysts and experimental setup this revealed that alkaline based tnts also showed excellent photoreactivity to catalyze the decomposition of fecl3 and h2o2 to produce free hydroxyl radicals oh and subsequently its significance for the

in the presence of fecl3 and h2o2 oxidants for the removal of phenol the adsorption results revealed that tio2 showed the removal performance of phenol up to 47 87 while alkaline based tnts removed up to 65 71 on the other hand the removal performance of phenol was found to be increased by the addition of both oxidants the alkaline based tnts in the presence of fecl3 showed removal performance of phenol up to 75 67 which is much higher than pure tio2 and alkaline based tnts as adsorbents as can be seen that h2o2 is found to be the most operative oxidants for maximum adsorption of phenol up to 83 67 the maximum adsorption performance of alkaline based tnts in oxidants could be due to the ratio between the existing number of active sites over phenol molecules to the active sites over the adsorbent indeed in the presence of oxidants alkaline based tnts as adsorbent has the additional capability to react with the available number of active sites over the surface of phenol the addition of oxidants may enhance the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged of phenol molecules and adsorption sites of alkaline based tnts additionally other attraction forces such as van der waal may also responsible for the successful removal of phenol onto alkaline based tnts in the presence of oxidants and hence increased the adsorption of phenol 5 2 adsorption kinetic modeling adsorption kinetic studies could be selected to determine the rate of the removal process of pollutants through adsorption to determine the reaction pathway for this purpose several adsorption kinetic models are being studied to understand the adsorption kinetics 63 64 the linear equations of employed adsorption models are written in table 3 where k1 min 1 phenol adsorption rate constant for pseudo first order kinetics k2 min 1 pseudo second order adsorption rate constant qe mg g removal quantity of phenol at stability stage qt mg g removal quantity of phenol at any degradation time ci thickness of boundary layer ki intraparticle diffusion rate constant kinetic graphs are shown in fig 7 and their experimental results are shown in table 4 it would be seen that two adsorption models of pseudo first order and type i pseudo second order were scrutinized as prime equations with adequate competence because of r2 near to one additionally predicted and empirical phenol removal values showing sufficient correlation with a small difference revealing the fitness of both adsorption models the remaining other types of pseudo second order models exposed their inapplicability because of lower r2 in addition the prominent deviation between predicted and empirical values was also screening their unworkability the predicted values qe cal for pseudo first order and types of pseudo second order adsorption models progressively declined this could be attributable to the development of additional barriers on the active surface of alkaline based tnts at high phenol concentrations 65 the straight form of plotting for the intraparticle diffusion adsorption model is exposed in fig 6 c which established that the entire plot was a not capable to proceed throughout zero this would affirming that intraparticle diffusion is not rate governing step the larger ci outcomes associated with phenol concentration indicates that the boundary layer has a significant effect 66 67 5 3 adsorption equilibrium modeling when designing adsorption systems adsorption isotherm models are recognized to be essential considering that they contribute a convenient data related to the absorption distribution during the fluid and material phases over numerous concentrations for this purpose several isotherm models are employed for assessing the adsorption properties of adsorbent 68 69 the linear equations of different isotherms are written in table 5 where qm mg g extreme removal quantity of phenol qe mg g removal quantity of phenol at stability stage ce mg l concentration of phenol at stability stage kl langmuir isotherm constant n dimensionless factor kf freundlich isotherm constant kt temkin isotherm constant ε polanyi potential e mean adsorption energy kdr d r isotherm constant and ke elovich isotherm constant the isotherm graphs are shown in fig 8 and their results are given in table 6 the isotherm results show that adsorption isotherms namely langmuir and freundlich were found to be more applicable for justifying the phenol removal attitude over alkaline based tnts because their r2 of 0 994 and 0 991 respectively moreover the langmuir equilibrium process also contributes extreme adsorption competency up to 9 356 mg g in the case of freundlich equilibrium the value of n is smaller than which revealed the favorable removal process onto alkaline based tnts under used experimental conditions the remaining isotherm such as temkin d r and elovich models produced relatively lower r2 of 0 915 0 712 and 0 976 respectively than langmuir and freundlich isotherms this indicated that these isotherms are not suitable to demonstrate the phenol removal process over alkaline based tnts 5 4 adsorption thermodynamics modeling estimating whether the process is spontaneous requires thermodynamic considerations of the adsorption process the important thermodynamic parameters in which gibbs free energy change δgo enthalpy change δho and entropy change δso are computed by applying temperature based empirical results and given in table 7 the following equations are admirable to expose these parameters 15 δ g δ h t δ s 16 δ g r t l n k d 17 l o g k d δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 r t 18 k d q e c e among them kd distribution rate constant t k temperature of phenol suspension r j mol k universal gas constant the results illustrated that the photocatalytic degradation of phenol was gradually increased from 298 to 338 k via employing alkaline based tnts as adsorbent the use of alkaline based tnts adsorbent gives negative δgo this designates that the phenol adsorption is thought to be practical and spontaneous these outcomes are observable in almost everyone and the same spontaneity indicates the relative temperature at which adsorption occurs 65 the positively δho disclosed endothermic properties of the phenol removal process ratifying that the entire experimental study is widely accepted endothermic action can proceed by raising the temperature of phenol to the outer boundary layer so using more adsorbing pores in general the chemisorption values for δho are ranging from 80 to 200 kj mol and physisorption ranging from 2 1 to 20 9 kj mol 70 the positively δso approved a random increase in the liquid solid interface throughout absorption therefore this is a physical process involving electrostatic influence among phenol molecules and alkaline based tnts as adsorbent 5 5 activation energy analysis the activation energy of phenol removal mechanism was designed through the following arrhenius equation at different temperatures 71 19 k a e x p e a r t among them a arrhenius constant in g mgmin k rate constant in g mgmin and ea activation energy in kj mol the resulting ea predicts regarding removal mechanism in terms of chemisorption or physisorption processes fig 9 used to calculate the several thermodynamic parameters and activation energy values in general ea ranging from 0 to 40 kj mol showed a physisorption removal mechanism and ea ranging from 40 to 800 kj mol illustrated physisorption removal mechanism 72 ea for alkaline based tnts was obtained as 22 178 kj mol intensifying the physisorption process the results predict that alkaline based tnts as adsorbent revealed efficient phenol removal aptitude 6 conclusions in the present study two well known electron acceptors especially fecl3 and h2o2 have been successfully operated for the first time along alkaline based tnts in the photocatalysis system under a visible light source phenol was used as model organic pollutants the results showed that both oxidizing agents have strong capabilities to develop additional hydroxyl radicals to minimize the reconsolidation rate of photogenerated electrons and hole pairs the phenol removal efficiency was reported to be 94 11 and 97 63 in the existence of fecl3 and h2o2 respectively tnts were prepared according to literature via a simple hydrothermal process under an alkaline environment alkaline based tnts were characterized through several characterization techniques namely xrd tem bet surface area ftir and drs langmuir hinshelwood degradation rate kinetic model was practiced explaining phenol degradation under fecl3 and h2o2 using reaction rate constant two adsorption models of pseudo first order and type i pseudo second order were scrutinized as prime equations to explain adsorption mechanism with adequate competence because of higher r2 near to one in isotherm studies langmuir models and freundlich models were more applicable to phenol experimental results owing to higher r2 and supreme adsorption capacity up to 9 359 mg g several thermodynamic parameters discovered that the phenol adsorption system is suggested to be more favorable spontaneous and physical in nature the present research concludes that established green and eco friendly photocatalysis system via employing alkaline based tnts could be more feasible for the
