14950,drinking water and wastewater utilities are in the business of making clean water not using clean energy and the ongoing energy transition is swiftly creating new challenges for which they are unprepared at this critical juncture in the water energy nexus this making waves article explores how the research community can support water utilities during the transition as features like renewables flexible loads and dynamic markets become standard researchers can help water utilities implement existing energy management techniques not yet widely practiced including establishing energy policies managing energy data using low energy intensity water sources and participating in demand response programs new research priorities are dynamic energy pricing on site renewable energy micro grids and integrated water and energy demand forecasting water utilities have adapted to many technological and regulatory changes over the years and with research support for new designs and operations they will thrive in a clean energy future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords energy transition renewable energy water utility drinking water wastewater forecasting data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction drinking water and wastewater utilities which provide essential services to their communities are accustomed to making clean water not using clean energy they need energy mostly in the form of electricity to do their jobs lam et al 2017 sowby and burian 2017 chini and stillwell 2018 perhaps up to 3 of global energy use liu et al 2016 and those energy demands will likely increase with alternative water supplies climate change and stricter treatment standards while drinking water and wastewater utilities hereafter water utilities are generally prudent with energy and manage it well at a basic level details like its unit price source timing and carbon content have had little bearing on their day to day decisions the status quo however seems to be founded on the erroneous assumption that all energy is created equal today the self evident truth is that energy is diverse in its environmental impacts and that global climate change particularly the role of anthropogenic carbon emissions in it ipcc 2022 is accelerating the need for clean energy the urgency of climate change combined with economic motivations and technological advances is driving a momentous energy transition solomon and krishna 2011 markard 2018 that is swiftly creating challenges for which water utilities are unprepared this making waves article describes the emerging challenges of the energy transition and how the research community can help water utilities address them i write it from my perspectives as a technical advisor in energy management programs with over 80 american and canadian water utilities as vice chair of the american water works association s awwa s energy management committee as chair of awwa s forthcoming energy manual and as an engineering consultant researcher and educator 2 water and wastewater utilities must adapt to a future built on clean energy modern water utilities came of age in the twentieth century when fossil fuels were abundant and emissions were not as troubling as they are today with cheap and plentiful coal and gas fired electricity water utilities plugged in pumps mixers filters and blowers to meet growing communities needs for water services like other industries reliable affordable water services are due in large part to reliable affordable electricity built on fossil fuels gross 2020 it appears to me that water utilities implicitly but not unreasonably assumed that energy would always be there leading to design and operational practices that did not fully consider the eventual replacement of energy derived from fossil fuels with alternative cleaner options that have different constraints to be clear i do not mean that water utilities deliberately waste energy just that supplying clean water is their primary goal and that if they need to use more energy to do it they will it is the cost of doing business water operators know for example that when a storage tank level drops too low they can switch on a pump to fill it back up or that when turbidity breaks through a rapid sand filter they can force another backwash appropriately when faced with risking a public health crisis or spending more energy a sensible operator will choose the latter in other words water utilities are accustomed to having the discretion to use almost any amount of energy at any time for any reason for a relatively low price water utilities like things to be standardized and predictable and the ability to call on energy suits them well today that game is changing according to yan 2020 key characteristics of the ongoing energy transition are increased penetration of renewable energy responses to the flexibility of energy systems expansion of low carbon and distributed energy resources development of energy storage technologies digitalization of the energy sector deployment of negative emissions technologies as the energy transition unfolds steady burning coal and gas are being replaced by intermittent wind and solar fixed tariffs are yielding to dynamic digital marketplaces where electricity prices change minute by minute once constant processes have to ramp down to avoid overloading the electric grid at peak times or ramp up to consume more clean power before it is gone put simply water utilities need to adapt and use energy differently than before how are they supposed to keep up the water industry s past and future energy paradigms are clearly incompatible table 1 without adaptations their paths could further diverge the present moment is a time of challenge for water utilities caught in the transition and simultaneously an opportunity for them to pivot to a future built on clean energy patel et al 2022 this is a critical juncture in the water energy nexus but water utilities have adapted to many technological and regulatory changes over the years to succeed in the new energy paradigm water utilities must 1 become competent in existing energy management techniques and 2 develop new design and operation practices to match the new conditions the research community can support both activities 3 the transition requires energy management techniques water utilities do not yet widely practice where do water utilities start on the path to energy management fortunately the subject is not new and much guidance is already available from professional associations government agencies non profits and power companies the list is long but a few stand out like the u s department of energy s better plants program and reports by the u s environmental protection agency epa new york state energy research development authority nyserda awwa and focus on energy the difficulty as usual is application what water utilities need is greater exposure to and practice with the concepts here are a few energy management techniques i view as priorities for water utilities to learn while the fundamental research on each of these topics is well developed more work is needed to move the concepts into practice particularly in the form of case studies co developed with water utility practitioners sowby and walski 2021 3 1 energy management policy in my opinion too few water utilities have embraced energy management as a core value their very missions depend on it nothing happens without energy water utilities with energy management policies use less energy than comparable ones without them sowby 2018 but many water utilities still lack such policies an organizational commitment to managing energy provides a vision for everyone involved epa 2008 and given the changing energy landscape having a guiding set of principles around energy is now more important than ever in other industries the positive effect of voluntary energy management policies is well documented geller et al 2006 tanaka 2011 water utilities could benefit from additional research on the type scope and effectiveness of energy management policies specific to them as well as guidance on best practices to craft and adopt such policies for their unique circumstances once a policy basis is established other adjustments necessary for thriving in the energy transition will come more naturally 3 2 data management one of the biggest obstacles to managing energy at the water utility level is having the right information for reasons described by chini and stillwell 2017 and sowby et al 2019 water utilities struggle to track basic energy use data even at coarse monthly and yearly scales when most of them already track pressure flow and water quality parameters at multiple sites at sub hourly intervals extending the same practice to energy should be natural going forward water utilities need to be as good at handling energy data as they are at handling water data as energy transactions become more dynamic and digital the water sector must step up its efforts to manage the corresponding data in its own favor researchers may help water utility staff develop programs of energy data acquisition analysis and action for this purpose blending technical components like meters databases and dashboards with human resources in a clean energy future energy data will be the new language and energy literate water utilities will be well positioned to succeed 3 3 water source selection just as energy can be saved through optimal pump scheduling energy can be saved through optimal dispatching of water sources for large water systems with multiple interchangeable water sources one unsophisticated but underutilized technique is source selection taught in water oriented energy management programs with great success source selection means adding energy intensity to the existing decision process for dispatching water sources a process that may include water rights treatment capacity and environmental concerns and prioritizing the least energy intensive water sources whenever possible sowby et al 2017 it is powerful because it is an operational solution that immediately saves energy without a capital investment just analysis and discipline but while simple in concept source selection is difficult in practice because it requires data to determine each water source s energy footprint and a policy to prefer the best ones hence the previous two recommendations after bridging the policy and data gaps researchers can help water utilities take the next step to update their operational strategies with the energy transition in mind 3 4 demand response participation in the energy transition power utilities need to balance loads more carefully than they have in the past they need to maximize production and consumption when the sun shines and the wind blows and then shed demand when renewables cannot keep up because water utilities are concentrated electric demands but have storage in the form of tanks and reservoirs that allows them to temporarily shift certain operations they are excellent candidates for demand response flexible load management and can be part of the solution liu and mauter 2020 liu et al 2021 sowby 2021 zohrabian et al 2021 in demand response programs water utilities are compensated for voluntarily shutting down some operations to help balance the electric grid at critical times essentially selling back grid capacity and becoming a partner with power utilities demand response is underutilized among water utilities and as sowby 2021 suggested researchers can help by studying water operators risk perceptions identifying processes that can be shifted finding ways to stabilize hourly flow variations and preparing case studies with water utilities 4 research can support water utilities in new designs and operations besides getting existing energy management techniques to further penetrate into the water sector new ones suited to the energy transition need to be developed what can the research community do to help i see three areas to prioritize 4 1 preparation for dynamic energy pricing demand response can achieve occasional voluntary reductions from a few large power users but broader ongoing reductions will be necessary to stabilize the future grid with fixed energy prices however customers have little incentive to alter their behavior dynamic pricing time varying price signals based on available grid capacity is therefore essential dutta and mitra 2017 dynamic pricing is already active in certain energy markets and will expand as renewables meet a greater share of energy demand so water utilities should prepare future finances equipment and staff to operate under conditions where energy use may be cost prohibitive at certain times of day even wise water utilities that have already moved predictable operations to off peak times will have to go a step further researchers can help water utilities identify vulnerable subsystems optimize variably priced energy document successful transitions to dynamic pricing and canonize best practices for others to follow 4 2 on site renewable energy micro grids electricity has historically been provided to customers by a monopolized grid today distributed energy resources der like photovoltaic pv solar power enable individual customers to generate enough electricity on site to sustain some or all of their demands some or all of the time water utilities whose facilities often have large footprints that could accommodate solar wind biogas battery and even geothermal resources may benefit from establishing their own on site micro grids kenway et al 2019 as an infrastructural solution micro grids would offset a portion of their energy demand buffer them from the vicissitudes of dynamic pricing and increase their resilience to outages from a single power utility strazzabosco et al 2020 concluded that biogas and solar pv are the most important renewable energy technologies to water utilities and that reducing the cost of energy is the main driver for investing in them the prospect is especially appealing for desalination and other highly energy intensive water supplies future work should explore applications of micro grids specifically for water utilities including effective layouts modeling methods implementation design and performance monitoring 4 3 integrated water and energy demand forecasting in order to truly succeed in dynamic pricing and other aspects of the future energy market both water and energy demand need to be known in advance until the two can be combined any attempt to win at dynamic pricing will be reactive instead of proactive water demand forecasting donkor et al 2014 brentan et al 2017 and real time water distribution control creaco et al 2019 have improved but the undeveloped next step is to forecast the associated energy demand and create a plan to minimize it instead of water utilities automatically expecting power deliveries from their power utilities regardless of capacity and power utilities merely reacting to whatever loads water utilities impose on them power can be coordinated at times and places that are beneficial to both parties for the water utility this is largely an operational activity relying heavily on the data management source selection and micro grid potential described above but it also requires new innovations in energy forecasting market analytics rapid optimization and system control to succeed the technology must progress through fundamental research computer simulation and pilot testing with real utilities demonstrating both reliability and value coordinated near real time forecasting and optimization of water and energy demand applied at scale to water and wastewater utilities would be a breakthrough for the industry 5 advancing a successful research program while noble the desire to do research is not enough for it takes a supply chain of people funding and facilities to succeed to advance the agenda outlined above i encourage researchers to pursue research activities both of the broad fundamental nature e g developing design standards or modeling methods for the general industry and of the specific applied nature e g executing case studies or tackling location specific problems either way i view collaborating with water utilities and power utilities as essential as they are the stakeholders in question and research done without them may have little impact in helping them navigate the energy transition after initial seed funding larger research activities could eventually be funded by those same utility partners or by traditional research grants where a healthy ecosystem already exists to support clean energy research the work may occur in typical academic programs like engineering but many institutions also have interdisciplinary research labs organized around climate sustainability or infrastructure utilities where the work may also find a home fig 1 summarizes the proposed research priorities and these elements 6 conclusions water and wastewater utilities must adapt to a future built on clean energy their historic energy paradigm has led to design and operation practices that are incompatible with the changing energy market in order to transition successfully the water industry needs assistance from the research community the transition requires existing energy management techniques that water utilities do not yet widely practice establishing an energy policy managing energy data using low energy intensity water sources and participating in demand response programs all need greater support from researchers and application by water utilities researchers can support water utilities in new designs and operations for the energy transition areas to prioritize are dynamic energy pricing on site renewable energy micro grids and integrated water and energy demand forecasting advancing the necessary solutions will entail both fundamental research for the general industry and applied research for specific water utilities collaboration with water and power stakeholders is essential funding may come from these same stakeholders or from clean energy research grants and the work may occur in interdisciplinary labs organized around climate sustainability or infrastructure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

college of resources sichuan agricultural university chengdu 611130 china college of resources sichuan agricultural university chengdu 611130 china human and ecological health depends on the vitality of freshwater systems but these are increasingly threatened by cyanotoxins released from harmful algal blooms habs periodic cyanotoxin production although undesirable may be tolerable when there is enough time for cyanotoxins to degrade and dissipate in the environment but the year round presence of these toxins will be a chronic health for humans and ecosystems the purpose of this critical review is to document the seasonal shifts of algal species and their ecophysiological acclimatation to dynamic environmental conditions we discuss how these conditions will create successive occurrences of algal blooms and the release of cyanotoxins into freshwater we first review the most common cyanotoxins and evaluate the multiple ecological roles and physiological functions of these toxins for algae then the annual recurring patterns habs are considered in the context of global change which demonstrates the capacity for algal blooms to shift from seasonal to year round growth regimes that are driven by abiotic and biotic factors leading to chronic loading of freshwaters with cyanotoxins at last we illustrate the impacts of habs on the environment by compiling four health issues and four ecology issues emanating from their presence in the that covers atmosphere aquatic ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems our study highlights the annual patterns of algal blooms and proposes that a perfect storm of events is lurking that will cause the seasonal toxicity to become a full blown chronic toxicity in the context of the deterioration of habs highlighting a non negligible chronic health and ecological hazard graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal bloom ecophysiological roles species compositions cyanotoxins human and ecological health data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs result from the proliferation of diverse algal species mainly including cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae diatoms dinoflagellates green algae habs are a serious threat to human health because of their toxic secondary metabolites the existence of habs also deprives other aquatic organisms of a healthy living environment by monopolizing resources often by secreting phytotoxic and biotoxic substances that inhibit the normal growth and reproduction of other species in addition cyanobacterial blooms produce toxic secondary metabolites known as cyanotoxins there are 40 toxin producing cyanobacteria genera plus an unknown number of potentially toxic species sivonen and jones 1999 and they release hundreds of toxins variants into 60 of the cyanobacterial bloom in the world furthermore many cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates produce potent neurotoxins such as beta n methylamino l alanine bmaa saxitoxins and their various isomers catherine et al 2013 about 30 of the estimated 2000 dinoflagellate species on earth produce toxins that cause human illness mostly contracted from consuming shellfish or fish that bioaccumulated neurotoxic amino acids the occurrence of habs is environment dependent responding to nutrient accessibility temperature and light availability in vulnerable freshwater systems the ecological niche of habs has increased with global climate change because the combination of warmer water temperatures more uv radiation penetrating further into the water column plus extra nutrient loading gives the habs a competitive advantage over other aquatic organisms habs occur seasonally as these key environmental parameters fluctuate in freshwaters which leads to the successive occurrence of habs and their toxins the bloom forming species engage in intra and inter competition for space and other resources intra species competition is a strategy that allows algae populations to co occur or out compete similar species inter species competition explains why cyanobacterial blooms dominate in summer whereas diatoms and dinoflagellates are most numerous in the winter spring period in addition to the seasonal variation the relative abundance of various species within habs and their competitive interactions shows distinct patterns across the marine to freshwater continuum these biological interactions account for ecophysiological acclimatation of habs and their ability to grow in dynamic environmental conditions some reports do not distinguish cyanotoxins from algal toxins and tend to group cyanotoxins with algal toxins given that cyanobacteria diatom and dinoflagellate are all capable of synthesizing cyanotoxins this review paper directs attention to blooms of cyanobacteria and diatom dinoflagellate and focuses upon cyanotoxins our critical analysis begins by introducing common cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria and diatom dinoflagellate we deduced six ecological roles and five physiological functions of these toxins based on literature reports then we present the annual recurring patterns of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms leading to an explanation of how the shift of seasonal blooms regimes by cyanobacteria and diatom dinoflagellate due to global change could cause the yearlong occurrence of cyanotoxins in freshwaters at last we synthesized and summarized 4 health issues and four ecology issues arising from the extended impact of habs on the environment throughout the year from spring to winter considering the impacts on a seasonal and yearly basis 2 cyanotoxins 2 1 cyanotoxins and their toxicity cyanotoxins can be produced by cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates the structure of key compounds and their producers are summarized in table 1 toxicologically anatoxin a is a potent pre and post synaptic depolarizing agent which competes efficiently with acetylcholine being 100 times more selective for nicotinic receptors in neuromuscular junctions and the central nervous system mahmood and carmichael 1986 homoanatoxin a has nearly identical toxicological properties and the same mode of action as anatoxin a lilleheil et al 1997 bmaa is a slow acting toxin linked to the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex syndrome of guam and is suspected of contributing to chronic neurotoxicology in disorders like alzheimer s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cox et al 2003 both anabaenopeptins and cyanopeptolins are known inhibitors of serine proteases and protein phosphatases which are enzymes responsible for regulating several vital physiological and metabolic processes lenz et al 2019 the uracil moiety and the hydroxyl group are responsible for cylindrospermopsin toxicity banker et al 2001 cylindrospermopsin could irreversibly inhibit protein synthesis and glutathione synthesis in plant and animal cells rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 microcystins mcs are potent and specific inhibitors of protein phosphatase1 and 2a corbel et al 2014 bouaicha et al 2019 saxitoxin is one of the world s most potent natural toxins for instance its ld50 10 μg kg 1 bw after intraperitoneal injection in mice was more than 5 times higher than mc lr 50 μg kg 1 bw saxitoxin is a neurotoxin that acts as a selective sodium channel blocker thottumkara et al 2014 2 2 ecophysiological roles of freshwater cyanotoxins cyanotoxins biosynthesis is energetically and nutritionally costly so it must give an evolutionary advantage to algae cyanotoxins are stored intracellularly or released into the surrounding environment except for cylindrospermopsin the other toxins are retained in living cells of cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates and release into the surrounding environment when cells lyse these molecules may ensure the organism s functional niche ecological advantage or improve their fitness physiological efficiency we synthesized the six known ecological roles fig 1 and five physiological functions fig 2 of cyanotoxins 2 2 1 ecological roles of cyanotoxins 2 2 1 1 signal molecule some cyanotoxins are signal molecules for example mcs act as infochemicals controlling colony phenotypes the low concentration mcs producing genotypes have colonies 50 µm in contrast to the highest concentration mcs producing cells that grow colonies 100 µm gan et al 2012 other cyanobacterial cells sense the mcs released from lysed cyanobacteria and respond by synthesizing more mcs thereby enhancing their fitness to occupy their ecological niche schatz et al 2007 bmaa has chemical characteristics analogous to other signal molecules produced by prokaryotes these include high hydrophibility logkow 4 00 a low molecular weight of 118 da and a rapid diffusion coefficient of 0 78 zhang and whalen 2020 most cyanobacteria taxa produce bmaa and it is postulated to be a signal molecule for communication among cyanobacteria species cox et al 2005 other non protein amino acids that are chemically similar to bmaa such as gamma aminobutyric acid accumulate rapidly in plants under stress and initiate defense pathways against drought and insect herbivory bown and shelp 2016 2 2 1 2 programmed cell death participator mcs and bmaa may initiate programmed cell death of cyanobacteria under stressful environmental conditions the genetic basis for programmed cell death is the metacaspases which initiate targeted protein degradation in the apoptotic programmed cell death pathways with high catalytic efficiencies and strict substrate specificities asplund samuelsson et al 2016 phylogenetic analysis of cyanobacteria with 16s rna analysis revealed metacaspase orthologues which suggests that cyanobacteria initiate programmed cell death when they encounter stressful conditions bar zeev et al 2013 an increase in exogenous mcs and bmaa concentration could induce the expression of metacaspase genes and initiate programmed cell death as a negative feedback to control the size of cyanobacteria populations sigee et al 2007 2 2 1 3 intraspecific competition mcs could be allelochemicals which provide a selective and competitive advantage for mcs producing strains to access limited resources kaebernick and neilan 2001 for instance cyanobacteria may use mcs to inhibit non mcs producing organisms which allows the mcs producing strains to acquire more soluble nutrients or occupy more space van de waal et al 2011 the released mcs can be taken up and localized in the thylakoid membranes of non mcs producing strains where photosynthesis ii activity was inhibited phelan and downing 2014 cylindrospermopsin inhibits the production of mcs producing cyanobacteria species thereby reducing the fitness of the mcs producing cyanobacteria population rzymski et al 2014 mcs and anatoxin a govern the allelopathic interactions between mcs producing microcystis and anatoxin producing cyanobacteria strains dolichospermum previously anabaena this allelopathic interaction is linked to nutrient availability in the environment production of mcs and anatoxin a alters the dominant cyanobacteria species under different nutrient conditions giving their producers a competitive advantage for nutrient acquisition chia et al 2018 nitrogen availability is critical for the production of bmaa by cyanobacteria downing et al 2011 scott et al 2014 under nitrogen starvation non n fixing cyanobacteria are the dominant bmaa producers the bmaa produced by non n fixing cyanobacteria under nitrogen starvation could be taken up by n2 fixing cyanobacteria and inhibit their nitrogenase activity thus altering the competitive interactions among non n fixing and n fixing cyanobacteria bmaa production kills some of the n fixing cyanobacteria and nutrients released from their lysed cells is then recycled by the non n fixing cyanobacteria population besides bmaa blocks nitrogenase activity and constrains the growth of n fixing cyanobacteria thereby reducing their population size and liberating resources such as space and oxygen needed by the non n fixing cyanobacteria population zhang and whalen 2020 saxitoxin is less well studied in this regard although saxitoxin can kill the non saxitoxin producing cyanobacteria holland and kinnear 2013 there is a possibility that the saxitoxin producing cyanobacteria use this toxin to gain a competitive advantage over non saxitoxin producing cyanobacteria in environments with high ph or salt stress holland and kinnear 2013 2 2 1 4 phosphorus competition cylindrospermopsin is reportedly involved in phosphate biogeochemical cycling making cylindrospermopsin producing cyanobacteria the best competitors for inorganic phosphorus when inorganic phosphorus is limited cyanobacteria release cylindrospermopsin into the surrounding environment and induce metabolic changes in phytoplankton this stimulates the production and secretion of alkaline phosphatase into the extracellular environment the alkaline phosphatase transforms organic phosphorus compounds into bioavailable inorganic phosphorus which is rapidly absorbed by cylindrospermopsin producing cyanobacteria 2 2 1 5 feed deterrence cyanobacteria adapt their morphology and biochemical make up toxicity as defensive responses to grazers ger et al 2016 for instance mcs cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and saxitoxin can reduce zooplankton fitness in laboratory studies sadler and von elert 2014 the role of mcs as an anti grazer defense compound is better studied than that cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and saxitoxin mcs could assemble cyanobacteria into large colonies that slow or probihit zooplankton ingestion yang and kong 2012 another trait i e mcs toxicity may also deter grazings mcs inhibit eukaryotic phosphatase enzyme activity causing direct toxicity that reduces the growth and survival rate of zooplanktons such as daphnia and copepod wilson et al 2006 2 2 1 6 interspecific competition concurrent allelopathic interactions occur between cyanobacteria phytoplankton and macrophytes cyanobacteria that release mcs cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin a into the environment can inhibit the growth of other algal species and macrophytes thereby allowing these cyanotoxin producing organisms to access the limited resources keating 1978 2 2 2 physiological roles of cyanotoxins 2 2 2 1 iron regulation mcs interact with trace metal ions as trace metal complexing ligands and iron chelators siderophores and by detoxifying metals in cells facey et al 2019 given the inconsistent interactions between mcs and trace metals from one study to another the current belief is that mcs act primarily as transporters boosting iron transport through the cell membrane of cyanobacteria wang et al 2012 2 2 2 2 maintain sodium hemostasis saxitoxin acts as a selective sodium channel blocker and is linked to na homeostasis in cyanobacteria pomati et al 2003 like saxitoxin anatoxin a also binds to the nicotinic receptor on sodium channels which opens the channels and allows sodium ions to flow into the cell bownik 2010 several genera of cyanobacteria dolichospermum previously anabaena aphanizomenon chrysosporum cylindrospermopsis planktothrix produce both saxitoxin and anatoxin a cirés and ballot 2016 pearson et al 2010 this may allow these cyanobacteria to maintain na homeostasis in saline i e high na is associated with saxitoxin and nonsaline environments as low na concentration is linked to anatoxin a production 2 2 2 3 thylakoid structural supporter in cyanobacterial cells two thirds of mcs are localized in the thylakoid area which changes the thylakoid ultrastructure slightly shi et al 1995 young et al 2005 2 2 2 4 photosynthesis regulation cyanobacteria must protect their photosynthetic apparatus from damage by photooxidation and the protective effect could be enhanced by mcs and bmaa the mcs bioaccumulate preferentially in the thylakoid area where photosynthetic pigments and enzymes are found furthermore there are approximately 20 more photosynthetic pigments in the cells of mcs producing cyanobacteria microcystis than in non mcs producing cyanobacteria hesse et al 2001 young et al 2005 greater light intensity induces transcription of mcs biosynthesis gene mcyd in cyanobacteria which suggests that mcs may help to regulate photosynthesis deblois and juneau 2010 studies with biological soil crust from arid environments also suggest that mcs and bmaa prevent cyanobacteria damage from light radiation but their contribution depends upon the nitrogen availability to cyanobacteria cells downing et al 2015b in biological soil crusts with high nitrogen availability mcs buffer the oxygen evolution capacity under high light intensity thereby preventing excessive oxygen radical formation and associated light induced reaction center damage in nitrogen limited conditions bmaa appears to regulate oxygenic photosynthesis by blocking light signal transduction to protect cyanobacteria from oxidative damage under high light intensity zhang and whalen 2020 bmaa might also regulate chlorophyll a activity to avoid its photooxidation since bmaa is produced under nitrogen starvation conditions that induce chlorosis and the degradation of photosynthetic pigments it would be logical for bmaa to protect pigments in the xanthophyll cycle to dissipate light radiation before it damages the chloroplast or to inhibit the activity of chlorophyll a as proposed by downing et al 2012 and berntzon et al 2013 thus mcs offer protection from sudden onset high light stress whereas bmaa helps the cyanobacteria avoid and repair oxidative damage physiologically this allows the cyanobacteria to respond rapidly to variations in nitrogen availability and high light intensity with the assistance of these two toxins the cyanobacteria can simultaneously maintain the integrity of its photosynthetic apparatus while taking advantage of available nutrients for cellular metabolism growth and reproduction downing et al 2015a metcalf et al 2015 2 2 2 5 nitrogen metabolism as described above bmaa biosynthesis is associated with cellular nitrogen stress downing et al 2011 holtcamp 2012 cultures grown under nitrogen starvation conditions 10 μm may produce bmaa to initiate the ionotropic glutamate receptors iglurs and thus activate glutamate receptor cation ca2 channels which control ca2 movement and maintain the integrity of cellular membranes berntzon et al 2013 brenner et al 2003 another possible role for bmaa is to initiate the incorporation of ca2 into the carbon skeleton of 2 oxoglutarate after enzymatic reduction although it seems counterintuitive to use limited n resources to synthesize a non protein amino acid there is evidence that the primary amino n group in bmaa can be redistributed to glutamate and glutamine via transamination of the enzyme glutamine synthetase glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase gogat downing et al 2011 martı n figueroa et al 2000 therefore bmaa has important physiological functions that maintain the integrity of cyanobacteria cells under n starvation conditions and mechanisms to reassimilate the amino n portions of the molecule once the protective glutamate pathways are initiated cyanobacteria are the survivors of more than 3 0 billion years of evolution and architects of the great oxygenation event which occurred around 2 3 2 5 billion years ago the genes encoding for toxins were selected from billions of possible permutations that evolved over millennia although their ecophysiological effects are not completely understood there is no doubt that toxins fulfill multiple functions for cyanobacteria most of the current studies on the ecophysiological roles of toxins focus on mcs given that cyanobacteria produce many cyanotoxins besides mcs and diatoms dinoflagellates produce additional toxins it seems advisable to consider multiple cyanotoxins as well as their individual and synergistic effects to understand the importance of these bioactive molecules for phytoplankton huisman et al 2018 3 the annual patterns of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms and their cyanotoxins production in this section we first summarize and illustrate the annual patterns of freshwater cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms then we document the successive occurrences of cyanotoxins in response to dynamic environmental conditions that shift of the bloom regimes in freshwaters 3 1 abiotic factors driving the dynamic succession of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in magnitude frequency and duration due to the increasing anthropogenic nutrient inputs and climate change i e global warming rising co2 concentration higher frequency of high intensity rainfall events longer dry periods reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 shan et al 2019b a global survey of 2 058 water bodies in 2012 revealed 63 of them were eutrophic and 31 of the total surface area was eutrophic and this was associated with dominant cyanobacterial blooms during the summer zhang 2021 cyanobacterial blooms normally have more harmful species that produce cyanotoxins diatoms and dinoflagellates are two typical groups that usually form the winter spring habs accounting 5 diatoms and up to 75 dinoflagellates of the harmful phytoplankton species xiao et al 2018 many freshwater ecosystems have concurrent cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms table 1 notably many so called harmful algal species do not dominate the bloom biomass while some phytoplankton that are not classically considered as habs species are also habs like therefore in this study we refer to cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms as the combined increase in biomass relative to background levels of the toxin producing species which is not necessarily going to increase the total phytoplankton biomass flynn 2008 in freshwater ecosystems we assume nutrient accessibility temperature and light availability determine the size of phytoplankton ecological niches brun et al 2015 distinct ecological niches are linked to the major survival strategies that rely upon phytoplankton physiological and morphological traits the physiological and morphological traits of cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates indicated that they have separate and some overlapping ecological niches diatoms class bacillariophyceae are a group of unicellular photosynthetic and non motile eukaryotic algae with silica shells found in almost all types of habitats in freshwater and marine ecosystems zhang et al 2019 diatoms prefer cool nutrient rich environments they are typically r strategists r rule also called the resource ratio hypothesis and tend to have high maximum nutrient e g silicate and nitrogen uptake rates and disproportionately large storage vacuoles falkowski et al 2004 phosphate deficiency can limit the growth of diatoms lin et al 2016 diatoms grow well at 10 c and their optimal temperature range is typically 15 20 c zhou et al 2017 diatoms are also sensitive to variations in light intensity while some bloom forming diatoms have excellent survival in the dark dinoflagellates are unicellular mixotrophic organisms with vertical mobility belonging to the alveolata supertype bashenkhaeva et al 2017 dinoflagellates tend to bloom in warm and relatively nutrient poor waters i e low phosphorus and high n p ratio xiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 dinoflagellates are not very sensitive to nutrient conditions they have an intrinsically high affinity for phosphate and can hydrolyze organic phosphorus with alkaline phosphatase nitrate favors dinoflagellate growth and an increasing in nitrate supply could intensify the dinoflagellate blooms zhou et al 2017 dinoflagellates can grow well from 10 c but their optimal temperature range is typically 20 27 c they are less sensitive to the variations of light intensity than diatoms and the optimal light intensity for their growth is lower than that of the diatoms cyanobacteria are typically distinguished in two groups as n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing cyanobacteria based on nitrogen fixation ability they often thrive in calm hot and nutrient rich waters paerl and huisman 2008 warm temperature proper sunlight long water residence time low disturbance and abundant nutrients low n p ratio favor the growth of cyanobacteria brookes and carey 2011 cyanobacteria prefer assimilable ammonium to nitrate and nitrite for their metabolic requirements cyanobacteria also require appreciable quantities of phosphorus to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis in their c n p chemistry and for vital metabolic functions structural integrity energy relations and as an information carrier huisman et al 2018 optimal growth rates of cyanobacteria are at relatively high temperatures usually 25 c paerl and scott 2010 chlorophyll a is the major pigment used by cyanobacteria to capture light for photosynthesis they also contain other pigments such as the phycobiliproteins like allophycocyanin blue phycocyanin blue and sometimes phycoerythrine red these pigments absorb light in the green yellow and orange wavelengths 500 650 nm which is unique among phytoplankton species cyanobacteria gain a competitive advantage from their ability to grow at a lower light intensity and to photosynthesize with radiative energy from more wavelengths this enables cyanobacteria to grow in the shadow of other phytoplankton and eventually out compete them the different survival strategies of cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates result in the distinct patterns of their annual blooms zhang et al 2019 generally cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms recur annually following a successive pattern diatoms usually dominate late spring blooms cyanobacteria dominate summer fall blooms and a diatom dinoflagellate consortia dominate winter spring blooms in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems fig 3 diatoms are dominant in the spring blooms in three stages leblanc et al 2018 the first stage is the colonization of fast growing small species 10 µm after a strong mixing event during the ice breakup spring snowmelt and rainfall events that occur in early spring then a larger number of medium sized diatom species appear often forming long chains during the middle late spring season last as nutrients are consumed and temperature and light intensity increase in the late spring and early summer diatom species begin to decline some diatoms become senescent while others sink below the euphotic zone and come to rest as spores in the sediment spilling et al 2018 subsequently gas vesicles assist cyanobacteria to proliferate in the euphotic zone and thus occupy the warm layers of water where light penetrates during stratified summer conditions intense blooms of cyanobacteria especially non n fixing cyanobacteria are fueled by the increasing temperature during the summer along with anthropogenic nutrient inputs paerl and scott 2010 growth of the cyanobacterial bloom in the early summer reduces the nitrogen concentration and therefore n fixing cyanobacteria replace non n fixing cyanobacteria as dominant species the regime shift introduces new nitrogen from two sources the first nitrogen source is from the lysed cells of non n fixing cyanobacteria the second nitrogen source is the atmospheric nitrogen that is brought into the freshwater ecosystem by n fixing cyanobacteria with the increasing temperature and light intensity during the summer months n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing cyanobacteria co occur and compete for nitrogen non n fixing cyanobacteria out compete the n fixing cyanobacteria and the total cyanobacterial biomass gradually peaks during summer paerl and otten 2016 as the bloom develops further the available nitrogen concentration declines abruptly in the late summer months again n fixing cyanobacteria out compete non n fixing cyanobacteria and regain their dominant status huisman et al 2018 cyanobacteria deplete the bioavailable nutrients and the temperature and light intensity diminish causing the cyanobacterial bloom to decline and eventually collapse around the late summer to fall many cyanobacteria die during the collapse phase but some cells differentiate into akinetes and hormogonia which sink to the sediments where they overwinter and wait for favorable conditions to start a new round of bloom hense and beckmann 2010 the next successional state in annual cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms is dominated by the diatom dinoflagellate group decomposition of collapsed cyanobacterial bloom releases ammonium as much as 90 of released total nitrogen that is available for primary production for 10 days supporting the reappearance and bloom of diatoms in the late fall to the early winter yan et al 2017 the bloom declines as temperatures decline 0 c and days become shorter causing the diatom resting spores at the end of the late fall early winter bloom sink below the euphotic zone into sediments spilling et al 2018 some diatoms remain active by colonizing vertical channels in the ice where light and nutrients can be accessed d souza et al 2013 from winter to spring the dominant diatoms and dinoflagellates are functional surrogates although dinoflagellates can outgrow diatoms in some environments and were observed to form dense blooms in ice covered lakes during winter zhang et al 2019 in addition many dinoflagellates can endure short and long term periods of cold in the dark and proliferate in stratified water columns beneath the ice during winter park et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 as the temperature rises from winter to spring the n p ratio in the water column declines which drives the succession of dominant species from dinoflagellates to diatoms xiao et al 2018 dinoflagellates from the declining bloom sink as resting cysts or lyse in the water column and contribute phyto detritus spilling et al 2018 the spores and cysts of diatoms and dinoflagellates that remain in the water body will populate future blooms which has year round repercussions in ice covered freshwaters hampton et al 2015 kong et al 2021 3 2 species interactions biotic factors during the dynamics of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms ecological interactions among cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates influence the successive presence of bloom species in a particular freshwater environment zhou et al 2020 however few studies explained how biotic factors controlled the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate succession it is more challenging to quantify biotic factors than abiotic determinants like water temperature and nutrient availability microbial community interactions during cyanobacterial blooms are fairly well understood but the link between cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates is less studied possibly because most reports about diatom and dinoflagellate biotic interactions are from marine systems rather than freshwaters shi et al 2022 j zhou et al 2020 we are providing some ideas to stimulate research on how species interactions trigger the shift succession of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms in freshwater bloom species interact with various microorganisms in a variety of ways from parasitism antagonism to commensalism and mutualism ramanan et al 2016 these interactions are documented among cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate and between this group and other microbiomes particularly with archaea zooplankton viruses and heterotrophic bacteria during bloom seasons fig 4 the archaea and bloom species interact with cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms primarily via commensalism and mutualism fig 4a blooms produce phyto detritus that is a carbon source for archaea while the archaea contribute by processing complex compounds into micromolecules e g methanocellales and removing excessive ammonium waste e g methanocellales schwarz et al 2008 zhou et al 2018 zooplankton mainly interacts with bloom species via parasitism and commensalism fig 4b since most zooplanktons are phytoplankton grazers they provide top down control that accelerates the decline and collapse of blooms zhou et al 2018 zooplankton can also remineralize nutrients contained in the bloom detritus which can release sufficient nitrogen to support the growth of some bloom species e g cylindrospermopsis raciborskii ferber et al 2004 viruses act like parasites since lytic viruses can end a bloom event by infecting the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate species resulting in cell lysis fig 4c nagasaki 2008 ory et al 2010 in contrast bacteria are generally beneficial for the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate bloom this is due to the mutualistic effect of bacteria on biogeochemical cycling orchestrated nutrient exchange micro food web structure mutual support with growth factors quorum sensing and episodic killing of competitors fig 4d cirri and pohnert 2019 cook et al 2020 ramanan et al 2016 still heterotrophic bacteria may have antagonistic or commensalistic associations with bloom species because they compete for scarce resources exhibit algicidal activity and elicit oxidative stress in bloom species fig 4d chun et al 2020 interkingdom interactions that alter cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate population dynamics are expected to increase the resilience of the involved communities cirri and pohnert 2019 bloom species and their associated microbiome may perform ecological functions by working together as a microbial module unit based on the relation continuum mechanism huang et al 2022 ramanan et al 2016 j zhou et al 2020 since bloom species exhibit an ebb and flow pattern when dynamically responding to changes in environmental parameters this suggests that interactions with associated microbes are fluctuating at the same time the annual pattern of recurrent cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms may in fact be a simplification of a more complex cascading network linked to interannual successional pattern in freshwater microbial communities rapid advances in molecular techniques hold promise for in depth investigation of the combined ecological functions of bloom species archaea zooplankton virus heterotrophic bacteria continuum and should extend our knowledge of the biotic drivers in these complex communities chen et al 2020 tromas et al 2017 j zhou et al 2020 3 3 production of cyanotoxins during blooms cyanobacterial blooms produce various toxins while toxic diatom and dinoflagellate blooms produce some of the same neurotoxins i e bmaa and saxitoxins as cyanobacteria table 1 the summer fall cyanobacterial blooms followed by winter spring diatom dinoflagellate blooms make the year round occurrence of toxins a potential concern still it is difficult to predict whether a bloom event will trigger cyanotoxins production part of the difficulty is related to the methods of toxins extraction and quantification as well as the way that toxins production is expressed such as protein content gene expression enzyme activities chlorophyll a and dry weight kuniyoshi et al 2013 a cause and effect relationship does not exist between toxins production and environmental conditions in freshwater environments even if cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates produce toxins in controlled experiments there are many strains of these organisms in different parts of the world and their activity is probably not comparable in the lab and field environments yuan et al 2014 still there is a consensus that global warming with excessive allochthonous nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus is fuel for the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate bloom fire and that toxins can be produced during the entire bloom period in freshwater environments around the world the annual pattern of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms could cause a year long occurrence of toxins in freshwater this is because cyanotoxins are likely to occur with cyanobacterial blooms during summer and fall and specific toxins produced by the diatom dinoflagellate groups can be released from winter to spring as global change is creating environmental conditions that allow for consecutive production of cyanotoxins by cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms we predict that the combined effects of global warming intensive anthropogenic nutrient loading due to high intensity rainfall events and longer dry periods in freshwaters will create a longer season of toxic blooms and prolong their toxins productions our prediction of prolonged toxins production in freshwater environments is supported by a number of reports for instance paerl and otten 2013 proposed that global warming which increases storm events and creates stronger stratification and longer dry periods due to drought will exacerbate a positive feedback loop that competitively displaces nontoxic cyanobacterial strains paerl and otten 2013 this is expected to favor cyanobacteria that produce mcs light limitation e g due to high turbidity after heavy rainfall events together with excess nitrogen and carbon supply could enhance mc rr production reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 van de waal et al 2009 also seasonal nutrient loading from the surrounding agricultural landscape influenced the composition of toxic cyanobacteria species and triggered bmaa production zhang and whalen 2020 considering the specific drivers of cyanotoxins production we note that the production of mcs tends to occur when cyanobacteria are growing with ample nitrogen while cylindrospermopsin bmaa and anatoxin a were triggered under stressful conditions caused by nutrient deficiencies scott et al 2014 nitrogen is one of the most important drivers of mcs bmaa and anatoxin a production while phosphorus is a critical driver of cylindrospermopsin production the phosphorus limited conditions in early summer have created a cyanobacteria strategy to acquire phosphorus apparently by releasing cylindrospermopsin into freshwater as a way of eliminating competitors for this limiting nutrient in the early cyanobacterial bloom bácsi et al 2006 raven 2010 the intracellular toxins mcs anatoxin a saxitoxins and bmaa are released into freshwater following the lysis of cyanobacteria cells so these substances are generally detected when cyanobacterial blooms decline and collapse during the end of summer and fall months high nitrogen concentrations stimulate the activity of toxic mc producing cyanobacteria species and induce the mcs production in freshwater as the mcs are nitrogen rich compounds with nitrogen for 14 of the molecular mass and can represent up to 2 of the cellular dry weight of microcystis rastogi et al 2014 the mcs concentration is positively associated with the nitrogen concentration in freshwater joung et al 2011 monchamp et al 2014 while phosphorus limited conditions had no effect on the production of mcs jankowiak et al 2019 a low n p ratio 10 50 favors the production of mcs nitrogen starvation is associated with greater production of bmaa and anatoxin a anatoxin a is mainly produced by n fixing cyanobacteria dolichospermum previously anabaena the production of anatoxin a was triggered under nutrient deficit conditions rather than nutrient enrichment conditions heath et al 2016 this was also associated with regime shifts between non n fixing cyanobacteria e g microcystis and n fixing cyanobacteria e g dolichospermum previously anabaena under nitrogen replete conditions the dominant mcs producing microcystis could inhibit the production of anatoxin a chia et al 2018 when nitrogen is deficient in freshwater dolichospermum previously anabaena could replace microcystis and become the dominant species in the freshwater environment davis et al 2009 under nitrogen deficient conditions both non n fixing and n fixing cyanobacteria can synthesize bmaa but this cyanotoxin is particularly crucial for the non n fixing cyanobacteria that produces 7 times more bmaa in nitrogen deficient than nitrogen sufficient environments cox et al 2005 main et al 2018 monteiro et al 2017 dinoflagellates i e winter species peridinium aciculiferum also produced toxins as an adaptive strategy to outcompete other winter phytoplankton in freshwaters rengefors and legrand 2001 the bmaa production by toxic diatoms and dinoflagellates is further evidence that the winter spring diatom dinoflagellate blooms may contribute to the toxins produced year round in freshwaters 4 chronic health and ecological issues caused by habs periodic toxins production although undesirable may be tolerable when there is enough time for cyanotoxins to degrade and dissipate in the environment cyanotoxins dissipate through biodegradation photodegradation and chemical hydrolysis reactions gao et al 2022 kurtz et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 microbially mediated degradation is believed to be the primary pathway for cyanotoxins elimination from freshwaters gao et al 2022 photolysis is expected to be of limited importance for cyanotoxins degradation especially for the intracellular cyanotoxins that are shielded from light exposure and released following the collapse of blooms in the late fall or winter spring months chemical hydrolysis reactions are thought to be a minor pathway to eliminate cyanotoxins from freshwater depending on the cyanotoxins variant degree of sunlight natural organic matter and the presence of bacteria in freshwaters typically the half life of anatoxin a was between a few hours to 14 days cylindrospermopsin was 11 to 56 days microcystins was 4 250 days and saxitoxins was 9 to 28 days no information is available on the half life of cyanopeptolins and bmaa in the northern hemisphere cyanobacterial blooms proliferate from may to october 180 days and diatom dinoflagellate blooms occur during october and may 180 days although the half life of most of the cyanotoxins does not exceed the duration of the bloom the consecutive production of cyanotoxins by the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms could make cyanotoxins present continually in freshwaters besides it is widely acknowledged that the highest cyanotoxins concentration coincides with cell lysis during the decline and collapse of blooms the cooler temperatures lower light intensity and changes in water chemistry during the fall winter spring months may allow cyanotoxins to persist in the freshwater system we postulate that the potential year round occurrence of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms will prolong the presence of cyanotoxins in this environment to the detriment of human and ecosystem health here we summarize 4 human health issues and 4 ecological risks resulting from persistent cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms in the freshwater environment fig 5 4 1 human health h1 drinking water crisis water sources contaminated by taste and odor compounds and toxins are the greatest health risks to humans and animals from cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms the taste and odor compounds can cause malodorous or unpalatable drinking water while the existence of toxins has caused several major drinking water crises in the world in 1996 at caruaru brazil at least 50 patients died with symptoms of neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity after being hemodialyzed by waters collected from a nearby reservoir direct evidence for cyanotoxicosis came from the detection of considerable amounts of mcs in the dialysis patient s blood samples this was the most fatal tragedy caused by toxin contaminated waters jochimsen et al 1998 the publicized drinking water crises in 1990 and 2007 caused by intensive cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu s watersheds wuxi china caused 116 factories to halt work and 3 million inhabitants were forced to use bottled drinking water qin et al 2010 in 2014 western lake erie blooms composed essentially of mcs led to beach closures and drinking water advisories on the canadian and us sides of the lake the drinking water supply to the city of toledo with 400 000 residents was shut down for several days steffen et al 2017 most recently in 2020 pools of drinking water containing neurotoxins produced by toxic algae were responsible for the deaths of 330 elephants in botswana h2 cyanotoxins contaminated food bioaccumulation of cyanotoxins in freshwater food products has been widely documented around the world these toxins include anatoxin a bmaa cylindrospermopsin mcs and saxitoxins galvao et al 2009 ibelings and chorus 2007 besides freshwater food products bmaa cylindrospermopsin and mcs are known to bioaccumulate in edible parts of agricultural plants that are irrigated with cyanobacteria contaminated water li et al 2019 machado et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 the health risk of consuming toxins contaminated aquatic products is greater to human than agricultural plants the concentration of toxins in aquatic and terrestrial products specifically mcs has exceeded the daily tolerance intake world health organization 0 04 mg mcs kg body mass day in many countries xiang et al 2019 the risks from acute and chronic exposure to toxic food products must not be underestimated especially considering the greater frequency and intensity of persistent toxic blooms in freshwater and irrigation water worldwide testai et al 2016 h3 recreation activities contact the most common human exposure to cyanotoxins is through recreational activities in water bodies where cyanobacterial blooms occur shan et al 2019a human could be exposed to toxins through intentional or incidental immersion and ingestion including primary contact activities e g swimming bathing wading windsurfing and waterskiing and secondary contact activities e g canoeing boating or fishing people may report at least one symptom of exposure to cyanotoxins after a recreational activity in water with cyanobacterial blooms reported symptoms included itchy skin rashes hay fever like symptoms gastrointestinal distress and allergic reactions as well as more severe symptoms such as headaches fever and blistering in the mouth backer et al 2010 the first acute case of cyanobacterial poisoning associated with mc producing cyanobacterial blooms in recreational water was reported in 2007 in this case the patient was diagnosed with atypical pneumonia and developed a hepatotoxicosis showing nausea abdominal pain fever dyspnea and respiratory distress giannuzzi et al 2011 h4 aerosolized cyanotoxins inhalation potential exposure to aerosolized toxins through direct inhalation is an area of growing concern plaas and paerl 2021 aerosolized toxins are more toxic than the same dose of orally ingested toxins probably because inhalation enhances the absorption of toxins into the bloodstream leading to systemic impacts benson et al 2005 olson et al 2020 besides chronic exposure to aerosolized toxins especially the neurotoxin bmaa is particular route of interest especially considering that diatom dinoflagellate blooms are new potential sources of these neurotoxins facciponte et al 2018 hu et al 2020 aerosolized toxins that enter the olfactory anatomy where there is no blood brain barrier in the cribriform plate gain easy access to the central nervous system banack et al 2015 inhabitants that live near or downwind of lakes where cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms occur may be more likely to report a greater incidence of chronic neurodegenerative disease possibly due to exposure to aerosolized bmaa for instance people living within 1 km of cyanobacteria contaminated new hampshire lakes in the united states had a 2 3 times greater risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inhabitants of lake mascoma in new hampshire had up to 25 times greater risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis than the general population banack et al 2010 caller et al 2009 4 2 ecological health e1 dead zone hypoxia oxygen depletion the aquatic organisms living in the shadow of algal blooms are prone to hypoxia which produces a dead zone at the early stage of cyanobacterial blooms the ability of cyanobacteria to grow at a low light intensity and to use radiative energy from more wavelengths for photosynthesis enables them to grow in the shadow of other phytoplankton and eventually out compete them cyanobacteria proliferation in the upper layers of the water column reduces water clarity and prevents sunlight from penetrating the water to reach submerged aquatic vegetation and benthic microalgae normally the submerged vegetation would photosynthesize and release oxygen to the oxygen supply in the freshwater environment holden 2016 during the decline and collapse of blooms dissolved oxygen is consumed so rapidly by decomposers that the oxygen level becomes insufficient to sustain aquatic animal life watson et al 2016 the hypoxia conditions are often established early in the summer and extend to the fall during the annual cyanobacterial blooms as the cyanobacteria community is still establishing early in the summer it is suspected that winter spring diatom dinoflagellate blooms are partly responsible for the early summer hypoxia reavie et al 2016 e2 toxicity to plants and soil water organisms cyanotoxins bioaccumulate in plants and animals but they also are toxic to these organisms the mostly studied cyanotoxins i e mcs and cylindrospermopsin negatively affect multiple plant physiological processes in addition mcs can stimulate or inhibit mitosis depending on the exposure dose machado et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 cyanotoxins are also directly toxic to soil organisms e g earthworms and nematodes and aquatic organisms e g zooplankton fish shrimp etc mcs can induce oxidative stress on earthworms and reduce their populations at environmentally relevant levels indicating the risk to soil ecosystems cao et al 2017 wen et al 2017 in freshwater environments cyanotoxins have well known detrimental impacts on aquatic organisms van apeldoorn et al 2007 the mcs anatoxin a cyanopeptides cylindrospermopsin bmaa and saxitoxin cause acute effects e g reduction in survivorship feeding inhibition paralysis chronic effects e g reduction in growth and fecundity biochemical alterations e g changing the activity of phosphatases glutathione s transferase and proteases and behavioral alterations the frequent detection of co occurring cyanotoxins in freshwater systems is an emerging concern since we do not fully understand their synergistic effects on ecological health zhang et al 2022 e3 taste and odor taste and odor compounds are noxious secondary metabolites that degrade the integrity aesthetics and safety of surface waters used for drinking and recreation and cause socioeconomic issues watson et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 most taste and odor events are associated with cyanobacterial blooms due to compounds like geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol ma et al 2013 although there are no health risks from taste and odor outbreaks these secondary metabolites frequently co occurred with cyanotoxins i e in 91 of blooms warning water purveyors to increase surveillance for taste and odor compounds and cyanotoxins so that water sanitation treatments can be modified accordingly graham et al 2010 e4 facilitator of green gas emission methane eutrophication is predicted to increase freshwater ch4 emissions by 30 to 90 during the 21st century cyanobacterial blooms in the water column are probably the main contributor to ch4 production beaulieu et al 2019 this is because cyanobacteria produce ch4 and were probably key players in the global ch4 cycle since their appearance on earth 3 2 to 3 5 billion years ago bižić et al 2020 the global occurrences of cyanobacterial blooms are apparently a major direct source of ch4 but these organisms also contribute indirectly to ch4 production large amounts of phytodetritus in the water column and sediments originated from cyanobacteria cells fermentation of this organic debris in an oxygen limited aquatic environment releases ch4 which represents 50 92 of the emitted carbon by mass yan et al 2019 yan et al 2017 it is no doubt that increased magnitude persistence and frequency of cyanobacterial blooms have accelerated the ch4 emissions from freshwaters impacting the global ch4 budget and acting as a positive feedback for global climate change 5 conclusion this synthesis explained why diverse freshwater algae have evolved cyanotoxins biosynthesis as a protective function and illustrated the recurring annual patterns of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms our greatest concern is that the shift in bloom regimes of the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate complex is causing more frequent detection of cyanotoxins that have public and ecological health consequences still there remain many research gaps that hinder us from visualizing and predicting the future evolution of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms in freshwater systems we support a systematic research program that will test the hypotheses related to the ecophysiological functions of cyanotoxins investigate the synergistic effects of cyanotoxins mixtures on humans plants and animals and track their interactions with other environmental health hazards we also stress the need to understand the species interactions in winter spring diatom dinoflagellate blooms as a key to the possible detection of environmental impacts caused by persistent year round blooms further we recommend further study of aerosolized cyanotoxins with an emphasis on bmaa a potent neurotoxin given the current interest in blue carbon to mitigate the atmospheric carbon footprint

college of resources sichuan agricultural university chengdu 611130 china college of resources sichuan agricultural university chengdu 611130 china human and ecological health depends on the vitality of freshwater systems but these are increasingly threatened by cyanotoxins released from harmful algal blooms habs periodic cyanotoxin production although undesirable may be tolerable when there is enough time for cyanotoxins to degrade and dissipate in the environment but the year round presence of these toxins will be a chronic health for humans and ecosystems the purpose of this critical review is to document the seasonal shifts of algal species and their ecophysiological acclimatation to dynamic environmental conditions we discuss how these conditions will create successive occurrences of algal blooms and the release of cyanotoxins into freshwater we first review the most common cyanotoxins and evaluate the multiple ecological roles and physiological functions of these toxins for algae then the annual recurring patterns habs are considered in the context of global change which demonstrates the capacity for algal blooms to shift from seasonal to year round growth regimes that are driven by abiotic and biotic factors leading to chronic loading of freshwaters with cyanotoxins at last we illustrate the impacts of habs on the environment by compiling four health issues and four ecology issues emanating from their presence in the that covers atmosphere aquatic ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems our study highlights the annual patterns of algal blooms and proposes that a perfect storm of events is lurking that will cause the seasonal toxicity to become a full blown chronic toxicity in the context of the deterioration of habs highlighting a non negligible chronic health and ecological hazard graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal bloom ecophysiological roles species compositions cyanotoxins human and ecological health data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs result from the proliferation of diverse algal species mainly including cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae diatoms dinoflagellates green algae habs are a serious threat to human health because of their toxic secondary metabolites the existence of habs also deprives other aquatic organisms of a healthy living environment by monopolizing resources often by secreting phytotoxic and biotoxic substances that inhibit the normal growth and reproduction of other species in addition cyanobacterial blooms produce toxic secondary metabolites known as cyanotoxins there are 40 toxin producing cyanobacteria genera plus an unknown number of potentially toxic species sivonen and jones 1999 and they release hundreds of toxins variants into 60 of the cyanobacterial bloom in the world furthermore many cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates produce potent neurotoxins such as beta n methylamino l alanine bmaa saxitoxins and their various isomers catherine et al 2013 about 30 of the estimated 2000 dinoflagellate species on earth produce toxins that cause human illness mostly contracted from consuming shellfish or fish that bioaccumulated neurotoxic amino acids the occurrence of habs is environment dependent responding to nutrient accessibility temperature and light availability in vulnerable freshwater systems the ecological niche of habs has increased with global climate change because the combination of warmer water temperatures more uv radiation penetrating further into the water column plus extra nutrient loading gives the habs a competitive advantage over other aquatic organisms habs occur seasonally as these key environmental parameters fluctuate in freshwaters which leads to the successive occurrence of habs and their toxins the bloom forming species engage in intra and inter competition for space and other resources intra species competition is a strategy that allows algae populations to co occur or out compete similar species inter species competition explains why cyanobacterial blooms dominate in summer whereas diatoms and dinoflagellates are most numerous in the winter spring period in addition to the seasonal variation the relative abundance of various species within habs and their competitive interactions shows distinct patterns across the marine to freshwater continuum these biological interactions account for ecophysiological acclimatation of habs and their ability to grow in dynamic environmental conditions some reports do not distinguish cyanotoxins from algal toxins and tend to group cyanotoxins with algal toxins given that cyanobacteria diatom and dinoflagellate are all capable of synthesizing cyanotoxins this review paper directs attention to blooms of cyanobacteria and diatom dinoflagellate and focuses upon cyanotoxins our critical analysis begins by introducing common cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria and diatom dinoflagellate we deduced six ecological roles and five physiological functions of these toxins based on literature reports then we present the annual recurring patterns of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms leading to an explanation of how the shift of seasonal blooms regimes by cyanobacteria and diatom dinoflagellate due to global change could cause the yearlong occurrence of cyanotoxins in freshwaters at last we synthesized and summarized 4 health issues and four ecology issues arising from the extended impact of habs on the environment throughout the year from spring to winter considering the impacts on a seasonal and yearly basis 2 cyanotoxins 2 1 cyanotoxins and their toxicity cyanotoxins can be produced by cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates the structure of key compounds and their producers are summarized in table 1 toxicologically anatoxin a is a potent pre and post synaptic depolarizing agent which competes efficiently with acetylcholine being 100 times more selective for nicotinic receptors in neuromuscular junctions and the central nervous system mahmood and carmichael 1986 homoanatoxin a has nearly identical toxicological properties and the same mode of action as anatoxin a lilleheil et al 1997 bmaa is a slow acting toxin linked to the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex syndrome of guam and is suspected of contributing to chronic neurotoxicology in disorders like alzheimer s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cox et al 2003 both anabaenopeptins and cyanopeptolins are known inhibitors of serine proteases and protein phosphatases which are enzymes responsible for regulating several vital physiological and metabolic processes lenz et al 2019 the uracil moiety and the hydroxyl group are responsible for cylindrospermopsin toxicity banker et al 2001 cylindrospermopsin could irreversibly inhibit protein synthesis and glutathione synthesis in plant and animal cells rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 microcystins mcs are potent and specific inhibitors of protein phosphatase1 and 2a corbel et al 2014 bouaicha et al 2019 saxitoxin is one of the world s most potent natural toxins for instance its ld50 10 μg kg 1 bw after intraperitoneal injection in mice was more than 5 times higher than mc lr 50 μg kg 1 bw saxitoxin is a neurotoxin that acts as a selective sodium channel blocker thottumkara et al 2014 2 2 ecophysiological roles of freshwater cyanotoxins cyanotoxins biosynthesis is energetically and nutritionally costly so it must give an evolutionary advantage to algae cyanotoxins are stored intracellularly or released into the surrounding environment except for cylindrospermopsin the other toxins are retained in living cells of cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates and release into the surrounding environment when cells lyse these molecules may ensure the organism s functional niche ecological advantage or improve their fitness physiological efficiency we synthesized the six known ecological roles fig 1 and five physiological functions fig 2 of cyanotoxins 2 2 1 ecological roles of cyanotoxins 2 2 1 1 signal molecule some cyanotoxins are signal molecules for example mcs act as infochemicals controlling colony phenotypes the low concentration mcs producing genotypes have colonies 50 µm in contrast to the highest concentration mcs producing cells that grow colonies 100 µm gan et al 2012 other cyanobacterial cells sense the mcs released from lysed cyanobacteria and respond by synthesizing more mcs thereby enhancing their fitness to occupy their ecological niche schatz et al 2007 bmaa has chemical characteristics analogous to other signal molecules produced by prokaryotes these include high hydrophibility logkow 4 00 a low molecular weight of 118 da and a rapid diffusion coefficient of 0 78 zhang and whalen 2020 most cyanobacteria taxa produce bmaa and it is postulated to be a signal molecule for communication among cyanobacteria species cox et al 2005 other non protein amino acids that are chemically similar to bmaa such as gamma aminobutyric acid accumulate rapidly in plants under stress and initiate defense pathways against drought and insect herbivory bown and shelp 2016 2 2 1 2 programmed cell death participator mcs and bmaa may initiate programmed cell death of cyanobacteria under stressful environmental conditions the genetic basis for programmed cell death is the metacaspases which initiate targeted protein degradation in the apoptotic programmed cell death pathways with high catalytic efficiencies and strict substrate specificities asplund samuelsson et al 2016 phylogenetic analysis of cyanobacteria with 16s rna analysis revealed metacaspase orthologues which suggests that cyanobacteria initiate programmed cell death when they encounter stressful conditions bar zeev et al 2013 an increase in exogenous mcs and bmaa concentration could induce the expression of metacaspase genes and initiate programmed cell death as a negative feedback to control the size of cyanobacteria populations sigee et al 2007 2 2 1 3 intraspecific competition mcs could be allelochemicals which provide a selective and competitive advantage for mcs producing strains to access limited resources kaebernick and neilan 2001 for instance cyanobacteria may use mcs to inhibit non mcs producing organisms which allows the mcs producing strains to acquire more soluble nutrients or occupy more space van de waal et al 2011 the released mcs can be taken up and localized in the thylakoid membranes of non mcs producing strains where photosynthesis ii activity was inhibited phelan and downing 2014 cylindrospermopsin inhibits the production of mcs producing cyanobacteria species thereby reducing the fitness of the mcs producing cyanobacteria population rzymski et al 2014 mcs and anatoxin a govern the allelopathic interactions between mcs producing microcystis and anatoxin producing cyanobacteria strains dolichospermum previously anabaena this allelopathic interaction is linked to nutrient availability in the environment production of mcs and anatoxin a alters the dominant cyanobacteria species under different nutrient conditions giving their producers a competitive advantage for nutrient acquisition chia et al 2018 nitrogen availability is critical for the production of bmaa by cyanobacteria downing et al 2011 scott et al 2014 under nitrogen starvation non n fixing cyanobacteria are the dominant bmaa producers the bmaa produced by non n fixing cyanobacteria under nitrogen starvation could be taken up by n2 fixing cyanobacteria and inhibit their nitrogenase activity thus altering the competitive interactions among non n fixing and n fixing cyanobacteria bmaa production kills some of the n fixing cyanobacteria and nutrients released from their lysed cells is then recycled by the non n fixing cyanobacteria population besides bmaa blocks nitrogenase activity and constrains the growth of n fixing cyanobacteria thereby reducing their population size and liberating resources such as space and oxygen needed by the non n fixing cyanobacteria population zhang and whalen 2020 saxitoxin is less well studied in this regard although saxitoxin can kill the non saxitoxin producing cyanobacteria holland and kinnear 2013 there is a possibility that the saxitoxin producing cyanobacteria use this toxin to gain a competitive advantage over non saxitoxin producing cyanobacteria in environments with high ph or salt stress holland and kinnear 2013 2 2 1 4 phosphorus competition cylindrospermopsin is reportedly involved in phosphate biogeochemical cycling making cylindrospermopsin producing cyanobacteria the best competitors for inorganic phosphorus when inorganic phosphorus is limited cyanobacteria release cylindrospermopsin into the surrounding environment and induce metabolic changes in phytoplankton this stimulates the production and secretion of alkaline phosphatase into the extracellular environment the alkaline phosphatase transforms organic phosphorus compounds into bioavailable inorganic phosphorus which is rapidly absorbed by cylindrospermopsin producing cyanobacteria 2 2 1 5 feed deterrence cyanobacteria adapt their morphology and biochemical make up toxicity as defensive responses to grazers ger et al 2016 for instance mcs cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and saxitoxin can reduce zooplankton fitness in laboratory studies sadler and von elert 2014 the role of mcs as an anti grazer defense compound is better studied than that cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and saxitoxin mcs could assemble cyanobacteria into large colonies that slow or probihit zooplankton ingestion yang and kong 2012 another trait i e mcs toxicity may also deter grazings mcs inhibit eukaryotic phosphatase enzyme activity causing direct toxicity that reduces the growth and survival rate of zooplanktons such as daphnia and copepod wilson et al 2006 2 2 1 6 interspecific competition concurrent allelopathic interactions occur between cyanobacteria phytoplankton and macrophytes cyanobacteria that release mcs cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin a into the environment can inhibit the growth of other algal species and macrophytes thereby allowing these cyanotoxin producing organisms to access the limited resources keating 1978 2 2 2 physiological roles of cyanotoxins 2 2 2 1 iron regulation mcs interact with trace metal ions as trace metal complexing ligands and iron chelators siderophores and by detoxifying metals in cells facey et al 2019 given the inconsistent interactions between mcs and trace metals from one study to another the current belief is that mcs act primarily as transporters boosting iron transport through the cell membrane of cyanobacteria wang et al 2012 2 2 2 2 maintain sodium hemostasis saxitoxin acts as a selective sodium channel blocker and is linked to na homeostasis in cyanobacteria pomati et al 2003 like saxitoxin anatoxin a also binds to the nicotinic receptor on sodium channels which opens the channels and allows sodium ions to flow into the cell bownik 2010 several genera of cyanobacteria dolichospermum previously anabaena aphanizomenon chrysosporum cylindrospermopsis planktothrix produce both saxitoxin and anatoxin a cirés and ballot 2016 pearson et al 2010 this may allow these cyanobacteria to maintain na homeostasis in saline i e high na is associated with saxitoxin and nonsaline environments as low na concentration is linked to anatoxin a production 2 2 2 3 thylakoid structural supporter in cyanobacterial cells two thirds of mcs are localized in the thylakoid area which changes the thylakoid ultrastructure slightly shi et al 1995 young et al 2005 2 2 2 4 photosynthesis regulation cyanobacteria must protect their photosynthetic apparatus from damage by photooxidation and the protective effect could be enhanced by mcs and bmaa the mcs bioaccumulate preferentially in the thylakoid area where photosynthetic pigments and enzymes are found furthermore there are approximately 20 more photosynthetic pigments in the cells of mcs producing cyanobacteria microcystis than in non mcs producing cyanobacteria hesse et al 2001 young et al 2005 greater light intensity induces transcription of mcs biosynthesis gene mcyd in cyanobacteria which suggests that mcs may help to regulate photosynthesis deblois and juneau 2010 studies with biological soil crust from arid environments also suggest that mcs and bmaa prevent cyanobacteria damage from light radiation but their contribution depends upon the nitrogen availability to cyanobacteria cells downing et al 2015b in biological soil crusts with high nitrogen availability mcs buffer the oxygen evolution capacity under high light intensity thereby preventing excessive oxygen radical formation and associated light induced reaction center damage in nitrogen limited conditions bmaa appears to regulate oxygenic photosynthesis by blocking light signal transduction to protect cyanobacteria from oxidative damage under high light intensity zhang and whalen 2020 bmaa might also regulate chlorophyll a activity to avoid its photooxidation since bmaa is produced under nitrogen starvation conditions that induce chlorosis and the degradation of photosynthetic pigments it would be logical for bmaa to protect pigments in the xanthophyll cycle to dissipate light radiation before it damages the chloroplast or to inhibit the activity of chlorophyll a as proposed by downing et al 2012 and berntzon et al 2013 thus mcs offer protection from sudden onset high light stress whereas bmaa helps the cyanobacteria avoid and repair oxidative damage physiologically this allows the cyanobacteria to respond rapidly to variations in nitrogen availability and high light intensity with the assistance of these two toxins the cyanobacteria can simultaneously maintain the integrity of its photosynthetic apparatus while taking advantage of available nutrients for cellular metabolism growth and reproduction downing et al 2015a metcalf et al 2015 2 2 2 5 nitrogen metabolism as described above bmaa biosynthesis is associated with cellular nitrogen stress downing et al 2011 holtcamp 2012 cultures grown under nitrogen starvation conditions 10 μm may produce bmaa to initiate the ionotropic glutamate receptors iglurs and thus activate glutamate receptor cation ca2 channels which control ca2 movement and maintain the integrity of cellular membranes berntzon et al 2013 brenner et al 2003 another possible role for bmaa is to initiate the incorporation of ca2 into the carbon skeleton of 2 oxoglutarate after enzymatic reduction although it seems counterintuitive to use limited n resources to synthesize a non protein amino acid there is evidence that the primary amino n group in bmaa can be redistributed to glutamate and glutamine via transamination of the enzyme glutamine synthetase glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase gogat downing et al 2011 martı n figueroa et al 2000 therefore bmaa has important physiological functions that maintain the integrity of cyanobacteria cells under n starvation conditions and mechanisms to reassimilate the amino n portions of the molecule once the protective glutamate pathways are initiated cyanobacteria are the survivors of more than 3 0 billion years of evolution and architects of the great oxygenation event which occurred around 2 3 2 5 billion years ago the genes encoding for toxins were selected from billions of possible permutations that evolved over millennia although their ecophysiological effects are not completely understood there is no doubt that toxins fulfill multiple functions for cyanobacteria most of the current studies on the ecophysiological roles of toxins focus on mcs given that cyanobacteria produce many cyanotoxins besides mcs and diatoms dinoflagellates produce additional toxins it seems advisable to consider multiple cyanotoxins as well as their individual and synergistic effects to understand the importance of these bioactive molecules for phytoplankton huisman et al 2018 3 the annual patterns of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms and their cyanotoxins production in this section we first summarize and illustrate the annual patterns of freshwater cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms then we document the successive occurrences of cyanotoxins in response to dynamic environmental conditions that shift of the bloom regimes in freshwaters 3 1 abiotic factors driving the dynamic succession of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in magnitude frequency and duration due to the increasing anthropogenic nutrient inputs and climate change i e global warming rising co2 concentration higher frequency of high intensity rainfall events longer dry periods reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 shan et al 2019b a global survey of 2 058 water bodies in 2012 revealed 63 of them were eutrophic and 31 of the total surface area was eutrophic and this was associated with dominant cyanobacterial blooms during the summer zhang 2021 cyanobacterial blooms normally have more harmful species that produce cyanotoxins diatoms and dinoflagellates are two typical groups that usually form the winter spring habs accounting 5 diatoms and up to 75 dinoflagellates of the harmful phytoplankton species xiao et al 2018 many freshwater ecosystems have concurrent cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms table 1 notably many so called harmful algal species do not dominate the bloom biomass while some phytoplankton that are not classically considered as habs species are also habs like therefore in this study we refer to cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms as the combined increase in biomass relative to background levels of the toxin producing species which is not necessarily going to increase the total phytoplankton biomass flynn 2008 in freshwater ecosystems we assume nutrient accessibility temperature and light availability determine the size of phytoplankton ecological niches brun et al 2015 distinct ecological niches are linked to the major survival strategies that rely upon phytoplankton physiological and morphological traits the physiological and morphological traits of cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates indicated that they have separate and some overlapping ecological niches diatoms class bacillariophyceae are a group of unicellular photosynthetic and non motile eukaryotic algae with silica shells found in almost all types of habitats in freshwater and marine ecosystems zhang et al 2019 diatoms prefer cool nutrient rich environments they are typically r strategists r rule also called the resource ratio hypothesis and tend to have high maximum nutrient e g silicate and nitrogen uptake rates and disproportionately large storage vacuoles falkowski et al 2004 phosphate deficiency can limit the growth of diatoms lin et al 2016 diatoms grow well at 10 c and their optimal temperature range is typically 15 20 c zhou et al 2017 diatoms are also sensitive to variations in light intensity while some bloom forming diatoms have excellent survival in the dark dinoflagellates are unicellular mixotrophic organisms with vertical mobility belonging to the alveolata supertype bashenkhaeva et al 2017 dinoflagellates tend to bloom in warm and relatively nutrient poor waters i e low phosphorus and high n p ratio xiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 dinoflagellates are not very sensitive to nutrient conditions they have an intrinsically high affinity for phosphate and can hydrolyze organic phosphorus with alkaline phosphatase nitrate favors dinoflagellate growth and an increasing in nitrate supply could intensify the dinoflagellate blooms zhou et al 2017 dinoflagellates can grow well from 10 c but their optimal temperature range is typically 20 27 c they are less sensitive to the variations of light intensity than diatoms and the optimal light intensity for their growth is lower than that of the diatoms cyanobacteria are typically distinguished in two groups as n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing cyanobacteria based on nitrogen fixation ability they often thrive in calm hot and nutrient rich waters paerl and huisman 2008 warm temperature proper sunlight long water residence time low disturbance and abundant nutrients low n p ratio favor the growth of cyanobacteria brookes and carey 2011 cyanobacteria prefer assimilable ammonium to nitrate and nitrite for their metabolic requirements cyanobacteria also require appreciable quantities of phosphorus to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis in their c n p chemistry and for vital metabolic functions structural integrity energy relations and as an information carrier huisman et al 2018 optimal growth rates of cyanobacteria are at relatively high temperatures usually 25 c paerl and scott 2010 chlorophyll a is the major pigment used by cyanobacteria to capture light for photosynthesis they also contain other pigments such as the phycobiliproteins like allophycocyanin blue phycocyanin blue and sometimes phycoerythrine red these pigments absorb light in the green yellow and orange wavelengths 500 650 nm which is unique among phytoplankton species cyanobacteria gain a competitive advantage from their ability to grow at a lower light intensity and to photosynthesize with radiative energy from more wavelengths this enables cyanobacteria to grow in the shadow of other phytoplankton and eventually out compete them the different survival strategies of cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates result in the distinct patterns of their annual blooms zhang et al 2019 generally cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms recur annually following a successive pattern diatoms usually dominate late spring blooms cyanobacteria dominate summer fall blooms and a diatom dinoflagellate consortia dominate winter spring blooms in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems fig 3 diatoms are dominant in the spring blooms in three stages leblanc et al 2018 the first stage is the colonization of fast growing small species 10 µm after a strong mixing event during the ice breakup spring snowmelt and rainfall events that occur in early spring then a larger number of medium sized diatom species appear often forming long chains during the middle late spring season last as nutrients are consumed and temperature and light intensity increase in the late spring and early summer diatom species begin to decline some diatoms become senescent while others sink below the euphotic zone and come to rest as spores in the sediment spilling et al 2018 subsequently gas vesicles assist cyanobacteria to proliferate in the euphotic zone and thus occupy the warm layers of water where light penetrates during stratified summer conditions intense blooms of cyanobacteria especially non n fixing cyanobacteria are fueled by the increasing temperature during the summer along with anthropogenic nutrient inputs paerl and scott 2010 growth of the cyanobacterial bloom in the early summer reduces the nitrogen concentration and therefore n fixing cyanobacteria replace non n fixing cyanobacteria as dominant species the regime shift introduces new nitrogen from two sources the first nitrogen source is from the lysed cells of non n fixing cyanobacteria the second nitrogen source is the atmospheric nitrogen that is brought into the freshwater ecosystem by n fixing cyanobacteria with the increasing temperature and light intensity during the summer months n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing cyanobacteria co occur and compete for nitrogen non n fixing cyanobacteria out compete the n fixing cyanobacteria and the total cyanobacterial biomass gradually peaks during summer paerl and otten 2016 as the bloom develops further the available nitrogen concentration declines abruptly in the late summer months again n fixing cyanobacteria out compete non n fixing cyanobacteria and regain their dominant status huisman et al 2018 cyanobacteria deplete the bioavailable nutrients and the temperature and light intensity diminish causing the cyanobacterial bloom to decline and eventually collapse around the late summer to fall many cyanobacteria die during the collapse phase but some cells differentiate into akinetes and hormogonia which sink to the sediments where they overwinter and wait for favorable conditions to start a new round of bloom hense and beckmann 2010 the next successional state in annual cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms is dominated by the diatom dinoflagellate group decomposition of collapsed cyanobacterial bloom releases ammonium as much as 90 of released total nitrogen that is available for primary production for 10 days supporting the reappearance and bloom of diatoms in the late fall to the early winter yan et al 2017 the bloom declines as temperatures decline 0 c and days become shorter causing the diatom resting spores at the end of the late fall early winter bloom sink below the euphotic zone into sediments spilling et al 2018 some diatoms remain active by colonizing vertical channels in the ice where light and nutrients can be accessed d souza et al 2013 from winter to spring the dominant diatoms and dinoflagellates are functional surrogates although dinoflagellates can outgrow diatoms in some environments and were observed to form dense blooms in ice covered lakes during winter zhang et al 2019 in addition many dinoflagellates can endure short and long term periods of cold in the dark and proliferate in stratified water columns beneath the ice during winter park et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 as the temperature rises from winter to spring the n p ratio in the water column declines which drives the succession of dominant species from dinoflagellates to diatoms xiao et al 2018 dinoflagellates from the declining bloom sink as resting cysts or lyse in the water column and contribute phyto detritus spilling et al 2018 the spores and cysts of diatoms and dinoflagellates that remain in the water body will populate future blooms which has year round repercussions in ice covered freshwaters hampton et al 2015 kong et al 2021 3 2 species interactions biotic factors during the dynamics of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms ecological interactions among cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates influence the successive presence of bloom species in a particular freshwater environment zhou et al 2020 however few studies explained how biotic factors controlled the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate succession it is more challenging to quantify biotic factors than abiotic determinants like water temperature and nutrient availability microbial community interactions during cyanobacterial blooms are fairly well understood but the link between cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates is less studied possibly because most reports about diatom and dinoflagellate biotic interactions are from marine systems rather than freshwaters shi et al 2022 j zhou et al 2020 we are providing some ideas to stimulate research on how species interactions trigger the shift succession of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms in freshwater bloom species interact with various microorganisms in a variety of ways from parasitism antagonism to commensalism and mutualism ramanan et al 2016 these interactions are documented among cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate and between this group and other microbiomes particularly with archaea zooplankton viruses and heterotrophic bacteria during bloom seasons fig 4 the archaea and bloom species interact with cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms primarily via commensalism and mutualism fig 4a blooms produce phyto detritus that is a carbon source for archaea while the archaea contribute by processing complex compounds into micromolecules e g methanocellales and removing excessive ammonium waste e g methanocellales schwarz et al 2008 zhou et al 2018 zooplankton mainly interacts with bloom species via parasitism and commensalism fig 4b since most zooplanktons are phytoplankton grazers they provide top down control that accelerates the decline and collapse of blooms zhou et al 2018 zooplankton can also remineralize nutrients contained in the bloom detritus which can release sufficient nitrogen to support the growth of some bloom species e g cylindrospermopsis raciborskii ferber et al 2004 viruses act like parasites since lytic viruses can end a bloom event by infecting the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate species resulting in cell lysis fig 4c nagasaki 2008 ory et al 2010 in contrast bacteria are generally beneficial for the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate bloom this is due to the mutualistic effect of bacteria on biogeochemical cycling orchestrated nutrient exchange micro food web structure mutual support with growth factors quorum sensing and episodic killing of competitors fig 4d cirri and pohnert 2019 cook et al 2020 ramanan et al 2016 still heterotrophic bacteria may have antagonistic or commensalistic associations with bloom species because they compete for scarce resources exhibit algicidal activity and elicit oxidative stress in bloom species fig 4d chun et al 2020 interkingdom interactions that alter cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate population dynamics are expected to increase the resilience of the involved communities cirri and pohnert 2019 bloom species and their associated microbiome may perform ecological functions by working together as a microbial module unit based on the relation continuum mechanism huang et al 2022 ramanan et al 2016 j zhou et al 2020 since bloom species exhibit an ebb and flow pattern when dynamically responding to changes in environmental parameters this suggests that interactions with associated microbes are fluctuating at the same time the annual pattern of recurrent cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms may in fact be a simplification of a more complex cascading network linked to interannual successional pattern in freshwater microbial communities rapid advances in molecular techniques hold promise for in depth investigation of the combined ecological functions of bloom species archaea zooplankton virus heterotrophic bacteria continuum and should extend our knowledge of the biotic drivers in these complex communities chen et al 2020 tromas et al 2017 j zhou et al 2020 3 3 production of cyanotoxins during blooms cyanobacterial blooms produce various toxins while toxic diatom and dinoflagellate blooms produce some of the same neurotoxins i e bmaa and saxitoxins as cyanobacteria table 1 the summer fall cyanobacterial blooms followed by winter spring diatom dinoflagellate blooms make the year round occurrence of toxins a potential concern still it is difficult to predict whether a bloom event will trigger cyanotoxins production part of the difficulty is related to the methods of toxins extraction and quantification as well as the way that toxins production is expressed such as protein content gene expression enzyme activities chlorophyll a and dry weight kuniyoshi et al 2013 a cause and effect relationship does not exist between toxins production and environmental conditions in freshwater environments even if cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates produce toxins in controlled experiments there are many strains of these organisms in different parts of the world and their activity is probably not comparable in the lab and field environments yuan et al 2014 still there is a consensus that global warming with excessive allochthonous nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus is fuel for the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate bloom fire and that toxins can be produced during the entire bloom period in freshwater environments around the world the annual pattern of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms could cause a year long occurrence of toxins in freshwater this is because cyanotoxins are likely to occur with cyanobacterial blooms during summer and fall and specific toxins produced by the diatom dinoflagellate groups can be released from winter to spring as global change is creating environmental conditions that allow for consecutive production of cyanotoxins by cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms we predict that the combined effects of global warming intensive anthropogenic nutrient loading due to high intensity rainfall events and longer dry periods in freshwaters will create a longer season of toxic blooms and prolong their toxins productions our prediction of prolonged toxins production in freshwater environments is supported by a number of reports for instance paerl and otten 2013 proposed that global warming which increases storm events and creates stronger stratification and longer dry periods due to drought will exacerbate a positive feedback loop that competitively displaces nontoxic cyanobacterial strains paerl and otten 2013 this is expected to favor cyanobacteria that produce mcs light limitation e g due to high turbidity after heavy rainfall events together with excess nitrogen and carbon supply could enhance mc rr production reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 van de waal et al 2009 also seasonal nutrient loading from the surrounding agricultural landscape influenced the composition of toxic cyanobacteria species and triggered bmaa production zhang and whalen 2020 considering the specific drivers of cyanotoxins production we note that the production of mcs tends to occur when cyanobacteria are growing with ample nitrogen while cylindrospermopsin bmaa and anatoxin a were triggered under stressful conditions caused by nutrient deficiencies scott et al 2014 nitrogen is one of the most important drivers of mcs bmaa and anatoxin a production while phosphorus is a critical driver of cylindrospermopsin production the phosphorus limited conditions in early summer have created a cyanobacteria strategy to acquire phosphorus apparently by releasing cylindrospermopsin into freshwater as a way of eliminating competitors for this limiting nutrient in the early cyanobacterial bloom bácsi et al 2006 raven 2010 the intracellular toxins mcs anatoxin a saxitoxins and bmaa are released into freshwater following the lysis of cyanobacteria cells so these substances are generally detected when cyanobacterial blooms decline and collapse during the end of summer and fall months high nitrogen concentrations stimulate the activity of toxic mc producing cyanobacteria species and induce the mcs production in freshwater as the mcs are nitrogen rich compounds with nitrogen for 14 of the molecular mass and can represent up to 2 of the cellular dry weight of microcystis rastogi et al 2014 the mcs concentration is positively associated with the nitrogen concentration in freshwater joung et al 2011 monchamp et al 2014 while phosphorus limited conditions had no effect on the production of mcs jankowiak et al 2019 a low n p ratio 10 50 favors the production of mcs nitrogen starvation is associated with greater production of bmaa and anatoxin a anatoxin a is mainly produced by n fixing cyanobacteria dolichospermum previously anabaena the production of anatoxin a was triggered under nutrient deficit conditions rather than nutrient enrichment conditions heath et al 2016 this was also associated with regime shifts between non n fixing cyanobacteria e g microcystis and n fixing cyanobacteria e g dolichospermum previously anabaena under nitrogen replete conditions the dominant mcs producing microcystis could inhibit the production of anatoxin a chia et al 2018 when nitrogen is deficient in freshwater dolichospermum previously anabaena could replace microcystis and become the dominant species in the freshwater environment davis et al 2009 under nitrogen deficient conditions both non n fixing and n fixing cyanobacteria can synthesize bmaa but this cyanotoxin is particularly crucial for the non n fixing cyanobacteria that produces 7 times more bmaa in nitrogen deficient than nitrogen sufficient environments cox et al 2005 main et al 2018 monteiro et al 2017 dinoflagellates i e winter species peridinium aciculiferum also produced toxins as an adaptive strategy to outcompete other winter phytoplankton in freshwaters rengefors and legrand 2001 the bmaa production by toxic diatoms and dinoflagellates is further evidence that the winter spring diatom dinoflagellate blooms may contribute to the toxins produced year round in freshwaters 4 chronic health and ecological issues caused by habs periodic toxins production although undesirable may be tolerable when there is enough time for cyanotoxins to degrade and dissipate in the environment cyanotoxins dissipate through biodegradation photodegradation and chemical hydrolysis reactions gao et al 2022 kurtz et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 microbially mediated degradation is believed to be the primary pathway for cyanotoxins elimination from freshwaters gao et al 2022 photolysis is expected to be of limited importance for cyanotoxins degradation especially for the intracellular cyanotoxins that are shielded from light exposure and released following the collapse of blooms in the late fall or winter spring months chemical hydrolysis reactions are thought to be a minor pathway to eliminate cyanotoxins from freshwater depending on the cyanotoxins variant degree of sunlight natural organic matter and the presence of bacteria in freshwaters typically the half life of anatoxin a was between a few hours to 14 days cylindrospermopsin was 11 to 56 days microcystins was 4 250 days and saxitoxins was 9 to 28 days no information is available on the half life of cyanopeptolins and bmaa in the northern hemisphere cyanobacterial blooms proliferate from may to october 180 days and diatom dinoflagellate blooms occur during october and may 180 days although the half life of most of the cyanotoxins does not exceed the duration of the bloom the consecutive production of cyanotoxins by the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms could make cyanotoxins present continually in freshwaters besides it is widely acknowledged that the highest cyanotoxins concentration coincides with cell lysis during the decline and collapse of blooms the cooler temperatures lower light intensity and changes in water chemistry during the fall winter spring months may allow cyanotoxins to persist in the freshwater system we postulate that the potential year round occurrence of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms will prolong the presence of cyanotoxins in this environment to the detriment of human and ecosystem health here we summarize 4 human health issues and 4 ecological risks resulting from persistent cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms in the freshwater environment fig 5 4 1 human health h1 drinking water crisis water sources contaminated by taste and odor compounds and toxins are the greatest health risks to humans and animals from cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms the taste and odor compounds can cause malodorous or unpalatable drinking water while the existence of toxins has caused several major drinking water crises in the world in 1996 at caruaru brazil at least 50 patients died with symptoms of neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity after being hemodialyzed by waters collected from a nearby reservoir direct evidence for cyanotoxicosis came from the detection of considerable amounts of mcs in the dialysis patient s blood samples this was the most fatal tragedy caused by toxin contaminated waters jochimsen et al 1998 the publicized drinking water crises in 1990 and 2007 caused by intensive cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu s watersheds wuxi china caused 116 factories to halt work and 3 million inhabitants were forced to use bottled drinking water qin et al 2010 in 2014 western lake erie blooms composed essentially of mcs led to beach closures and drinking water advisories on the canadian and us sides of the lake the drinking water supply to the city of toledo with 400 000 residents was shut down for several days steffen et al 2017 most recently in 2020 pools of drinking water containing neurotoxins produced by toxic algae were responsible for the deaths of 330 elephants in botswana h2 cyanotoxins contaminated food bioaccumulation of cyanotoxins in freshwater food products has been widely documented around the world these toxins include anatoxin a bmaa cylindrospermopsin mcs and saxitoxins galvao et al 2009 ibelings and chorus 2007 besides freshwater food products bmaa cylindrospermopsin and mcs are known to bioaccumulate in edible parts of agricultural plants that are irrigated with cyanobacteria contaminated water li et al 2019 machado et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 the health risk of consuming toxins contaminated aquatic products is greater to human than agricultural plants the concentration of toxins in aquatic and terrestrial products specifically mcs has exceeded the daily tolerance intake world health organization 0 04 mg mcs kg body mass day in many countries xiang et al 2019 the risks from acute and chronic exposure to toxic food products must not be underestimated especially considering the greater frequency and intensity of persistent toxic blooms in freshwater and irrigation water worldwide testai et al 2016 h3 recreation activities contact the most common human exposure to cyanotoxins is through recreational activities in water bodies where cyanobacterial blooms occur shan et al 2019a human could be exposed to toxins through intentional or incidental immersion and ingestion including primary contact activities e g swimming bathing wading windsurfing and waterskiing and secondary contact activities e g canoeing boating or fishing people may report at least one symptom of exposure to cyanotoxins after a recreational activity in water with cyanobacterial blooms reported symptoms included itchy skin rashes hay fever like symptoms gastrointestinal distress and allergic reactions as well as more severe symptoms such as headaches fever and blistering in the mouth backer et al 2010 the first acute case of cyanobacterial poisoning associated with mc producing cyanobacterial blooms in recreational water was reported in 2007 in this case the patient was diagnosed with atypical pneumonia and developed a hepatotoxicosis showing nausea abdominal pain fever dyspnea and respiratory distress giannuzzi et al 2011 h4 aerosolized cyanotoxins inhalation potential exposure to aerosolized toxins through direct inhalation is an area of growing concern plaas and paerl 2021 aerosolized toxins are more toxic than the same dose of orally ingested toxins probably because inhalation enhances the absorption of toxins into the bloodstream leading to systemic impacts benson et al 2005 olson et al 2020 besides chronic exposure to aerosolized toxins especially the neurotoxin bmaa is particular route of interest especially considering that diatom dinoflagellate blooms are new potential sources of these neurotoxins facciponte et al 2018 hu et al 2020 aerosolized toxins that enter the olfactory anatomy where there is no blood brain barrier in the cribriform plate gain easy access to the central nervous system banack et al 2015 inhabitants that live near or downwind of lakes where cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms occur may be more likely to report a greater incidence of chronic neurodegenerative disease possibly due to exposure to aerosolized bmaa for instance people living within 1 km of cyanobacteria contaminated new hampshire lakes in the united states had a 2 3 times greater risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inhabitants of lake mascoma in new hampshire had up to 25 times greater risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis than the general population banack et al 2010 caller et al 2009 4 2 ecological health e1 dead zone hypoxia oxygen depletion the aquatic organisms living in the shadow of algal blooms are prone to hypoxia which produces a dead zone at the early stage of cyanobacterial blooms the ability of cyanobacteria to grow at a low light intensity and to use radiative energy from more wavelengths for photosynthesis enables them to grow in the shadow of other phytoplankton and eventually out compete them cyanobacteria proliferation in the upper layers of the water column reduces water clarity and prevents sunlight from penetrating the water to reach submerged aquatic vegetation and benthic microalgae normally the submerged vegetation would photosynthesize and release oxygen to the oxygen supply in the freshwater environment holden 2016 during the decline and collapse of blooms dissolved oxygen is consumed so rapidly by decomposers that the oxygen level becomes insufficient to sustain aquatic animal life watson et al 2016 the hypoxia conditions are often established early in the summer and extend to the fall during the annual cyanobacterial blooms as the cyanobacteria community is still establishing early in the summer it is suspected that winter spring diatom dinoflagellate blooms are partly responsible for the early summer hypoxia reavie et al 2016 e2 toxicity to plants and soil water organisms cyanotoxins bioaccumulate in plants and animals but they also are toxic to these organisms the mostly studied cyanotoxins i e mcs and cylindrospermopsin negatively affect multiple plant physiological processes in addition mcs can stimulate or inhibit mitosis depending on the exposure dose machado et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 cyanotoxins are also directly toxic to soil organisms e g earthworms and nematodes and aquatic organisms e g zooplankton fish shrimp etc mcs can induce oxidative stress on earthworms and reduce their populations at environmentally relevant levels indicating the risk to soil ecosystems cao et al 2017 wen et al 2017 in freshwater environments cyanotoxins have well known detrimental impacts on aquatic organisms van apeldoorn et al 2007 the mcs anatoxin a cyanopeptides cylindrospermopsin bmaa and saxitoxin cause acute effects e g reduction in survivorship feeding inhibition paralysis chronic effects e g reduction in growth and fecundity biochemical alterations e g changing the activity of phosphatases glutathione s transferase and proteases and behavioral alterations the frequent detection of co occurring cyanotoxins in freshwater systems is an emerging concern since we do not fully understand their synergistic effects on ecological health zhang et al 2022 e3 taste and odor taste and odor compounds are noxious secondary metabolites that degrade the integrity aesthetics and safety of surface waters used for drinking and recreation and cause socioeconomic issues watson et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 most taste and odor events are associated with cyanobacterial blooms due to compounds like geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol ma et al 2013 although there are no health risks from taste and odor outbreaks these secondary metabolites frequently co occurred with cyanotoxins i e in 91 of blooms warning water purveyors to increase surveillance for taste and odor compounds and cyanotoxins so that water sanitation treatments can be modified accordingly graham et al 2010 e4 facilitator of green gas emission methane eutrophication is predicted to increase freshwater ch4 emissions by 30 to 90 during the 21st century cyanobacterial blooms in the water column are probably the main contributor to ch4 production beaulieu et al 2019 this is because cyanobacteria produce ch4 and were probably key players in the global ch4 cycle since their appearance on earth 3 2 to 3 5 billion years ago bižić et al 2020 the global occurrences of cyanobacterial blooms are apparently a major direct source of ch4 but these organisms also contribute indirectly to ch4 production large amounts of phytodetritus in the water column and sediments originated from cyanobacteria cells fermentation of this organic debris in an oxygen limited aquatic environment releases ch4 which represents 50 92 of the emitted carbon by mass yan et al 2019 yan et al 2017 it is no doubt that increased magnitude persistence and frequency of cyanobacterial blooms have accelerated the ch4 emissions from freshwaters impacting the global ch4 budget and acting as a positive feedback for global climate change 5 conclusion this synthesis explained why diverse freshwater algae have evolved cyanotoxins biosynthesis as a protective function and illustrated the recurring annual patterns of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms our greatest concern is that the shift in bloom regimes of the cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate complex is causing more frequent detection of cyanotoxins that have public and ecological health consequences still there remain many research gaps that hinder us from visualizing and predicting the future evolution of cyanobacteria diatom dinoflagellate blooms in freshwater systems we support a systematic research program that will test the hypotheses related to the ecophysiological functions of cyanotoxins investigate the synergistic effects of cyanotoxins mixtures on humans plants and animals and track their interactions with other environmental health hazards we also stress the need to understand the species interactions in winter spring diatom dinoflagellate blooms as a key to the possible detection of environmental impacts caused by persistent year round blooms further we recommend further study of aerosolized cyanotoxins with an emphasis on bmaa a potent neurotoxin given the current interest in blue carbon to mitigate the atmospheric carbon footprint

14952,circular water management has the potential to close resource and material loops within and across value chains in the water industry circular municipal wastewater management through industrial urban symbiosis ius is recognized as a solution to overcome water scarcity in urban environments ius involves collaboration between actors with different organizational backgrounds which can lead to inherent risks of conflicting goals this study explores how different values drive various organizations to participate in an emerging circular wastewater collaboration the study comprises a literature review of 34 scientific articles and a case study of a potential circular wastewater system through ius in simrishamn sweden it presents an interdisciplinary framework based on the total economic value concept and organizational archetypes for examining actor values in circular wastewater management this framework provides a novel approach for assessing different values and how they may compete or align it can also identify the absence of certain values enabling the achievement of a minimum level of value coherence amongst different actors and thereby increasing the sustainability and effectiveness of circular wastewater collaborations therefore careful planning and stakeholder interaction in accordance with economic value perspectives can enhance the legitimacy and policy development of circular solutions keywords circular water management integrated water resource management total economic value organizational governance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater is a vital necessity for both ecosystems and society bunsen et al 2021 water is also a key driver of social and economic development as it is critical for agriculture and industrial production bunsen et al 2021 cosgrove and loucks 2015 however climate change and the persistent increasing trend of polluting the aquatic environment continues to put increasing pressure on global water resources delpla et al 2009 environmental change is impacting the hydrological cycle across all scales from local water sources to regional climate systems in turn affecting the earth s capacity to adapt to changing conditions and situations of crisis falkenmark et al 2019 moreover water demands are continuously increasing in order to support growing populations urban expansion rising energy demands and industrial needs unep 2021 the challenges are compounding and it is estimated that by 2030 with current water and sanitation management practices around 2 2 billion people will lack sufficient access to safe drinking water and 4 2 billion people will lack access to safe sanitation fao and un water 2021 even though european countries are not amongst the most seriously affected the european commission states in a 2019 report that less than half of the eu s waterbodies are in a good condition european commission 2019 despite the recent commitments made by many countries and despite the fact that global water use efficiency has increased in recent years there is still an urgent need to improve how we use and manage water fao and un water 2021 unep 2021 there are strong links between sustainable development goal number six sdg6 clean water and sanitation and the circular economy when it comes to developing sustainable water practices bakan et al 2021 schroeder et al 2019 for instance the un has identified integrated water resource management iwrm as a significant approach in order to match water demand across actors and across sectors in society without compromising the ecosystem unep 2021 iwrm and circular wastewater concepts strive to maximize economic and social welfare while assuring access to finite water resources unep 2012 the concepts largely build upon participatory processes and stakeholder engagement in order to generate cross sectorial policy approaches and develop sustainable water management solutions the awareness that water is an elemental component of the ecosystem as well as a social and economic good stress the point that water contains various perceptions of value even though management of water resources is a critical factor for urban sustainability the reality is that it is often difficult for water service providers to deliver quality services that live up to both regulations and budget constraints marlow et al 2013 one way of advancing sustainable water management is the implementation of wastewater reclamation this can be done through circular approaches such as industrial symbiosis reducing abstraction and freshwater use for various economic applications e g agriculture or industrial production another way of improving water access is by aquifer recharge unfortunately progress has not been sufficient and efforts need to double if the goal of broad implementation of iwrm by 2030 is to be achieved industrial symbiosis collaborations have been proposed as a potentially important component in sustainable business models fraccascia et al 2019 and are suitable for circular water management patala et al 2020 the unep 2021 states that some of the major challenges in implementing iwrm are insufficient financing and poor coordination amongst water related initiatives weak policy alignments and a lack of coordination between water related sectors and stakeholders the results in this study indicate that the most frequently identified economic values in circular wastewater systems relates to direct use values this means for example monetised market values for irrigation or other forms of monetised values from using water directly other frequently identified values in this study are indirect use values and in situ values for example ground water injection and recreational activities a policy implication from the results is that direct and indirect use values are important but other non use values should be considered when implementing iwrm projects to develop wastewater synergies are being funded under the european commission s research programme horizon 2020 despite these initiatives there is insufficient knowledge regarding innovation and business models for implementing new technologies in urban water management operations sousa zomer and miguel 2018 there is also a lack of studies with a clear focus on iwrm e g circular water management arrangements or industrial symbiosis collaborations and organisational perspectives of value moreover despite the expected benefits for example through industrial symbiosis that might incentivise circular water treatment challenges to effective implementation still remain södergren and palm 2021b although a few recent studies gregg et al 2020 ramsheva et al 2019 södergren and palm 2021a have analysed value in relation to different social actors they offer limited insights into organisational perspectives and rationales additionally it has been shown to be challenging to ascribe value or provide measures of benefits to environmental functions and services that are not priced by market mechanisms langford et al 2001 wadström et al 2021 thus there is a lack of studies discussing the essentials of value and how this relates to different organisations and stakeholders involved in an emerging industrial symbiosis södergren and palm 2021b in order to bridge this knowledge gap this study first critically examines how value according to economic theory is viewed and implemented in water management research next the study presents a descriptive case study that investigates which values are driving different types of organisations and actors engaged in an emerging circular wastewater collaboration project the structured literature review of 34 scientific articles provides important details and valuable context in order to effectively interpret and generalise the findings from the case study the case study takes place in the municipality of simrishamn in sweden where a full scale system for advanced water treatment has been operational since the beginning of 2019 the treatment facility is capable of removing micro pollutants such as pharmaceutical and hormone disturbing substances an evaluation of the plant and the reusability of the treated water showed that the removal rate for pharmaceuticals endocrine disrupting substances and antibiotics was almost 100 christian baresel et al 2020 the considered circular water synergy in simrishamn includes the reuse of water in industry agriculture and groundwater injection the study applies qualitative content analysis qca as its main analytical method and uses the concept of total economic value tev and organisational theory for the construction of the coding frame used in the formal analysis the purpose of the analysis is to identify links between theory and empirical findings in a comprehensive approach to understanding value perceptions related to circular wastewater management by mapping and analysing which values are in focus for different organisations this can contribute to understanding why more circular water management arrangements are not implemented the research questions addressed by the literature review are with regard to water management and circular water management what is the object of the study which actors and organisational archetypes are studied in accordance with tev and from an organisational perspective which value classes are identified and expressed in the research in the case study the following research question is addressed which values are expressed by different organisations taking part in an emerging circular water reclamation collaboration and how do these values converge or diverge to the authors knowledge there are no previous studies in sustainable water literature that uses the combination of tev and qca the application of tev is often limited to the inclusion of use values often in the form of market prices and non use values are often loosely ascribed to perceptions of individuals in various cost benefit analysis approaches birol et al 2010 in this study definitions and classifications are clearly and explicitly stated and are then used to critically explore which values are expressed this ensures valid and reliable results by using qca and by deductively classifying values according to tev and organisational theory it will be possible to both generalise and compare the results across cases organisations and situations this study introduces a novel approach to tev analysis which goes beyond identifying spatial effects and delves into temporal effects as well this means that it can provide insights into when a specific value contributes the nature of that value and which actor or organization it is most relevant to this will provide a better understanding of the incentive structure around which values are typically included or excluded in a circular wastewater collaboration scheme it will also provide insights into how different values either compete or align as well as how this may impact the realisation and continuation of the circular wastewater system for instance it can reveal how the value of a circular solution changes over time how different stakeholders are affected and who stands to benefit or lose from changes in the value moreover this framework s ability to identify the nature of the value in question provides a more nuanced perspective on the various benefits and costs associated with a particular activity or policy it can uncover hidden costs or benefits that are not immediately apparent in traditional analyses and reveal the true trade offs involved in decision making the terms circular wastewater management and circular wastewater systems are used interchangeably in this study as both terms consider the circular use of wastewater we also refer to wastewater symbiosis and wastewater collaboration as both concepts highlight multi actor engagement participation and cooperation the limitation with the study is that it is a single case study which can give an analytical rather the statistical representative contribution another limitation is that the study does not cover the full range of value perspective existing but has a narrower scope where value classes are related to tev and the chosen organisational perspective the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the theoretical chapter explores the fundamentals of the economic concept of tev and the organisational archetypes in wastewater treatment section 3 presents the method for data collection and analysis section 4 contains the results from a literature review and a case study the paper ends with a discussion in section 5 where the review and case study are compared conclusions and key takeaways as well as ideas for moving the research field forward are presented in section 6 2 theory the total economic value tev approach used in this paper incorporates the concept of non use values this value class is important but also controversial cummings and harrison 1995 unlike use values non use values are separated from any present or expected future utility of an object or resource and its provided services for example the willingness to pay to preserve a river even though no one may ever use it while the concept of non use values such as existence value are widely accepted the controversy lies in the issue of how to measure them and discern non use values from the total economic value crowards 1997 cummings and harrison 1995 kotchen and reiling 2000 schultz et al 2012 even if the debate on the role of non use values is intriguing and important the main goal of this study is not to contribute to the debate itself rather the ambition is to use the concept of total economic value as a framework for identifying value perceptions in different organisational archetypes taking part in a wastewater symbiosis understanding specific perspectives of value may prove essential when translating these into real incentives engel et al 2008 in order to provide circular urban water services this has been a starting point for this study 2 1 value in economic theory as humans we are constantly making choices either individually or collectively and choices are an unescapable and central part of our lives some choices constitute major decisions while other choices are routine champ et al 2003 all choices involve evaluating alternatives as choosing one option precludes choosing other options gold and shadlen 2007 nonmarket valuation is basically about analysing value based on individual choices that are not fully captured by market mechanisms champ et al 2003 furthermore the process of making choices is essentially an assessment of individual preferences over a set of options conversely this means that choices reveal information about preferences champ et al 2003 von neumann and morgenstern 2007 standard economic theory describes value as a form of measure for the trade offs that individuals are willing to make the total economic value tev framework presented for example by pearce and turner 1990 and illustrated in fig 1 describes and organises different classes of value that we will associate with circular wastewater collaboration in this paper value is divided into two general classes use value and non use value for detailed definitions of how values are coded see table 1 use value is the broader class of values that originate from the actual use of water use value includes direct use value indirect value and option value direct use values include consumptive and commercial value where water is used either directly in production or as the output furthermore direct use value can also be derived from non consumptive in situ use of the resource or service e g recreation or swimming indirect use value comprises the utility that a person might derive from an asset without actually using the asset itself e g pollination by bees and maintenance of oxygen cycles by plants this study takes a humanistic and consequential approach which is why for example ecosystem services are coded as indirect value option value is not associated with the current use of a resource or environmental asset instead this value is derived from the possibility of using the resource at some later date this is typically measured as the value attached to future development or use opportunities and does not need to be exclusively related to either consumptive or non consumptive use henry 1974 weisbrod 1964 in other words option value can be viewed as an extra payment in order to ensure future availability a non use value is derived distinctively independently from the direct or indirect use of an asset environment or service a non use value can be either existence value or bequest value where the first value class stems from the knowledge that a particular species or environmental asset simply exists and the latter from the individual desire to pass on a certain environmental asset to one s heirs or to preserve it for future generations crowards 1997 quasi option value describes the welfare gain associated with delaying a decision where there is uncertainty about the future payoffs and alternative choices in order to evaluate quasi option value at least one of the choices must involve an irreversible change and commitment of the considered resources quasi option value arises from the value of information gained by postponing an irreversible decision to develop a natural resource or environmental asset fisher and hanemann 1987 for example the value gained from delaying a decision to develop a freshwater resource where the future value of preservation is unknown until a future date in this paper quasi option value is placed between use and non use value as it can be considered as both depending on the actual outcome 2 2 organisational archetypes in wastewater reclamation different organisational archetypes bring or encompass different core values in order to more deeply understand the values expressed and promoted by different forms of organisations a basic understanding of their modes of governing is required since organisations taking part in circular wastewater systems such as industrial symbiosis are essentially separate entities their management structures strategies cultures and values are likely to vary brinckerhoff 2009 tudor et al 2007 in governance literature different organisational archetypes have been distinguished including hierarchy market network hybrid and ngo niehaves et al 2011 pahl wostl 2015 palm et al 2019a 2019b tang and zhan 2008 thompson 2003 we will here discuss values in relation to these different organisation forms but adapted to the wastewater sector for detailed definitions concerning the coding see table 2 hierarchy is a structured mechanism of control designed to run large and complex organizations thompson 2003 the central idea is to control the hierarchical organisation through bureaucratic measures such as scrutiny rulemaking issuing orders directives monitoring and auditing when there is control of the entirety all parts can work for a collective purpose and result a hierarchical structure of wastewater management typically translates into services being run by the municipal administration the municipality thus organises the strategic planning and the operation of freshwater wastewater treatment plant wwtp and sewage facilities within the framework of municipal administration lingsten 2010 thomasson 2013 the operational responsibility is often delegated to one municipal department such as the department for civil environmental and natural resources a market is a mechanism that coordinates economic activities and ensures order without any detailed organising centre that directs it in wastewater management market based governance is typically seen when private companies are in charge of water services all management tasks responsibilities and ownership of water utilities are placed in the hands of private operators this is not so common though and in europe this only exist in england wales and the czech republic eureau 2018 within a circular water management scheme such as an industrial symbiosis the collaborative arrangements typically emerge through firms developing a self organising network for resource exchange chertow 2007 in the case studied in this article it is the municipality that has brought companies together to start working on circular water management the market actors in our case study are represented by the private firms invited to participate in the circular water management scheme a hybrid form of governance appears at the intersection between public administration hierarchy and private corporation market as there is a blending of logics institutional orders and traits of character furusten and alexius 2019 in this context it applies to delegated public management where a management entity is appointed by the responsible public entity to execute the management tasks in this case it will be represented by a municipally owned water corporation according to furusten and alexius 2009 the blend of logics is perhaps most striking in the case of state owned enterprises since the logics of political control and civic value are mixed with the logic of profit making the civic ngo archetype is added as an alternative approach for analysing how activity is organised and governed in the analysis we will focus on the policy advocacy based ngos which aim to influence policy and decision making of governments disseminate information and take action with other stakeholders kuruppu and lodhia 2019 unerman and o dwyer 2006 these archetypes tend to arise from for example smaller bottom up civic or grassroots movements and by a deliberate design they often rely on direct personal contact and are confined to a clearly defined group or interest network groups such as civic ngos tend to work through attributes like loyalty and trust rather than administrative orders or prices thompson 2003 ngos like wwf have played a significant role in water management globally van der brugge et al 2005 in the case study analysis the following four broad types are used in the coding municipality market producer municipal corporation and ngo 3 material and method in order to develop an understanding of how value is viewed and expressed amongst different actors and stakeholders in a circular wastewater collaborations the study applies qca to primary data semi structured interviews and secondary data documents and scientific articles gathered in the study 3 1 data collection review the literature search was performed in january 2022 using the scholarly database scopus the study focuses on values in circular wastewater operations according to tev the search criteria used the following boolean operators 1 title abs key total economic value or use value or non use value or direct use value or indirect use value or option value or quasi option value or existence value or bequest value and 2 title abs key circular wastewater or circular water management or water management or water reclamation or wastewater reclamation or integrated water resource management this specification concentrates the material in order for the analysis to specifically capture values that relate to circular water management fig 2 presents the systems boundary for the search and inclusion criteria operationalised by the second set of boolean operators furthermore the search is limited to articles published in peer reviewed journals and written in english in order to be relevant for inclusion in the analysis selected articles need to explicitly study a case of water management real or hypothetical see fig 3 for search query and selection criteria for example publications containing studies of water purifying techniques will be omitted in the next step the articles selected for full analysis were methodically read and then coded in total 34 articles were analysed the studied material included a wide range of different types of studies such as assessments frameworks cost benefit studies contingent valuation modelling optimisation simulations principal component analysis real options and various valuation studies the analysed material was published between 1983 and 2021 and thus spans a long period 3 2 data collection for simrishamn case study data was collected in multiple steps with primary data collection via interviews and archival analysis being conducted between september 2019 and june 2020 in simrishamn a municipality located in the south of sweden during this period the municipality was in the initial establishment phase of a circular wastewater collaboration through industrial symbiosis involving a variation of private and public stakeholders fig 4 illustrates the system boundaries for the study and provides a visual representation of the different sectors involved in the emerging symbiosis to obtain primary data semi structured interviews were conducted with 14 respondents see appendix a these actors were identified after having conducted a stakeholder analysis together with representatives from the municipality targeting organisations of relevance to this study all organisations with clear a link to or an interest in developing a circular wastewater system through industrial symbiosis were included in the sample five respondents were selected from the municipal organisation three from the municipal water and sewage company five from various private companies in the area and one from an agricultural non governmental organisation ngo representing farmers interests interviews were recorded and transcribed into text files for more information about the types of questions asked during the interviews see appendix b to complement the interview data archival research was also conducted documents were gathered from the municipality as well as from the water and sewage department the documents contain information regarding decision making processes linked to the strategic development of circular water management and the wwtps located in simrishamn for details see appendix c 3 3 coding frame and analysis qualitative content analysis qca is a systematic and flexible method for describing the meaning of qualitative data in a concise manner it is suitable for material that requires some degree of interpretation it can be applied to a broad range of data sources including interview transcripts company brochures presentations contracts policy documents articles textbooks websites etc elo and kyngäs 2008 mayring 2004 schreier 2012 in this paper we followed a procedure for qca proposed by schreier 2012 fig 5 summarises the main steps included in this methodological approach 1 research question 2 selecting texts and documents 3 developing the coding frame 4 dividing the material into units of coding 5 testing the coding frame and first coding 6 evaluating and modifying the coding frame 7 main analysis second coding and 8 interpreting and presenting findings the main component in a qca is the coding frame because it controls how the material will be categorised and analysed this study will mainly use concept or theory driven deductive categories in the coding frame however there will also be some elements of data driven inductive categorisations the deductive strategy used in this study mainly applies to the identification of values defined by the tev concept see table 1 for details of our deductively derived categories and sub categories and the identification of organisations see table 2 for details of xpressed negative values or disbenefits in the studied material note that in this study negative values are not to be equated with costs the review material was coded on two different occasions by one of the authors of this paper the coding procedure incorporated marking and assigning specific words phrases or paragraphs into categories specified by the coding frame presented in tables 1 and 2 the analysis focuses on the occurrence of various categories in each article not the frequency of the occurrences in this way categories are all equally weighted and the results considers the occurrence of various value classes and the inductively identified categories presented in the result section the repeated coding procedure with a time gap of one week in between occasions limits the risk of missing information in the material and increases the validity the case study material was cross coded by two of the authors both the review and the case study coding were performed using the computer software nvivo 12 pro qsr international pty ltd 2020 computer assisted qualitative data analysis software caqdas such as nvivo is useful when synthesising content across academic literature it also allows for systematic coding and analysis of textual data across multiple categories curtis and lehner 2019 furthermore caqdas reduces human errors in the coding process escarcha et al 2018 and when working with more than one coder it increase validity and reliability garcía horta and guerra ramos 2009 rademaker et al 2012 each article interview or document was first segmented into smaller parts step 4 where the segments selected for coding have to be directly linked to questions that relate to water synergies or circularity in the water and sewage sector this strict segmenting criteria is implemented in order to ensure validity when coding and to limit overinterpretation and the risk of coding out of context answers in this way the risk of wrongly including coded value classes is limited but there is an increased risk of missing out on relevant content that should be included in the analysis in order to control for this issue all case study material was segmented individually by both coders and then compared in order to incorporate all relevant information in the material the review material was segmented on both coding occasions with a time gap of one week in between next the segments were coded according to the coding frame step 5 after the initial coding the results of the coding were compared step 6 cohen s kappa κ coefficient cohen 1960 was used in order to ensure a high level of reliability if the different coding results are in complete agreement the kappa coefficient is 1 and if there is no agreement other than by chance the coefficient is 0 coefficients between 0 and 1 mean partial agreement any category with a kappa coefficient below 0 7 was selected for revision and revised until the kappa coefficient for each category reached the threshold rate of at least 0 7 a level indicating high agreement between codings mchugh 2012 4 results and analysis in order to provide a general understanding of value from the perspective of water management section 4 1 presents and analyses the results from the literature review see appendix d for references next in section 4 2 the case study results are presented separately and in detail 4 1 overall findings review as can be seen in fig 6 earlier studies have identified and expressed a narrower scope of value classes in these studies mainly positive direct and indirect value classes were identified e g venkatesh and hobbs 1999 4 1 1 value classes from the perspective of the object of study the majority of the analysed material 30 articles studied geographical locations water reservoirs or other specific types of water source e g dupont and renzetti 2008 mcdonald and johns 1999 tev in relation to circular water management was relatively unexplored however the few articles studying circular water management were also the only studies liu and cheah 2009 segui et al 2009 containing references to negative indirect use values negative externalities fig 7 shows that direct use values are the most common value class in the main body of the studied material articles studying geographical locations and water sources such as lakes and reservoirs in combination with in situ direct use values this could be attributed to the fact that the articles often study lakes and water reservoirs in on or near which recreational activities can be studied and included in various valuation techniques indirect use values positive externalities and secondary effects were also expressed in the material e g okumah and yeboah 2020 with a few studies also mentioning option values e g liu and cheah 2009 the option values identified were mainly descriptive statements of option value and some calculated option values related to e g conservation costs of reservoirs natural parks and future access to direct use of water existence values and bequest values were also present but these were mainly descriptive statements along with stated preferences regarding the benefits from knowing that a water resource exists and that it will be enjoyed by future generations e g dadaser celik et al 2009 lowe et al 2020 4 1 2 value from the perspective of organisations fig 8 shows the results analysed from the perspective of organisations for the category market producers agriculture consumers or population and industry the structure of the identified value classes was almost identical the majority of the identified values were direct use values and in situ use values e g kondili et al 2010 lowe et al 2020 followed by indirect e g berbel et al 2018 lado 1997 existence value e g lado 1997 and option value e g qureshi et al 2012 another result was that value according to tev is not commonly studied when it comes to hierarchical and hybrid organisations however these organisational perspectives did include negative indirect values for example negative externalities in the form of harm to the environment 4 2 simrishamn case study results the results are summarised in figs 9 and 10 showing that respondents mainly referred to direct and indirect use values when discussing wastewater synergies or symbiosis the results are based on explicit comments made by interviewees or by explicit statements in the studied documents this could be an indication that the involved organisations mainly viewed the development of circular water schemes as a process of commercialising wastewater as a resource bakker 2002 in the interviews all classes of value are expressed although to varying degrees besides direct and indirect use values option and quasi option values were the most commonly occurring value classes furthermore there were occasional statements expressing negative existence value however there were very few such occurrences when analysing written documents the content emphasises indirect use value over direct use value and there were no occurrences or mentions of existence value bequest value only occurred infrequently in both interviews and documents a coherence in expressed values might be an indication of that the process of developing circular wastewater management is characterised less by conflict and more by consensus in relation to how resources should be shared and how to organise a symbiosis brown et al 2017 for examples of coded interview quotations see appendix e considering respondent organisational belonging the material indicates that respondents belonging to organisations that are not dominated by a market form of governance to a higher degree referred to multiple classes of value such as direct and indirect use value option and quasi option value and existence value respondents belonging to organisations with a market inclined form of governance primarily expressed direct use value the main exceptions were respondent j who only expressed bequest value and respondent l who did not express or mention any value at all other than for other non municipal wastewater types of synergies this indicate that it existed different expectations on what a circular wastewater system would deliver which could be a barrier for the process if not dealt with early in the planning phase 4 2 1 direct use value respondent mostly referred to the direct use of circulated water in various forms agricultural actors stated that they saw value in reused wastewater for irrigation and crops and for utilising the nutrients in some way another direct use value was that a circular water system gives more freely usable water resources as it decreases the dependency on groundwater circular water management was also considered to help with seasonal variations and water shortages in regional water reservoirs where for example swimming pool owners can use recycled water when filling their pools in times of water scarcity the fishing industry saw a large potential for using recirculated wastewater in parts of production that do not directly come into contact with food products however in the future if regulation regarding health factors and wastewater treatment becomes clearer the industry saw a value for direct use even in processes that are in direct contact with food at the time for the interviews issues regarding municipal wastewater in food production were still rather sensitive moreover a negative direct use value was expressed in relation to not using water in a more circular way this came from the fact that investments and constructions e g in upgraded wwtps had already been made and thus represented a sunk cost according to some of the respondents not using the facility to the full extent would therefore be squandering an opportunity another negative direct use was expressed by a company that has put great efforts into marketing itself as self sufficient including in terms of water using externally recycled water could jeopardise this image and potentially impact the business negatively 4 2 2 indirect use value the second most common value class in the interviews was indirect use value the majority of the indirect use values identified were related to trade and industry development in the municipality innovation employment and job creation respondents explicitly mentioned marine and agricultural innovation business development energy synergies such as biogas generation from biproducts and sewage sludge and developing a meeting place for industry and academia other types of indirect value identified were related to the creation of wetlands for improving bird habitats and wetland crops the identified indirect values in the material had a more environmental and social character compared to the direct use values nearly all respondents mentioned some form of indirect value relating to effects in connection with the surrounding environment 4 2 3 option value when examining the identified option values in our material some of the discussions referred to the uncertainty of future access to water and the capacity for the region to sustain the variety of urban industrial and agricultural activities values were referred to in relation to the global sustainable development goals sdg agenda 2030 especially to goals 6 and 14 specific mentioned option values concerned long term care for scarce water resources in a changing environment the concerns were not expressed by all of the respondents in the same way respondents from the municipal administration and the water treatment organisation along with respondents from agriculture and fruit growers expressed the greatest concerns while most of the market producing respondents did not consider this a major problem from a general perspective the expressed and identified option values in the material indicated a clear link to the resilience and stability of the region 4 2 4 quasi option value the quasi option value found in the material was linked to the construction of the state of the art water treatment facility with the capacity to purify water from a broad range of toxic substances and medical residues the main reason for building the wwtp was to increase the knowledge around water treatment and a more circular water system another option value was linked to allowing scientists access to the wwtp and thereby providing a test bed for research on water treatment processes one example was research on removing pharmaceutical residues from the wastewater in this sense the circular operation of the wwtp could help advance knowledge and simultaneously minimise public financial costs moreover simrishamn is of the municipalities leading the work on sustainable marine environments in the baltic sea to this purpose it has established a centre for knowledge working towards healthy seas a sustainable marine business environment and a strengthened development of coastal settlements 4 2 5 existence value existence value was only brought up on two occasions in the material interestingly both instances were in relation to farmers and the inherent value of soil for their practices respondents explained that farmers love their soil care for it and feel proud of it this in turn impacts their opinions interests and behaviours as linked to potential outcomes of industrial symbiosis collaborations for example the analysis also identified negative existence values in the material the negative existence value stemmed from the knowledge that some of the re circulated water had been used in animal and meat processing for some individuals this was a very disturbing thought from a purely analytical perspective this was an excellent example of an existence value merely the knowledge that some of the water had been used in animal and meat production induced a negative value even though there were no actual residues from the food industry left in the water 4 2 6 bequest value a few occurrences of bequest values were also found where respondents aspired to pass on or preserve environmental assets for future generations such values were brought up in relation to the modernisation of the municipal wwtps as mentioned there was a specific ambition to open up the new technology for researchers to conduct experiments and share the results in relation to bequest value this entails leaving knowledge and the means for gaining new knowledge for future generations specific references were also made to environmental laws expressing that future generations should be ensured a healthy environment this went hand in hand with the municipal political decision that laid the foundation for these structural wastewater investments which claimed to promote sustainable development and a healthy good environment for current and future generations 5 discussion circular wastewater collaborations involved multiple and complex relationships amongst various actors and according to earlier studies there is a risk that conflicting preferences and value perceptions will undermine their effectiveness ramsheva et al 2019 however few studies have assessed the extent to which organisational values compete or align at the moment of entering a iwrm scheme this study contributes to this gap by critically examining how tev is applied in the literature and then exploring which values are expressed by different organisations taking part in an emerging circular wastewater system the novelty in this research is the detailed information about value perceptions in circular wastewater collaborations gained by combining qca literature review and case study the analysis shows how both research focus and organisation perspectives matter in terms of how value is perceived which might influence the development of iwrm and circular wastewater operations the qca approach in combination with tev also broadens the perception of value as it goes beyond market based valuations and it widens the understanding of positive and negative tev in water management the results showed that different stakeholders organisations actors and respondents expressed different values regarding circular wastewater management as indicated in fig 10 all value classes were mentioned amongst the respondents although to varying degrees the results also indicated both in the literature review and in the case study that there were converging values amongst the sectors and actors indeed direct use value and indirect use value were defined as the largest categories across all respondents and organisations this suggests that circular wastewater management is seen as something concrete a solution that can bring tangible outcomes to the direct users as well as to the geographical location as a whole on the other hand even if the existence and bequest value were discussed less often such categories signifying more inherent or intergenerational aspects could also be associated with wastewater synergies the findings point towards a pattern of which values were expressed included or excluded in the circular wastewater system for example values expressed in the review or by respondents and written documents were more or less aligned when it came to tev classes none the less there might be conflicting values within a specific value class as indicated by the negative and positive existence values this indicates a potential risk of actors developing an internal value conflict as the circular water management scheme evolves it is therefore important to discuss different values early on in the process of creating collaborations around circular water resources where different values and goals become visible earlier research has shown the importance to visualise and verbalise values to achieve successful collaboration amongst divergent actors lazoroska and palm 2019 as shown in the review different value perceptions can be limited in scope the municipal organisation and the water and sewage organisation expressed a broad spectrum of value classes compared to the other organisations even if both the narrow and broad value classes were mainly aligned the different value focused e g direct use value vs option value can potentially lead to tensions between the involved actors bakker 2002 where the economic perspectives can impact the wastewater management gandy 2008 on the other hand when managed correctly which in this case means identifying stakeholder preferences and values and then balancing the incentives accordingly value perspectives can limit the tension between public and private management brown et al 2017 including ownership and control of water resources thus carrying out this kind of value mapping exercise prior to formally engaging in a wastewater symbiosis could help actors avoid such collaborative challenges indeed uncovering their different aspirations in a first step is important to allow actors in a second step to collectively align around goals and ambitions for joint commitments a limitation with this study is that it is a single case study a single case study can give a deep understanding of one case but it is not possible to draw general conclusions valid for all cases this has partly been alleviated in this paper by presenting the case study results within the context of the literature review the literature review is by no means exhaustive in terms of being all encompassing with regard to the plethora of value perspectives but it focusses on tev and organisation form still this is a limitation of the study the scope and depth of the analysis in this paper warrant specificity when it comes to material selection with the well defined search and selection process used here the coding frame makes it possible to explore identified values and contribute with analytical generalisations in future studies it would be interesting to make a comparative study between value categories expressed in an emerging versus a well established circular water operation to investigate developments over time this could also give insights into how conflicting values both within and across organisations may have been handled another idea is to dive deeper into different organisational attributes of actors taking part in circular water management operations in doing so researchers could create a better understanding of how organisational governance factors interact with or impact each other and the outcomes of resource synergies it would also be valuable to expand the study of values in other resource efficient systems by focusing on other resource flows perhaps placing energy exchanges at the centre instead of wastewater which was the focus of this paper 6 conclusion the literature review revealed that tev in relation to circular water management is previously unexplored in terms of value classes earlier studies have identified and expressed a rather narrow value scope since mainly positive direct and indirect value classes were identified from a market orientated organisational perspective the majority of the identified values are direct use values followed by indirect use values existence and option values when it comes to hierarchical and hybrid organisations values also include negative indirect values results from the emerging circular wastewater collaboration in simrishamn showed that all classes of value were expressed although to varying degrees respondents mainly referred to direct and indirect use values when discussing wastewater synergies or symbiosis looking at organisational belonging the material indicates that respondents belonging to organisations that are not dominated by a market form of governance to a higher degree referred to multiple classes of value ranging from direct and indirect use value to option and quasi option value and existence value respondents belonging to organisations with a market inclined form of governance however primarily expressed direct use value this study finds that there is a certain level of value coherence amongst organisations involved developing circular wastewater management this can help minimize conflicts around decision making and build consensus around how resources should be shared and how to organise a symbiosis this also accentuates the understanding of what values that are the most effective when it comes to sustainable decision making ultimately this study shows the importance of a detailed understanding of value perspectives and the impact it can have on circular wastewater management overall the analysis through this framework allows for a more robust and accurate assessment of the impacts of various activities or policies it provides decision makers with a more complete picture of the costs and benefits involved thereby enabling them to make more informed choices that better align with societal goals and values it also provides important clues as to why some of these solutions are successfully implemented while others are not thus strategic planning and effective stakeholder engagement guided by value perspectives can enhance the legitimacy and facilitate the policy development of circular solutions credit author statement wadström c conceptualization investigation methodology

14952,circular water management has the potential to close resource and material loops within and across value chains in the water industry circular municipal wastewater management through industrial urban symbiosis ius is recognized as a solution to overcome water scarcity in urban environments ius involves collaboration between actors with different organizational backgrounds which can lead to inherent risks of conflicting goals this study explores how different values drive various organizations to participate in an emerging circular wastewater collaboration the study comprises a literature review of 34 scientific articles and a case study of a potential circular wastewater system through ius in simrishamn sweden it presents an interdisciplinary framework based on the total economic value concept and organizational archetypes for examining actor values in circular wastewater management this framework provides a novel approach for assessing different values and how they may compete or align it can also identify the absence of certain values enabling the achievement of a minimum level of value coherence amongst different actors and thereby increasing the sustainability and effectiveness of circular wastewater collaborations therefore careful planning and stakeholder interaction in accordance with economic value perspectives can enhance the legitimacy and policy development of circular solutions keywords circular water management integrated water resource management total economic value organizational governance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater is a vital necessity for both ecosystems and society bunsen et al 2021 water is also a key driver of social and economic development as it is critical for agriculture and industrial production bunsen et al 2021 cosgrove and loucks 2015 however climate change and the persistent increasing trend of polluting the aquatic environment continues to put increasing pressure on global water resources delpla et al 2009 environmental change is impacting the hydrological cycle across all scales from local water sources to regional climate systems in turn affecting the earth s capacity to adapt to changing conditions and situations of crisis falkenmark et al 2019 moreover water demands are continuously increasing in order to support growing populations urban expansion rising energy demands and industrial needs unep 2021 the challenges are compounding and it is estimated that by 2030 with current water and sanitation management practices around 2 2 billion people will lack sufficient access to safe drinking water and 4 2 billion people will lack access to safe sanitation fao and un water 2021 even though european countries are not amongst the most seriously affected the european commission states in a 2019 report that less than half of the eu s waterbodies are in a good condition european commission 2019 despite the recent commitments made by many countries and despite the fact that global water use efficiency has increased in recent years there is still an urgent need to improve how we use and manage water fao and un water 2021 unep 2021 there are strong links between sustainable development goal number six sdg6 clean water and sanitation and the circular economy when it comes to developing sustainable water practices bakan et al 2021 schroeder et al 2019 for instance the un has identified integrated water resource management iwrm as a significant approach in order to match water demand across actors and across sectors in society without compromising the ecosystem unep 2021 iwrm and circular wastewater concepts strive to maximize economic and social welfare while assuring access to finite water resources unep 2012 the concepts largely build upon participatory processes and stakeholder engagement in order to generate cross sectorial policy approaches and develop sustainable water management solutions the awareness that water is an elemental component of the ecosystem as well as a social and economic good stress the point that water contains various perceptions of value even though management of water resources is a critical factor for urban sustainability the reality is that it is often difficult for water service providers to deliver quality services that live up to both regulations and budget constraints marlow et al 2013 one way of advancing sustainable water management is the implementation of wastewater reclamation this can be done through circular approaches such as industrial symbiosis reducing abstraction and freshwater use for various economic applications e g agriculture or industrial production another way of improving water access is by aquifer recharge unfortunately progress has not been sufficient and efforts need to double if the goal of broad implementation of iwrm by 2030 is to be achieved industrial symbiosis collaborations have been proposed as a potentially important component in sustainable business models fraccascia et al 2019 and are suitable for circular water management patala et al 2020 the unep 2021 states that some of the major challenges in implementing iwrm are insufficient financing and poor coordination amongst water related initiatives weak policy alignments and a lack of coordination between water related sectors and stakeholders the results in this study indicate that the most frequently identified economic values in circular wastewater systems relates to direct use values this means for example monetised market values for irrigation or other forms of monetised values from using water directly other frequently identified values in this study are indirect use values and in situ values for example ground water injection and recreational activities a policy implication from the results is that direct and indirect use values are important but other non use values should be considered when implementing iwrm projects to develop wastewater synergies are being funded under the european commission s research programme horizon 2020 despite these initiatives there is insufficient knowledge regarding innovation and business models for implementing new technologies in urban water management operations sousa zomer and miguel 2018 there is also a lack of studies with a clear focus on iwrm e g circular water management arrangements or industrial symbiosis collaborations and organisational perspectives of value moreover despite the expected benefits for example through industrial symbiosis that might incentivise circular water treatment challenges to effective implementation still remain södergren and palm 2021b although a few recent studies gregg et al 2020 ramsheva et al 2019 södergren and palm 2021a have analysed value in relation to different social actors they offer limited insights into organisational perspectives and rationales additionally it has been shown to be challenging to ascribe value or provide measures of benefits to environmental functions and services that are not priced by market mechanisms langford et al 2001 wadström et al 2021 thus there is a lack of studies discussing the essentials of value and how this relates to different organisations and stakeholders involved in an emerging industrial symbiosis södergren and palm 2021b in order to bridge this knowledge gap this study first critically examines how value according to economic theory is viewed and implemented in water management research next the study presents a descriptive case study that investigates which values are driving different types of organisations and actors engaged in an emerging circular wastewater collaboration project the structured literature review of 34 scientific articles provides important details and valuable context in order to effectively interpret and generalise the findings from the case study the case study takes place in the municipality of simrishamn in sweden where a full scale system for advanced water treatment has been operational since the beginning of 2019 the treatment facility is capable of removing micro pollutants such as pharmaceutical and hormone disturbing substances an evaluation of the plant and the reusability of the treated water showed that the removal rate for pharmaceuticals endocrine disrupting substances and antibiotics was almost 100 christian baresel et al 2020 the considered circular water synergy in simrishamn includes the reuse of water in industry agriculture and groundwater injection the study applies qualitative content analysis qca as its main analytical method and uses the concept of total economic value tev and organisational theory for the construction of the coding frame used in the formal analysis the purpose of the analysis is to identify links between theory and empirical findings in a comprehensive approach to understanding value perceptions related to circular wastewater management by mapping and analysing which values are in focus for different organisations this can contribute to understanding why more circular water management arrangements are not implemented the research questions addressed by the literature review are with regard to water management and circular water management what is the object of the study which actors and organisational archetypes are studied in accordance with tev and from an organisational perspective which value classes are identified and expressed in the research in the case study the following research question is addressed which values are expressed by different organisations taking part in an emerging circular water reclamation collaboration and how do these values converge or diverge to the authors knowledge there are no previous studies in sustainable water literature that uses the combination of tev and qca the application of tev is often limited to the inclusion of use values often in the form of market prices and non use values are often loosely ascribed to perceptions of individuals in various cost benefit analysis approaches birol et al 2010 in this study definitions and classifications are clearly and explicitly stated and are then used to critically explore which values are expressed this ensures valid and reliable results by using qca and by deductively classifying values according to tev and organisational theory it will be possible to both generalise and compare the results across cases organisations and situations this study introduces a novel approach to tev analysis which goes beyond identifying spatial effects and delves into temporal effects as well this means that it can provide insights into when a specific value contributes the nature of that value and which actor or organization it is most relevant to this will provide a better understanding of the incentive structure around which values are typically included or excluded in a circular wastewater collaboration scheme it will also provide insights into how different values either compete or align as well as how this may impact the realisation and continuation of the circular wastewater system for instance it can reveal how the value of a circular solution changes over time how different stakeholders are affected and who stands to benefit or lose from changes in the value moreover this framework s ability to identify the nature of the value in question provides a more nuanced perspective on the various benefits and costs associated with a particular activity or policy it can uncover hidden costs or benefits that are not immediately apparent in traditional analyses and reveal the true trade offs involved in decision making the terms circular wastewater management and circular wastewater systems are used interchangeably in this study as both terms consider the circular use of wastewater we also refer to wastewater symbiosis and wastewater collaboration as both concepts highlight multi actor engagement participation and cooperation the limitation with the study is that it is a single case study which can give an analytical rather the statistical representative contribution another limitation is that the study does not cover the full range of value perspective existing but has a narrower scope where value classes are related to tev and the chosen organisational perspective the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the theoretical chapter explores the fundamentals of the economic concept of tev and the organisational archetypes in wastewater treatment section 3 presents the method for data collection and analysis section 4 contains the results from a literature review and a case study the paper ends with a discussion in section 5 where the review and case study are compared conclusions and key takeaways as well as ideas for moving the research field forward are presented in section 6 2 theory the total economic value tev approach used in this paper incorporates the concept of non use values this value class is important but also controversial cummings and harrison 1995 unlike use values non use values are separated from any present or expected future utility of an object or resource and its provided services for example the willingness to pay to preserve a river even though no one may ever use it while the concept of non use values such as existence value are widely accepted the controversy lies in the issue of how to measure them and discern non use values from the total economic value crowards 1997 cummings and harrison 1995 kotchen and reiling 2000 schultz et al 2012 even if the debate on the role of non use values is intriguing and important the main goal of this study is not to contribute to the debate itself rather the ambition is to use the concept of total economic value as a framework for identifying value perceptions in different organisational archetypes taking part in a wastewater symbiosis understanding specific perspectives of value may prove essential when translating these into real incentives engel et al 2008 in order to provide circular urban water services this has been a starting point for this study 2 1 value in economic theory as humans we are constantly making choices either individually or collectively and choices are an unescapable and central part of our lives some choices constitute major decisions while other choices are routine champ et al 2003 all choices involve evaluating alternatives as choosing one option precludes choosing other options gold and shadlen 2007 nonmarket valuation is basically about analysing value based on individual choices that are not fully captured by market mechanisms champ et al 2003 furthermore the process of making choices is essentially an assessment of individual preferences over a set of options conversely this means that choices reveal information about preferences champ et al 2003 von neumann and morgenstern 2007 standard economic theory describes value as a form of measure for the trade offs that individuals are willing to make the total economic value tev framework presented for example by pearce and turner 1990 and illustrated in fig 1 describes and organises different classes of value that we will associate with circular wastewater collaboration in this paper value is divided into two general classes use value and non use value for detailed definitions of how values are coded see table 1 use value is the broader class of values that originate from the actual use of water use value includes direct use value indirect value and option value direct use values include consumptive and commercial value where water is used either directly in production or as the output furthermore direct use value can also be derived from non consumptive in situ use of the resource or service e g recreation or swimming indirect use value comprises the utility that a person might derive from an asset without actually using the asset itself e g pollination by bees and maintenance of oxygen cycles by plants this study takes a humanistic and consequential approach which is why for example ecosystem services are coded as indirect value option value is not associated with the current use of a resource or environmental asset instead this value is derived from the possibility of using the resource at some later date this is typically measured as the value attached to future development or use opportunities and does not need to be exclusively related to either consumptive or non consumptive use henry 1974 weisbrod 1964 in other words option value can be viewed as an extra payment in order to ensure future availability a non use value is derived distinctively independently from the direct or indirect use of an asset environment or service a non use value can be either existence value or bequest value where the first value class stems from the knowledge that a particular species or environmental asset simply exists and the latter from the individual desire to pass on a certain environmental asset to one s heirs or to preserve it for future generations crowards 1997 quasi option value describes the welfare gain associated with delaying a decision where there is uncertainty about the future payoffs and alternative choices in order to evaluate quasi option value at least one of the choices must involve an irreversible change and commitment of the considered resources quasi option value arises from the value of information gained by postponing an irreversible decision to develop a natural resource or environmental asset fisher and hanemann 1987 for example the value gained from delaying a decision to develop a freshwater resource where the future value of preservation is unknown until a future date in this paper quasi option value is placed between use and non use value as it can be considered as both depending on the actual outcome 2 2 organisational archetypes in wastewater reclamation different organisational archetypes bring or encompass different core values in order to more deeply understand the values expressed and promoted by different forms of organisations a basic understanding of their modes of governing is required since organisations taking part in circular wastewater systems such as industrial symbiosis are essentially separate entities their management structures strategies cultures and values are likely to vary brinckerhoff 2009 tudor et al 2007 in governance literature different organisational archetypes have been distinguished including hierarchy market network hybrid and ngo niehaves et al 2011 pahl wostl 2015 palm et al 2019a 2019b tang and zhan 2008 thompson 2003 we will here discuss values in relation to these different organisation forms but adapted to the wastewater sector for detailed definitions concerning the coding see table 2 hierarchy is a structured mechanism of control designed to run large and complex organizations thompson 2003 the central idea is to control the hierarchical organisation through bureaucratic measures such as scrutiny rulemaking issuing orders directives monitoring and auditing when there is control of the entirety all parts can work for a collective purpose and result a hierarchical structure of wastewater management typically translates into services being run by the municipal administration the municipality thus organises the strategic planning and the operation of freshwater wastewater treatment plant wwtp and sewage facilities within the framework of municipal administration lingsten 2010 thomasson 2013 the operational responsibility is often delegated to one municipal department such as the department for civil environmental and natural resources a market is a mechanism that coordinates economic activities and ensures order without any detailed organising centre that directs it in wastewater management market based governance is typically seen when private companies are in charge of water services all management tasks responsibilities and ownership of water utilities are placed in the hands of private operators this is not so common though and in europe this only exist in england wales and the czech republic eureau 2018 within a circular water management scheme such as an industrial symbiosis the collaborative arrangements typically emerge through firms developing a self organising network for resource exchange chertow 2007 in the case studied in this article it is the municipality that has brought companies together to start working on circular water management the market actors in our case study are represented by the private firms invited to participate in the circular water management scheme a hybrid form of governance appears at the intersection between public administration hierarchy and private corporation market as there is a blending of logics institutional orders and traits of character furusten and alexius 2019 in this context it applies to delegated public management where a management entity is appointed by the responsible public entity to execute the management tasks in this case it will be represented by a municipally owned water corporation according to furusten and alexius 2009 the blend of logics is perhaps most striking in the case of state owned enterprises since the logics of political control and civic value are mixed with the logic of profit making the civic ngo archetype is added as an alternative approach for analysing how activity is organised and governed in the analysis we will focus on the policy advocacy based ngos which aim to influence policy and decision making of governments disseminate information and take action with other stakeholders kuruppu and lodhia 2019 unerman and o dwyer 2006 these archetypes tend to arise from for example smaller bottom up civic or grassroots movements and by a deliberate design they often rely on direct personal contact and are confined to a clearly defined group or interest network groups such as civic ngos tend to work through attributes like loyalty and trust rather than administrative orders or prices thompson 2003 ngos like wwf have played a significant role in water management globally van der brugge et al 2005 in the case study analysis the following four broad types are used in the coding municipality market producer municipal corporation and ngo 3 material and method in order to develop an understanding of how value is viewed and expressed amongst different actors and stakeholders in a circular wastewater collaborations the study applies qca to primary data semi structured interviews and secondary data documents and scientific articles gathered in the study 3 1 data collection review the literature search was performed in january 2022 using the scholarly database scopus the study focuses on values in circular wastewater operations according to tev the search criteria used the following boolean operators 1 title abs key total economic value or use value or non use value or direct use value or indirect use value or option value or quasi option value or existence value or bequest value and 2 title abs key circular wastewater or circular water management or water management or water reclamation or wastewater reclamation or integrated water resource management this specification concentrates the material in order for the analysis to specifically capture values that relate to circular water management fig 2 presents the systems boundary for the search and inclusion criteria operationalised by the second set of boolean operators furthermore the search is limited to articles published in peer reviewed journals and written in english in order to be relevant for inclusion in the analysis selected articles need to explicitly study a case of water management real or hypothetical see fig 3 for search query and selection criteria for example publications containing studies of water purifying techniques will be omitted in the next step the articles selected for full analysis were methodically read and then coded in total 34 articles were analysed the studied material included a wide range of different types of studies such as assessments frameworks cost benefit studies contingent valuation modelling optimisation simulations principal component analysis real options and various valuation studies the analysed material was published between 1983 and 2021 and thus spans a long period 3 2 data collection for simrishamn case study data was collected in multiple steps with primary data collection via interviews and archival analysis being conducted between september 2019 and june 2020 in simrishamn a municipality located in the south of sweden during this period the municipality was in the initial establishment phase of a circular wastewater collaboration through industrial symbiosis involving a variation of private and public stakeholders fig 4 illustrates the system boundaries for the study and provides a visual representation of the different sectors involved in the emerging symbiosis to obtain primary data semi structured interviews were conducted with 14 respondents see appendix a these actors were identified after having conducted a stakeholder analysis together with representatives from the municipality targeting organisations of relevance to this study all organisations with clear a link to or an interest in developing a circular wastewater system through industrial symbiosis were included in the sample five respondents were selected from the municipal organisation three from the municipal water and sewage company five from various private companies in the area and one from an agricultural non governmental organisation ngo representing farmers interests interviews were recorded and transcribed into text files for more information about the types of questions asked during the interviews see appendix b to complement the interview data archival research was also conducted documents were gathered from the municipality as well as from the water and sewage department the documents contain information regarding decision making processes linked to the strategic development of circular water management and the wwtps located in simrishamn for details see appendix c 3 3 coding frame and analysis qualitative content analysis qca is a systematic and flexible method for describing the meaning of qualitative data in a concise manner it is suitable for material that requires some degree of interpretation it can be applied to a broad range of data sources including interview transcripts company brochures presentations contracts policy documents articles textbooks websites etc elo and kyngäs 2008 mayring 2004 schreier 2012 in this paper we followed a procedure for qca proposed by schreier 2012 fig 5 summarises the main steps included in this methodological approach 1 research question 2 selecting texts and documents 3 developing the coding frame 4 dividing the material into units of coding 5 testing the coding frame and first coding 6 evaluating and modifying the coding frame 7 main analysis second coding and 8 interpreting and presenting findings the main component in a qca is the coding frame because it controls how the material will be categorised and analysed this study will mainly use concept or theory driven deductive categories in the coding frame however there will also be some elements of data driven inductive categorisations the deductive strategy used in this study mainly applies to the identification of values defined by the tev concept see table 1 for details of our deductively derived categories and sub categories and the identification of organisations see table 2 for details of xpressed negative values or disbenefits in the studied material note that in this study negative values are not to be equated with costs the review material was coded on two different occasions by one of the authors of this paper the coding procedure incorporated marking and assigning specific words phrases or paragraphs into categories specified by the coding frame presented in tables 1 and 2 the analysis focuses on the occurrence of various categories in each article not the frequency of the occurrences in this way categories are all equally weighted and the results considers the occurrence of various value classes and the inductively identified categories presented in the result section the repeated coding procedure with a time gap of one week in between occasions limits the risk of missing information in the material and increases the validity the case study material was cross coded by two of the authors both the review and the case study coding were performed using the computer software nvivo 12 pro qsr international pty ltd 2020 computer assisted qualitative data analysis software caqdas such as nvivo is useful when synthesising content across academic literature it also allows for systematic coding and analysis of textual data across multiple categories curtis and lehner 2019 furthermore caqdas reduces human errors in the coding process escarcha et al 2018 and when working with more than one coder it increase validity and reliability garcía horta and guerra ramos 2009 rademaker et al 2012 each article interview or document was first segmented into smaller parts step 4 where the segments selected for coding have to be directly linked to questions that relate to water synergies or circularity in the water and sewage sector this strict segmenting criteria is implemented in order to ensure validity when coding and to limit overinterpretation and the risk of coding out of context answers in this way the risk of wrongly including coded value classes is limited but there is an increased risk of missing out on relevant content that should be included in the analysis in order to control for this issue all case study material was segmented individually by both coders and then compared in order to incorporate all relevant information in the material the review material was segmented on both coding occasions with a time gap of one week in between next the segments were coded according to the coding frame step 5 after the initial coding the results of the coding were compared step 6 cohen s kappa κ coefficient cohen 1960 was used in order to ensure a high level of reliability if the different coding results are in complete agreement the kappa coefficient is 1 and if there is no agreement other than by chance the coefficient is 0 coefficients between 0 and 1 mean partial agreement any category with a kappa coefficient below 0 7 was selected for revision and revised until the kappa coefficient for each category reached the threshold rate of at least 0 7 a level indicating high agreement between codings mchugh 2012 4 results and analysis in order to provide a general understanding of value from the perspective of water management section 4 1 presents and analyses the results from the literature review see appendix d for references next in section 4 2 the case study results are presented separately and in detail 4 1 overall findings review as can be seen in fig 6 earlier studies have identified and expressed a narrower scope of value classes in these studies mainly positive direct and indirect value classes were identified e g venkatesh and hobbs 1999 4 1 1 value classes from the perspective of the object of study the majority of the analysed material 30 articles studied geographical locations water reservoirs or other specific types of water source e g dupont and renzetti 2008 mcdonald and johns 1999 tev in relation to circular water management was relatively unexplored however the few articles studying circular water management were also the only studies liu and cheah 2009 segui et al 2009 containing references to negative indirect use values negative externalities fig 7 shows that direct use values are the most common value class in the main body of the studied material articles studying geographical locations and water sources such as lakes and reservoirs in combination with in situ direct use values this could be attributed to the fact that the articles often study lakes and water reservoirs in on or near which recreational activities can be studied and included in various valuation techniques indirect use values positive externalities and secondary effects were also expressed in the material e g okumah and yeboah 2020 with a few studies also mentioning option values e g liu and cheah 2009 the option values identified were mainly descriptive statements of option value and some calculated option values related to e g conservation costs of reservoirs natural parks and future access to direct use of water existence values and bequest values were also present but these were mainly descriptive statements along with stated preferences regarding the benefits from knowing that a water resource exists and that it will be enjoyed by future generations e g dadaser celik et al 2009 lowe et al 2020 4 1 2 value from the perspective of organisations fig 8 shows the results analysed from the perspective of organisations for the category market producers agriculture consumers or population and industry the structure of the identified value classes was almost identical the majority of the identified values were direct use values and in situ use values e g kondili et al 2010 lowe et al 2020 followed by indirect e g berbel et al 2018 lado 1997 existence value e g lado 1997 and option value e g qureshi et al 2012 another result was that value according to tev is not commonly studied when it comes to hierarchical and hybrid organisations however these organisational perspectives did include negative indirect values for example negative externalities in the form of harm to the environment 4 2 simrishamn case study results the results are summarised in figs 9 and 10 showing that respondents mainly referred to direct and indirect use values when discussing wastewater synergies or symbiosis the results are based on explicit comments made by interviewees or by explicit statements in the studied documents this could be an indication that the involved organisations mainly viewed the development of circular water schemes as a process of commercialising wastewater as a resource bakker 2002 in the interviews all classes of value are expressed although to varying degrees besides direct and indirect use values option and quasi option values were the most commonly occurring value classes furthermore there were occasional statements expressing negative existence value however there were very few such occurrences when analysing written documents the content emphasises indirect use value over direct use value and there were no occurrences or mentions of existence value bequest value only occurred infrequently in both interviews and documents a coherence in expressed values might be an indication of that the process of developing circular wastewater management is characterised less by conflict and more by consensus in relation to how resources should be shared and how to organise a symbiosis brown et al 2017 for examples of coded interview quotations see appendix e considering respondent organisational belonging the material indicates that respondents belonging to organisations that are not dominated by a market form of governance to a higher degree referred to multiple classes of value such as direct and indirect use value option and quasi option value and existence value respondents belonging to organisations with a market inclined form of governance primarily expressed direct use value the main exceptions were respondent j who only expressed bequest value and respondent l who did not express or mention any value at all other than for other non municipal wastewater types of synergies this indicate that it existed different expectations on what a circular wastewater system would deliver which could be a barrier for the process if not dealt with early in the planning phase 4 2 1 direct use value respondent mostly referred to the direct use of circulated water in various forms agricultural actors stated that they saw value in reused wastewater for irrigation and crops and for utilising the nutrients in some way another direct use value was that a circular water system gives more freely usable water resources as it decreases the dependency on groundwater circular water management was also considered to help with seasonal variations and water shortages in regional water reservoirs where for example swimming pool owners can use recycled water when filling their pools in times of water scarcity the fishing industry saw a large potential for using recirculated wastewater in parts of production that do not directly come into contact with food products however in the future if regulation regarding health factors and wastewater treatment becomes clearer the industry saw a value for direct use even in processes that are in direct contact with food at the time for the interviews issues regarding municipal wastewater in food production were still rather sensitive moreover a negative direct use value was expressed in relation to not using water in a more circular way this came from the fact that investments and constructions e g in upgraded wwtps had already been made and thus represented a sunk cost according to some of the respondents not using the facility to the full extent would therefore be squandering an opportunity another negative direct use was expressed by a company that has put great efforts into marketing itself as self sufficient including in terms of water using externally recycled water could jeopardise this image and potentially impact the business negatively 4 2 2 indirect use value the second most common value class in the interviews was indirect use value the majority of the indirect use values identified were related to trade and industry development in the municipality innovation employment and job creation respondents explicitly mentioned marine and agricultural innovation business development energy synergies such as biogas generation from biproducts and sewage sludge and developing a meeting place for industry and academia other types of indirect value identified were related to the creation of wetlands for improving bird habitats and wetland crops the identified indirect values in the material had a more environmental and social character compared to the direct use values nearly all respondents mentioned some form of indirect value relating to effects in connection with the surrounding environment 4 2 3 option value when examining the identified option values in our material some of the discussions referred to the uncertainty of future access to water and the capacity for the region to sustain the variety of urban industrial and agricultural activities values were referred to in relation to the global sustainable development goals sdg agenda 2030 especially to goals 6 and 14 specific mentioned option values concerned long term care for scarce water resources in a changing environment the concerns were not expressed by all of the respondents in the same way respondents from the municipal administration and the water treatment organisation along with respondents from agriculture and fruit growers expressed the greatest concerns while most of the market producing respondents did not consider this a major problem from a general perspective the expressed and identified option values in the material indicated a clear link to the resilience and stability of the region 4 2 4 quasi option value the quasi option value found in the material was linked to the construction of the state of the art water treatment facility with the capacity to purify water from a broad range of toxic substances and medical residues the main reason for building the wwtp was to increase the knowledge around water treatment and a more circular water system another option value was linked to allowing scientists access to the wwtp and thereby providing a test bed for research on water treatment processes one example was research on removing pharmaceutical residues from the wastewater in this sense the circular operation of the wwtp could help advance knowledge and simultaneously minimise public financial costs moreover simrishamn is of the municipalities leading the work on sustainable marine environments in the baltic sea to this purpose it has established a centre for knowledge working towards healthy seas a sustainable marine business environment and a strengthened development of coastal settlements 4 2 5 existence value existence value was only brought up on two occasions in the material interestingly both instances were in relation to farmers and the inherent value of soil for their practices respondents explained that farmers love their soil care for it and feel proud of it this in turn impacts their opinions interests and behaviours as linked to potential outcomes of industrial symbiosis collaborations for example the analysis also identified negative existence values in the material the negative existence value stemmed from the knowledge that some of the re circulated water had been used in animal and meat processing for some individuals this was a very disturbing thought from a purely analytical perspective this was an excellent example of an existence value merely the knowledge that some of the water had been used in animal and meat production induced a negative value even though there were no actual residues from the food industry left in the water 4 2 6 bequest value a few occurrences of bequest values were also found where respondents aspired to pass on or preserve environmental assets for future generations such values were brought up in relation to the modernisation of the municipal wwtps as mentioned there was a specific ambition to open up the new technology for researchers to conduct experiments and share the results in relation to bequest value this entails leaving knowledge and the means for gaining new knowledge for future generations specific references were also made to environmental laws expressing that future generations should be ensured a healthy environment this went hand in hand with the municipal political decision that laid the foundation for these structural wastewater investments which claimed to promote sustainable development and a healthy good environment for current and future generations 5 discussion circular wastewater collaborations involved multiple and complex relationships amongst various actors and according to earlier studies there is a risk that conflicting preferences and value perceptions will undermine their effectiveness ramsheva et al 2019 however few studies have assessed the extent to which organisational values compete or align at the moment of entering a iwrm scheme this study contributes to this gap by critically examining how tev is applied in the literature and then exploring which values are expressed by different organisations taking part in an emerging circular wastewater system the novelty in this research is the detailed information about value perceptions in circular wastewater collaborations gained by combining qca literature review and case study the analysis shows how both research focus and organisation perspectives matter in terms of how value is perceived which might influence the development of iwrm and circular wastewater operations the qca approach in combination with tev also broadens the perception of value as it goes beyond market based valuations and it widens the understanding of positive and negative tev in water management the results showed that different stakeholders organisations actors and respondents expressed different values regarding circular wastewater management as indicated in fig 10 all value classes were mentioned amongst the respondents although to varying degrees the results also indicated both in the literature review and in the case study that there were converging values amongst the sectors and actors indeed direct use value and indirect use value were defined as the largest categories across all respondents and organisations this suggests that circular wastewater management is seen as something concrete a solution that can bring tangible outcomes to the direct users as well as to the geographical location as a whole on the other hand even if the existence and bequest value were discussed less often such categories signifying more inherent or intergenerational aspects could also be associated with wastewater synergies the findings point towards a pattern of which values were expressed included or excluded in the circular wastewater system for example values expressed in the review or by respondents and written documents were more or less aligned when it came to tev classes none the less there might be conflicting values within a specific value class as indicated by the negative and positive existence values this indicates a potential risk of actors developing an internal value conflict as the circular water management scheme evolves it is therefore important to discuss different values early on in the process of creating collaborations around circular water resources where different values and goals become visible earlier research has shown the importance to visualise and verbalise values to achieve successful collaboration amongst divergent actors lazoroska and palm 2019 as shown in the review different value perceptions can be limited in scope the municipal organisation and the water and sewage organisation expressed a broad spectrum of value classes compared to the other organisations even if both the narrow and broad value classes were mainly aligned the different value focused e g direct use value vs option value can potentially lead to tensions between the involved actors bakker 2002 where the economic perspectives can impact the wastewater management gandy 2008 on the other hand when managed correctly which in this case means identifying stakeholder preferences and values and then balancing the incentives accordingly value perspectives can limit the tension between public and private management brown et al 2017 including ownership and control of water resources thus carrying out this kind of value mapping exercise prior to formally engaging in a wastewater symbiosis could help actors avoid such collaborative challenges indeed uncovering their different aspirations in a first step is important to allow actors in a second step to collectively align around goals and ambitions for joint commitments a limitation with this study is that it is a single case study a single case study can give a deep understanding of one case but it is not possible to draw general conclusions valid for all cases this has partly been alleviated in this paper by presenting the case study results within the context of the literature review the literature review is by no means exhaustive in terms of being all encompassing with regard to the plethora of value perspectives but it focusses on tev and organisation form still this is a limitation of the study the scope and depth of the analysis in this paper warrant specificity when it comes to material selection with the well defined search and selection process used here the coding frame makes it possible to explore identified values and contribute with analytical generalisations in future studies it would be interesting to make a comparative study between value categories expressed in an emerging versus a well established circular water operation to investigate developments over time this could also give insights into how conflicting values both within and across organisations may have been handled another idea is to dive deeper into different organisational attributes of actors taking part in circular water management operations in doing so researchers could create a better understanding of how organisational governance factors interact with or impact each other and the outcomes of resource synergies it would also be valuable to expand the study of values in other resource efficient systems by focusing on other resource flows perhaps placing energy exchanges at the centre instead of wastewater which was the focus of this paper 6 conclusion the literature review revealed that tev in relation to circular water management is previously unexplored in terms of value classes earlier studies have identified and expressed a rather narrow value scope since mainly positive direct and indirect value classes were identified from a market orientated organisational perspective the majority of the identified values are direct use values followed by indirect use values existence and option values when it comes to hierarchical and hybrid organisations values also include negative indirect values results from the emerging circular wastewater collaboration in simrishamn showed that all classes of value were expressed although to varying degrees respondents mainly referred to direct and indirect use values when discussing wastewater synergies or symbiosis looking at organisational belonging the material indicates that respondents belonging to organisations that are not dominated by a market form of governance to a higher degree referred to multiple classes of value ranging from direct and indirect use value to option and quasi option value and existence value respondents belonging to organisations with a market inclined form of governance however primarily expressed direct use value this study finds that there is a certain level of value coherence amongst organisations involved developing circular wastewater management this can help minimize conflicts around decision making and build consensus around how resources should be shared and how to organise a symbiosis this also accentuates the understanding of what values that are the most effective when it comes to sustainable decision making ultimately this study shows the importance of a detailed understanding of value perspectives and the impact it can have on circular wastewater management overall the analysis through this framework allows for a more robust and accurate assessment of the impacts of various activities or policies it provides decision makers with a more complete picture of the costs and benefits involved thereby enabling them to make more informed choices that better align with societal goals and values it also provides important clues as to why some of these solutions are successfully implemented while others are not thus strategic planning and effective stakeholder engagement guided by value perspectives can enhance the legitimacy and facilitate the policy development of circular solutions credit author statement wadström c conceptualization investigation methodology

14953,developing high performance catalytic systems for eliminating contaminants effectively in water has received a lot of attention however the complexity of practical wastewater poses a challenge for degrading organic pollutants non radical active species with strong resistance to interference have shown great advantages in degrading organic pollutants under complex aqueous conditions herein a novel system was constructed by fe dpa cl2 fel dpa n n 4 nitro 1 2 phenylene dipicolinamide activating peroxymonosulfate pms the mechanism study verified that the fel pms system had high efficiency in producing high valent iron oxo and singlet oxygen 1o2 to degrade various organic pollutants in addition the chemical bonding between pms and fel was elucidated by the density functional theory dft calculations the fel pms system could remove 96 reactive red 195 rr195 in 2 min which was much higher than other systems involved in this study more attractively the fel pms system demonstrated general resistance to interference from common anions cl hco3 no3 and so4 2 humic acid ha and ph changes and were thus compatible with various natural waters this work provides a new approach for

peroxymonosulfate pms present great potential in water treatment sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh generated by pms activation possess high redox potentials 2 5 3 1 v for so4 and 1 9 2 7 v for oh li et al 2016 yao et al 2016 which can degrade organic pollutants efficiently however so4 and oh are often interfered by anions and co existing organics in industrial wastewater kong et al 2019 which severely limits the application of radical dominated catalytic systems in particular dyeing wastewater from the textile industry contains lots of inorganic ions so the removal of dyes remains a challenge in practice under this condition non radical catalytic systems based on pms have been researched gradually the high valent metal oxo and singlet oxygen 1o2 are important non radical reactive species with anti interference ability and have high oxidation properties for electron rich organics jin et al 2020 wei et al 2022 zhu et al 2019 more importantly compared with so4 and oh non radical reactive species can lower the depletion of reactive species by anions and natural organics in water maintaining positive oxidative activity in complex aqueous matrices chen et al 2021 li et al 2018 luo et al 2019 as a result the catalytic systems dominated by non radical active species exhibit attractive prospects in practical wastewater treatment a series of metal compounds such as transition metal salts zong et al 2020 2022 transition metal oxides kang et al 2021 zeng et al 2022 fe doped g c3n4 feng et al 2018 li et al 2019a and single atom catalysts li et al 2020 peng et al 2022 can generate the high valent metal oxo species these metal compounds have shown satisfactory performance in degrading a broad range of organic pollutants meanwhile 1o2 has received increasing attention as another important non radical reactive species carbon materials yun et al 2018 nitrogen doped n doped carbon based materials gao et al 2020 liu et al 2021 ma et al 2018 and co doped carbon based materials gao et al 2021 li et al 2022 miao et al 2021 exhibit great capability for activating pms to generate 1o2 recently the activation of pms by single atom catalysts supported by n doped carbon materials bursts with powerful potential for 1o2 production mi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 1o2 shows high resistance to inorganic ions and can be applied over a broad ph range zhang et al 2021 nonetheless the milder oxidation potential of 1o2 may limit its catalytic performance some recent research chen et al 2021 wei et al 2022 demonstrate that the combination of two non radical reactive species shows high efficiency in degrading organics in high salt wastewater previous research has shown that metal complexes can activate pms with trace dosage feng et al 2021 li et al 2018 yu et al 2020 and appear to be an excellent catalyst for producing non radical species so in this work a catalytic system was firstly constructed by fe dpa cl2 fel dpa n n 4 nitro 1 2 phenylene dipicolinamide complex and pms to degrade organic pollutants reactive red 195 rr195 is among the most widely used commercial dyes so it was chosen as the model of organic pollutants in this study radical quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr and probe experiments were conducted to investigate the active species furthermore the relevant mechanism was researched by the density functional theory dft calculations the removal kinetics of rr195 and impact of other reaction parameters on the performance of fel pms system were examined finally the resistance to complex aqueous environments

agents were 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp respectively the degradation intermediates of rr195 were tested by lc ms lc qtof ms agilent 1290 6550 specific details are provided in text s2 2 5 dft computational methods a more detailed description of the dft computational methods was displayed in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fel fig 1 shows the sem images of the dpa and fel at different magnifications the dpa and fel are both rod like structures under the action of coordination bonds the n atoms of the fel tend to form a coplanar structure with the iron atom which reduces the distortion and rotation of the dpa as a result compared with the dpa the crystals of fel took the form of a more regular rod like shape the formation of fe n coordination bonds in the fel complex was confirmed by xps analysis fig 2 which shows two new peaks with binding energies of 398 ev and 401 62 ev corresponding to the fe n and n c4 li et al 2017 tian et al 2020 appeared in the spectrum of fel in fig s1 the results of ftir spectra showed that the characteristic peak of nh stretching 3330 cm 1 present in the dpa spectrum which was absent in the fel spectrum meanwhile due to the coordination of dpa to fe3 c o and c n stretching peaks downshifted from 1701 cm 1 and 1668 cm 1 to 1625 cm 1 and 1597 cm 1 respectively the molecular ion of the complex m net 4 was also detected by hrms at 486 95407 fig s2 which was consistent with the theoretical value 486 95 as a result it can conclude that the fel has been successfully prepared 3 2 degradation performance of fel pms system the oxidant plays a critical role in the catalytic system liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 for this a series of systems was constituted by fel and different oxidants pms pc pb h2o2 pds and their degradation behaviors toward rr195 were evaluated as displayed in fig s3 fel had a high activation effect on these oxidants at different initial ph values except pds and the fel pms system exhibited the most excellent property in fig 3 a the catalytic performance of each system was compared at their optimal ph conditions the removal efficiency for rr195 in the fel pms system was 96 at 2 min and 98 at 30 min fig 3a comparatively catalytic systems based on pc pb h2o2 and pds showed only 28 24 26 and 1 removal efficiency at 2 min and 87 82 67 and 2 at 30 min respectively the superior degradation performance made the fel pms system stand out in summary it confirmed that the fel is an excellent activator for pms comparative experiments were carried out to further study the performance of fel pms in degrading rr195 fig 3b the removal efficiency of rr195 was 98 in 30 min by fel pms system however pms or fel alone was proved ineffective in removing rr195 suggesting that the inherent oxidation properties of pms and fel were negligible the structural analysis of the complexes verified that fe3 was coordinated with four n atoms and two cl ions fig s2 hocl and cl can be formed by cl react with radicals oh so4 lee et al 2020 luo et al 2019 and exhibit weak oxidation properties hence the role of cl was further investigated using nacl as the source of cl the research suggested that the pms nacl system was inefficient in the rr195 degradation less than 7 in 30 min indicating that cl played a minor role in this system moreover the degradation ability of the pms fe3 system was also detected using pms fecl3 the removal efficiency of rr195 in pms fecl3 system was 15 in 30 min which was much lower than the removal efficiency of the fel pms system despite enhancing the dosage of fecl3 in the pms fecl3 system to 75 μm it still had a lower removal efficiency for rr195 than the fel pms system fig s4 the research indicated that the fel pms system exhibited excellent properties in degradation rr195 which had potential application in wastewater treatment 3 3 study on the catalytic mechanism of fel pms system 3 3 1 investigation of active species in fel pms system the active species accountable for degrading rr195 were comprehensively investigated in the fel pms system in catalytic systems that contain the pms oh and so4 radicals are usually involved huang et al 2014 sun et al 2020 as depicted in fig 4 the four lines of peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were dmpo oh adducts cashman et al 2019 li et al 2019b indicating that oh existed in the fel pms system however there seemed to be no characteristic signal of so4 radicals in fig 4 hba can be oxidized to bq by so4 zhang et al 2021 therefore the so4 radicals were identified using hba as a probe there no added hba was oxidized to bq fig s5 which excluded the existence of so4 radicals in the fel pms system moreover quenching experiments of oh and so4 radicals were carried out to further clarify the effects of free radicals tba is usually used only as an oh quencher while etoh can quench oh and so4 kong et al 2019 yu et al 2020 herein tba and etoh concentrations ranging from 1000 mm to 6000 mm were used to investigate the role of oh and so4 in the removal of rr195 fig s6 the removal efficiency of rr195 was only slightly suppressed by tba or etoh fig s6 and fig s7 indicating that the removal of rr195 by so4 and oh was very weak consequently so4 and oh were not the dominant active species for degrading rr195 the potential influence of o2 was also researched in the fel pms system the nbt experiments showed no change in absorbance at 530 nm fig s8 indicating that nbt did not react with the superoxide radicals o2 bielski et al 1980 zheng et al 2022 the result suggested that the o2 radical may not exist in the fel pms system this conclusion was further confirmed by quenching experiments of o2 herein bq was used as a quenching reagent of o2 fan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 fig s7 when the bq content increased to 20 mm it had almost no inhibition on the degradation of rr195 the results of the above study excluded the effect of o2 in the fel pms system the above investigations verified that the degradation of rr195 did not via a radical process in the fel pms system therefore experiments were performed to investigate whether other non radical species were responsible for degrading rr195 such as high valent iron oxo species or 1o2 according to reports when the metal complexes are included in the catalytic systems chen et al 2020 han et al 2019 huang et al 2016 the high valent metal oxo usually exists herein pmso was chosen for detecting high valent iron oxo which can produce pmso2 after being oxidized by high valent metal oxo feng et al 2021 yu et al 2020 the standard samples of pmso and pmso2 were measured as controls respectively fig s9 the pmso2 peak appeared when pmso was added to the fel pms system considering that pmso also could be oxidized to pmso2 by pms control experiments were carried out in fig 5 it was observed that the content of pmso2 in the fel pms system was much higher than that in the pms system 0 6 mm in the former system and no more than 0 2 mm in the latter the increased concentration of pmso2 verified that high valent iron oxo was generated in the fel pms system in addition adding rr195 to the fel pms system resulted in significant inhibition of the production of pmso2 fig s10 all the results indicated that high valent iron oxo was generated which played a vital role in degrading rr195 in the fel pms system in addition to further clarify the reaction mechanism the generation and transformation of iron species have been explored in the rr195 degradation process the uv visible spectra are commonly employed to detect the signals of high valent metal oxo species as demonstrated in the above data the reaction in the fel pms system was performed very rapidly result in the traditional uv visible spectrophotometers can not capture the changes in the signals of iron species as a viable solution in situ absorption spectrometer was employed to identify changes in iron species in this study the in situ absorption spectrometer was constituted by tungsten lamp with a powerful emission light and a detector with a high sensitivity ms so that it can clearly record changes in iron species as shown in fig s11 when pms was added to the fel pms system the in situ absorption spectroscopy changed significantly from 0 to 24 s where a new peak emerged at 675 nm which was likely due to the generation of high valent iron oxo species after 24 s this peak at 675 nm gradually faded out suggesting the high valent iron oxo species was eventually consumed by rr195 the above findings provide another solid evidence for the generation of high valent iron oxo species in the fel pms system and their contribution to the degradation of rr195 as displayed in fig 6 a a triplet peak with an intensity of 1 1 1 was observed it was typical of the epr signal of temp 1o2 demonstrating the presence of 1o2 in the fel pms system dong et al 2022 fan et al 2019 although the pms could generate 1o2 alone the signal intensity was much weaker than that of the fel pms system indicating that the interaction between fel and pms was primarily responsible for the 1o2 produced in the system in addition as a typical 1o2 scavenger ffa was used to explore the role of 1o2 on rr195 degradation in this system dong et al 2022 the obvious inhibition of catalytic degradation of rr195 could be observed as the ffa content was enhanced to 500 mm fig 6b l histidine was added to the system as another quenching reagent of 1o2 and it had the same inhibitory effect on the removal of rr195 fig s12 overall it indicated that 1o2 contributed to the degradation of rr195 as another non radical species in the fel pms system 3 3 2 dft calculations to study the mechanism of pms activation by fel deeply the binding site between fel and pms and the electrostatic potential esp of the pms surface were calculated in fig 7 a the o1 site of pms possessed the lowest esp compared with o2 and o3 the two remaining oxygen atoms of pms are equivalent to o1 more electrons are present on the o1 surface which makes binding to fel more advantageous additionally the conformation of pms adsorption on fel was optimized and the corresponding adsorption energies eads were calculated fig 7b d showed the three optimized conformations with the eads of 75 724 kj mol 55 893 kj mol and 52 687 kj mol respectively the o1 site of pms adsorbed on the fel was more stable due to the highest adsorption energy in agreement with the results of the esp fig 7a the possible mechanism of fel pms degradation of rr195 was proposed based on the exploration of active species and the results of dft calculations as shown in fig 8 the specific reaction process involved in the fel pms system was shown in eqs 2 9 during pms activation the central metal ion of fel could coordinate with the o atom of pms when the coordinating atom of the pms was o1 or o2 the central metal ion of the fel complex could receive electrons from pms and be reduced to l fe ⅱ eq 2 feng et al 2018 wei et al 2022 meanwhile the pms was oxidized to so5 which could be combined to produce 1o2 eqs 3 4 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 as further evidence the ferrous ions were tested in this system fig s13 furthermore when the o3 atom of pms coordinated with the central metal ion of fel the l fe ⅴ o was produced as the high valent iron oxo eq 5 feng et al 2021 similarly the l fe ⅱ generated in eq 2 could continue to coordinate with o3 atom of pms and generate the l fe ⅳ o active species eq 6 finally the high valent iron oxo l fe ⅴ ⅳ o and 1o2 act as the dominant species to degrade the substrates eqs 7 9 2 l fe i i i hso 5 l fe i i so 5 h 3 so 5 so 5 s 2 o 8 2 1 o 2 4 so 5 so 5 2 so 4 2 1 o 2 5 l fe i i i hso 5 l fe v o so 4 2 h 6

of fel dosage on the removal efficiency of rr195 were explored when the fel dosage was raised from 5 μm to 20 μm the removal efficiency of rr195 increased from 95 to 98 fig s14a the kinetics of the rr195 removal were investigated by varying the dose of fel employing in situ absorption spectroscopy in this experiment the concentration of fel pms rr195 was proportionally decreased by one order of magnitude to avoid the signal saturation in the spectrometer however as discussed below the kinetics show a pseudo first order indicating the reaction kinetics are independent of the initial concentration of reactants therefore the kinetics reported herein are able to indicate the reaction pathway and process during the catalytic dye decomposition without needing to consider the initial concentration the results were fitted with the pseudo first order kinetics at varying fel concentrations fig 9 a as shown in the inset of fig 9a the k value for rr195 removal increased linearly with the fel dosage from 0 5 to 2 0 μm at the same pms dosage 0 1 mm suggesting that the formation of the reactive species was proportional to the dosage of fel the removal efficiency of rr195 was also enhanced by raising the concentration of the oxidant pms fig s14b as shown in the inset of fig 9b the k value for rr195 removal also increased linearly with the pms dosage from 0 010 to 0 100 mm at the same fel dosage 1 5 μm which indicated that the production of active species was also proportional to the amount of pms the above experiments demonstrated that raising the amount of fel and pms could promote the production of reactive species and accelerate the removal of rr195 in fig s15a a slight decline in the removal efficiency occurred as the concentration of the dye raised from 0 1 mm to 0 6 mm this impact was due to the limited quantity of active species jin et al 2018 which were unable to destroy all the dyes in this system ultimately leading to a slight decrease in degradation efficiency fortunately for rr195 with an initial concentration of 0 6 mm over 90 removal efficiency was still achieved in 30 min the properties of the fel pms system on degrading different kinds of organics were further evaluated in fig s15b the removal efficiency of rr195 rb19 ar1 rhb 4 cp and 2 4 dcp the related structures are shown in table s2 were about 98 99 100 100 100 and 100 at 30 min respectively which verified that the fel pms system was suitable for degrading different organic pollutants in table s3 the degradation performance of the fel pms system on treating dyeing wastewater was compared with the existing pms activation techniques the results showed that the fel exhibited higher efficiency in activating the pms which demonstrated the practical application potential of the fel pms system 3 5 resisting interference ability of fel pms system in different water situations in actual water situations some anions and co existing organics can consume radicals such as oh and so4 resulting in an inefficient degradation in the radicals dominated oxidation system luo et al 2019 especially inorganic salt ions are often present in the dyeing wastewater which leads to inefficient degradation of dyes in the radicals based catalytic system herein the resistance of the fel pms system to added anions cl hco3 no3 so4 2 was investigated as shown in fig s16a the system displayed excellent resistance to all added anions where the removal efficiency of rr195 at 30 min remained efficient at a dosage of ainons up to 20 mm moreover ha was added to the system as a natural organic model when 20 mg l ha was present in the fel pms system the efficient removal of rr195 could be maintained fig s16a noteworthy the removal efficiency of rr195 by the fel pms system was not affected by ph and it could maintain excellent performance over a wide range of ph values 4 10 fig s16b the rr195 degradation performance in different actual water bodies was also explored including deionized water tap water yangtze river water and lake water donghua university campus the physicochemical characteristics of the water bodies were provided in table s4 as shown in fig s17 the influences of water bodies on the degradation of rr195 could be negligible all the above studies verified that the fel pms system exhibits strong resistance to complex aqueous water situations 3 6 rr195 degradation pathways in the fel pms the degradation intermediates of rr195 in the fel pms system were examined by lc ms and eight key intermediates were identified fig s18 and table s5 based on these intermediates the degradation pathway of rr195 was proposed fig 10 in the fel pms system the diazo linkage and cn bond of rr195 could be cleaved by the oxidization of high valent iron oxo species and 1o2 in detail mct monochlorotriazine moiety of rr195 first underwent hydrolysis and dephenylation followed by cleavage of the diazo linkage by oxidation to afford p1 which consecutively lost the triazine moiety to afford p2 on the other hand the cn bond linking the naphthalene ring to the triazine ring in rr195 could be cleaved first to produce p3 which underwent hydrolysis to give p4 decomposition of p4 by hydrolysis of sulfate and oxidative de amination would lead to the formation of p5 and p6 respectively p6 could undergo further oxidation to yield p7 and p8 4 conclusions this study constructed a highly effective catalytic system by fel activated pms fel has the potential to activate a wide range of oxidants including pms pc pb and h2o2 the pms could be rapidly activated by fel and fel pms system showed excellent degradation performance for rr195 96 in 2 min epr tests radical quenching and pmso probe experiments suggested that the fel pms system degraded the rr195 via a non radical process dominated by fe ⅴ ⅳ o and 1o2 meanwhile the catalytic mechanism was further proved by dft calculations more interestingly with the nonradical dominated degradation process the fel pms system could avoid the impacts of anions cl hco3 no3 and so4 2 and ha in solution which could be used to remove different organic contaminants in different water environments with a wide ph range overall fel pms has promising applications in treating complex organic wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

peroxymonosulfate pms present great potential in water treatment sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh generated by pms activation possess high redox potentials 2 5 3 1 v for so4 and 1 9 2 7 v for oh li et al 2016 yao et al 2016 which can degrade organic pollutants efficiently however so4 and oh are often interfered by anions and co existing organics in industrial wastewater kong et al 2019 which severely limits the application of radical dominated catalytic systems in particular dyeing wastewater from the textile industry contains lots of inorganic ions so the removal of dyes remains a challenge in practice under this condition non radical catalytic systems based on pms have been researched gradually the high valent metal oxo and singlet oxygen 1o2 are important non radical reactive species with anti interference ability and have high oxidation properties for electron rich organics jin et al 2020 wei et al 2022 zhu et al 2019 more importantly compared with so4 and oh non radical reactive species can lower the depletion of reactive species by anions and natural organics in water maintaining positive oxidative activity in complex aqueous matrices chen et al 2021 li et al 2018 luo et al 2019 as a result the catalytic systems dominated by non radical active species exhibit attractive prospects in practical wastewater treatment a series of metal compounds such as transition metal salts zong et al 2020 2022 transition metal oxides kang et al 2021 zeng et al 2022 fe doped g c3n4 feng et al 2018 li et al 2019a and single atom catalysts li et al 2020 peng et al 2022 can generate the high valent metal oxo species these metal compounds have shown satisfactory performance in degrading a broad range of organic pollutants meanwhile 1o2 has received increasing attention as another important non radical reactive species carbon materials yun et al 2018 nitrogen doped n doped carbon based materials gao et al 2020 liu et al 2021 ma et al 2018 and co doped carbon based materials gao et al 2021 li et al 2022 miao et al 2021 exhibit great capability for activating pms to generate 1o2 recently the activation of pms by single atom catalysts supported by n doped carbon materials bursts with powerful potential for 1o2 production mi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 1o2 shows high resistance to inorganic ions and can be applied over a broad ph range zhang et al 2021 nonetheless the milder oxidation potential of 1o2 may limit its catalytic performance some recent research chen et al 2021 wei et al 2022 demonstrate that the combination of two non radical reactive species shows high efficiency in degrading organics in high salt wastewater previous research has shown that metal complexes can activate pms with trace dosage feng et al 2021 li et al 2018 yu et al 2020 and appear to be an excellent catalyst for producing non radical species so in this work a catalytic system was firstly constructed by fe dpa cl2 fel dpa n n 4 nitro 1 2 phenylene dipicolinamide complex and pms to degrade organic pollutants reactive red 195 rr195 is among the most widely used commercial dyes so it was chosen as the model of organic pollutants in this study radical quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr and probe experiments were conducted to investigate the active species furthermore the relevant mechanism was researched by the density functional theory dft calculations the removal kinetics of rr195 and impact of other reaction parameters on the performance of fel pms system were examined finally the resistance to complex aqueous environments

agents were 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp respectively the degradation intermediates of rr195 were tested by lc ms lc qtof ms agilent 1290 6550 specific details are provided in text s2 2 5 dft computational methods a more detailed description of the dft computational methods was displayed in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fel fig 1 shows the sem images of the dpa and fel at different magnifications the dpa and fel are both rod like structures under the action of coordination bonds the n atoms of the fel tend to form a coplanar structure with the iron atom which reduces the distortion and rotation of the dpa as a result compared with the dpa the crystals of fel took the form of a more regular rod like shape the formation of fe n coordination bonds in the fel complex was confirmed by xps analysis fig 2 which shows two new peaks with binding energies of 398 ev and 401 62 ev corresponding to the fe n and n c4 li et al 2017 tian et al 2020 appeared in the spectrum of fel in fig s1 the results of ftir spectra showed that the characteristic peak of nh stretching 3330 cm 1 present in the dpa spectrum which was absent in the fel spectrum meanwhile due to the coordination of dpa to fe3 c o and c n stretching peaks downshifted from 1701 cm 1 and 1668 cm 1 to 1625 cm 1 and 1597 cm 1 respectively the molecular ion of the complex m net 4 was also detected by hrms at 486 95407 fig s2 which was consistent with the theoretical value 486 95 as a result it can conclude that the fel has been successfully prepared 3 2 degradation performance of fel pms system the oxidant plays a critical role in the catalytic system liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 for this a series of systems was constituted by fel and different oxidants pms pc pb h2o2 pds and their degradation behaviors toward rr195 were evaluated as displayed in fig s3 fel had a high activation effect on these oxidants at different initial ph values except pds and the fel pms system exhibited the most excellent property in fig 3 a the catalytic performance of each system was compared at their optimal ph conditions the removal efficiency for rr195 in the fel pms system was 96 at 2 min and 98 at 30 min fig 3a comparatively catalytic systems based on pc pb h2o2 and pds showed only 28 24 26 and 1 removal efficiency at 2 min and 87 82 67 and 2 at 30 min respectively the superior degradation performance made the fel pms system stand out in summary it confirmed that the fel is an excellent activator for pms comparative experiments were carried out to further study the performance of fel pms in degrading rr195 fig 3b the removal efficiency of rr195 was 98 in 30 min by fel pms system however pms or fel alone was proved ineffective in removing rr195 suggesting that the inherent oxidation properties of pms and fel were negligible the structural analysis of the complexes verified that fe3 was coordinated with four n atoms and two cl ions fig s2 hocl and cl can be formed by cl react with radicals oh so4 lee et al 2020 luo et al 2019 and exhibit weak oxidation properties hence the role of cl was further investigated using nacl as the source of cl the research suggested that the pms nacl system was inefficient in the rr195 degradation less than 7 in 30 min indicating that cl played a minor role in this system moreover the degradation ability of the pms fe3 system was also detected using pms fecl3 the removal efficiency of rr195 in pms fecl3 system was 15 in 30 min which was much lower than the removal efficiency of the fel pms system despite enhancing the dosage of fecl3 in the pms fecl3 system to 75 μm it still had a lower removal efficiency for rr195 than the fel pms system fig s4 the research indicated that the fel pms system exhibited excellent properties in degradation rr195 which had potential application in wastewater treatment 3 3 study on the catalytic mechanism of fel pms system 3 3 1 investigation of active species in fel pms system the active species accountable for degrading rr195 were comprehensively investigated in the fel pms system in catalytic systems that contain the pms oh and so4 radicals are usually involved huang et al 2014 sun et al 2020 as depicted in fig 4 the four lines of peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were dmpo oh adducts cashman et al 2019 li et al 2019b indicating that oh existed in the fel pms system however there seemed to be no characteristic signal of so4 radicals in fig 4 hba can be oxidized to bq by so4 zhang et al 2021 therefore the so4 radicals were identified using hba as a probe there no added hba was oxidized to bq fig s5 which excluded the existence of so4 radicals in the fel pms system moreover quenching experiments of oh and so4 radicals were carried out to further clarify the effects of free radicals tba is usually used only as an oh quencher while etoh can quench oh and so4 kong et al 2019 yu et al 2020 herein tba and etoh concentrations ranging from 1000 mm to 6000 mm were used to investigate the role of oh and so4 in the removal of rr195 fig s6 the removal efficiency of rr195 was only slightly suppressed by tba or etoh fig s6 and fig s7 indicating that the removal of rr195 by so4 and oh was very weak consequently so4 and oh were not the dominant active species for degrading rr195 the potential influence of o2 was also researched in the fel pms system the nbt experiments showed no change in absorbance at 530 nm fig s8 indicating that nbt did not react with the superoxide radicals o2 bielski et al 1980 zheng et al 2022 the result suggested that the o2 radical may not exist in the fel pms system this conclusion was further confirmed by quenching experiments of o2 herein bq was used as a quenching reagent of o2 fan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 fig s7 when the bq content increased to 20 mm it had almost no inhibition on the degradation of rr195 the results of the above study excluded the effect of o2 in the fel pms system the above investigations verified that the degradation of rr195 did not via a radical process in the fel pms system therefore experiments were performed to investigate whether other non radical species were responsible for degrading rr195 such as high valent iron oxo species or 1o2 according to reports when the metal complexes are included in the catalytic systems chen et al 2020 han et al 2019 huang et al 2016 the high valent metal oxo usually exists herein pmso was chosen for detecting high valent iron oxo which can produce pmso2 after being oxidized by high valent metal oxo feng et al 2021 yu et al 2020 the standard samples of pmso and pmso2 were measured as controls respectively fig s9 the pmso2 peak appeared when pmso was added to the fel pms system considering that pmso also could be oxidized to pmso2 by pms control experiments were carried out in fig 5 it was observed that the content of pmso2 in the fel pms system was much higher than that in the pms system 0 6 mm in the former system and no more than 0 2 mm in the latter the increased concentration of pmso2 verified that high valent iron oxo was generated in the fel pms system in addition adding rr195 to the fel pms system resulted in significant inhibition of the production of pmso2 fig s10 all the results indicated that high valent iron oxo was generated which played a vital role in degrading rr195 in the fel pms system in addition to further clarify the reaction mechanism the generation and transformation of iron species have been explored in the rr195 degradation process the uv visible spectra are commonly employed to detect the signals of high valent metal oxo species as demonstrated in the above data the reaction in the fel pms system was performed very rapidly result in the traditional uv visible spectrophotometers can not capture the changes in the signals of iron species as a viable solution in situ absorption spectrometer was employed to identify changes in iron species in this study the in situ absorption spectrometer was constituted by tungsten lamp with a powerful emission light and a detector with a high sensitivity ms so that it can clearly record changes in iron species as shown in fig s11 when pms was added to the fel pms system the in situ absorption spectroscopy changed significantly from 0 to 24 s where a new peak emerged at 675 nm which was likely due to the generation of high valent iron oxo species after 24 s this peak at 675 nm gradually faded out suggesting the high valent iron oxo species was eventually consumed by rr195 the above findings provide another solid evidence for the generation of high valent iron oxo species in the fel pms system and their contribution to the degradation of rr195 as displayed in fig 6 a a triplet peak with an intensity of 1 1 1 was observed it was typical of the epr signal of temp 1o2 demonstrating the presence of 1o2 in the fel pms system dong et al 2022 fan et al 2019 although the pms could generate 1o2 alone the signal intensity was much weaker than that of the fel pms system indicating that the interaction between fel and pms was primarily responsible for the 1o2 produced in the system in addition as a typical 1o2 scavenger ffa was used to explore the role of 1o2 on rr195 degradation in this system dong et al 2022 the obvious inhibition of catalytic degradation of rr195 could be observed as the ffa content was enhanced to 500 mm fig 6b l histidine was added to the system as another quenching reagent of 1o2 and it had the same inhibitory effect on the removal of rr195 fig s12 overall it indicated that 1o2 contributed to the degradation of rr195 as another non radical species in the fel pms system 3 3 2 dft calculations to study the mechanism of pms activation by fel deeply the binding site between fel and pms and the electrostatic potential esp of the pms surface were calculated in fig 7 a the o1 site of pms possessed the lowest esp compared with o2 and o3 the two remaining oxygen atoms of pms are equivalent to o1 more electrons are present on the o1 surface which makes binding to fel more advantageous additionally the conformation of pms adsorption on fel was optimized and the corresponding adsorption energies eads were calculated fig 7b d showed the three optimized conformations with the eads of 75 724 kj mol 55 893 kj mol and 52 687 kj mol respectively the o1 site of pms adsorbed on the fel was more stable due to the highest adsorption energy in agreement with the results of the esp fig 7a the possible mechanism of fel pms degradation of rr195 was proposed based on the exploration of active species and the results of dft calculations as shown in fig 8 the specific reaction process involved in the fel pms system was shown in eqs 2 9 during pms activation the central metal ion of fel could coordinate with the o atom of pms when the coordinating atom of the pms was o1 or o2 the central metal ion of the fel complex could receive electrons from pms and be reduced to l fe ⅱ eq 2 feng et al 2018 wei et al 2022 meanwhile the pms was oxidized to so5 which could be combined to produce 1o2 eqs 3 4 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 as further evidence the ferrous ions were tested in this system fig s13 furthermore when the o3 atom of pms coordinated with the central metal ion of fel the l fe ⅴ o was produced as the high valent iron oxo eq 5 feng et al 2021 similarly the l fe ⅱ generated in eq 2 could continue to coordinate with o3 atom of pms and generate the l fe ⅳ o active species eq 6 finally the high valent iron oxo l fe ⅴ ⅳ o and 1o2 act as the dominant species to degrade the substrates eqs 7 9 2 l fe i i i hso 5 l fe i i so 5 h 3 so 5 so 5 s 2 o 8 2 1 o 2 4 so 5 so 5 2 so 4 2 1 o 2 5 l fe i i i hso 5 l fe v o so 4 2 h 6 l fe i i hso 5 l fe i v o so 4 2 h 7 l fe v o pollutants l fe i i i products 8 l fe i v o pollutants l fe i i products 9 1 o 2 pollutants products 3 4 influence of degradation conditions the impacts of fel dosage on the removal efficiency of rr195 were explored when the fel dosage was raised from 5 μm to 20 μm the removal efficiency of rr195 increased from 95 to 98 fig s14a the kinetics of the rr195 removal were investigated by varying the dose of fel employing in situ absorption spectroscopy in this experiment the concentration of fel pms rr195 was proportionally decreased by one order of magnitude to avoid the signal saturation in the spectrometer however as discussed below the kinetics show a pseudo first order indicating the reaction kinetics are independent of the initial concentration of reactants therefore the kinetics reported herein are able to indicate the reaction pathway and process during the catalytic dye decomposition without needing to consider the initial concentration the results were fitted with the pseudo first order kinetics at varying fel concentrations fig 9 a as shown in the inset of fig 9a the k value for rr195 removal increased linearly with the fel dosage from 0 5 to 2 0 μm at the same pms dosage 0 1 mm suggesting that the formation of the reactive species was proportional to the dosage of fel the removal efficiency of rr195 was also enhanced by raising the concentration of the oxidant pms fig s14b as shown in the inset of fig 9b the k value for rr195 removal also increased linearly with the pms dosage from 0 010 to 0 100 mm at the same fel dosage 1 5 μm which indicated that the production of active species was also proportional to the amount of pms the above experiments demonstrated that raising the amount of fel and pms could promote the production of reactive species and accelerate the removal of rr195 in fig s15a a slight decline in the removal efficiency occurred as the concentration of the dye raised from 0 1 mm to 0 6 mm this impact was due to the limited quantity of active species jin et al 2018 which were unable to destroy all the dyes in this system ultimately leading to a slight decrease in degradation efficiency fortunately for rr195 with an initial concentration of 0 6 mm over 90 removal efficiency was still achieved in 30 min the properties of the fel pms system on degrading different kinds of organics were further evaluated in fig s15b the removal efficiency of rr195 rb19 ar1 rhb 4 cp and 2 4 dcp the related structures are shown in table s2 were about 98 99 100 100 100 and 100 at 30 min respectively which verified that the fel pms system was suitable for degrading different organic pollutants in table s3 the degradation performance of the fel pms system on treating dyeing wastewater was compared with the existing pms activation techniques the results showed that the fel exhibited higher efficiency in activating the pms which demonstrated the practical application potential of the fel pms system 3 5 resisting interference ability of fel pms system in different water situations in actual water situations some anions and co existing organics can consume radicals such as oh and so4 resulting in an inefficient degradation in the radicals dominated oxidation system luo et al 2019 especially inorganic salt ions are often present in the dyeing wastewater which leads to inefficient degradation of dyes in the radicals based catalytic system herein the resistance of the fel pms system to added anions cl hco3 no3 so4 2 was investigated as shown in fig s16a the system displayed excellent resistance to all added anions where the removal efficiency of rr195 at 30 min remained efficient at a dosage of ainons up to 20 mm moreover ha was added to the system as a natural organic model when 20 mg l ha was present in the fel pms system the efficient removal of rr195 could be maintained fig s16a noteworthy the removal efficiency of rr195 by the fel pms system was not affected by ph and it could maintain excellent performance over a wide range of ph values 4 10 fig s16b the rr195 degradation performance in different actual water bodies was also explored including deionized water tap water yangtze river water and lake water donghua university campus the physicochemical characteristics of the water bodies were provided in table s4 as shown in fig s17 the influences of water bodies on the degradation of rr195 could be negligible all the above studies verified that the fel pms system exhibits strong resistance to complex aqueous water situations 3 6 rr195 degradation pathways in the fel pms the degradation intermediates of rr195 in the fel pms system were examined by lc ms and eight key intermediates were identified fig s18 and table s5 based on these intermediates the degradation pathway of rr195 was proposed fig 10 in the fel pms system the diazo linkage and cn bond of rr195 could be cleaved by the oxidization of high valent iron oxo species and 1o2 in detail mct monochlorotriazine moiety of rr195 first underwent hydrolysis and dephenylation followed by cleavage of the diazo linkage by oxidation to afford p1 which consecutively lost the triazine moiety to afford p2 on the other hand the cn bond linking the naphthalene ring to the triazine ring in rr195 could be cleaved first to produce p3 which underwent hydrolysis to give p4 decomposition of p4 by hydrolysis of sulfate and oxidative de amination would lead to the formation of p5 and p6 respectively p6 could undergo further oxidation to yield p7 and p8 4 conclusions this study constructed a highly effective catalytic system by fel activated pms fel has the potential to activate a wide range of oxidants including pms pc pb and h2o2 the pms could be rapidly activated by fel and fel pms system showed excellent degradation performance for rr195 96 in 2 min epr tests radical quenching and pmso probe experiments suggested that the fel pms system degraded the rr195 via a non radical process dominated by fe ⅴ ⅳ o and 1o2 meanwhile the catalytic mechanism was further proved by dft calculations more interestingly with the nonradical dominated degradation process the fel pms system could avoid the impacts of anions cl hco3 no3 and so4 2 and ha in solution which could be used to remove different organic contaminants in different water environments with a wide ph range overall fel pms has promising applications in treating complex organic wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

of civil mining and environmental engineering university of wollongong australia campylobacter jejuni and coli are two main pathogenic species inducing diarrhoeal diseases in humans which are responsible for the loss of 33 million lives each year current campylobacter infections are mainly monitored by clinical surveillance which is often limited to individuals seeking treatment resulting in under reporting of disease prevalence and untimely indicators of community outbreaks wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been developed and employed for the wastewater surveillance of pathogenic viruses and bacteria monitoring the temporal changes of pathogen concentration in wastewater allows the early detection of disease outbreaks in a community however studies investigating the wbe back estimation of campylobacter spp are rare essential factors including the analytical recovery efficiency the decay rate the effect of in sewer transport and the correlation between the wastewater concentration and the infections in communities are lacking to support wastewater surveillance this study carried out experiments to investigate the recovery of campylobacter jejuni and coli from wastewater and the decay under different simulated sewer reactor conditions it was found that the recovery of campylobacter spp from wastewater varied with their concentrations in wastewater and depended on the detection limit of quantification methods the concentration reduction of campylobacter jejuni and coli in sewers followed a two phase reduction model and the faster concentration reduction during the first phase is mainly due to their partitioning onto sewer biofilms the total decay of campylobacter jejuni and coli varied in different types of sewer reactors i e rising main vs gravity sewer in addition the sensitivity analysis for wbe back estimation of campylobacter suggested that the first phase decay rate constant k 1 and the turning time point t 1 are determining factors and their impacts increased with the hydraulic retention time of wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords campylobacter coli campylobacter jejuni wastewater decay sewer biofilm wastewater based epidemiology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction outbreaks of infectious diseases cause losses in both human and animal lives and serious economic damage to societies especially in urban areas with high population density campylobacter is one of the main pathogens causing bacterial gastroenteritis campylobacter jejuni c jejuni and campylobacter coli c coli are the top two thermophilic campylobacter species that are responsible for more than 95 of campylobacter induced illness worldwide dai et al 2020 c jejuni and c coli widely exist in animal food products with a mean prevalence of 19 3 and 9 7 respectively while eggs sausages milk and dairy products were found to have the lowest prevalence zbrun et al 2020 the infection dose of campylobacter spp is as low as 500 cells epps et al 2013 the high prevalence in the food and the low infectious dose makes campylobacter spp the most common cause of human gastroenteritis in the world kaakoush et al 2015 the disease surveillance for campylobacter spp has been reported by using food products and clinical samples joensen et al 2021 tong et al 2021 however the true incidence of gastroenteritis caused by campylobacter is poorly understood particularly in low and middle income countries studies in high income countries estimate the annual incidence to be 4 4 9 3 per 1000 population world health organization et al 2013 guillain barre syndrome gbs is one of the main sequelae of campylobacteriosis which is a serious illness with about 20 requiring intensive care the fatality rate in high income countries is 3 10 globally about one third of gbs cases have been attributed to campylobacter infection world health organization et al 2013 traditional disease detection of campylobacter infections relies on clinical diagnosis which is untimely and only based on people who attend healthcare facilities for treatment thus the clinical report usually leads to an underestimation of disease prevalence and it is hard to achieve early warnings of public health threats seventer and hochberg 2017 wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a relatively new method based on the analysis of chemicals and biomarkers in raw wastewater to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on the activities of residents in the sewer catchment area choi et al 2018 rousis et al 2017 sims and kasprzyk 2020 wbe based disease surveillance can provide near real time evidence to reveal that the infectious agent or its genetic component has entered the sewage system sometimes even days before symptoms appear and often before an infected person comes into contact with a healthcare facility tiwari et al 2023 therefore wbe is suggested as a promising pathway to provide early warning of disease outbreaks in addition in countries with limited resources wbe is regarded as an attractive complementary approach since it is an inexpensive and non invasive method of population surveillance compared to individual tests shrestha et al 2021 with the ever increasing public concerns about infectious diseases aroused by the covid 19 pandemic wbe based disease surveillance was reported can achieve early warning of different human pathogens induced outbreaks including both pathogenic viruses and bacteria abdeldayem et al 2022 anand et al 2022 riquelme et al 2021 zahedi et al 2021 wbe back estimation of sars cov 2 prevalence in communities has been established and evaluated for the application of other pathogenic viruses guo et al 2022 li et al 2022 2021b however only a few studies were reported for the surveillance of campylobacter prevalence based on wastewater bonetta et al 2016 hellein et al 2011 there is a lack of systematic studies about the key wbe steps including the recovery rate during detection the decay rate in wastewater the impact of sewer conditions and the back calculation of infections in communities according to the report of the global water pathogen project in 2017 significant data gaps exist in terms of the persistence of campylobacter in wastewater and the environmental conditions that can affect the persistence orner et al 2018 when evaluating microbial persistence in water bodies the temperature sunlight dissolved oxygen do soluble chemical oxygen demand scod nutrient availability and salinity were found to be important environmental conditions orner et al 2018 for wastewater based epidemiology the decay reduction of the biomarker concentration during the in sewer transport is also essential for the wbe back estimation li et al 2021c sewer systems could be divided into two main types by the flow regimes including rising mains rm and gravity sewers gs rising main pipelines are used to transport wastewater to higher elevations and operate under anaerobic conditions due to the fully filled wastewater in pipelines in contrast gravity pipelines deliver wastewater to lower elevations by gravity and are usually partially filled with wastewater thus containing both aerobic and anaerobic conditions hvitved et al 2013 previous studies have compared and reported the stability of biomarkers e g licit drug and pharmaceutical biomarkers in wastewater only and in laboratory scale sewer biofilm reactors and demonstrated that the biomarkers stability evaluated with the biofilm free conditions cannot reflect sewer conditions choi et al 2020 li et al 2018 2021a however no such studies have been carried out for campylobacter spp to address the research gaps for the wastewater based epidemiology of campylobacter a battery of experiments was carried out including the assessment of the recovery rate of c jejuni c coli and c sputorum from wastewater at three different seeding levels the concentration reduction of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater phase in different types of laboratory scale sewer reactors the adsorption and desorption of c jejuni and c coli in sewer biofilms and their decay in the phases of wastewater and biofilms at room temperature our previously developed triplex qpcr assay for c jejuni and c coli quantification in wastewater with c sputorum as the inhibition control reported was adopted to delineate the recovery decay and adsorption desorption behaviours of c jejuni and c coli in sewers furthermore a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the decay parameters acquired in this study for the wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli the results of this study paved the road for wastewater surveillance of campylobacter induced illness and would help improve the accuracy of wbe back estimation of campylobacter spp prevalence in communities in addition the wastewater monitoring of campylobacter concentration changes could also provide a cost effective methodology for its surveillance in low and middle income countries to achieve early warning and timely intervention of disease outbreaks 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial cultures three campylobacter species including campylobacter jejuni subsp jejuni atcc 700 819 the campylobacter coli atcc 33 559 and the campylobacter sputorum biovar sputorum atcc 33 562 were purchased from the american type culture collection atcc all three strains were incubated on trypticase soy agar tsa with 5 sheep blood agar plates thermo fisher scientific australia for 2 5 days at 42 c under microaerophilic conditions anaerocult c for microbiology for the generation of an oxygen depleted and co2 enriched atmosphere in an anaerobic jar merck australia 2 2 wastewater samples wastewater samples collected from a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp in wollongong australia were used for the wastewater seeding experiments and in sewer decay batch tests these wastewater samples were tested as negative or having a ct value of more than 40 by pcr detection for all three campylobacter species of this study these samples were sent to the laboratory within 30 min and kept in the refrigerator at 4 c until further tests within one week all of these wastewater samples have typical ph values of 6 8 7 1 sulfate levels of 10 45 mg s l dissolved oxygen do levels of around 0 7 mg l total suspended solids tss levels of 200 600 mg l total chemical oxygen demand tcod levels of 150 500 mg l and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod levels of 50 130 mg l shi et al 2022 2 3 evaluation of campylobacter species recovery of wastewater the c jejuni c coli and c sputorum cultures were spiked into 1 ml of wastewater to get a series of positive wastewater mocks with gradient concentrations around 102 104 and 106 cells ml respectively c sputorum primarily as an animal pathogen is mainly used as an analytical control while c jejuni and c coli were evaluated as human pathogens for their fate in sewers since only rough concentrations are required log level and the recovery was calculated based on qpcr results the initial bacteria concentrations were determined with a cell density meter biochrom c08000 and converted automatically in the cell density calculator https www agilent com store biocalculators calcodbacterial jsp five parallel mocks were extracted at each concentration level then the spiked wastewater mocks were centrifugated at 12 000 g for 5 min in the lysing matrix e tube of the fastdna spin kit for soil mp bio australia then the supernatant was removed and the solid particle was used for further dna extraction the dna extraction was strictly conducted according to the instruction in the kit s manual the final extracted dna volume of the 1 ml wastewater sample was 50 μl all the extracted dna was stored at 80 c for further analysis 2 4 laboratory scale sewer system to simulate real sewers a laboratory scale sewer reactor system fig s1 was used in this study the sewer reactor system has been supplied with domestic wastewater collected from a wwtp in wollongong australia for biofilm cultivation since 2020 90 l of residential wastewater was collected every two weeks and kept at 4 c this system was made up of two types of reactors rising main rm reactors and gravity sewer gs reactors each with an 80 mm diameter and a water height of 150 mm our previous studies demonstrated that the laboratory scale sewer reactors can reflect real sewer conditions in terms of biofilms and their biological activities jiang et al 2009 thai et al 2014 the sewer reactors were used extensively in evaluating the stability of various biomarker compounds like illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals choi et al 2020 li et al 2019a 2018 the working volume of wastewater in each reactor was around 0 75 l each reactor has a total biofilm area of around 0 05 m2 including the reactor wall and carrier surface as a result the biofilm area to wastewater volume ratio a v was approximately 70 9 m2 m3 a magnetic stirrer mls8 velp scientific italy was employed to provide continuous mixing 250 rpm to create a modest shear force 1 7 pa on the inner surface of the reactor wall and to prevent solids from sinking at the bottom batch tests were conducted in the rm b and gs b reactors to measure biofilm activity table s1 including the sulfate reduction rate and cod reduction rate to ensure that the reactors had attained a steady state before the tests with campylobacter jiang et al 2009 li et al 2019a 2018 2 5 sewer reactor experiments and sampling schemes four reactors including the rm and gs sewage reactors rm b and gs b and two control reactors rm c and gs c were used for the in sewer decay batch tests the control reactors are empty reactors with the same construction as the biofilm reactors but without biofilms before each batch test wastewater was continuously pumped into the sewer system for 5 min to refresh all the working wastewater in rm and gs sewer reactors simultaneously 0 75 l of wastewater was added to the rm c and gs c control reactors for parallel testing the temperature of the wastewater was around room temperature around 15 c since the sewer system was located in a lab without an air conditioner and the experiments were carried out during july 2022 this temperature is much lower than the optimal growth temperature of campylobacter at 37 42 c davis and dirita 2008 there is negligible multiplication of campylobacter during the test considering its doubling time around 2 7 h battersby et al 2016 then a volume of 5 ml c jejuni and c coli mix bacteria culture was spiked into both control rm c and gs c and sewer reactors rm b and gs b and waited for 2 min to allow a thorough mixing in reactors the concentration of c jejuni and c coli was around 107 108 cells l at the beginning of batch tests the duration of one complete batch test was 36 h including one 24 h decay adsorption test followed by another 12 h desorption test first 1 ml wastewater was sampled from rm b gs b rm c and gs c reactors at the time points of 0 h 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 12 h and 24 h one bio carrier biofilm sample was also collected at the time points of 0 h 12 h and 24 h for adsorption evaluation then after the wastewater and biofilm samples of 24 h were collected new wastewater without seeding was pumped into the sewer system for 5 min to refresh the seeding wastewater in sewer reactors rm b and gs b after that 1 ml wastewater was sampled from rm b and gs b reactors at the time points of 0 h 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 12 h after the pumping event to evaluate the desorption of c jejuni and c coli from sewer biofilms meanwhile one bio carrier biofilm sample was also collected at the time points of 12 h for the final desorption evaluation in conclusion a total number of 17 wastewater samples and four biofilm samples four bio carriers were collected for each sewage reactor rm b and gs b during one complete batch test within 36 h for control reactors nine wastewater samples were collected for each sewer reactor during one complete batch test to evaluate the decay of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater under biofilm free conditions within 24 h 2 6 sample processing dna extraction and the triplex qpcr assay for campylobacter the genomic template dna of three campylobacter species used for the positive control of the triplex qpcr test were extracted from each bacteria culture by using the genelute bacterial genomic dna kits sigma aldrich australia the dna quality was assessed using the nanodrop 2000c thermo fisher scientific australia and the dna concentration was determined using the qubit 4 0 fluorometer and the qubit 1 dsdna high sensitivity hs and broad range br assay kits 0 1 120 ng thermo fisher scientific australia the final concentration of each template dna used in the qpcr assay was adjusted to 0 2 ng µl and stored at 80 c for the dna extraction of wastewater samples 1 ml of sample was transferred into the lysing matrix e tube of the fastdna spin kit and centrifugated at 12 000 g for 5 min then the supernatant was removed and the dna extraction of solid particles was strictly conducted according to the instructions in the kit s manual the final extracted dna volume of the 1 ml wastewater sample was 50 μl for the dna extraction of biofilm samples one bio carrier was vortexed and brushed in 5 ml of 4 c phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 for 5 min to detach the biofilm then 1 ml of the liquid was used for the dna extraction by following the same procedure for wastewater samples all the extracted dna was stored at 80 c for further analysis the triplex qpcr assay with further details reported in another study under review was adopted for all quantification tests in this study sequence information of three primer probe sets and the thermal cycle protocol used were listed in table s2 in the supplementary material the final 20 µl qpcr system included 1 μl of c sputorum genomic template 0 2 ng µl as the internal amplification control to exclude the presence of pcr inhibitors only c sputorum assay results with a ct value between 31 and 33 cycles less than two cycle alterations relative to positive control were included to eliminate false negative results negative samples with a ct value of c sputorum assay outside of this range were tested again with a 10 fold dilution of the extracted dna 2 7 data analysis of the c jejuni and c coli reduction the temporal profiles of c jejuni and c coli concentrations in the wastewater of control or sewer reactors were analyzed using the monophasic and biphasic first order decay kinetics because of their broad utility for evaluating microbial decay in wastewater ahmed et al 2020b hokajärvi et al 2021 the variation of c jejuni and c coli concentration was linearized using the natural log ln transformation of the calculated dna concentration of each sampling point as shown in eq 1 monophasic and 2 biphasic where ct and c 0 are the concentrations based on gene copies ml of targeted gene copies at time t and time 0 respectively k h 1 is the decay rate constant of the monophasic first order decay model k 1 h 1 and k 2 h 1 are the decay rate constants of the first and second phases of the biphasic first order decay model respectively t 1 h is the turning time point of the first and second phases the monophasic and biphasic first order decay rates constant with the associated 95 confidence interval ci were estimated using graphpad prism version 9 0 0 graphpad software la jolla ca usa the fitness was assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and the runs test the time required to achieve a 90 t 90 reduction of the targeted dna was calculated by using k values

000 samples from the defined parameters to calculate predictions thereby creating sensitivity maps and frequency distributions petterson et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 campylobacter spp recovery from wastewater the campylobacter spp recovery of the sample processing and dna extraction methods was assessed by using five parallel three bacteria culture spiked wastewater mocks the results are provided in the box plot of fig 1 the recovery was calculated by dividing the gene copies per ml calculated based on the qpcr results with the original seeding concentration cells ml the results showed that c jejuni recovered at concentrations of 106 104 and 102 cells ml with rates of 22 05 9 76 10 65 3 42 and 65 41 48 41 respectively the recovery of c jejuni at 106 cells ml was around 2 1 times that at 104 cells ml the exceptionally high recovery and large variation at the concentration of 102 cells ml were probably due to the low concentration almost below the qpcr assay detection limit which was determined as above 102 cells ml in wastewater the c coli had a recovery of 15 76 6 48 9 74 2 44 and 10 58 3 96 at the concentration of 106 104 and 102 cells ml respectively the recovery of c coli at 104 cells ml was similar to that at 102 cells ml and the recovery at 106 cells ml was around 1 5 timesthat at 104 and 102 cells ml for c sputorum no positive result was acquired at the 102 cells ml seeding level the recovery of c sputorum at 106 and 104 cells ml was 48 92 12 07 and 25 43 18 56 respectively the recovery of c sputorum at 106 cells ml was around 1 9 times that at 104 cells ml the results showed that the recovery varied for different campylobacter species even within the same genus and also varied at different concentrations of the same species fig 1 however at the 104 cells ml seeding level the recovery rate of c jejuni and c coli are very close the results at 104 and 106 cells ml revealed that a 2 log variation of the pathogen concentration could induce a 1 5 2 times variation of the recovery within the same species in addition it seems that when the pathogen concentration in wastewater is close to the loq lod the recovery efficiency becomes unreliable because of the large deviation between replicate extractions therefore the detection limit of the adopted methods is significant for acquiring accurate wastewater recovery for wastewater with low pathogen concentrations 3 2 concentration profiles of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater of sewer reactors the concentration profiles of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater of different sewer reactors both with rm b and gs b and without rm c and gs c biofilms are shown in fig s2 0 h to 24 h before pumping new wastewater and fig s3 24 h to 36 h after new pumping the initial concentration of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater after seeding at the time point of 0 h was around 107 and 108 cells l respectively in rm reactors fig s2 a and c for both c jejuni and c coli the concentration reduction in wastewater in rm c and rm b reactors were similar the c coli concentration in both the rm c and rm b reactors reached a more than 1 log reduction within 7 5 h which is 10 h faster than the 1 log reduction of c jejuni in rm c and rm b reactors in gs reactors fig s2 b and d the reduction of c jejuni and c coli in the gs c reactor was similar to their reductions in the rm c reactor however the concentration of both c jejuni and c coli had a significantly higher reduction in the gs b reactor than that in the gs c reactor these results indicated that the conditions of the gs b reactor enhanced the reduction of c jejuni and c coli concentration in wastewater whereas no obvious effect was observed for the rm b reactor conditions after pumping new wastewater 24 h to 36 h fig s3 the concentration of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater still displayed a declining trend and only a slight reduction of their concentration was observed after 12 h the larger fluctuation of the c jejuni concentration in gs b reactors might be because of the larger variation of recovery at this concentration 102 gc or cells ml 3 3 reduction kinetics of c jejuni and c coli concentration in wastewater of sewer reactors the monophasic first order decay model was adopted to generate the reduction rate constant k and the time required to achieve a 90 t 90 reduction of the targeted dna of c jejuni and c coli the results were shown in table s3 and fig s4 it is worth noticing that although the monophasic first order decay model enabled a reasonable r2 0 69 0 89 for the reduction of c jejuni in rm c gs c and gs b reactors and for the reduction of c coli in rm c and gs c reactors the r2 of c jejuni reduction in rm b and the r2 of c coli reduction in rm b and gs b were unreasonable furthermore the fitted lines in fig s4 showed large deviations from the data which suggested that the monophasic first order decay model is insufficient to describe the reduction of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater of rm b and gs b reactors the biphasic first order kinetic model was fitted to the concentration profiles as shown in fig 2 and the fitted parameters were listed in table 1 all r2 generated were equal to or above 0 96 which indicated its good fitness for representing the reduction kinetics of c jejuni and c coli concentration in wastewater of different sewer reactors the k 1 value of c jejuni in rm b and gs b reactors was around 2 3 and 4 1 times that in rm c and gc c reactors respectively after the turning time point the k 2 value of rm c rm b gs c and gs b reactors was more or less similar 0 05 0 06 h 1 except for a higher level in gs b 0 13 h 1 the t 90 of c jejuni in rm c rm b and gs c reactors were also similar i e around 20 5 22 2 h which were around 2 5 times that in the gs b reactor the results showed that sewer biofilms did not induce an obvious difference in the overall reduction kinetics although the k 1 in the rm b reactor was more than two times of that in the rm c reactor this is due to the much shorter first phase t 1 2 73 h in rm b compared to that of rm c t 1 6 00 h in contrast for gs reactors a four times faster reduction was observed in sewer reactors compared to the control reactor due to higher values of both k 1 and k 2 in the case of c coli the k 1 value of c coli in rm b and gs b reactors was around 1 5 and 3 9 times that in rm c and gc c reactors respectively different from c jejuni the k 2 values of rm c rm b gs c and gs b reactors were all around 0 07 0 09 h 1 although the biofilm reactors had slightly higher values the turning time point t 1 of c coli in rm c rm b gs c and gs b reactors was 6 00 h 3 64 h 8 85 h and 2 72 h respectively with the much shorter first phase in biofilm reactors the faster decay kinetics in the first phase k 1 1 04 h 1 of gs b was mainly responsible for the overall higher reduction the t 90 of c coli in all reactors were 2 6 3 8 times faster than that of c jejuni this indicates the lower stability of c coli than c jejuni in sewers 3 4 the total decay and the partitions of c jejuni and c coli in the wastewater and biofilm phases the total gene number of c jejuni and c coli in the wastewater and biofilms phases of each reactor at the time point of 0 h 12 h and 24 h was calculated by supposing the total volume of wastewater was constantly as 0 75 l and the total area of sewer biofilm was constantly as 0 05m2 fig s5 the results showed that both the total c jejuni and c coli decay in the rm b reactors 0 53 log10 copies and 1 1 log10 copies the total gene number reduction in wastewater plus biofilm were lower than the decay in the rm c reactor 1 08 log10 copies and 1 57 log10 copies and no obvious difference in the total c jejuni and c coli reduction in the wastewater phase was observed between the rm c and rm b reactors fig s5 a and c black and red curves different from the situation in rm reactors the total decay of c jejuni and c coli in the gs b reactor 1 21 log10 copies and 1 63 log10 copies total gene number in wastewater and biofilm phases was faster than in the gs c reactor 1 05 log10 copies and 1 51 log10 copies in 24 h which indicated that the conditions in the gs b reactor enhanced the decay of c jejuni and c coli considering that there is no obvious difference in the total decay of c jejuni and c coli in the rm c and rm b reactors fig s5 a and c it is reasonable to infer that the faster reduction in sewage reactors compared to control reactors during the first reduction phase is mainly caused by the adsorption of sewer biofilms and the decay of adsorbed campylobacter was similar to those in wastewater in addition after the turning time point the decay rate constant of the second phase k 2 in both the rm c and rm b reactors is between 0 05 h 1 and 0 08 h 1 based on the above observations the c jejuni and c coli concentration reduction in the wastewater phase of the sewer reactors could be divided into two steps i the biofilm adsorption dominated fast concentration reduction ii the decay in the wastewater phase after achieving an adsorption equilibrium in gs reactors a higher total decay of c jejuni and c coli was observed in sewer reactors compared to the control reactors fig s5 b and d however in rm reactors the total decay of c jejuni and c coli in sewer biofilm reactors was similar to or even slightly lower than that in control reactors fig s5 a and c these results revealed that the rm and gs sewer environment may have aggravating and alleviating effects respectively on the decay of c jejuni and c coli environmental factors including temperature sunlight dissolved oxygen do soluble chemical oxygen demand scod nutrient availability and salinity have also been reported to be significant to the campylobacter spp persistence in environmental water orner et al 2018 this study used the same raw wastewater in reactors wrapped with foil at the same room temperature for all batch tests the most significant difference between the control and the sewer reactors is the absence or presence of different sewer biofilms i e anaerobic biofilms in rm and both aerobic and anaerobic biofilms in gs reactors jin et al 2018 li et al 2019b o brien et al 2019 shi et al 2022 the effects of temperature sunlight and wastewater characteristics were not considered in addition studies have reported the survival of campylobacter jejuni is directly affected by the oxygen concentrations of its surrounding environments kim et al 2015 therefore the difference in the ambient oxygen concentrations in rm b and gs b reactors might be the most possible reason for the different decay kinetics of c jejuni and c coil furthermore the components of sewer biofilms such as the extracellular polymeric substances eps and the dna enzymes are also potential factors in the adsorption and decay of c jejuni and c coli li et al 2019b it is worth noticing that during the real in sewer transport of these pathogens the wastewater cannot stay at the same pipe location for such a long time 24 h therefore the concentration reduction of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater caused by the adsorption into sewer biofilms might be even higher in real sewers than under the experimental conditions of this study 3 5 the adsorption desorption of c jejuni and c coli into sewer biofilms according to the author s assumption an adsorption equilibrium could be achieved after the turning time point thus it is reasonable to consider that at the time point of 12 h 24 h and 36 h of one batch test the rm b and gs b reactor were in adsorption equilibrium status therefore the adsorption isotherms of c jejuni and c coli on the biofilm of different sewer reactors were generated based on the c jejuni and c coli concentration in wastewater and in biofilm phases at the time of 12 h 24 h and 36 h to provide an insight into the adsorption capacity of different biofilms for c jejuni and c coli fig 3 borkowski et al 2015 lupascu et al 2022 based on the slope of the fitted lines it seems that the biofilm in the rm b reactor slope 1 2 has a slightly higher adsorption capacity for c jejuni than the biofilm of the gs b reactor slope 1 in contrast the biofilm in the gs b reactor slope 0 67 has a slightly higher adsorption capacity for c coli than the biofilm of the rm b reactor slope 0 41 in addition both the biofilm of rm b and gs b reactors showed an obviously higher adsorption capacity of c jejuni than of c coli exclude the constant condition of ph and the temperature of the wastewater used in this study the reasons for causing these differences might include the structure and components of the biofilms and the different bacteria sizes and surface characters borkowski et al 2015 li et al 2019b however this conclusion was only based on three data points to obtain a clear view of the adsorption capacity of different sewer biofilms for c jejuni and c coli further detailed studies should be conducted 3 6 sensitivity analysis for wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli to evaluate the application of the parameters acquired in this study in the wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli prevalence their sensitivity for inducing the variance of wbe back estimation was investigated based on the wbe back estimation equation the shedding concentration of campylobacter spp in human stool specimens has been estimated to be 106 109 cfu ml buss et al 2019 therefore the shedding concentration rs used in the sensitivity analysis of this study was defined and fixed as 7 5 log10 gene copies g according to the meta analysis of the campylobacter spp prevalence in wastewater investigated by another study under review the campylobacter concentration in wastewater r c used for sensitivity analysis was defined as 4 31 0 39 95 confidence interval log10 gene copies l with normal distribution the shedding probability in stool from an infected person p s was assumed as 100 with no prior information reported for campylobacter spp the daily wastewater generated by each person q was assumed to be 250l d person the daily stool shedding amount of each person q s was assumed as 250 g d person ahmed et al 2020a guo et al 2022 li et al 2022 2021b miura et al 2021 other parameters including the k1 k2 and t1 with the 95 ci acquired in section 3 3 were also defined with normal distribution in this sensitivity analysis the results showed that fig 4 under the analysis conditions defined in this study when hydraulic retention time t 1 h was lower than the turning time point t 1 the campylobacter concentration in wastewater r c was the dominating parameter that contributed 80 99 variance to the wbe back estimation of both c jejuni and c coli in all types of reactors the k1 was the second parameter that contributed 4 19 7 variance in the biofilm reactors when the hydraulic retention time equalled the turning time point t t 1 the sensitivity of k1 increased especially for the rm b and gs b reactors which became the dominating parameter that contributed more than 50 variance of the wbe back estimation of c jejuni when the hydraulic retention time was higher than t 1 t 12 h the sensitivity of t 1 had an obvious increase for both c jejuni and c coli in all reactors except for the rm c for c coli in rm b and gs b t 1 became the dominating parameter that contributed 40 9 and 56 1 variance respectively when the hydraulic retention time was up to 24 h the sensitivity of r c decreased to below 50 in all types of reactors except for the rm c in total with the increase of the hydraulic retention time the sensitivity of r c kept decreasing in contrast the sensitivity of decay related parameters k1 t 1 and k2 increased and contributed the most variance to the wbe back estimation of both c jejuni and c coli especially in biofilm reactors previous studies have reported that the human stool shedding concentration and the concentration in wastewater of the target human pathogens are the top two sensitive parameters for inducing the variance of wbe back estimation guo et al 2022 li et al 2021b 2021c this observation is based on very limited data on pathogen shedding and low accuracy in analysing pathogen concentrations in wastewater the sensitivity of the decay rate constant is usually reported as nil because of the lack of information on their in sewer decay guo et al 2022 however our study revealed that the sensitivity of decay related parameters can induce significant variance to the wbe back estimation of both c jejuni and c coli thus should be further studied to improve the accuracy 4 conclusions this study conducted a series of experiments to comprehensively investigate i the recovery efficiency of campylobacter species from wastewater at different concentrations ii the decay of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater of laboratory scale sewer biofilm reactors iii the adsorption and desorption of c jejuni and c coli in sewer biofilm reactors iv the parameter sensitivity of the wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli the key conclusions are the recovery efficiency of campylobacter spp increased with their concentrations in wastewater while the c jejuni and c coli have a very similar recovery of around 10 at 104 cells ml the decay of c jejuni and c coli in the gravity sewer reactor is faster than that in the rising main sewer reactor and the presence of dissolved oxygen might play an important role in aggravating the decay of c jejuni and c coli c coli generally decayed faster than c jejuni in wastewater under all conditions the adsorption of c jejuni and c coli onto sewer biofilms is a significant factor that can enhance their concentration reduction in the wastewater phase this overall reduction can be described by biphasic first order kinetics the decay parameters induce significant variance to the wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli prevalence especially for sewer catchments with long hydraulic retention time the recovery and decay parameters obtained in this study can significantly improve the precision of wbe back estimation of campylobacter prevalence in communities the further development of wastewater surveillance as a supplement to the clinical surveillance could achieve early warning of outbreaks particularly in low and middle income countries in future studies considering the environmental temperature could have a certain effect on the multiplication of target pathogens and the biological activities of biofilm communities more experiments should be carried out to evaluate the in sewer decay and partition of campylobacter spp under different environment temperatures to map the seasonal variation of its decay and partition

of civil mining and environmental engineering university of wollongong australia campylobacter jejuni and coli are two main pathogenic species inducing diarrhoeal diseases in humans which are responsible for the loss of 33 million lives each year current campylobacter infections are mainly monitored by clinical surveillance which is often limited to individuals seeking treatment resulting in under reporting of disease prevalence and untimely indicators of community outbreaks wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been developed and employed for the wastewater surveillance of pathogenic viruses and bacteria monitoring the temporal changes of pathogen concentration in wastewater allows the early detection of disease outbreaks in a community however studies investigating the wbe back estimation of campylobacter spp are rare essential factors including the analytical recovery efficiency the decay rate the effect of in sewer transport and the correlation between the wastewater concentration and the infections in communities are lacking to support wastewater surveillance this study carried out experiments to investigate the recovery of campylobacter jejuni and coli from wastewater and the decay under different simulated sewer reactor conditions it was found that the recovery of campylobacter spp from wastewater varied with their concentrations in wastewater and depended on the detection limit of quantification methods the concentration reduction of campylobacter jejuni and coli in sewers followed a two phase reduction model and the faster concentration reduction during the first phase is mainly due to their partitioning onto sewer biofilms the total decay of campylobacter jejuni and coli varied in different types of sewer reactors i e rising main vs gravity sewer in addition the sensitivity analysis for wbe back estimation of campylobacter suggested that the first phase decay rate constant k 1 and the turning time point t 1 are determining factors and their impacts increased with the hydraulic retention time of wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords campylobacter coli campylobacter jejuni wastewater decay sewer biofilm wastewater based epidemiology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction outbreaks of infectious diseases cause losses in both human and animal lives and serious economic damage to societies especially in urban areas with high population density campylobacter is one of the main pathogens causing bacterial gastroenteritis campylobacter jejuni c jejuni and campylobacter coli c coli are the top two thermophilic campylobacter species that are responsible for more than 95 of campylobacter induced illness worldwide dai et al 2020 c jejuni and c coli widely exist in animal food products with a mean prevalence of 19 3 and 9 7 respectively while eggs sausages milk and dairy products were found to have the lowest prevalence zbrun et al 2020 the infection dose of campylobacter spp is as low as 500 cells epps et al 2013 the high prevalence in the food and the low infectious dose makes campylobacter spp the most common cause of human gastroenteritis in the world kaakoush et al 2015 the disease surveillance for campylobacter spp has been reported by using food products and clinical samples joensen et al 2021 tong et al 2021 however the true incidence of gastroenteritis caused by campylobacter is poorly understood particularly in low and middle income countries studies in high income countries estimate the annual incidence to be 4 4 9 3 per 1000 population world health organization et al 2013 guillain barre syndrome gbs is one of the main sequelae of campylobacteriosis which is a serious illness with about 20 requiring intensive care the fatality rate in high income countries is 3 10 globally about one third of gbs cases have been attributed to campylobacter infection world health organization et al 2013 traditional disease detection of campylobacter infections relies on clinical diagnosis which is untimely and only based on people who attend healthcare facilities for treatment thus the clinical report usually leads to an underestimation of disease prevalence and it is hard to achieve early warnings of public health threats seventer and hochberg 2017 wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a relatively new method based on the analysis of chemicals and biomarkers in raw wastewater to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on the activities of residents in the sewer catchment area choi et al 2018 rousis et al 2017 sims and kasprzyk 2020 wbe based disease surveillance can provide near real time evidence to reveal that the infectious agent or its genetic component has entered the sewage system sometimes even days before symptoms appear and often before an infected person comes into contact with a healthcare facility tiwari et al 2023 therefore wbe is suggested as a promising pathway to provide early warning of disease outbreaks in addition in countries with limited resources wbe is regarded as an attractive complementary approach since it is an inexpensive and non invasive method of population surveillance compared to individual tests shrestha et al 2021 with the ever increasing public concerns about infectious diseases aroused by the covid 19 pandemic wbe based disease surveillance was reported can achieve early warning of different human pathogens induced outbreaks including both pathogenic viruses and bacteria abdeldayem et al 2022 anand et al 2022 riquelme et al 2021 zahedi et al 2021 wbe back estimation of sars cov 2 prevalence in communities has been established and evaluated for the application of other pathogenic viruses guo et al 2022 li et al 2022 2021b however only a few studies were reported for the surveillance of campylobacter prevalence based on wastewater bonetta et al 2016 hellein et al 2011 there is a lack of systematic studies about the key wbe steps including the recovery rate during detection the decay rate in wastewater the impact of sewer conditions and the back calculation of infections in communities according to the report of the global water pathogen project in 2017 significant data gaps exist in terms of the persistence of campylobacter in wastewater and the environmental conditions that can affect the persistence orner et al 2018 when evaluating microbial persistence in water bodies the temperature sunlight dissolved oxygen do soluble chemical oxygen demand scod nutrient availability and salinity were found to be important environmental conditions orner et al 2018 for wastewater based epidemiology the decay reduction of the biomarker concentration during the in sewer transport is also essential for the wbe back estimation li et al 2021c sewer systems could be divided into two main types by the flow regimes including rising mains rm and gravity sewers gs rising main pipelines are used to transport wastewater to higher elevations and operate under anaerobic conditions due to the fully filled wastewater in pipelines in contrast gravity pipelines deliver wastewater to lower elevations by gravity and are usually partially filled with wastewater thus containing both aerobic and anaerobic conditions hvitved et al 2013 previous studies have compared and reported the stability of biomarkers e g licit drug and pharmaceutical biomarkers in wastewater only and in laboratory scale sewer biofilm reactors and demonstrated that the biomarkers stability evaluated with the biofilm free conditions cannot reflect sewer conditions choi et al 2020 li et al 2018 2021a however no such studies have been carried out for campylobacter spp to address the research gaps for the wastewater based epidemiology of campylobacter a battery of experiments was carried out including the assessment of the recovery rate of c jejuni c coli and c sputorum from wastewater at three different seeding levels the concentration reduction of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater phase in different types of laboratory scale sewer reactors the adsorption and desorption of c jejuni and c coli in sewer biofilms and their decay in the phases of wastewater and biofilms at room temperature our previously developed triplex qpcr assay for c jejuni and c coli quantification in wastewater with c sputorum as the inhibition control reported was adopted to delineate the recovery decay and adsorption desorption behaviours of c jejuni and c coli in sewers furthermore a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the decay parameters acquired in this study for the wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli the results of this study paved the road for wastewater surveillance of campylobacter induced illness and would help improve the accuracy of wbe back estimation of campylobacter spp prevalence in communities in addition the wastewater monitoring of campylobacter concentration changes could also provide a cost effective methodology for its surveillance in low and middle income countries to achieve early warning and timely intervention of disease outbreaks 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial cultures three campylobacter species including campylobacter jejuni subsp jejuni atcc 700 819 the campylobacter coli atcc 33 559 and the campylobacter sputorum biovar sputorum atcc 33 562 were purchased from the american type culture collection atcc all three strains were incubated on trypticase soy agar tsa with 5 sheep blood agar plates thermo fisher scientific australia for 2 5 days at 42 c under microaerophilic conditions anaerocult c for microbiology for the generation of an oxygen depleted and co2 enriched atmosphere in an anaerobic jar merck australia 2 2 wastewater samples wastewater samples collected from a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp in wollongong australia were used for the wastewater seeding experiments and in sewer decay batch tests these wastewater samples were tested as negative or having a ct value of more than 40 by pcr detection for all three campylobacter species of this study these samples were sent to the laboratory within 30 min and kept in the refrigerator at 4 c until further tests within one week all of these wastewater samples have typical ph values of 6 8 7 1 sulfate levels of 10 45 mg s l dissolved oxygen do levels of around 0 7 mg l total suspended solids tss levels of 200 600 mg l total chemical oxygen demand tcod levels of 150 500 mg l and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod levels of 50 130 mg l shi et al 2022 2 3 evaluation of campylobacter species recovery of wastewater the c jejuni c coli and c sputorum cultures were spiked into 1 ml of wastewater to get a series of positive wastewater mocks with gradient concentrations around 102 104 and 106 cells ml respectively c sputorum primarily as an animal pathogen is mainly used as an analytical control while c jejuni and c coli were evaluated as human pathogens for their fate in sewers since only rough concentrations are required log level and the recovery was calculated based on qpcr results the initial bacteria concentrations were determined with a cell density meter biochrom c08000 and converted automatically in the cell density calculator https www agilent com store biocalculators calcodbacterial jsp five parallel mocks were extracted at each concentration level then the spiked wastewater mocks were centrifugated at 12 000 g for 5 min in the lysing matrix e tube of the fastdna spin kit for soil mp bio australia then the supernatant was removed and the solid particle was used for further dna extraction the dna extraction was strictly conducted according to the instruction in the kit s manual the final extracted dna volume of the 1 ml wastewater sample was 50 μl all the extracted dna was stored at 80 c for further analysis 2 4 laboratory scale sewer system to simulate real sewers a laboratory scale sewer reactor system fig s1 was used in this study the sewer reactor system has been supplied with domestic wastewater collected from a wwtp in wollongong australia for biofilm cultivation since 2020 90 l of residential wastewater was collected every two weeks and kept at 4 c this system was made up of two types of reactors rising main rm reactors and gravity sewer gs reactors each with an 80 mm diameter and a water height of 150 mm our previous studies demonstrated that the laboratory scale sewer reactors can reflect real sewer conditions in terms of biofilms and their biological activities jiang et al 2009 thai et al 2014 the sewer reactors were used extensively in evaluating the stability of various biomarker compounds like illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals choi et al 2020 li et al 2019a 2018 the working volume of wastewater in each reactor was around 0 75 l each reactor has a total biofilm area of around 0 05 m2 including the reactor wall and carrier surface as a result the biofilm area to wastewater volume ratio a v was approximately 70 9 m2 m3 a magnetic stirrer mls8 velp scientific italy was employed to provide continuous mixing 250 rpm to create a modest shear force 1 7 pa on the inner surface of the reactor wall and to prevent solids from sinking at the bottom batch tests were conducted in the rm b and gs b reactors to measure biofilm activity table s1 including the sulfate reduction rate and cod reduction rate to ensure that the reactors had attained a steady state before the tests with campylobacter jiang et al 2009 li et al 2019a 2018 2 5 sewer reactor experiments and sampling schemes four reactors including the rm and gs sewage reactors rm b and gs b and two control reactors rm c and gs c were used for the in sewer decay batch tests the control reactors are empty reactors with the same construction as the biofilm reactors but without biofilms before each batch test wastewater was continuously pumped into the sewer system for 5 min to refresh all the working wastewater in rm and gs sewer reactors simultaneously 0 75 l of wastewater was added to the rm c and gs c control reactors for parallel testing the temperature of the wastewater was around room temperature around 15 c since the sewer system was located in a lab without an air conditioner and the experiments were carried out during july 2022 this temperature is much lower than the optimal growth temperature of campylobacter at 37 42 c davis and dirita 2008 there is negligible multiplication of campylobacter during the test considering its doubling time around 2 7 h battersby et al 2016 then a volume of 5 ml c jejuni and c coli mix bacteria culture was spiked into both control rm c and gs c and sewer reactors rm b and gs b and waited for 2 min to allow a thorough mixing in reactors the concentration of c jejuni and c coli was around 107 108 cells l at the beginning of batch tests the duration of one complete batch test was 36 h including one 24 h decay adsorption test followed by another 12 h desorption test first 1 ml wastewater was sampled from rm b gs b rm c and gs c reactors at the time points of 0 h 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 12 h and 24 h one bio carrier biofilm sample was also collected at the time points of 0 h 12 h and 24 h for adsorption evaluation then after the wastewater and biofilm samples of 24 h were collected new wastewater without seeding was pumped into the sewer system for 5 min to refresh the seeding wastewater in sewer reactors rm b and gs b after that 1 ml wastewater was sampled from rm b and gs b reactors at the time points of 0 h 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 12 h after the pumping event to evaluate the desorption of c jejuni and c coli from sewer biofilms meanwhile one bio carrier biofilm sample was also collected at the time points of 12 h for the final desorption evaluation in conclusion a total number of 17 wastewater samples and four biofilm samples four bio carriers were collected for each sewage reactor rm b and gs b during one complete batch test within 36 h for control reactors nine wastewater samples were collected for each sewer reactor during one complete batch test to evaluate the decay of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater under biofilm free conditions within 24 h 2 6 sample processing dna extraction and the triplex qpcr assay for campylobacter the genomic template dna of three campylobacter species used for the positive control of the triplex qpcr test were extracted from each bacteria culture by using the genelute bacterial genomic dna kits sigma aldrich australia the dna quality was assessed using the nanodrop 2000c thermo fisher scientific australia and the dna concentration was determined using the qubit 4 0 fluorometer and the qubit 1 dsdna high sensitivity hs and broad range br assay kits 0 1 120 ng thermo fisher scientific australia the final concentration of each template dna used in the qpcr assay was adjusted to 0 2 ng µl and stored at 80 c for the dna extraction of wastewater samples 1 ml of sample was transferred into the lysing matrix e tube of the fastdna spin kit and centrifugated at 12 000 g for 5 min then the supernatant was removed and the dna extraction of solid particles was strictly conducted according to the instructions in the kit s manual the final extracted dna volume of the 1 ml wastewater sample was 50 μl for the dna extraction of biofilm samples one bio carrier was vortexed and brushed in 5 ml of 4 c phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 for 5 min to detach the biofilm then 1 ml of the liquid was used for the dna extraction by following the same procedure for wastewater samples all the extracted dna was stored at 80 c for further analysis the triplex qpcr assay with further details reported in another study under review was adopted for all quantification tests in this study sequence information of three primer probe sets and the thermal cycle protocol used were listed in table s2 in the supplementary material the final 20 µl qpcr system included 1 μl of c sputorum genomic template 0 2 ng µl as the internal amplification control to exclude the presence of pcr inhibitors only c sputorum assay results with a ct value between 31 and 33 cycles less than two cycle alterations relative to positive control were included to eliminate false negative results negative samples with a ct value of c sputorum assay outside of this range were tested again with a 10 fold dilution of the extracted dna 2 7 data analysis of the c jejuni and c coli reduction the temporal profiles of c jejuni and c coli concentrations in the wastewater of control or sewer reactors were analyzed using the monophasic and biphasic first order decay kinetics because of their broad utility for evaluating microbial decay in wastewater ahmed et al 2020b hokajärvi et al 2021 the variation of c jejuni and c coli concentration was linearized using the natural log ln transformation of the calculated dna concentration of each sampling point as shown in eq 1 monophasic and 2 biphasic where ct and c 0 are the concentrations based on gene copies ml of targeted gene copies at time t and time 0 respectively k h 1 is the decay rate constant of the monophasic first order decay model k 1 h 1 and k 2 h 1 are the decay rate constants of the first and second phases of the biphasic first order decay model respectively t 1 h is the turning time point of the first and second phases the monophasic and biphasic first order decay rates constant with the associated 95 confidence interval ci were estimated using graphpad prism version 9 0 0 graphpad software la jolla ca usa the fitness was assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and the runs test the time required to achieve a 90 t 90 reduction of the targeted dna was calculated by using k values

catchment to the decay rate constants the monte carlo method was adopted to sample data from the defined distributions of the parameters including k and hydraulic retention time the program took 10 000 samples from the defined parameters to calculate predictions thereby creating sensitivity maps and frequency distributions petterson et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 campylobacter spp recovery from wastewater the campylobacter spp recovery of the sample processing and dna extraction methods was assessed by using five parallel three bacteria culture spiked wastewater mocks the results are provided in the box plot of fig 1 the recovery was calculated by dividing the gene copies per ml calculated based on the qpcr results with the original seeding concentration cells ml the results showed that c jejuni recovered at concentrations of 106 104 and 102 cells ml with rates of 22 05 9 76 10 65 3 42 and 65 41 48 41 respectively the recovery of c jejuni at 106 cells ml was around 2 1 times that at 104 cells ml the exceptionally high recovery and large variation at the concentration of 102 cells ml were probably due to the low concentration almost below the qpcr assay detection limit which was determined as above 102 cells ml in wastewater the c coli had a recovery of 15 76 6 48 9 74 2 44 and 10 58 3 96 at the concentration of 106 104 and 102 cells ml respectively the recovery of c coli at 104 cells ml was similar to that at 102 cells ml and the recovery at 106 cells ml was around 1 5 timesthat at 104 and 102 cells ml for c sputorum no positive result was acquired at the 102 cells ml seeding level the recovery of c sputorum at 106 and 104 cells ml was 48 92 12 07 and 25 43 18 56 respectively the recovery of c sputorum at 106 cells ml was around 1 9 times that at 104 cells ml the results showed that the recovery varied for different campylobacter species even within the same genus and also varied at different concentrations of the same species fig 1 however at the 104 cells ml seeding level the recovery rate of c jejuni and c coli are very close the results at 104 and 106 cells ml revealed that a 2 log variation of the pathogen concentration could induce a 1 5 2 times variation of the recovery within the same species in addition it seems that when the pathogen concentration in wastewater is close to the loq lod the recovery efficiency becomes unreliable because of the large deviation between replicate extractions therefore the detection limit of the adopted methods is significant for acquiring accurate wastewater recovery for wastewater with low pathogen concentrations 3 2 concentration profiles of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater of sewer reactors the concentration profiles of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater of different sewer reactors both with rm b and gs b and without rm c and gs c biofilms are shown in fig s2 0 h to 24 h before pumping new wastewater and fig s3 24 h to 36 h after new pumping the initial concentration of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater after seeding at the time point of 0 h was around 107 and 108 cells l respectively in rm reactors fig s2 a and c for both c jejuni and c coli the concentration reduction in wastewater in rm c and rm b reactors were similar the c coli concentration in both the rm c and rm b reactors reached a more than 1 log reduction within 7 5 h which is 10 h faster than the 1 log reduction of c jejuni in rm c and rm b reactors in gs reactors fig s2 b and d the reduction of c jejuni and c coli in the gs c reactor was similar to their reductions in the rm c reactor however the concentration of both c jejuni and c coli had a significantly higher reduction in the gs b reactor than that in the gs c reactor these results indicated that the conditions of the gs b reactor enhanced the reduction of c jejuni and c coli concentration in wastewater whereas no obvious effect was observed for the rm b reactor conditions after pumping new wastewater 24 h to 36 h fig s3 the concentration of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater still displayed a declining trend and only a slight reduction of their concentration was observed after 12 h the larger fluctuation of the c jejuni concentration in gs b reactors might be because of the larger variation of recovery at this concentration 102 gc or cells ml 3 3 reduction kinetics of c jejuni and c coli concentration in wastewater of sewer reactors the monophasic first order decay model was adopted to generate the reduction rate constant k and the time required to achieve a 90 t 90 reduction of the targeted dna of c jejuni and c coli the results were shown in table s3 and fig s4 it is worth noticing that although the monophasic first order decay model enabled a reasonable r2 0 69 0 89 for the reduction of c jejuni in rm c gs c and gs b reactors and for the reduction of c coli in rm c and gs c reactors the r2 of c jejuni reduction in rm b and the r2 of c coli reduction in rm b and gs b were unreasonable furthermore the fitted lines in fig s4 showed large deviations from the data which suggested that the monophasic first order decay model is insufficient to describe the reduction of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater of rm b and gs b reactors the biphasic first order kinetic model was fitted to the concentration profiles as shown in fig 2 and the fitted parameters were listed in table 1 all r2 generated were equal to or above 0 96 which indicated its good fitness for representing the reduction kinetics of c jejuni and c coli concentration in wastewater of different sewer reactors the k 1 value of c jejuni in rm b and gs b reactors was around 2 3 and 4 1 times that in rm c and gc c reactors respectively after the turning time point the k 2 value of rm c rm b gs c and gs b reactors was more or less similar 0 05 0 06 h 1 except for a higher level in gs b 0 13 h 1 the t 90 of c jejuni in rm c rm b and gs c reactors were also similar i e around 20 5 22 2 h which were around 2 5 times that in the gs b reactor the results showed that sewer biofilms did not induce an obvious difference in the overall reduction kinetics although the k 1 in the rm b reactor was more than two times of that in the rm c reactor this is due to the much shorter first phase t 1 2 73 h in rm b compared to that of rm c t 1 6 00 h in contrast for gs reactors a four times faster reduction was observed in sewer reactors compared to the control reactor due to higher values of both k 1 and k 2 in the case of c coli the k 1 value of c coli in rm b and gs b reactors was around 1 5 and 3 9 times that in rm c and gc c reactors respectively different from c jejuni the k 2 values of rm c rm b gs c and gs b reactors were all around 0 07 0 09 h 1 although the biofilm reactors had slightly higher values the turning time point t 1 of c coli in rm c rm b gs c and gs b reactors was 6 00 h 3 64 h 8 85 h and 2 72 h respectively with the much shorter first phase in biofilm reactors the faster decay kinetics in the first phase k 1 1 04 h 1 of gs b was mainly responsible for the overall higher reduction the t 90 of c coli in all reactors were 2 6 3 8 times faster than that of c jejuni this indicates the lower stability of c coli than c jejuni in sewers 3 4 the total decay and the partitions of c jejuni and c coli in the wastewater and biofilm phases the total gene number of c jejuni and c coli in the wastewater and biofilms phases of each reactor at the time point of 0 h 12 h and 24 h was calculated by supposing the total volume of wastewater was constantly as 0 75 l and the total area of sewer biofilm was constantly as 0 05m2 fig s5 the results showed that both the total c jejuni and c coli decay in the rm b reactors 0 53 log10 copies and 1 1 log10 copies the total gene number reduction in wastewater plus biofilm were lower than the decay in the rm c reactor 1 08 log10 copies and 1 57 log10 copies and no obvious difference in the total c jejuni and c coli reduction in the wastewater phase was observed between the rm c and rm b reactors fig s5 a and c black and red curves different from the situation in rm reactors the total decay of c jejuni and c coli in the gs b reactor 1 21 log10 copies and 1 63 log10 copies total gene number in wastewater and biofilm phases was faster than in the gs c reactor 1 05 log10 copies and 1 51 log10 copies in 24 h which indicated that the conditions in the gs b reactor enhanced the decay of c jejuni and c coli considering that there is no obvious difference in the total decay of c jejuni and c coli in the rm c and rm b reactors fig s5 a and c it is reasonable to infer that the faster reduction in sewage reactors compared to control reactors during the first reduction phase is mainly caused by the adsorption of sewer biofilms and the decay of adsorbed campylobacter was similar to those in wastewater in addition after the turning time point the decay rate constant of the second phase k 2 in both the rm c and rm b reactors is between 0 05 h 1 and 0 08 h 1 based on the above observations the c jejuni and c coli concentration reduction in the wastewater phase of the sewer reactors could be divided into two steps i the biofilm adsorption dominated fast concentration reduction ii the decay in the wastewater phase after achieving an adsorption equilibrium in gs reactors a higher total decay of c jejuni and c coli was observed in sewer reactors compared to the control reactors fig s5 b and d however in rm reactors the total decay of c jejuni and c coli in sewer biofilm reactors was similar to or even slightly lower than that in control reactors fig s5 a and c these results revealed that the rm and gs sewer environment may have aggravating and alleviating effects respectively on the decay of c jejuni and c coli environmental factors including temperature sunlight dissolved oxygen do soluble chemical oxygen demand scod nutrient availability and salinity have also been reported to be significant to the campylobacter spp persistence in environmental water orner et al 2018 this study used the same raw wastewater in reactors wrapped with foil at the same room temperature for all batch tests the most significant difference between the control and the sewer reactors is the absence or presence of different sewer biofilms i e anaerobic biofilms in rm and both aerobic and anaerobic biofilms in gs reactors jin et al 2018 li et al 2019b o brien et al 2019 shi et al 2022 the effects of temperature sunlight and wastewater characteristics were not considered in addition studies have reported the survival of campylobacter jejuni is directly affected by the oxygen concentrations of its surrounding environments kim et al 2015 therefore the difference in the ambient oxygen concentrations in rm b and gs b reactors might be the most possible reason for the different decay kinetics of c jejuni and c coil furthermore the components of sewer biofilms such as the extracellular polymeric substances eps and the dna enzymes are also potential factors in the adsorption and decay of c jejuni and c coli li et al 2019b it is worth noticing that during the real in sewer transport of these pathogens the wastewater cannot stay at the same pipe location for such a long time 24 h therefore the concentration reduction of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater caused by the adsorption into sewer biofilms might be even higher in real sewers than under the experimental conditions of this study 3 5 the adsorption desorption of c jejuni and c coli into sewer biofilms according to the author s assumption an adsorption equilibrium could be achieved after the turning time point thus it is reasonable to consider that at the time point of 12 h 24 h and 36 h of one batch test the rm b and gs b reactor were in adsorption equilibrium status therefore the adsorption isotherms of c jejuni and c coli on the biofilm of different sewer reactors were generated based on the c jejuni and c coli concentration in wastewater and in biofilm phases at the time of 12 h 24 h and 36 h to provide an insight into the adsorption capacity of different biofilms for c jejuni and c coli fig 3 borkowski et al 2015 lupascu et al 2022 based on the slope of the fitted lines it seems that the biofilm in the rm b reactor slope 1 2 has a slightly higher adsorption capacity for c jejuni than the biofilm of the gs b reactor slope 1 in contrast the biofilm in the gs b reactor slope 0 67 has a slightly higher adsorption capacity for c coli than the biofilm of the rm b reactor slope 0 41 in addition both the biofilm of rm b and gs b reactors showed an obviously higher adsorption capacity of c jejuni than of c coli exclude the constant condition of ph and the temperature of the wastewater used in this study the reasons for causing these differences might include the structure and components of the biofilms and the different bacteria sizes and surface characters borkowski et al 2015 li et al 2019b however this conclusion was only based on three data points to obtain a clear view of the adsorption capacity of different sewer biofilms for c jejuni and c coli further detailed studies should be conducted 3 6 sensitivity analysis for wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli to evaluate the application of the parameters acquired in this study in the wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli prevalence their sensitivity for inducing the variance of wbe back estimation was investigated based on the wbe back estimation equation the shedding concentration of campylobacter spp in human stool specimens has been estimated to be 106 109 cfu ml buss et al 2019 therefore the shedding concentration rs used in the sensitivity analysis of this study was defined and fixed as 7 5 log10 gene copies g according to the meta analysis of the campylobacter spp prevalence in wastewater investigated by another study under review the campylobacter concentration in wastewater r c used for sensitivity analysis was defined as 4 31 0 39 95 confidence interval log10 gene copies l with normal distribution the shedding probability in stool from an infected person p s was assumed as 100 with no prior information reported for campylobacter spp the daily wastewater generated by each person q was assumed to be 250l d person the daily stool shedding amount of each person q s was assumed as 250 g d person ahmed et al 2020a guo et al 2022 li et al 2022 2021b miura et al 2021 other parameters including the k1 k2 and t1 with the 95 ci acquired in section 3 3 were also defined with normal distribution in this sensitivity analysis the results showed that fig 4 under the analysis conditions defined in this study when hydraulic retention time t 1 h was lower than the turning time point t 1 the campylobacter concentration in wastewater r c was the dominating parameter that contributed 80 99 variance to the wbe back estimation of both c jejuni and c coli in all types of reactors the k1 was the second parameter that contributed 4 19 7 variance in the biofilm reactors when the hydraulic retention time equalled the turning time point t t 1 the sensitivity of k1 increased especially for the rm b and gs b reactors which became the dominating parameter that contributed more than 50 variance of the wbe back estimation of c jejuni when the hydraulic retention time was higher than t 1 t 12 h the sensitivity of t 1 had an obvious increase for both c jejuni and c coli in all reactors except for the rm c for c coli in rm b and gs b t 1 became the dominating parameter that contributed 40 9 and 56 1 variance respectively when the hydraulic retention time was up to 24 h the sensitivity of r c decreased to below 50 in all types of reactors except for the rm c in total with the increase of the hydraulic retention time the sensitivity of r c kept decreasing in contrast the sensitivity of decay related parameters k1 t 1 and k2 increased and contributed the most variance to the wbe back estimation of both c jejuni and c coli especially in biofilm reactors previous studies have reported that the human stool shedding concentration and the concentration in wastewater of the target human pathogens are the top two sensitive parameters for inducing the variance of wbe back estimation guo et al 2022 li et al 2021b 2021c this observation is based on very limited data on pathogen shedding and low accuracy in analysing pathogen concentrations in wastewater the sensitivity of the decay rate constant is usually reported as nil because of the lack of information on their in sewer decay guo et al 2022 however our study revealed that the sensitivity of decay related parameters can induce significant variance to the wbe back estimation of both c jejuni and c coli thus should be further studied to improve the accuracy 4 conclusions this study conducted a series of experiments to comprehensively investigate i the recovery efficiency of campylobacter species from wastewater at different concentrations ii the decay of c jejuni and c coli in wastewater of laboratory scale sewer biofilm reactors iii the adsorption and desorption of c jejuni and c coli in sewer biofilm reactors iv the parameter sensitivity of the wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli the key conclusions are the recovery efficiency of campylobacter spp increased with their concentrations in wastewater while the c jejuni and c coli have a very similar recovery of around 10 at 104 cells ml the decay of c jejuni and c coli in the gravity sewer reactor is faster than that in the rising main sewer reactor and the presence of dissolved oxygen might play an important role in aggravating the decay of c jejuni and c coli c coli generally decayed faster than c jejuni in wastewater under all conditions the adsorption of c jejuni and c coli onto sewer biofilms is a significant factor that can enhance their concentration reduction in the wastewater phase this overall reduction can be described by biphasic first order kinetics the decay parameters induce significant variance to the wbe back estimation of c jejuni and c coli prevalence especially for sewer catchments with long hydraulic retention time the recovery and decay parameters obtained in this study can significantly improve the precision of wbe back estimation of campylobacter prevalence in communities the further development of wastewater surveillance as a supplement to the clinical surveillance could achieve early warning of outbreaks particularly in low and middle income countries in future studies considering the environmental temperature could have a certain effect on the multiplication of target pathogens and the biological activities of biofilm communities more experiments should be carried out to evaluate the in sewer decay and partition of campylobacter spp under different environment temperatures to map the seasonal variation of its decay and partition and further improve the wbe based back estimation of campylobacter spp prevalence in communities and relevant environments credit authorship contribution statement shuxin zhang methodology
