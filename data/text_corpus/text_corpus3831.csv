19155,chemical dosing is a commonly used strategy for mitigating sewer corrosion and odour problems caused by sulfide production prediction of sewage flow variation in real time is critical for the optimization of chemical dosing to achieve cost effective mitigation of hydrogen sulfide h2s autoregressive ar models have previously been used for real time sewage prediction however the prediction showed significant delays in wet weather conditions in this paper autoregressive with exogenous inputs arx models are employed to reduce the delays with rainfall data used as model inputs the model is applied to predicting sewage flows at two real life sewage pumping stations spss with different hydraulic characteristics and climatic conditions the calibrated models were capable of predicting flow rates in both cases much more accurately than previously developed ar models under wet weather conditions simulation of on line chemical dosing control based on the predicted flows showed excellent sulfide mitigation performance at reduced cost graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer flow rate arx rainfall prediction chemical dosing 1 introduction sewer networks are among the most critical urban infrastructures they collect and transport domestic and industrial wastewater to wastewater treatment plants wwtp for treatment and disposal sewer systems are vulnerable to corrosion caused by hydrogen sulfide h2s generated in sewage under anaerobic conditions boon 1995 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 the emission of h2s and other odorous compounds also induce serious odour complaints and health hazards jiang et al 2015 to minimize the generation and emission of h2s in a whole network a commonly used strategy is dosing of chemicals such as oxygen gutierrez et al 2008 ochi et al 1998 nitrate jiang et al 2009 yang et al 2005 iron salts firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2005 and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 gutierrez et al 2009 the chemical dosing rate is critical to the sulfide control performance and the operational costs the main dosing strategies include constant dosing with which the dosing rate is maintained at a constant value without considering hydraulic or biological dynamics and variations of the wastewater characteristics flow paced dosing with the dosing rate proportional to the sewage flow rate profiled dosing where the dosing rates are pre defined in a profile which is established from empirical knowledge and typical hydraulic conditions ganigue et al 2011 the dosing strategy may have satisfactory performance when real conditions are similar to the designed ones however variable weather events induce changes to sewage hydraulics and characteristics leading to non optimal dosing recently an on line control strategy of chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation was developed and applied to h2s control with mg oh 2 ganigué et al 2016 and fecl3 ganigué et al 2018 dosing one critical component of the control structures proposed was a feedforward controller that calculated the amount of mg oh 2 or fecl3 required to balance acid or precipitate sulfide to be produced in the downstream pipes during sewage transport as the acid sulfide production mainly depends on the hydraulic retention time hrt of sewage in the pipe sharma et al 2008a the prediction of hrt is central for the control strategy sharma et al 2008b for a volume of sewage pumped into the pipe it can be treated as a moving slug the slug is pushed through the downstream pipe by the future sewage flow entering the sewer pipes due to this nature of sewage in sewers the hrt of a sewage slug in the downstream pipe is unknown at the time when chemicals are dosed to the slug therefore sewage flow has to be predicted several hours ahead in order to predict hrt of the current slug the prediction horizon depends on the retention time of the slug in the pipe generally in the order of hours an autoregressive model was developed for real time prediction of future flow in sewers chen et al 2014 which had been applied in the hrt based on line dosing control ganigué et al 2016 2018 the calibrated model could predict sewage flow up to six hours ahead with good accuracy during dry weather providing critical inputs to the on line controllers the controller supported by the flow prediction reduced mg oh 2 consumption by 15 in comparison to flow paced dosing strategy ganigué et al 2016 and fecl3 consumption by 31 ganigué et al 2018 in real sewer applications in both cases however a delay of a few hours occurred between the real flows and predicted ones during wet weather the delay was caused by the model not directly considering the rainfall in the catchment rainfall derived inflow and infiltration enter not only combined sewers but also sanitary systems via cross connection defective pipes and joints leaking manhole walls and covers or low disconnected traps butler and davies 2004 the additional flow shortens sewage hrt in the network which affects the amount of chemicals required also concentration of the chemical dosed is dramatically diluted by the increased flow both factors contribute to poorer control performance of sulfide in sewers jiang et al 2013 therefore a methodology for flow prediction directly considering the impact of rainfalls is of great importance for the optimization of sulfide mitigation to develop a model for predicting the rain impacted sewage flow in a review of hydrological forecasting methods o connell and clarke 1981 it was highlighted that a predicting model should be able to reflect the recently observed state to provide immediate response to the time varying series and to compute efficiently bidwell 1971 predicted the stream flow out of a catchment by considering the catchment as a discrete non linear system with rainfall as the input a certain memory period of rainfall values was determined by stepwise multiple regression however this method had low ability in accounting for evaporation and caused over estimation during long dry periods in a study of hydrological runoff the surface runoff and rainfall derived infiltration were separated based on unit hydrograph through arma autoregressive moving average transfer function modelling novotny and zheng 1989 but not as an exogenous input in novotny and zheng 1989 and several other studies ding and chen 2005 ding et al 2006 gelfan et al 1999 several algorithms for model parameter estimation were introduced and the impact of model structure order and parameter values on the accuracy of prediction was analysed these studies provided useful guidance on arma modelling they showed that the accuracy of on line flow prediction highly relied on the order of the model used they also revealed that an increase of the model parameters can effectively improve the results for off line prediction ding et al 2006 however the model cannot handle an entire non stationary process and thus requires further study before being applied to predict sewage flow during wet weather this study aims to develop a methodology that is able to achieve real time flow prediction of the sewage under variable weather conditions this was achieved through fitting flows and rainfalls to an autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs armax model the rainfall data was taken into consideration as an external input to improve the prediction accuracy by decreasing the delays the calibration and validation of the model was conducted with data from two sewage pumping stations spss with different hydraulic characteristics and climatic conditions collecting sewage in a small and a large catchment respectively the value of the models in supporting real time chemical dosing control was then demonstrated through simulation studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewer systems and flow data two sewer systems namely the uc09 sps and the bellambi sps with different hydraulic characteristics and climatic conditions see fig s1 in si for their catchment maps are used for the armax model development and demonstration 2 1 1 uc09 sps uc09 is a sewage pumping station in gold coast city australia it collects sewage from a small residential area with an equivalent population of 645 the rising main leading from the uc09 sps has a total length of 1084 m and diameter of 150 mm during dry weather the average flow rate is around 200 m3 d the wet weather flow could be 3 4 times higher the sps is operated in an intermittent manner the pump is activated when water level in the wet well reaches a pre defined upper level 18 of the total wet well height and keeps operating until the water level returns to a pre defined lower level 7 of the total wet well height this on duration typically lasts for approximately 2 min followed by an off period of 10 min to 1 h the pumping events are recorded by a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system the sewage flow into the sps wet well is not measured but can be estimated from the sps operational data sps on and off time and the known pumped flow rate according to chen et al 2014 1 q i n q p u m p t 2 t 1 t 2 t 0 where q in is the average flow rate into the wet well between two pumping events q pump is the constant pumped flow rate t 0 is the stop time of the previous pump cycle t 1 and t 2 are the start and the stop time of current pumping cycle 2 1 2 bellambi sps the bellambi sps operated by sydney water corporation is located in wollongong australia its service area is around 40 km2 predominantly residential it is a large pumping station containing six pumps with different pumped flow rates these pumps jointly deliver semi continuous flows with stepwise variations in the flow rate the average dry weather flow is approximately 20 000 m3 d with the wet weather flow being up to 5 times higher the length of the rising main is 9930 m and the pipe diameter is 720 mm flow rate out of the sps is recorded with an on line flow meter and a scada system the incoming flow to the sps is calculated based on eq 2 chen et al 2014 2 q i n q o u t d v d t where q in is the incoming flow to the sps q out is measured outflow and v is the volume of sewage in the wet well measured on line using a water level sensor and the scada system 2 2 rainfall data rainfall data in the catchments of the two spss studied were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology the oxenford station station number 040166 and bellambi station station number 068228 the closest weather stations to the uc09 and bellambi catchments fig s1 in si respectively were chosen for rain data collection they record rainfall in millimeters at six minute and one minute intervals respectively during which every equivalence of 0 2 mm precipitation is measured with tipping bucket rain gauges the annual total rainfalls of the sampled year were 2320 0 mm in the uc09 catchment and 1255 2 mm in the bellambi catchment 2 3 simulation studies 2 3 1 sewex model in order to test the control performance of different dosing methods the sewex model sharma et al 2008a is implemented as an auxiliary tool to simulate the uc09 sewer pipe see 2 1 1 the sewex model is a comprehensive dynamic mathematical model that describes chemical physical and biological processes occurring in sewer networks sharma et al 2008a 2008b the model predicts temporal and spatial variation of carbonaceous sulfurous and nitrogenous compounds under aerobic anaerobic and anoxic conditions occurring in sewer systems this model is also capable of describing chemical processes such as sulfide oxidation precipitation reactions and acid base systems the ph calculation is based on a set of algebraic equations representing acid equilibrium with charge balance built into the sewex model making the model capable of predicting ph variation according to the changes of sewage composition sharma et al 2013 2 3 2 an mg oh 2 dosing control algorithm ganigué et al 2016 proposed a control algorithm for mg oh 2 dosing to sewers the control goal is to maintain ph at the discharge point at a pre defined value chemical dosing is determined by an on line controller the control algorithm involves two components first mg oh 2 is dosed to the pumping station wet well to raise the sewage ph to the pre defined set point using a feedback controller sewage ph in the wet well is measured to provide the feedback signal for the control loop the second component involves dosing mg oh 2 to the beginning of the pipe at such a rate that the dosed mg oh 2 would neutralize the predicted acid production during the transport of the sewage through the pipe in this way sewage ph at the discharge point is expected to be at the set point level the acid production prediction requires the prediction of the sewage hrt in real time which subsequently requires the prediction of sewage flow eq 3 and eq 4 demonstrate two key steps for the calculation of dosing amount based on sewage hrt further details are described in ganigué et al 2016 3 δ h a h r t b 4 q m g o h 2 f f f q s e w a g e δ h where δ h mole m3 represents net proton production a and b denote model parameters requiring calibration hrt h is the hydraulic retention time of the sewage slug q m g o h 2 f f kg day is the mg oh 2 dosing rate for feedforward control f is a factor to convert the unit of protons from moles to kg of mg oh 2 required q sewage m3 day is the flow rate of the sewage entering the pipe it should be noted that in the original work sewage flow prediction was achieved through the development of an ar model which did not consider the rainfall data leading to delays of hours in the predicted flow compared to the real flow in this study rainfall events are taken into consideration by the arx model section 3 for predicting the flow coming into the wet well based on the characteristics of the wet well hrt of the sewage into the pipe can be predicted for the feedforward controller to calculate chemical dosage eq 3 and eq 4 the schematic of the on line controller based on flow prediction is depicted in fig 1 2 3 3 performance of control by different dosing strategies in simulation studies mg oh 2 is dosed at uc09 sps with the aim of maintaining sewage ph at 9 0 at the discharge point the study involves simultaneously simulating both the uc09 sewer pipe using the sewex model and the on line controller described in 2 3 2 the sewage characteristics and uc09 sps operational data pump on off timing previously measured at uc09 sharma and yuan 2009 were used as its input simultaneously the sps operational data along with the rainfall data were fed to the controller in real time based on which the on line controller including the feedforward component was implemented before being fed to the controller outliers and noise in the actual data were eliminated through data pretreatment as described in the supplementary information the output of the controller namely the mg oh 2 dosing rate was provided to the sewex model as an input signal for comparison constant dosing and flow paced dosing predominantly used by industries as well as a predictive controller based on previously established ar models chen et al 2014 were selected as reference scenarios both sulfide control performance and chemical costs are compared simulation of each of the dosing methods is carried out in three different weather conditions namely dry weather intermittent rain and storm weather 3 armax model development to construct an armax model for accurate prediction the development is an iterative process consisting of data pretreatment order determination and parameter estimation brockwell and davis 2013 3 1 a generic armax model an armax model is a linear input and output model that performs prediction into unseen future through regressing analysis of the historical data a general armax model for sewage flow prediction can be expressed by eq 5 5 a z 1 y t b z 1 u t c z 1 e t where z 1 is the backshift operator i e z 1 y t y t 1 y t is the output argument at time t here representing sewage flow rates m3 day u t is the input variable that indicates the amount of rainfall mm e t is a gaussian white noise with statistical independence from output a z 1 b z 1 and c z 1 are polynomials of z 1 that corresponding to autoregressive ar part namely the forecasting equation exogenous x part which contains input series and moving average ma part that terms forecast errors respectively 6 a z 1 1 a 1 z 1 a n a z n a 7 b z 1 b 0 b 1 z 1 a n b 1 z n b 1 z n k 8 c z 1 1 c 1 z 1 c n c z n c where n a n b and n c are the orders of a z 1 b z 1 and c z 1 respectively n k is the input output delay a i i 1 n a b i i 1 n b and c i i 1 n c are the parameters of a z 1 b z 1 and c z 1 respectively in particular when c z 1 equals 1 the armax model collapses to an arx model which is a simpler type of the full armax model 3 2 pretreatment of data the raw flow data were recorded as discrete events pump on off operation by on line scada systems which cannot be directly applied for armax model calibration these raw data were converted into a time series of flow into the wet well using equation 1 for uc09 and equation 2 for bellambi these time series data are non stationary and thus unsuitable as feed data for the armax models fig 2 a and fig 2b the time series were further pretreated to produce re scaled and stationary data series suitable for the identification of the armax model first some extreme high and low flow rates occurred randomly were eliminated as outliers through verification using normalization rousseeuw and leroy 2005 then the noise was further filtered through smoothing allowing the significant flow patterns to stand out from the data set finally the typical flow was removed from the data set by differencing operation the typical flow μ t represents the diurnal sewage flow which is obtained by stacking daily historical inflow data in dry weather in one set then the average flow at each sampling time during one day period is determined more details of these pre treatment steps are described in the supplementary information 3 3 order determination and parameter estimation to calibrate the armax models for uc09 sps and the bellambi sps fifty two 52 days data from the uc09 sps and ninety 90 days data from the bellmabi sps with intervals of 30 min were used here zero order differencing was employed to produce stationary time series after importing the pretreated data into the model function model orders were determined by plotting sample autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf first the orders of the ar and ma parts were identified with the reference of the pacf and acf patterns respectively brockwell and davis 2013 the tendencies of acf and pacf indicated that the ma part made little contribution to data tracking as a result only the order of ar part needed to be determined while the ma part was eliminated from the model structure once the orders of ar and ma part were determined a range of values generally from 1 to 10 were applied for the order of the x part to make different combinations with the determined ar order ma order and their corresponding model parameters which were estimated through least squares ls method then the order of x part was selected from the combination that achieved the best model fitness which was evaluated by akaike s information criterion aic finally two arx models were constructed the confirmed orders were arx 7 4 1 for uc09 and arx 8 8 2 for bellambi where the three values denote the orders of the ar x and time delay respectively model orders and the estimated parameters are shown in eq 9 for uc09 and eq 10 for bellambi respectively as an example fig 3 shows 7 days data used for model calibration with a prediction horizon of one hour and the model fit the functions used here and the detailed process of order determination and parameter estimation are further

involves regressing the errors between the real and predicted data bringing the error into correct alignment it is not a necessary component in every case but adds extra computation instead when an arx model can already achieve acceptable performance it is wise to simplify the armax model to an arx model bierens 1987 in this study the implemented models in both cases were arx models however the capabilities of armax model were still considered for a further assessment fig s5 in si as expected the ma part turned out to be negligible thus the arx models presented in eq 9 and eq 10 were confirmed and adopted for the simulations of chemical dosing 4 model performance assessment 4 1 multi step prediction of sewage flow rate sewage slugs carrying chemical typically have an hrt of hours therefore it is essential to acquire flow information several hours ahead in this light the iterative multistep prediction approach is employed for real time flow prediction in a horizon of several hours niu and yang 2009 for a k steps prediction the forecasting value at time t k k 1 2 n is calculated as follows 11 y ˆ t k t i 1 n a a i y ˆ t k i t i k n b b i u t k i i k n c c i e ˆ t k i where y ˆ t i t is iteratively sampled output at time t k i u t k i and e ˆ t k i are the input and forecasting error at time t k i respectively for model validation flow data over two wet weather periods from each sps were used three criteria were used for evaluating the prediction performance of the calibrated arx models namely root mean square errors rmse mean absolute deviation mad and maximum delay which is time delay between the peak value of actual flow and the predicted flow see si for the equations of rmse and mad the prediction results of uc09 and bellambi are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively fig 4 depicts the predicted sewage flow rates for uc09 in comparison to the measured flow rates with the rainfall information shown on the top of the figure both periods used for model validation comprised rainfall events from light to heavy rains with intervening dry weather gradient prediction horizons of 1 3 and 6 h were applied to each test specifically period 1 7 days contained more intensive rainfall while period 2 10 days had larger maximum instantaneous values of rainfall similar comparisons were also made for a 7 day long dry weather with example results shown in fig s4 in si it can be observed from fig 4 that sewage flow fluctuated upon the variation of rainfall during wet weather across both period 1 and period 2 there was a close fitness between actual flow and the predicted flow without significant under prediction or over prediction in comparison the ar model produced much more significant delays in the predictions for the same period fig s6 in si to quantitatively compare the prediction accuracy of the arx models and ar models rmse and mad were applied to the flow data table 1 all the values of rmse and mad based on the arx models were smaller than those based on the ar models which indicated that the introduction of rainfall data as exogenous inputs successfully reduced the delay in predictions the superior performance of the arx model compared to the ar model in real time sewage flow prediction was better seen in predictions with longer prediction horizons the rmse of the arx model were 47 3 69 5 and 75 0 for the prediction horizons of 1 3 and 6 h respectively which are 13 0 26 4 and 35 9 respectively smaller than the rmse values of the ar model demonstrating that arx model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to the ar model the maximum delays for the ar model in the case of uc09 for the prediction horizons of 1 3 and 6 h were 0 88 3 38 and 5 60 h respectively in comparison the maximum delays incurred to the arx model in the six hour prediction was only 1 01 h the arx model validation results for the bellambi sps are shown in fig 5 compared to the ar model the rmse values of the arx model decreased by 15 0 26 4 and 34 6 respectively the maximum delay in the six hour prediction was reduced from 5 55 h ar model to 1 72 h arx model 4 2 simulation study on line mg oh 2 dosing control a desktop simulation study was performed for assessing the performance of on line dosing of mg oh 2 based on model predictive control the control objective was to maintain sewage ph at 9 0 at the discharge point of the uc09 rising main with minimized dosing of mg oh 2 the arx model was used by a feedforward controller for on line dosing control providing information of future hrt calculation the hrt was further used to calculate the acidification of sewage during its transport in the pipe which required mg oh 2 for neutralisation as detailed in ganigué et al 2016 to validate the benefits of the arx model constant dosing flow paced dosing and feedforward control supported by a previously calibrated ar model chen et al 2014 were introduced here as reference scenarios flow predictions with a horizon of three hours were implemented by the arx and ar model for feedforward control all scenarios were simulated under three different weather conditions namely dry weather intermittent rain and storm weather each of them lasts for 7 days fig 6 shows the simulated ph and the dissolved hydrogen sulfide concentration mg s l at the discharge point in all three weather conditions and the associated amount of chemical dosing these results are quantitatively compared in table 2 as depicted in fig 6a in dry weather all the four dosing methods achieved an average ph around 9 0 however with constant dosing and flow paced dosing the two commonly used dosing methods in practice ph at the discharge point fluctuated in relatively wider ranges of 8 63 9 40 and 8 41 9 36 with standard deviations std of 0 15 and 0 22 respectively table 2 in comparison ph with feedforward control based on real time flow predicted by the ar and arx models varied in much smaller ranges of 8 92 9 07 and 8 91 9 09 with std of 0 03 and 0 04 respectively in dry weather the average concentration of dissolved h2s with flow paced dosing was the highest with a level of 0 060 mg s l fig 6a the level of dissolved h2s with constant dosing and ar model supported feedforward control were nearly the same with average concentrations of 0 060 mg s l and 0 061 mg s l respectively in comparison arx model supported feedforward control achieved the lowest concentration of dissolved h2s averaged at 0 056 mg s l and the smallest variations with a std of 0 008 concomitantly chemical consumption with the feedforward dosing control was much lower than those of the constant dosing and flow paced dosing the average chemical consumption with the ar model and arx model were 0 059 and 0 058 kg mg oh 2 m3 respectively while chemical consumption with the other two dosing methods were 0 086 and 0 064 kg mg oh 2 m3 respectively during wet weather due to rainfall derived inflow and infiltration sewage flow dramatically increased constant dosing and flow paced dosing which only relied on deterministic guidelines lost their effectiveness in sewage ph control under intermittent rain and storm weather fig 6b and c ph at the discharge point with constant dosing was highly dynamic in the intermittent rain with a range of 8 64 9 46 and storm periods with a range of 8 22 9 28 the variation of sewage ph with flow paced dosing varied in a range of more than one unit in both the intermittent rain ranged from 8 40 to 9 46 and storm periods ranged from 8 45 to 9 48 the ar model supported feedforward control performed better maintaining the ph between 8 86 and 9 45 in the intermittent rain period and 8 87 9 54 in the stormy period in comparison feedforward control supported by the arx model delivered more effective ph control achieving ph of 8 81 9 12 averaged at 8 98 for intermittent rain and 8 78 9 20 averaged at 9 00 for stormy period in intermittent rain all the four scenarios achieved average concentration of dissolved h2s below 0 050 mg s l and the ar model supported feedforward control achieved the lowest value of 0 038 mg s l fig 6b in storm weather the concentration of dissolved h2s by constant dosing was the lowest with an average of 0 038 mg s l fig 6c in both wet weather conditions the average concentration of dissolved h2s with arx model supported feedforward control were not the lowest due to reduced chemical dosing however it achieved the most stable control of dissolved h2s concentration with std of 0 007 and 0 009 at low levels of 0 050 and 0 053 mg s l in intermittent rain and storm weather respectively in comparison there were significant peak values of dissolved h2s up to 0 249 mg s l with constant dosing and flow paced dosing fig 6b and c much higher std were achieved in the other three scenarios with 0 027 and 0 026 for constant dosing 0 038 and 0 039 for flow paced dosing and 0 015 and 0 016 for ar model supported on line dosing in intermittent rain and storm weather respectively in terms of chemical consumption in wet weather flow paced dosing performed the worst roughly doubling the chemical consumption in other cases which were comparable fig 6d it is important to note that the arx model supported feedforward control achieved better ph control without increasing chemical consumption in fact its chemical consumption was 8 and 20 lower than the ar model supported feedforward control in the two wet weather periods 5 discussion 5 1 improvements achieved by the arx model over an ar model the present study illustrated the feasibility of using a simple yet effective approach for real time future sewage flow prediction compared to the ar model the arx model significantly improved the prediction accuracy with a great decrease of the prediction delays by taking rainfall into consideration as exogenous inputs yielding excellent performance under both dry weather and wet weather conditions the arx model outperformed the ar model in wet weather when a longer prediction horizon is required figs 4 and 5 through multistep prediction the developed model was utilized to provide real time information of sewage hrt calculation required by previously developed on line algorithm for sulfide control in sewer systems the on line dosing based on model predictive control was capable of adjusting the chemical dosage according to the dynamic flow and consequently maintaining the sewage ph at the defined level regardless of weather conditions in dry weather the novel control strategy achieved stable ph control with moderate chemical saving compared to traditional methods the power of the arx model was more neatly illustrated during wet weather during which ph with traditional dosing methods exhibited large fluctuations while feedforward control realized not only excellent ph control performance but also substantial 50 cost savings even higher improvements can be expected when the rainfall events are more severe or the prediction horizon needs to be further extended intriguingly during rainfall events ph with feedforward control supported by ar model is significantly higher than that supported by arx model this is because the ar model does not consider the effect of rain directly resulting in time delay between the predicted and actual flows when the flow rates already begin to increase after rainfall the flow rates predicted by the ar model are still at a relatively low level therefore during wet weather most of the predicted flow rates are lower than their real values lower flow rates produce longer hrt and the feedforward control over doses chemical resulting in higher ph this is also the reason why during intermittent rain and storm the average values of h2s with feedforward control with ar model were lower than those with arx model table 2 in future improvements the rainfall data could be conditioned based on the rain patterns and also the catchment characteristics before being fed into the model in this work the rainfall data at every sampling time was taken into calculation however some sporadic rain after a long lasting dry period will not necessarily lead to an increase in sewage flow because slight rain will be quickly lost to the absorption by dry soil and evaporation on the dry ground before reaching the sewer pipes in this case the model may erroneously predict the sewage flow and hence low amounts of rainfall need to be rejected as model input besides according to the area use catchments can be classified as natural catchment with pervious surface cover and urban catchment with a large part of impervious cover the rainfall is transported mainly via infiltration on pervious surfaces while most of the rain will form run off on impervious catchments potentially leading to inflow to sanitary sewers through e g cross connections so different catchments have very different component proportions of surface runoff inflow and infiltration in the widely used stormwater management model swmm rossman and huber 2016 there are a series of equations to convert precipitation to surface runoff based on sub catchment partition in addition urban areas are divided into pervious surfaces and impervious surfaces and the latter ones can be further divided into subareas with depression storage or without depression storage with aerial photos or land use maps the percent imperviousness of a catchment can be accurately measured rossman and huber 2016 for a general solution precipitation under a lower level defined based on the catchment characteristics can be deducted from the input series of arx model avoiding over estimation and further facilitate the optimization of chemical dosing in sewers 5 2 information derivable from parameters in an arx model rainfall affects sewage flow through inflow and infiltration inflow is rain water that directly enters sewers via for example cross connections and defective manhole covers inflow causes rapid increases in sewage flow in a collection system infiltration is the rainwater that firstly infiltrates into the soil then enters sewer systems through indirect connections to the sewer systems such as cracked pipes deteriorated manholes and root penetration to the contrary of inflow sewage flow rate responds to infiltration more slowly butler and davies 2004 as it takes some time to generate impact on sewage flow by the infiltration after the start of rainfall and this process has a subsequent influence beyond the end of rainfall the above key features of inflow and infiltration are visible in the x term parameters of the arx models developed in this study in the case of the bellambi model the eight x term parameters can be divided into three groups the values of the first group the first three parameters 321 8 1288 and the last group the last two parameters 1250 1552 are significantly higher than the values of the second group the 4th 6th parameters 11 20 49 61 it may be hypothesized that the first three terms close to the current time represent the more rapid effect of inflow while the last group represent the delayed effect of infiltration similarly in the case of the uc09 model the four x term parameters can also be divided into three groups the first two parameters with values of 1 5261 and 0 7946 respectively represent the inflow and the forth of 0 2921 represents infiltration it is noted that the third parameter with a value of 0 0285 which is almost negligible moreover the delay of the initial regression term demonstrates the features of sewer catchment for example the first term in the x part for uc09 is u t 1 that means the regression starts from one sample back more commonly referred to as a model delay of one whereas the delay in the bellambi case is two in fact figs 4 and 5 showed that the sewage experienced the same tendency as the rainfall but around one and two sample intervals after the variation of the precipitation the different delays are related to the fact that the catchments served by the uc09 sps and bellambi sps are vastly different with the bellambi catchment an order of magnitude larger than that of uc09 this difference was clearly captured by the arx models 5 3 other potential applications of arx models for real time control in this study the arx model was applied to chemical dosing control to mitigate the problems of corrosion and odour in sewers liu et al 2016 the usefulness of the model goes much beyond this original purpose first of all this method can be used to reduce combined sewer overflow cso increased sewage flow rate during rain events may exceed the capacity of the interceptor sewers and the storage reservoirs in this case large amounts of untreated sewage will be discharged to adjacent receiving waters causing pollution problems real time control of sewer flows is a promising approach for cso minimization darsono and labadie 2007 the implementation of real time control of cso not only needs the current measurements of water storage in sewers but also requires the prediction of future states of the system duchesne et al 2001 the developed arx model is able to provide such information a few hours ahead and thus contributing to a cost effective control of cso sewage is finally transported to a wwtp for treatment the arx model can be used in integrated control of wwtp and the sewer system operations brdys et al 2008 after implementing the incoming flow prediction the efficiency of primary and secondary sedimentation units could be greatly improved especially under wet weather conditions el din and smith 2002 the complex physical and biochemical phenomena in activated sludge may also be better regulated by feedforward control shen et al 2009 based on the information of future sewage flow likewise urban drainage management yuan et al 1999 and optimal design of irrigation systems feigin et al 2012 would be better carried out with the help of an accurate flow prediction last but not least the arx model can be used for gap filling the missing or incomplete data due to technical failures of measurement instruments or disturbance occurring in hydrological processes urban water management and wwtps oriani et al 2016 6 conclusions a real time prediction methodology for sewage flow was designed and implemented for on line chemical dosing control for sulfide mitigation in sewers under variable weather conditions the following conclusions are drawn an arx model involving the regression of historical sewage inflow with simultaneous consideration of rainfall data as an exogenous input was established and was demonstrated to significantly improve the prediction accuracy in comparison to previously established ar models arx models were calibrated for two sewage pumping stations with different hydraulic characteristics and catchment features both of the calibrated models were evaluated through predicting sewage flows several hours ahead in periods contained both dry weather and wet weather conditions and achieved excellent prediction performance the simulation of chemical dosing was carried out in three weather conditions namely dry weather intermittent rain and storm weather the on line chemical dosing method relying on flow prediction by an arx model achieved robust control performance and significant cost savings outperforming not only the current industry practice but also the on line dosing control based on an ar model in all tested scenarios the applications of arx models can potentially be expanded to other aspects of urban wastewater management

19155,chemical dosing is a commonly used strategy for mitigating sewer corrosion and odour problems caused by sulfide production prediction of sewage flow variation in real time is critical for the optimization of chemical dosing to achieve cost effective mitigation of hydrogen sulfide h2s autoregressive ar models have previously been used for real time sewage prediction however the prediction showed significant delays in wet weather conditions in this paper autoregressive with exogenous inputs arx models are employed to reduce the delays with rainfall data used as model inputs the model is applied to predicting sewage flows at two real life sewage pumping stations spss with different hydraulic characteristics and climatic conditions the calibrated models were capable of predicting flow rates in both cases much more accurately than previously developed ar models under wet weather conditions simulation of on line chemical dosing control based on the predicted flows showed excellent sulfide mitigation performance at reduced cost graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer flow rate arx rainfall prediction chemical dosing 1 introduction sewer networks are among the most critical urban infrastructures they collect and transport domestic and industrial wastewater to wastewater treatment plants wwtp for treatment and disposal sewer systems are vulnerable to corrosion caused by hydrogen sulfide h2s generated in sewage under anaerobic conditions boon 1995 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 the emission of h2s and other odorous compounds also induce serious odour complaints and health hazards jiang et al 2015 to minimize the generation and emission of h2s in a whole network a commonly used strategy is dosing of chemicals such as oxygen gutierrez et al 2008 ochi et al 1998 nitrate jiang et al 2009 yang et al 2005 iron salts firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2005 and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 gutierrez et al 2009 the chemical dosing rate is critical to the sulfide control performance and the operational costs the main dosing strategies include constant dosing with which the dosing rate is maintained at a constant value without considering hydraulic or biological dynamics and variations of the wastewater characteristics flow paced dosing with the dosing rate proportional to the sewage flow rate profiled dosing where the dosing rates are pre defined in a profile which is established from empirical knowledge and typical hydraulic conditions ganigue et al 2011 the dosing strategy may have satisfactory performance when real conditions are similar to the designed ones however variable weather events induce changes to sewage hydraulics and characteristics leading to non optimal dosing recently an on line control strategy of chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation was developed and applied to h2s control with mg oh 2 ganigué et al 2016 and fecl3 ganigué et al 2018 dosing one critical component of the control structures proposed was a feedforward controller that calculated the amount of mg oh 2 or fecl3 required to balance acid or precipitate sulfide to be produced in the downstream pipes during sewage transport as the acid sulfide production mainly depends on the hydraulic retention time hrt of sewage in the pipe sharma et al 2008a the prediction of hrt is central for the control strategy sharma et al 2008b for a volume of sewage pumped into the pipe it can be treated as a moving slug the slug is pushed through the downstream pipe by the future sewage flow entering the sewer pipes due to this nature of sewage in sewers the hrt of a sewage slug in the downstream pipe is unknown at the time when chemicals are dosed to the slug therefore sewage flow has to be predicted several hours ahead in order to predict hrt of the current slug the prediction horizon depends on the retention time of the slug in the pipe generally in the order of hours an autoregressive model was developed for real time prediction of future flow in sewers chen et al 2014 which had been applied in the hrt based on line dosing control ganigué et al 2016 2018 the calibrated model could predict sewage flow up to six hours ahead with good accuracy during dry weather providing critical inputs to the on line controllers the controller supported by the flow prediction reduced mg oh 2 consumption by 15 in comparison to flow paced dosing strategy ganigué et al 2016 and fecl3 consumption by 31 ganigué et al 2018 in real sewer applications in both cases however a delay of a few hours occurred between the real flows and predicted ones during wet weather the delay was caused by the model not directly considering the rainfall in the catchment rainfall derived inflow and infiltration enter not only combined sewers but also sanitary systems via cross connection defective pipes and joints leaking manhole walls and covers or low disconnected traps butler and davies 2004 the additional flow shortens sewage hrt in the network which affects the amount of chemicals required also concentration of the chemical dosed is dramatically diluted by the increased flow both factors contribute to poorer control performance of sulfide in sewers jiang et al 2013 therefore a methodology for flow prediction directly considering the impact of rainfalls is of great importance for the optimization of sulfide mitigation to develop a model for predicting the rain impacted sewage flow in a review of hydrological forecasting methods o connell and clarke 1981 it was highlighted that a predicting model should be able to reflect the recently observed state to provide immediate response to the time varying series and to compute efficiently bidwell 1971 predicted the stream flow out of a catchment by considering the catchment as a discrete non linear system with rainfall as the input a certain memory period of rainfall values was determined by stepwise multiple regression however this method had low ability in accounting for evaporation and caused over estimation during long dry periods in a study of hydrological runoff the surface runoff and rainfall derived infiltration were separated based on unit hydrograph through arma autoregressive moving average transfer function modelling novotny and zheng 1989 but not as an exogenous input in novotny and zheng 1989 and several other studies ding and chen 2005 ding et al 2006 gelfan et al 1999 several algorithms for model parameter estimation were introduced and the impact of model structure order and parameter values on the accuracy of prediction was analysed these studies provided useful guidance on arma modelling they showed that the accuracy of on line flow prediction highly relied on the order of the model used they also revealed that an increase of the model parameters can effectively improve the results for off line prediction ding et al 2006 however the model cannot handle an entire non stationary process and thus requires further study before being applied to predict sewage flow during wet weather this study aims to develop a methodology that is able to achieve real time flow prediction of the sewage under variable weather conditions this was achieved through fitting flows and rainfalls to an autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs armax model the rainfall data was taken into consideration as an external input to improve the prediction accuracy by decreasing the delays the calibration and validation of the model was conducted with data from two sewage pumping stations spss with different hydraulic characteristics and climatic conditions collecting sewage in a small and a large catchment respectively the value of the models in supporting real time chemical dosing control was then demonstrated through simulation studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewer systems and flow data two sewer systems namely the uc09 sps and the bellambi sps with different hydraulic characteristics and climatic conditions see fig s1 in si for their catchment maps are used for the armax model development and demonstration 2 1 1 uc09 sps uc09 is a sewage pumping station in gold coast city australia it collects sewage from a small residential area with an equivalent population of 645 the rising main leading from the uc09 sps has a total length of 1084 m and diameter of 150 mm during dry weather the average flow rate is around 200 m3 d the wet weather flow could be 3 4 times higher the sps is operated in an intermittent manner the pump is activated when water level in the wet well reaches a pre defined upper level 18 of the total wet well height and keeps operating until the water level returns to a pre defined lower level 7 of the total wet well height this on duration typically lasts for approximately 2 min followed by an off period of 10 min to 1 h the pumping events are recorded by a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system the sewage flow into the sps wet well is not measured but can be estimated from the sps operational data sps on and off time and the known pumped flow rate according to chen et al 2014 1 q i n q p u m p t 2 t 1 t 2 t 0 where q in is the average flow rate into the wet well between two pumping events q pump is the constant pumped flow rate t 0 is the stop time of the previous pump cycle t 1 and t 2 are the start and the stop time of current pumping cycle 2 1 2 bellambi sps the bellambi sps operated by sydney water corporation is located in wollongong australia its service area is around 40 km2 predominantly residential it is a large pumping station containing six pumps with different pumped flow rates these pumps jointly deliver semi continuous flows with stepwise variations in the flow rate the average dry weather flow is approximately 20 000 m3 d with the wet weather flow being up to 5 times higher the length of the rising main is 9930 m and the pipe diameter is 720 mm flow rate out of the sps is recorded with an on line flow meter and a scada system the incoming flow to the sps is calculated based on eq 2 chen et al 2014 2 q i n q o u t d v d t where q in is the incoming flow to the sps q out is measured outflow and v is the volume of sewage in the wet well measured on line using a water level sensor and the scada system 2 2 rainfall data rainfall data in the catchments of the two spss studied were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology the oxenford station station number 040166 and bellambi station station number 068228 the closest weather stations to the uc09 and bellambi catchments fig s1 in si respectively were chosen for rain data collection they record rainfall in millimeters at six minute and one minute intervals respectively during which every equivalence of 0 2 mm precipitation is measured with tipping bucket rain gauges the annual total rainfalls of the sampled year were 2320 0 mm in the uc09 catchment and 1255 2 mm in the bellambi catchment 2 3 simulation studies 2 3 1 sewex model in order to test the control performance of different dosing methods the sewex model sharma et al 2008a is implemented as an auxiliary tool to simulate the uc09 sewer pipe see 2 1 1 the sewex model is a comprehensive dynamic mathematical model that describes chemical physical and biological processes occurring in sewer networks sharma et al 2008a 2008b the model predicts temporal and spatial variation of carbonaceous sulfurous and nitrogenous compounds under aerobic anaerobic and anoxic conditions occurring in sewer systems this model is also capable of describing chemical processes such as sulfide oxidation precipitation reactions and acid base systems the ph calculation is based on a set of algebraic equations representing acid equilibrium with charge balance built into the sewex model making the model capable of predicting ph variation according to the changes of sewage composition sharma et al 2013 2 3 2 an mg oh 2 dosing control algorithm ganigué et al 2016 proposed a control algorithm for mg oh 2 dosing to sewers the control goal is to maintain ph at the discharge point at a pre defined value chemical dosing is determined by an on line controller the control algorithm involves two components first mg oh 2 is dosed to the pumping station wet well to raise the sewage ph to the pre defined set point using a feedback controller sewage ph in the wet well is measured to provide the feedback signal for the control loop the second component involves dosing mg oh 2 to the beginning of the pipe at such a rate that the dosed mg oh 2 would neutralize the predicted acid production during the transport of the sewage through the pipe in this way sewage ph at the discharge point is expected to be at the set point level the acid production prediction requires the prediction of the sewage hrt in real time which subsequently requires the prediction of sewage flow eq 3 and eq 4 demonstrate two key steps for the calculation of dosing amount based on sewage hrt further details are described in ganigué et al 2016 3 δ h a h r t b 4 q m g o h 2 f f f q s e w a g e δ h where δ h mole m3 represents net proton production a and b denote model parameters requiring calibration hrt h is the hydraulic retention time of the sewage slug q m g o h 2 f f kg day is the mg oh 2 dosing rate for feedforward control f is a factor to convert the unit of protons from moles to kg of mg oh 2 required q sewage m3 day is the flow rate of the sewage entering the pipe it should be noted that in the original work sewage flow prediction was achieved through the development of an ar model which did not consider the rainfall data leading to delays of hours in the predicted flow compared to the real flow in this study rainfall events are taken into consideration by the arx model section 3 for predicting the flow coming into the wet well based on the characteristics of the wet well hrt of the sewage into the pipe can be predicted for the feedforward controller to calculate chemical dosage eq 3 and eq 4 the schematic of the on line controller based on flow prediction is depicted in fig 1 2 3 3 performance of control by different dosing strategies in simulation studies mg oh 2 is dosed at uc09 sps with the aim of maintaining sewage ph at 9 0 at the discharge point the study involves simultaneously simulating both the uc09 sewer pipe using the sewex model and the on line controller described in 2 3 2 the sewage characteristics and uc09 sps operational data pump on off timing previously measured at uc09 sharma and yuan 2009 were used as its input simultaneously the sps operational data along with the rainfall data were fed to the controller in real time based on which the on line controller including the feedforward component was implemented before being fed to the controller outliers and noise in the actual data were eliminated through data pretreatment as described in the supplementary information the output of the controller namely the mg oh 2 dosing rate was provided to the sewex model as an input signal for comparison constant dosing and flow paced dosing predominantly used by industries as well as a predictive controller based on previously established ar models chen et al 2014 were selected as reference scenarios both sulfide control performance and chemical costs are compared simulation of each of the dosing methods is carried out in three different weather conditions namely dry weather intermittent rain and storm weather 3 armax model development to construct an armax model for accurate prediction the development is an iterative process consisting of data pretreatment order determination and parameter estimation brockwell and davis 2013 3 1 a generic armax model an armax model is a linear input and output model that performs prediction into unseen future through regressing analysis of the historical data a general armax model for sewage flow prediction can be expressed by eq 5 5 a z 1 y t b z 1 u t c z 1 e t where z 1 is the backshift operator i e z 1 y t y t 1 y t is the output argument at time t here representing sewage flow rates m3 day u t is the input variable that indicates the amount of rainfall mm e t is a gaussian white noise with statistical independence from output a z 1 b z 1 and c z 1 are polynomials of z 1 that corresponding to autoregressive ar part namely the forecasting equation exogenous x part which contains input series and moving average ma part that terms forecast errors respectively 6 a z 1 1 a 1 z 1 a n a z n a 7 b z 1 b 0 b 1 z 1 a n b 1 z n b 1 z n k 8 c z 1 1 c 1 z 1 c n c z n c where n a n b and n c are the orders of a z 1 b z 1 and c z 1 respectively n k is the input output delay a i i 1 n a b i i 1 n b and c i i 1 n c are the parameters of a z 1 b z 1 and c z 1 respectively in particular when c z 1 equals 1 the armax model collapses to an arx model which is a simpler type of the full armax model 3 2 pretreatment of data the raw flow data were recorded as discrete events pump on off operation by on line scada systems which cannot be directly applied for armax model calibration these raw data were converted into a time series of flow into the wet well using equation 1 for uc09 and equation 2 for bellambi these time series data are non stationary and thus unsuitable as feed data for the armax models fig 2 a and fig 2b the time series were further pretreated to produce re scaled and stationary data series suitable for the identification of the armax model first some extreme high and low flow rates occurred randomly were eliminated as outliers through verification using normalization rousseeuw and leroy 2005 then the noise was further filtered through smoothing allowing the significant flow patterns to stand out from the data set finally the typical flow was removed from the data set by differencing operation the typical flow μ t represents the diurnal sewage flow which is obtained by stacking daily historical inflow data in dry weather in one set then the average flow at each sampling time during one day period is determined more details of these pre treatment steps are described in the supplementary information 3 3 order determination and parameter estimation to calibrate the armax models for uc09 sps and the bellambi sps fifty two 52 days data from the uc09 sps and ninety 90 days data from the bellmabi sps with intervals of 30 min were used here zero order differencing was employed to produce stationary time series after importing the pretreated data into the model function model orders were determined by plotting sample autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf first the orders of the ar and ma parts were identified with the reference of the pacf and acf patterns respectively brockwell and davis 2013 the tendencies of acf and pacf indicated that the ma part made little contribution to data tracking as a result only the order of ar part needed to be determined while the ma part was eliminated from the model structure once the orders of ar and ma part were determined a range of values generally from 1 to 10 were applied for the order of the x part to make different combinations with the determined ar order ma order and their corresponding model parameters which were estimated through least squares ls method then the order of x part was selected from the combination that achieved the best model fitness which was evaluated by akaike s information criterion aic finally two arx models were constructed the confirmed orders were arx 7 4 1 for uc09 and arx 8 8 2 for bellambi where the three values denote the orders of the ar x and time delay respectively model orders and the estimated parameters are shown in eq 9 for uc09 and eq 10 for bellambi respectively as an example fig 3 shows 7 days data used for model calibration with a prediction horizon of one hour and the model fit the functions used here and the detailed process of order determination and parameter estimation are further

involves regressing the errors between the real and predicted data bringing the error into correct alignment it is not a necessary component in every case but adds extra computation instead when an arx model can already achieve acceptable performance it is wise to simplify the armax model to an arx model bierens 1987 in this study the implemented models in both cases were arx models however the capabilities of armax model were still considered for a further assessment fig s5 in si as expected the ma part turned out to be negligible thus the arx models presented in eq 9 and eq 10 were confirmed and adopted for the simulations of chemical dosing 4 model performance assessment 4 1 multi step prediction of sewage flow rate sewage slugs carrying chemical typically have an hrt of hours therefore it is essential to acquire flow information several hours ahead in this light the iterative multistep prediction approach is employed for real time flow prediction in a horizon of several hours niu and yang 2009 for a k steps prediction the forecasting value at time t k k 1 2 n is calculated as follows 11 y ˆ t k t i 1 n a a i y ˆ t k i t i k n b b i u t k i i k n c c i e ˆ t k i where y ˆ t i t is iteratively sampled output at time t k i u t k i and e ˆ t k i are the input and forecasting error at time t k i respectively for model validation flow data over two wet weather periods from each sps were used three criteria were used for evaluating the prediction performance of the calibrated arx models namely root mean square errors rmse mean absolute deviation mad and maximum delay which is time delay between the peak value of actual flow and the predicted flow see si for the equations of rmse and mad the prediction results of uc09 and bellambi are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively fig 4 depicts the predicted sewage flow rates for uc09 in comparison to the measured flow rates with the rainfall information shown on the top of the figure both periods used for model validation comprised rainfall events from light to heavy rains with intervening dry weather gradient prediction horizons of 1 3 and 6 h were applied to each test specifically period 1 7 days contained more intensive rainfall while period 2 10 days had larger maximum instantaneous values of rainfall similar comparisons were also made for a 7 day long dry weather with example results shown in fig s4 in si it can be observed from fig 4 that sewage flow fluctuated upon the variation of rainfall during wet weather across both period 1 and period 2 there was a close fitness between actual flow and the predicted flow without significant under prediction or over prediction in comparison the ar model produced much more significant delays in the predictions for the same period fig s6 in si to quantitatively compare the prediction accuracy of the arx models and ar models rmse and mad were applied to the flow data table 1 all the values of rmse and mad based on the arx models were smaller than those based on the ar models which indicated that the introduction of rainfall data as exogenous inputs successfully reduced the delay in predictions the superior performance of the arx model compared to the ar model in real time sewage flow prediction was better seen in predictions with longer prediction horizons the rmse of the arx model were 47 3 69 5 and 75 0 for the prediction horizons of 1 3 and 6 h respectively which are 13 0 26 4 and 35 9 respectively smaller than the rmse values of the ar model demonstrating that arx model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to the ar model the maximum delays for the ar model in the case of uc09 for the prediction horizons of 1 3 and 6 h were 0 88 3 38 and 5 60 h respectively in comparison the maximum delays incurred to the arx model in the six hour prediction was only 1 01 h the arx model validation results for the bellambi sps are shown in fig 5 compared to the ar model the rmse values of the arx model decreased by 15 0 26 4 and 34 6 respectively the maximum delay in the six hour prediction was reduced from 5 55 h ar model to 1 72 h arx model 4 2 simulation study on line mg oh 2 dosing control a desktop simulation study was performed for assessing the performance of on line dosing of mg oh 2 based on model predictive control the control objective was to maintain sewage ph at 9 0 at the discharge point of the uc09 rising main with minimized dosing of mg oh 2 the arx model was used by a feedforward controller for on line dosing control providing information of future hrt calculation the hrt was further used to calculate the acidification of sewage during its transport in the pipe which required mg oh 2 for neutralisation as detailed in ganigué et al 2016 to validate the benefits of the arx model constant dosing flow paced dosing and feedforward control supported by a previously calibrated ar model chen et al 2014 were introduced here as reference scenarios flow predictions with a horizon of three hours were implemented by the arx and ar model for feedforward control all scenarios were simulated under three different weather conditions namely dry weather intermittent rain and storm weather each of them lasts for 7 days fig 6 shows the simulated ph and the dissolved hydrogen sulfide concentration mg s l at the discharge point in all three weather conditions and the associated amount of chemical dosing these results are quantitatively compared in table 2 as depicted in fig 6a in dry weather all the four dosing methods achieved an average ph around 9 0 however with constant dosing and flow paced dosing the two commonly used dosing methods in practice ph at the discharge point fluctuated in relatively wider ranges of 8 63 9 40 and 8 41 9 36 with standard deviations std of 0 15 and 0 22 respectively table 2 in comparison ph with feedforward control based on real time flow predicted by the ar and arx models varied in much smaller ranges of 8 92 9 07 and 8 91 9 09 with std of 0 03 and 0 04 respectively in dry weather the average concentration of dissolved h2s with flow paced dosing was the highest with a level of 0 060 mg s l fig 6a the level of dissolved h2s with constant dosing and ar model supported feedforward control were nearly the same with average concentrations of 0 060 mg s l and 0 061 mg s l respectively in comparison arx model supported feedforward control achieved the lowest concentration of dissolved h2s averaged at 0 056 mg s l and the smallest variations with a std of 0 008 concomitantly chemical consumption with the feedforward dosing control was much lower than those of the constant dosing and flow paced dosing the average chemical consumption with the ar model and arx model were 0 059 and 0 058 kg mg oh 2 m3 respectively while chemical consumption with the other two dosing methods were 0 086 and 0 064 kg mg oh 2 m3 respectively during wet weather due to rainfall derived inflow and infiltration sewage flow dramatically increased constant dosing and flow paced dosing which only relied on deterministic guidelines lost their effectiveness in sewage ph control under intermittent rain and storm weather fig 6b and c ph at the discharge point with constant dosing was highly dynamic in the intermittent rain with a range of 8 64 9 46 and storm periods with a range of 8 22 9 28 the variation of sewage ph with flow paced dosing varied in a range of more than one unit in both the intermittent rain ranged from 8 40 to 9 46 and storm periods ranged from 8 45 to 9 48 the ar model supported feedforward control performed better maintaining the ph between 8 86 and 9 45 in the intermittent rain period and 8 87 9 54 in the stormy period in comparison feedforward control supported by the arx model delivered more effective ph control achieving ph of 8 81 9 12 averaged at 8 98 for intermittent rain and 8 78 9 20 averaged at 9 00 for stormy period in intermittent rain all the four scenarios achieved average concentration of dissolved h2s below 0 050 mg s l and the ar model supported feedforward control achieved the lowest value of 0 038 mg s l fig 6b in storm weather the concentration of dissolved h2s by constant dosing was the lowest with an average of 0 038 mg s l fig 6c in both wet weather conditions the average concentration of dissolved h2s with arx model supported feedforward control were not the lowest due to reduced chemical dosing however it achieved the most stable control of dissolved h2s concentration with std of 0 007 and 0 009 at low levels of 0 050 and 0 053 mg s l in intermittent rain and storm weather respectively in comparison there were significant peak values of dissolved h2s up to 0 249 mg s l with constant dosing and flow paced dosing fig 6b and c much higher std were achieved in the other three scenarios with 0 027 and 0 026 for constant dosing 0 038 and 0 039 for flow paced dosing and 0 015 and 0 016 for ar model supported on line dosing in intermittent rain and storm weather respectively in terms of chemical consumption in wet weather flow paced dosing performed the worst roughly doubling the chemical consumption in other cases which were comparable fig 6d it is important to note that the arx model supported feedforward control achieved better ph control without increasing chemical consumption in fact its chemical consumption was 8 and 20 lower than the ar model supported feedforward control in the two wet weather periods 5 discussion 5 1 improvements achieved by the arx model over an ar model the present study illustrated the feasibility of using a simple yet effective approach for real time future sewage flow prediction compared to the ar model the arx model significantly improved the prediction accuracy with a great decrease of the prediction delays by taking rainfall into consideration as exogenous inputs yielding excellent performance under both dry weather and wet weather conditions the arx model outperformed the ar model in wet weather when a longer prediction horizon is required figs 4 and 5 through multistep prediction the developed model was utilized to provide real time information of sewage hrt calculation required by previously developed on line algorithm for sulfide control in sewer systems the on line dosing based on model predictive control was capable of adjusting the chemical dosage according to the dynamic flow and consequently maintaining the sewage ph at the defined level regardless of weather conditions in dry weather the novel control strategy achieved stable ph control with moderate chemical saving compared to traditional methods the power of the arx model was more neatly illustrated during wet weather during which ph with traditional dosing methods exhibited large fluctuations while feedforward control realized not only excellent ph control performance but also substantial 50 cost savings even higher improvements can be expected when the rainfall events are more severe or the prediction horizon needs to be further extended intriguingly during rainfall events ph with feedforward control supported by ar model is significantly higher than that supported by arx model this is because the ar model does not consider the effect of rain directly resulting in time delay between the predicted and actual flows when the flow rates already begin to increase after rainfall the flow rates predicted by the ar model are still at a relatively low level therefore during wet weather most of the predicted flow rates are lower than their real values lower flow rates produce longer hrt and the feedforward control over doses chemical resulting in higher ph this is also the reason why during intermittent rain and storm the average values of h2s with feedforward control with ar model were lower than those with arx model table 2 in future improvements the rainfall data could be conditioned based on the rain patterns and also the catchment characteristics before being fed into the model in this work the rainfall data at every sampling time was taken into calculation however some sporadic rain after a long lasting dry period will not necessarily lead to an increase in sewage flow because slight rain will be quickly lost to the absorption by dry soil and evaporation on the dry ground before reaching the sewer pipes in this case the model may erroneously predict the sewage flow and hence low amounts of rainfall need to be rejected as model input besides according to the area use catchments can be classified as natural catchment with pervious surface cover and urban catchment with a large part of impervious cover the rainfall is transported mainly via infiltration on pervious surfaces while most of the rain will form run off on impervious catchments potentially leading to inflow to sanitary sewers through e g cross connections so different catchments have very different component proportions of surface runoff inflow and infiltration in the widely used stormwater management model swmm rossman and huber 2016 there are a series of equations to convert precipitation to surface runoff based on sub catchment partition in addition urban areas are divided into pervious surfaces and impervious surfaces and the latter ones can be further divided into subareas with depression storage or without depression storage with aerial photos or land use maps the percent imperviousness of a catchment can be accurately measured rossman and huber 2016 for a general solution precipitation under a lower level defined based on the catchment characteristics can be deducted from the input series of arx model avoiding over estimation and further facilitate the optimization of chemical dosing in sewers 5 2 information derivable from parameters in an arx model rainfall affects sewage flow through inflow and infiltration inflow is rain water that directly enters sewers via for example cross connections and defective manhole covers inflow causes rapid increases in sewage flow in a collection system infiltration is the rainwater that firstly infiltrates into the soil then enters sewer systems through indirect connections to the sewer systems such as cracked pipes deteriorated manholes and root penetration to the contrary of inflow sewage flow rate responds to infiltration more slowly butler and davies 2004 as it takes some time to generate impact on sewage flow by the infiltration after the start of rainfall and this process has a subsequent influence beyond the end of rainfall the above key features of inflow and infiltration are visible in the x term parameters of the arx models developed in this study in the case of the bellambi model the eight x term parameters can be divided into three groups the values of the first group the first three parameters 321 8 1288 and the last group the last two parameters 1250 1552 are significantly higher than the values of the second group the 4th 6th parameters 11 20 49 61 it may be hypothesized that the first three terms close to the current time represent the more rapid effect of inflow while the last group represent the delayed effect of infiltration similarly in the case of the uc09 model the four x term parameters can also be divided into three groups the first two parameters with values of 1 5261 and 0 7946 respectively represent the inflow and the forth of 0 2921 represents infiltration it is noted that the third parameter with a value of 0 0285 which is almost negligible moreover the delay of the initial regression term demonstrates the features of sewer catchment for example the first term in the x part for uc09 is u t 1 that means the regression starts from one sample back more commonly referred to as a model delay of one whereas the delay in the bellambi case is two in fact figs 4 and 5 showed that the sewage experienced the same tendency as the rainfall but around one and two sample intervals after the variation of the precipitation the different delays are related to the fact that the catchments served by the uc09 sps and bellambi sps are vastly different with the bellambi catchment an order of magnitude larger than that of uc09 this difference was clearly captured by the arx models 5 3 other potential applications of arx models for real time control in this study the arx model was applied to chemical dosing control to mitigate the problems of corrosion and odour in sewers liu et al 2016 the usefulness of the model goes much beyond this original purpose first of all this method can be used to reduce combined sewer overflow cso increased sewage flow rate during rain events may exceed the capacity of the interceptor sewers and the storage reservoirs in this case large amounts of untreated sewage will be discharged to adjacent receiving waters causing pollution problems real time control of sewer flows is a promising approach for cso minimization darsono and labadie 2007 the implementation of real time control of cso not only needs the current measurements of water storage in sewers but also requires the prediction of future states of the system duchesne et al 2001 the developed arx model is able to provide such information a few hours ahead and thus contributing to a cost effective control of cso sewage is finally transported to a wwtp for treatment the arx model can be used in integrated control of wwtp and the sewer system operations brdys et al 2008 after implementing the incoming flow prediction the efficiency of primary and secondary sedimentation units could be greatly improved especially under wet weather conditions el din and smith 2002 the complex physical and biochemical phenomena in activated sludge may also be better regulated by feedforward control shen et al 2009 based on the information of future sewage flow likewise urban drainage management yuan et al 1999 and optimal design of irrigation systems feigin et al 2012 would be better carried out with the help of an accurate flow prediction last but not least the arx model can be used for gap filling the missing or incomplete data due to technical failures of measurement instruments or disturbance occurring in hydrological processes urban water management and wwtps oriani et al 2016 6 conclusions a real time prediction methodology for sewage flow was designed and implemented for on line chemical dosing control for sulfide mitigation in sewers under variable weather conditions the following conclusions are drawn an arx model involving the regression of historical sewage inflow with simultaneous consideration of rainfall data as an exogenous input was established and was demonstrated to significantly improve the prediction accuracy in comparison to previously established ar models arx models were calibrated for two sewage pumping stations with different hydraulic characteristics and catchment features both of the calibrated models were evaluated through predicting sewage flows several hours ahead in periods contained both dry weather and wet weather conditions and achieved excellent prediction performance the simulation of chemical dosing was carried out in three weather conditions namely dry weather intermittent rain and storm weather the on line chemical dosing method relying on flow prediction by an arx model achieved robust control performance and significant cost savings outperforming not only the current industry practice but also the on line dosing control based on an ar model in all tested scenarios the applications of arx models can potentially be expanded to other aspects of urban wastewater management

19156,this study aimed to examine the drivers in shaping the occurrence and distribution of total viruses and picoplankton in tropical freshwater ecosystems flow cytometry was used to quantify the concentrations of total viruses picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria three land use patterns urban agriculture and parkland dominated were evaluated using arcgis significant correlations were observed between water borne microbial targets and water quality parameters 0 175 r 0 441 nutrients 0 250 r 0 570 and land use factors 0 200 r 0 460 in particular the concentrations of total viruses and picoheterotrophic cells were higher in catchments whereas the abundances of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria were higher in reservoirs total viruses and picoplankton had higher concentrations in urban and agriculture dominated areas probably due to anthropogenic inputs and agricultural inputs respectively although surface water is a complex matrix influenced by niche based i e physicochemical properties nutrients land use impact etc and neutral based factors i e ecological drift dispersal and species land use patterns could help to elucidate the occurrence and distribution of the total microbial community at the macroscopic level meanwhile inter correlations among viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 715 r 0 990 also substantiates their mutual interactions in influencing the microbial community furthermore the relationships between total microbial cells and bacterial and viral indicators were also investigated concentrations of total viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs were positively correlated with bacterial indicators 0 427 r 0 590 and viral indicators 0 201 r 0 563 these results indicated that faecal and viral contamination could contribute to the numbers of total viruses and bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords viruses phytoplankton cyanobacteria flow cytometry occurrence 1 introduction viruses are the most numerically dominant microorganisms on earth with an estimated 1031 total viruses globally weitz and wilhelm 2012 they are thought to influence a number of processes ranging from nutrient and geochemical cycling to gene transfer microbial community dynamics and even evolution of organisms jacquet et al 2010 like viruses microbial cells play crucial roles in most geochemical cycles in the global ecosystem including organic matter transformation and nutrient cycling and their activity has a strong impact on ecosystem metabolism fuhrman et al 2015 autotrophic and heterotrophic cells are the two fundamental units in the ecosystem where the former can utilize light or chemical energy for food while the latter rely on other organisms for nutrition marcarelli et al 2011 phytoplankton also known as microalgae are the most numerous autotrophs and are thought to be responsible for half of the global primary production boyce et al 2010 many different kinds of phytoplankton have been described and among the most common ones are diatoms dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria tang and dobbs 2007 cyanobacteria blue green algae are photosynthetic bacteria which can be found all over the world and their blooms have severe impacts on aquatic ecosystems zanchett and oliveira 2013 given the importance of viruses microbial cells phytoplankton and cyanobacteria in the global ecosystem many studies have been conducted on the abundance and distribution of these microorganisms in environmental waters haller et al 2018 ng et al 2018 pan et al 2017 thomson et al 2010 woodhouse et al 2016 yet much about the occurrence of all these microorganisms remains a mystery the occurrence of total viruses autotrophic and heterotrophic cells in full scale freshwater ecosystems and possible factors which influence their distribution and prevalence remains largely unexplored microscopy and plate counting have been used as standard techniques for detection and quantification of microorganisms however both methods are very time consuming and could considerably underestimate the total number of viruses and cells in the aquatic environment as most of them are extremely small and inherently difficult or impossible to culture in recent decades many molecular approaches such as quantitative real time polymer chain reaction qpcr have been used for the rapid and accurate enumeration of target microorganisms in environmental samples including water sediment soil and sludge canfora et al 2016 goh et al 2017 yang et al 2017 however unlike the specific signature sequences for prokaryotes 16s rrna and eukaryotes 18s rrna viruses heterotrophs and phytoplankton communities lack universally conserved sequences for their entire population which severely limits the detection of whole groups of cells using the qpcr method bidle 2014 kang et al 2011 alternatively flow cytometry fcm has been used for environmental microbial analysis van nevel et al 2017 wang et al 2010 basically fcm is an automated technique which is able to rapidly up to 104 cells second measure the optical properties of cells suspended in liquid transport through beams of light fcm is well suited for the investigation of aquatic microorganisms as many of them are very small 2 μm and difficult to analyze by traditional methods furthermore all phytoplanktonic cells are naturally autofluorescent due to their photosynthetic pigments e g chlorophyll a chl a phycoerythrin pe and phycocyanin pc and hence they can be easily distinguished from each other by fcm gin et al 2003 in addition through the staining of nucleic acids with highly fluorescent dyes sybr green i ii sybr gold the abundance of microbial cells can be determined and quantified by fcm with high statistical confidence in recent years the application of highly fluorescent dyes coupled with high instrument sensitivity has enabled the detection and quantification of small virus like particles many factors are known to be able to shape the occurrence and distribution of viruses picoplankton in freshwater ecosystems over the past few decades however investigated factors were mainly limited to physicochemical factors and nutrients other important factors such as land use which is one of the key drivers in shaping the water borne microorganisms is still largely unexplored goh et al 2017 hassell et al 2017 in fact land use patterns is a vital indication of specific activities within those areas katsiapi et al 2012 many reported studies show that urban and agricultural land use can indicate anthropogenic pressure amos et al 2015 mattikalli and richards 1996 te et al 2017 using molecular methods such as qpcr and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing specific microbial populations and community structures of particular areas can be identified through these approaches for example the occurrence of viral e g norovirus gi gii adenovirus enterovirus rotavirus and hepatitis a virus and fecal indicator bacteria e g e coli and enterococci were found to be higher in urbanized areas caused by sewage contamination and domestic animal faeces corsi et al 2014 in addition the bacterial community structure was found to be impacted by land use gradients bowers et al 2011 liu et al 2014 for instance the richness and diversity of cyanobacteria communities were driven by intensive disturbance of urban and agricultural practice on yungui plateau china liao et al 2016 nevertheless the occurrence of viruses or bacterial communities driven by land use patterns is still not well investigated as qpcr only targets specific microorganisms without looking at the broader picture and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing is unable to quantify the microbial community fcm was employed in this study to address these gaps the aims of this study were to investigate the abundance of total viruses picoplankton picophytoplankton picoheterotroph and picocyanobacteria in singapore freshwater ecosystems by fcm and to explore the impacts of different factors including physicochemical factors nutrients and land use on their dynamics to the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study to investigate impacts of land use on water borne microbial aquatic communities in a highly urbanized tropical city such as singapore in addition relationships between these microbial communities with bacterial and viral indicators were also highlighted the results from this study would be useful in understanding freshwater ecosystems comprehensively and in managing water quality of water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and land use analysis this study was conducted in singapore an island country in southeast asia with an average annual rainfall of 2200 mm a land area of 719 1 km2 and a population of 5 61 million people in 2017 department of statistics singapore 2017 all the sampling sites and land use categories were mapped with arcgis 10 3 1 esri redlands ca usa land use shape files were obtained from the singapore land authority pub singapore s national water agency and the land use subcategories were defined by the singapore urban redevelopment authority however to reduce the number of parameters in this study subcategories were merged into 5 categories i residential ii urban iii green iv agricultural and v water body four different map layers were used in this study i catchment land use shape files ii river land use shape files iii sub catchment land use shape files and iv drain line maps wgs 1984 web mercator auxiliary sphere and gcs wgs 1984 svy21 singapore were used as the projection coordinate system and the geographic coordinate system respectively the land covering percentage area of each sampling point was calculated based on the drains flowing into the sampling sites however if no drain flows directly the effect of land use was estimated using a 2 km buffer around the site to reduce the parameter numbers the land use weightage which is the combination of different land use categories was calculated to calculate the weightage numbers 1 2 3 4 were assigned to green agriculture urban and residential respectively details of land use categories were provided in table s1 the final weightage number was calculated based on the contribution of each land use category to each sampling site 2 2 sample collection and measurement of physical chemical parameters a total of 143 water samples were collected from 7 reservoirs r1 r7 and 3 upstream catchments t1 t3 between nov 2014 and feb 2017 to be specific the sampling time included the northeast monsoon dec 2014 jan 2015 dec 2015 dec 2016 southwest monsoon july 2015 aug 2015 aug 2016 inter monsoon mar 2015 apr 2015 oct 2015 oct 2016 feb 2017 ten sampling points in reservoirs and nine sampling points in catchments were surveyed only r1 3 had their corresponding tributary sampling points flowing through the reservoirs table s2 lists the land use percentage for the 7 reservoirs and 3 upstream catchments to better assess land use impacts the sampling sites were classified into three main categories a urbanized areas b agricultural areas and c parkland areas sites 1 2 and 4 were urbanized areas with more than 60 residential and urban areas site 3 was the only sampling location with a reasonable percentage of agriculture area and thus was regarded as agricultural area sites 5 and 7 were parkland areas with more than 95 green areas although site 6 took 80 residential and urban areas it was also regarded as a parkland area in this study as there was no drain directly flowing to the reservoir and the possibility that urbanized land use impacted on the reservoirs was small fig s1 physicochemical parameters including temperature ph conductivity salinity turbidity dissolved oxygen do and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ using the hi9828 multiparameter meter hanna instruments usa other water quality parameters including total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured according to the american public health association apha standard methods 2 3 flow cytometry analysis flow cytometry was performed using a cytoflex flow cytometer beckman coulter inc ca usa all the freshwater samples were pretreated and analyzed as described earlier brown et al 2015 gin et al 2003 payet et al 2014 briefly for virus enumeration 500 μl samples were diluted from 1 1 to 1 100 in te buffer 10 mm tris 1 mm edta ph 8 0 and stained with sybr gold thermo fisher scientific usa for 15 min in the dark at 80 c the samples a 50 μl volume fraction of the 500 μl sample were analyzed at a rate of 10 μl min and the discriminator was set on green fluorescence fig s2a for total picoplankton enumeration samples were stained with sybr gold for 15 min in the dark at room temperature the discriminator was set on green fluorescence fig s2b and samples 50 μl were analyzed at a rate of 60 μl min for picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria enumerations the discriminators were set on red fig s2c and orange fluorescence fig s2d respectively 0 5 μm and 1 0 μm fluospheres microsphere beads thermo fisher scientific inc usa were added to each virus and picoplankton samples respectively for absolute counting the concentrations of viruses and picoplankton in original samples were calculated by the following formula concentration of cells viruses cells viruses events number beads events number beads concentration dilution factor 2 4 quantification for bacterial and viral indicators for quantification of e coli enterococcus ent and pseudomonas colilert 18 enterolert and pseudalert idexx laboratories inc usa were used media powder was mixed with a volume of 100 ml of raw water sample and 10 fold serially diluted before pouring into a multi well tray quanti tray 2000 colilert 18 and pseudalert samples were incubated at 35 c for 18 and 24 h while enterolert samples were incubated at 41 c for 24 h the presence of fluorescence in individual well was visualized under long wave ultraviolet light 365 nm the concentration was calculated by the most probable number mpn table provided and the diluter factor for quantification of total coliphage f and somatic coliphage single agar layer plaque assay method was used as described by vergara et al 2015 for quantification of viral indicators pmmov frna gii f rna giii water samples were collected in sterilized carboys and concentrated using hollow fiber ultrafiltration fresenius medical care germany to obtain a final volume of 600 ml primary concentrate si a fig s3 viral nucleic acids were extracted from secondary concentration using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit si b qiagen germany basically peg precipitation chloroform treatment and amicon ultrafiltration were applied to

guidelines bustin et al 2009 the standard curve had r2 range of 0 985 0 99 and detection limits for pmmov frna gii and frna giii were 80 gc l table s4 2 5 statistical data analysis statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss 23 ibm portsmouth uk the mann whitney u test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in the concentrations of microbial targets for reservoirs and catchments the kruskal wallis test was used to determine if the concentrations of microbial targets were significantly different across all sites spearman s rho correlation was performed among the microbial targets environmental parameters and land use percentage three levels of correlation were determined by correlation coefficients weak r 0 3 moderate 0 3 r 0 5 and strong r 0 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of viruses picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria higher concentrations of viruses and picoplankton were present in the catchments than in reservoirs fig 1 a table s5 this might be because more viruses could be absorbed in the sediment matrix in catchments the concentrations of total viruses and picoplankton in the 3 reservoirs and their catchments and their respective means medians 5th and 95th percentiles and outliers are shown in fig 1b among all the samples the lowest mean concentrations of viruses and picoplankton were detected in reservoirs r2 3 4 107 counts ml and r1 2 7 106 counts ml while the highest mean concentrations were detected in tributaries t2 3 1 108 counts ml and t1 1 5 107 counts ml respectively the concentrations of viruses and picoplankton varied between reservoirs and catchments and different land use patterns both 1 and 2 are urban dominated areas while 3 is an agriculture dominated area the concentrations of viruses and picoplankton in reservoirs were significantly lower than in their catchments p 0 01 mann whitney test while the difference in the mean of virus to picoplankton ratios in both reservoirs and catchments was not significant p 0 01 mann whitney test indicating that the abundance of viruses could be associated with their host density since the phytoplankton are the autotrophic components of the plankton community the concentrations of their counterpart picoheterotrophs could be estimated from the difference between the two table s5 the concentrations of picoheterotrophs were quite stable over the different reservoirs and catchments ranging from 106 to 107 counts ml fig 2 a and b however the concentrations of picophytoplankton in catchments were lower by 1 2 orders of magnitude than those in reservoirs p 0 01 kruskal wallis test picophytoplankton refers to picoeukaryotes and picocyanobacteria similarly the concentration differences of picocyanobacteria in catchments and reservoirs were also significant p 0 01 mann whitney test catchment t2 showed the lowest autotroph concentration picophytoplankton 2 3 104 counts ml and picocyanobacteria 2 1 104 counts ml while reservoir r2 showed the highest amount picophytoplankton 6 4 105 counts ml and picocyanobacteria 5 8 105 counts ml these concentration differences may be due to high washout losses of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria and low residence time in the catchments especially during the monsoon season interestingly the concentrations of viruses picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria in catchments showed greater variations likely caused by different land usage patterns and more dynamic fluctuations in ph temperature flow rate turbidity and other water quality parameters were observed in the catchments than in the reservoirs 3 2 impact of land use on the occurrence of viruses picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria in order to investigate human impacts on the structure and function of reservoir ecosystems in singapore the abundance of viruses and different picoplankton were grouped into 3 types urban agriculture and parkland according to their dominant land use types as mentioned in section 2 2 fig 3 a and b the mean concentrations of viruses and picoplankton in urban agriculture and parkland dominated land use were 4 0 107 counts ml and 2 9 106 counts ml 1 2 108 counts ml and 4 6 106 counts ml 1 5 107 counts ml and 1 4 106 counts ml respectively similarly the lowest mean concentrations of picoheterotrophs and picophytoplankton were detected in parkland dominated area while relatively higher concentrations were measured in urban and agriculture dominated reservoirs table s6 the mean concentrations of picocyanobacteria in urban agriculture and parkland dominated land use were 2 8 105 counts ml 2 7 105 counts ml and 1 5 105 counts ml accounting for about 88 1 84 7 and 82 5 of the picophytoplankton amount respectively the higher abundance of all types of cells in agriculture dominated reservoirs than other areas is probably because of the higher concentrations of n p and lower n p mass ratio which are suitable for cells to grow katsiapi et al 2012 paerl et al 2016 other human activities could also contribute to nutrient pollution to further examine the land use impacts on the distribution of different pico microbial targets spearman s rank correlations were performed among pico microbial targets and different percentage of land use areas at each sampling site table 1 viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs positively correlated p 0 01 with the percentage of residential areas 0 326 r 0 383 urban areas 0 323 r 0 418 but negatively correlated with the percentage of green areas 0 455 r 0 395 these results suggested that viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs were correlated with land use patterns and anthropogenic activities different land use patterns were characterized by specific physicochemical properties and nutrients in this study the urban and residential land were highly positively correlated with nitrogen and phosphorus whereas green areas were negatively correlated with nutrients table s7 the lack of correlations between the percentage of agriculture areas and concentrations of nutrients is attributed to the fact that the variation of nutrient concentrations in agricultural areas across different sampling locations is within a relatively small range during our sampling period nonetheless concentrations of nutrients are still high in agriculture areas in short urban residential and agricultural areas were the main sources of nutrient input for local freshwater ecosystems factors in shaping the microbial communities have been investigated in various aquatic environments for instance a recent study conducted in singapore urbanized catchments reported positive correlations between specific species e g e coli ent and alternative faecal indicators and turbidity do conductivity and nutrients liang et al 2015 however this study was limited to specific targets and did not explore the land use factors in contrast in this study we expanded this to include different land use patterns and found that the latter influenced the distribution of microbial targets strongly in another case land use in catchments contributed little to the variation of cyanobacterial diversity in danish lakes özkan et al 2013 as opposed to this study although the geometric concentrations of picocyanobacteria in both catchments were low our study showed that urbanized catchments were significantly lower than those in agricultural catchments p 0 05 as mentioned earlier this may be due to the relatively high p concentration and low n p mass ratio in agricultural areas these results are consistent with previous studies of cyanobacteria investigated in different water shed land use types which also showed that p was the limiting nutrient beaver et al 2014 katsiapi et al 2012 3 3 relationships between viruses picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton picocyanobacteria concentrations and water quality parameters among the pico microbial targets and nutrients tn showed the strongest positive correlations with viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 534 r 0 570 followed by ammonia 0 426 r 0 466 and tp 0 446 r 0 462 as expected nutrients are key sources for picoplankton and picoheterotrophs to grow in this study picoheterotrophs are largely heterotrophic bacteria that can biodegrade dissolved organic matter dom and particulate organic matter pom into inorganic nutrients azam and malfatti 2007 which explains the positive correlations between picoheterotrophs and nutrients the positive correlations between viruses and nutrients could be attributed to lytic processes specifically viruses lyse bacteria and release their cell contents particulate and dissolved organic matter into aquatic environments which could then be utilized by uninfected bacteria where bacteria growth is stimulated shelford et al 2012 it was confirmed in experiments that virus replete samples increased the ammonium concentration compared to virus free samples shelford et al 2012 our results also suggest that viruses are important players in nutrient cycling in aquatic environments in terms of the physiochemical parameters turbidity had moderate positive correlations with viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 371 r 0 441 consistent with greater cell growth resulting in increased turbidity hammes et al 2008 in addition weak correlations were observed with conductivity total dissolved solids tds salinity and dissolved oxygen do conductivity measures the amount of ions that can be derived from mineral dissolution and atmospheric deposition tds which represents the concentrations of inorganic salts organic matter and other dissolved materials in water can provide suitable media containing supportive nutrients for cells to grow narkis et al 1995 salinity regulates the osmotic pressure of microbial cells and alter their ability to uptake dissolved organic carbon compounds liu et al 2011 do is involved in cell metabolic pathways since it measures electron acceptor availability berdjeb et al 2011 weak correlations could be due to the pooled datasets as different associations among microbial targets and water quality parameters were observed for different sampling sites the concentrations of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria were correlated negatively with the concentrations of viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 365 r 0 262 picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria also showed negative correlations with nutrients turbidity conductivity tds salinity and positive correlations with do which exhibited reverse correlation coefficients with water quality parameters compared to viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs using pooled datasets table 2 picophytoplankton are known to be ubiquitous and able to thrive in a wide trophic range from hyperoligotrophy to hypereutrophy weisse 1993 this might be attributed to their tiny cell sizes which require lower maintenance energy but enable faster nutrient uptake through diffusion due to higher surface area to volume ratio generally earlier studies showed that the abundance of picophytoplankton increased with an increase in nutrient availability however their contribution to the total phytoplankton relative abundance decreased when water became more eutrophic as other larger algae out competed picophytoplankton callieri et al 2012 negative correlations between picophytoplankton and nutrients found in this study was likely due to the dominance of eukaryotic phytoplankton with physiological advantages that can proliferate rapidly under nutrient rich environment therefore surpassing the growth of picophytoplankton gin et al 1999 2003 stockner 1991 a strong positive correlation was observed between picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria r 0 988 as picocyanobacteria are the major component among picophytoplankton in our samples regardless of different locations comprising 85 3 in reservoirs and 86 8 in catchments among viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs picoheterotrophs correlated well with picoplankton r 0 99 on average 88 59 of the picoplankton belonged to picoheterotrophs as a result the distribution and behavior of picoheterotrophs largely influenced the dynamics of picoplankton in surface waters viruses correlated well with picoheterotrophs and picoplankton with r values of 0 724 and 0 715 respectively it is well known that the majority of the virome are found to be bacteriophage in aquatic environments breitbart and rohwer 2005 which can explain the strong correlation coefficients observed the data further suggested that picoheterotrophs was a primary food source for these viruses by lytic infection 3 4 relationships between viruses picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton picocyanobacteria concentrations and bacterial indicators and viral indicators the concentrations of several bacterial indicators i e ent e coli pseudomonas and viral indicators i e total coliphage f coliphage somatic coliphage frna gi giv and pmmov were measured and quantified in the previous studies liang et al 2015 vergara et al 2015 spearman s rank correlations were performed to examine the associations between pico microbial targets and specific viral and bacterial indicators bacterial indicators correlated well with viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 427 r 0 590 although they were responsible for only a small percentage of the total bacteria table 3 by comparison specific bacterial indicators had slightly better correlations with picoheterotrophs 0 450 r 0 500 compared to total picoplankton 0 427 r 0 482 this is not surprising as ent e coli and p aeruginosa belong to heterotrophic bacteria and they share similar energy utilization sources picoplankton contained autotrophic cells with contrasting behavior and consequently decreased the associations between ent e coli and p aeruginosa overall these results suggested that faecal contamination could contribute to the abundance of picoplankton picoheterotrophs in surface waters since e coli and ent are traditional faecal indicator bacteria on the other hand viral indicators had significant correlations with picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria frna gii giii and pmmov are human specific faecal indicators which indicate that the concentrations of picoplankton picoheterotrophs and viruses were correlated with anthropogenic activities including sewage contamination viral indicators had better correlations with total viruses 0 247 r 0 563 compared to picoheterotrophs 0 207 r 0 505 and picoplankton 0 201 r 0 482 this might be due to the fact that total viruses share similar persistence and replication mode picoplankton and picoheterotrophs were associated with specific virus through virus host interaction by comparison since most viral indicators are bacteriophages they were correlated slightly better with picoheterotrophs than picoplankton interestingly picoplankton picoheterotrophs and viruses had pronounced correlations with frna gii 0 343 r 0 405 and frna giii 0 247 r 0 563 but not for frna gi and frna giv p 0 05 generally frna gii giii are human specific indicators and frna gi giv are animal specific indicators in particular their human and animal specificity were reported in singapore urbanized catchments previously frna gii showed higher correlations with the majority of the enteric viruses followed by frna giii while frna gi frna giv were detected exclusively in animal faeces vergara et al 2015 accordingly the results indicated that the impact of human activities would outweigh the animal activities in influencing the overall quantification and distribution of pico microbial targets meanwhile higher positive detection frequency and human specific sensitivity of frna gii resulted in greater correlation coefficients than frna giii vergara et al 2015 in addition pmmov a plant pathogenic virus which has exhibited particular human specificity in human faeces rosario et al 2009 zhang et al 2005 correlated well with pico microbial targets 0 482 r 0 563 in a recent study pmmov was found to be associated with anthropogenic activities in terms of land use assessment in singapore urbanized watersheds on the whole associations between pico microbial targets and viral indicators suggested that anthropogenic inputs and land use patterns could augment the presence and concentrations of pico microbial targets in aquatic environments 3 5 implications on fcm as a tool for monitoring microorganisms cyanobacterial blooms are the cause for water quality concerns due to their potential to produce bioactive compounds known as secondary metabolites in the form of toxins and off flavours thus rapid and accurate detection of cyanobacteria concentration is extremely important in providing early warning to prevent the occurrence of potentially hazardous conditions recently many fluorescent sensor systems have been developed for the real time detection of cyanobacteria based on the direct measurement of the fluorescence of chl a and pc in spite of advances accurate and sensitive quantification of cyanobacteria is still problematic as the chl a and pc contents can vary significantly among different species and physiological states fcm is one of the most promising alternatives for monitoring single celled cyanobacteria particularly picocyanobacteria as they are much more abundant than the micro and macro planktonic cyanobacteria and are thought to be responsible for up to 75 of primary production in aquatic environments pittera et al 2017 steitz and velimirov 1999 it is noteworthy however that fcm may not be able to analyze certain cyanobacteria such as filamentous cyanobacteria this is because the filamentous cyanobacteria have different trichome lengths which light scattering cannot distinguish and the upper size limit of most fcm is typically 30 150 μm cellamare et al 2010 nevertheless in this study the mean percentages of picocyanobacteria out of the total picoplankton are 17 1 and 0 7 in reservoirs and catchments and 11 2 5 6 and 24 80 in urban agriculture and parkland dominated areas respectively which are very close to the percentage of cyanobacteria in total bacteria from our 16s rrna amplicon sequencing results reservoirs 10 74 catchments 7 55 urban 3 27 agriculture 12 59 and parkland dominated areas 13 7 our results further validate that fcm is preferred for routine picocyanobacteria monitoring and could be adapted to provide an early cyanobacterial warning system viruses constitute the most abundant and dynamic form of life in global aquatic ecosystems however their abundance and importance in aquatic environments have been underestimated for many years although different methodologies e g epifluorescence microscopy and fcm can lead to different results the concentrations of marine viruses is well recognized to range from 106 counts ml in the deep sea to 108 counts ml in productive coastal waters and does not vary strongly over time suttle 2005 in freshwater ecosystems however the virus abundance could be as high as 1010 counts ml brown et al 2015 and be considerably impacted by many natural disturbances i e strong winds and torrential rain the abundance of total viruses was found to be linked with rainfall and storm events in temperate lakes hewson et al 2012 mohiuddin and schellhorn 2015 and followed seasonal variations in subtropical regions tseng et al 2013 in this study however the mean concentrations of viruses heterotrophs and phytoplankton of different reservoirs in different months were similar p 0 05 table s9 probably because singapore is a typical tropical city with little month to month climate variation throughout the year although experiencing dry and wet seasons further examination showed that there was no significant difference between concentrations of viruses heterotrophs and phytoplankton in monsoon and inter monsoon seasons p 0 05 table s8 however there are limitations in fcm especially for small viruses 20 30 nm and plant viruses with rod shapes at this size range of 20 30 nm the wavelengths of light used in fcm are larger than the minimal levels of light scattering from particles bonar and tilton 2017 and hence there will likely be poor resolution of these very small particles pronounced relationships could be found between the following pairs viruses and heterotrophs and viruses and autotrophs viruses can influence the heterotrophs or autotrophs through lytic or lysogenic processes directly or through the viral shunt indirectly in terms of nutrients the viral shunt is a virus mediated lysis of host cells to release dom and pom which can subsequently be utilized by the host cells hence viruses play a significant role in nutrient cycles in the aquatic environment jover et al 2014 in this study the virus to heterotrophic bacteria ratio varied from 1 1 to 1581 2 with a geometric mean of 18 4 in general higher geometric mean values of this ratio were observed in catchments 26 than in reservoirs 14 with a distinction between three land use patterns urban 18 agriculture 31 and parkland dominated areas 16 this virus to heterotrophic bacteria ratio could indicate their mutual interactions as driven by land use likewise a similar ratio termed as virus to bacteria ratio vbr ranged from 2 in the human gut to as high as 2750 in agricultural soil prussin et al 2015 williamson et al 2005 in our study the picoheterotroph population is likely to comprise a substantial portion of the total heterotrophic bacteria population and thus our virus to picoheterotroph ratio covered a large range similar to the reported vbr in previous literature 4 conclusions total viruses heterotrophic and autotrophic cells were impacted by reservoirs catchments and land use patterns high associations were found between the concentrations of overall water borne microbial organisms and specific microbial targets i e bacterial and viral indicators with anthropogenic modification of the land contributing significantly to the abundance of total viruses and bacteria the concentrations of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria correlated negatively with the concentrations of total viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs providing important insights into understanding tropical urban freshwater ecosystems acknowledgements

19156,this study aimed to examine the drivers in shaping the occurrence and distribution of total viruses and picoplankton in tropical freshwater ecosystems flow cytometry was used to quantify the concentrations of total viruses picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria three land use patterns urban agriculture and parkland dominated were evaluated using arcgis significant correlations were observed between water borne microbial targets and water quality parameters 0 175 r 0 441 nutrients 0 250 r 0 570 and land use factors 0 200 r 0 460 in particular the concentrations of total viruses and picoheterotrophic cells were higher in catchments whereas the abundances of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria were higher in reservoirs total viruses and picoplankton had higher concentrations in urban and agriculture dominated areas probably due to anthropogenic inputs and agricultural inputs respectively although surface water is a complex matrix influenced by niche based i e physicochemical properties nutrients land use impact etc and neutral based factors i e ecological drift dispersal and species land use patterns could help to elucidate the occurrence and distribution of the total microbial community at the macroscopic level meanwhile inter correlations among viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 715 r 0 990 also substantiates their mutual interactions in influencing the microbial community furthermore the relationships between total microbial cells and bacterial and viral indicators were also investigated concentrations of total viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs were positively correlated with bacterial indicators 0 427 r 0 590 and viral indicators 0 201 r 0 563 these results indicated that faecal and viral contamination could contribute to the numbers of total viruses and bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords viruses phytoplankton cyanobacteria flow cytometry occurrence 1 introduction viruses are the most numerically dominant microorganisms on earth with an estimated 1031 total viruses globally weitz and wilhelm 2012 they are thought to influence a number of processes ranging from nutrient and geochemical cycling to gene transfer microbial community dynamics and even evolution of organisms jacquet et al 2010 like viruses microbial cells play crucial roles in most geochemical cycles in the global ecosystem including organic matter transformation and nutrient cycling and their activity has a strong impact on ecosystem metabolism fuhrman et al 2015 autotrophic and heterotrophic cells are the two fundamental units in the ecosystem where the former can utilize light or chemical energy for food while the latter rely on other organisms for nutrition marcarelli et al 2011 phytoplankton also known as microalgae are the most numerous autotrophs and are thought to be responsible for half of the global primary production boyce et al 2010 many different kinds of phytoplankton have been described and among the most common ones are diatoms dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria tang and dobbs 2007 cyanobacteria blue green algae are photosynthetic bacteria which can be found all over the world and their blooms have severe impacts on aquatic ecosystems zanchett and oliveira 2013 given the importance of viruses microbial cells phytoplankton and cyanobacteria in the global ecosystem many studies have been conducted on the abundance and distribution of these microorganisms in environmental waters haller et al 2018 ng et al 2018 pan et al 2017 thomson et al 2010 woodhouse et al 2016 yet much about the occurrence of all these microorganisms remains a mystery the occurrence of total viruses autotrophic and heterotrophic cells in full scale freshwater ecosystems and possible factors which influence their distribution and prevalence remains largely unexplored microscopy and plate counting have been used as standard techniques for detection and quantification of microorganisms however both methods are very time consuming and could considerably underestimate the total number of viruses and cells in the aquatic environment as most of them are extremely small and inherently difficult or impossible to culture in recent decades many molecular approaches such as quantitative real time polymer chain reaction qpcr have been used for the rapid and accurate enumeration of target microorganisms in environmental samples including water sediment soil and sludge canfora et al 2016 goh et al 2017 yang et al 2017 however unlike the specific signature sequences for prokaryotes 16s rrna and eukaryotes 18s rrna viruses heterotrophs and phytoplankton communities lack universally conserved sequences for their entire population which severely limits the detection of whole groups of cells using the qpcr method bidle 2014 kang et al 2011 alternatively flow cytometry fcm has been used for environmental microbial analysis van nevel et al 2017 wang et al 2010 basically fcm is an automated technique which is able to rapidly up to 104 cells second measure the optical properties of cells suspended in liquid transport through beams of light fcm is well suited for the investigation of aquatic microorganisms as many of them are very small 2 μm and difficult to analyze by traditional methods furthermore all phytoplanktonic cells are naturally autofluorescent due to their photosynthetic pigments e g chlorophyll a chl a phycoerythrin pe and phycocyanin pc and hence they can be easily distinguished from each other by fcm gin et al 2003 in addition through the staining of nucleic acids with highly fluorescent dyes sybr green i ii sybr gold the abundance of microbial cells can be determined and quantified by fcm with high statistical confidence in recent years the application of highly fluorescent dyes coupled with high instrument sensitivity has enabled the detection and quantification of small virus like particles many factors are known to be able to shape the occurrence and distribution of viruses picoplankton in freshwater ecosystems over the past few decades however investigated factors were mainly limited to physicochemical factors and nutrients other important factors such as land use which is one of the key drivers in shaping the water borne microorganisms is still largely unexplored goh et al 2017 hassell et al 2017 in fact land use patterns is a vital indication of specific activities within those areas katsiapi et al 2012 many reported studies show that urban and agricultural land use can indicate anthropogenic pressure amos et al 2015 mattikalli and richards 1996 te et al 2017 using molecular methods such as qpcr and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing specific microbial populations and community structures of particular areas can be identified through these approaches for example the occurrence of viral e g norovirus gi gii adenovirus enterovirus rotavirus and hepatitis a virus and fecal indicator bacteria e g e coli and enterococci were found to be higher in urbanized areas caused by sewage contamination and domestic animal faeces corsi et al 2014 in addition the bacterial community structure was found to be impacted by land use gradients bowers et al 2011 liu et al 2014 for instance the richness and diversity of cyanobacteria communities were driven by intensive disturbance of urban and agricultural practice on yungui plateau china liao et al 2016 nevertheless the occurrence of viruses or bacterial communities driven by land use patterns is still not well investigated as qpcr only targets specific microorganisms without looking at the broader picture and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing is unable to quantify the microbial community fcm was employed in this study to address these gaps the aims of this study were to investigate the abundance of total viruses picoplankton picophytoplankton picoheterotroph and picocyanobacteria in singapore freshwater ecosystems by fcm and to explore the impacts of different factors including physicochemical factors nutrients and land use on their dynamics to the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study to investigate impacts of land use on water borne microbial aquatic communities in a highly urbanized tropical city such as singapore in addition relationships between these microbial communities with bacterial and viral indicators were also highlighted the results from this study would be useful in understanding freshwater ecosystems comprehensively and in managing water quality of water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and land use analysis this study was conducted in singapore an island country in southeast asia with an average annual rainfall of 2200 mm a land area of 719 1 km2 and a population of 5 61 million people in 2017 department of statistics singapore 2017 all the sampling sites and land use categories were mapped with arcgis 10 3 1 esri redlands ca usa land use shape files were obtained from the singapore land authority pub singapore s national water agency and the land use subcategories were defined by the singapore urban redevelopment authority however to reduce the number of parameters in this study subcategories were merged into 5 categories i residential ii urban iii green iv agricultural and v water body four different map layers were used in this study i catchment land use shape files ii river land use shape files iii sub catchment land use shape files and iv drain line maps wgs 1984 web mercator auxiliary sphere and gcs wgs 1984 svy21 singapore were used as the projection coordinate system and the geographic coordinate system respectively the land covering percentage area of each sampling point was calculated based on the drains flowing into the sampling sites however if no drain flows directly the effect of land use was estimated using a 2 km buffer around the site to reduce the parameter numbers the land use weightage which is the combination of different land use categories was calculated to calculate the weightage numbers 1 2 3 4 were assigned to green agriculture urban and residential respectively details of land use categories were provided in table s1 the final weightage number was calculated based on the contribution of each land use category to each sampling site 2 2 sample collection and measurement of physical chemical parameters a total of 143 water samples were collected from 7 reservoirs r1 r7 and 3 upstream catchments t1 t3 between nov 2014 and feb 2017 to be specific the sampling time included the northeast monsoon dec 2014 jan 2015 dec 2015 dec 2016 southwest monsoon july 2015 aug 2015 aug 2016 inter monsoon mar 2015 apr 2015 oct 2015 oct 2016 feb 2017 ten sampling points in reservoirs and nine sampling points in catchments were surveyed only r1 3 had their corresponding tributary sampling points flowing through the reservoirs table s2 lists the land use percentage for the 7 reservoirs and 3 upstream catchments to better assess land use impacts the sampling sites were classified into three main categories a urbanized areas b agricultural areas and c parkland areas sites 1 2 and 4 were urbanized areas with more than 60 residential and urban areas site 3 was the only sampling location with a reasonable percentage of agriculture area and thus was regarded as agricultural area sites 5 and 7 were parkland areas with more than 95 green areas although site 6 took 80 residential and urban areas it was also regarded as a parkland area in this study as there was no drain directly flowing to the reservoir and the possibility that urbanized land use impacted on the reservoirs was small fig s1 physicochemical parameters including temperature ph conductivity salinity turbidity dissolved oxygen do and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ using the hi9828 multiparameter meter hanna instruments usa other water quality parameters including total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured according to the american public health association apha standard methods 2 3 flow cytometry analysis flow cytometry was performed using a cytoflex flow cytometer beckman coulter inc ca usa all the freshwater samples were pretreated and analyzed as described earlier brown et al 2015 gin et al 2003 payet et al 2014 briefly for virus enumeration 500 μl samples were diluted from 1 1 to 1 100 in te buffer 10 mm tris 1 mm edta ph 8 0 and stained with sybr gold thermo fisher scientific usa for 15 min in the dark at 80 c the samples a 50 μl volume fraction of the 500 μl sample were analyzed at a rate of 10 μl min and the discriminator was set on green fluorescence fig s2a for total picoplankton enumeration samples were stained with sybr gold for 15 min in the dark at room temperature the discriminator was set on green fluorescence fig s2b and samples 50 μl were analyzed at a rate of 60 μl min for picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria enumerations the discriminators were set on red fig s2c and orange fluorescence fig s2d respectively 0 5 μm and 1 0 μm fluospheres microsphere beads thermo fisher scientific inc usa were added to each virus and picoplankton samples respectively for absolute counting the concentrations of viruses and picoplankton in original samples were calculated by the following formula concentration of cells viruses cells viruses events number beads events number beads concentration dilution factor 2 4 quantification for bacterial and viral indicators for quantification of e coli enterococcus ent and pseudomonas colilert 18 enterolert and pseudalert idexx laboratories inc usa were used media powder was mixed with a volume of 100 ml of raw water sample and 10 fold serially diluted before pouring into a multi well tray quanti tray 2000 colilert 18 and pseudalert samples were incubated at 35 c for 18 and 24 h while enterolert samples were incubated at 41 c for 24 h the presence of fluorescence in individual well was visualized under long wave ultraviolet light 365 nm the concentration was calculated by the most probable number mpn table provided and the diluter factor for quantification of total coliphage f and somatic coliphage single agar layer plaque assay method was used as described by vergara et al 2015 for quantification of viral indicators pmmov frna gii f rna giii water samples were collected in sterilized carboys and concentrated using hollow fiber ultrafiltration fresenius medical care germany to obtain a final volume of 600 ml primary concentrate si a fig s3 viral nucleic acids were extracted from secondary concentration using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit si b qiagen germany basically peg precipitation chloroform treatment and amicon ultrafiltration were applied to further concentrate viral particles the extracted viral nucleic acids were reversed transcribed using the improm ii reverse transcription system promega usa the forward and reverse primers and probe were listed in table s3 duplicate rt qpcr reactions were performed in a steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems usa using faststart universal probe master rox roche germany following miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 the standard curve had r2 range of 0 985 0 99 and detection limits for pmmov frna gii and frna giii were 80 gc l table s4 2 5 statistical data analysis statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss 23 ibm portsmouth uk the mann whitney u test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in the concentrations of microbial targets for reservoirs and catchments the kruskal wallis test was used to determine if the concentrations of microbial targets were significantly different across all sites spearman s rho correlation was performed among the microbial targets environmental parameters and land use percentage three levels of correlation were determined by correlation coefficients weak r 0 3 moderate 0 3 r 0 5 and strong r 0 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of viruses picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria higher concentrations of viruses and picoplankton were present in the catchments than in reservoirs fig 1 a table s5 this might be because more viruses could be absorbed in the sediment matrix in catchments the concentrations of total viruses and picoplankton in the 3 reservoirs and their catchments and their respective means medians 5th and 95th percentiles and outliers are shown in fig 1b among all the samples the lowest mean concentrations of viruses and picoplankton were detected in reservoirs r2 3 4 107 counts ml and r1 2 7 106 counts ml while the highest mean concentrations were detected in tributaries t2 3 1 108 counts ml and t1 1 5 107 counts ml respectively the concentrations of viruses and picoplankton varied between reservoirs and catchments and different land use patterns both 1 and 2 are urban dominated areas while 3 is an agriculture dominated area the concentrations of viruses and picoplankton in reservoirs were significantly lower than in their catchments p 0 01 mann whitney test while the difference in the mean of virus to picoplankton ratios in both reservoirs and catchments was not significant p 0 01 mann whitney test indicating that the abundance of viruses could be associated with their host density since the phytoplankton are the autotrophic components of the plankton community the concentrations of their counterpart picoheterotrophs could be estimated from the difference between the two table s5 the concentrations of picoheterotrophs were quite stable over the different reservoirs and catchments ranging from 106 to 107 counts ml fig 2 a and b however the concentrations of picophytoplankton in catchments were lower by 1 2 orders of magnitude than those in reservoirs p 0 01 kruskal wallis test picophytoplankton refers to picoeukaryotes and picocyanobacteria similarly the concentration differences of picocyanobacteria in catchments and reservoirs were also significant p 0 01 mann whitney test catchment t2 showed the lowest autotroph concentration picophytoplankton 2 3 104 counts ml and picocyanobacteria 2 1 104 counts ml while reservoir r2 showed the highest amount picophytoplankton 6 4 105 counts ml and picocyanobacteria 5 8 105 counts ml these concentration differences may be due to high washout losses of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria and low residence time in the catchments especially during the monsoon season interestingly the concentrations of viruses picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria in catchments showed greater variations likely caused by different land usage patterns and more dynamic fluctuations in ph temperature flow rate turbidity and other water quality parameters were observed in the catchments than in the reservoirs 3 2 impact of land use on the occurrence of viruses picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria in order to investigate human impacts on the structure and function of reservoir ecosystems in singapore the abundance of viruses and different picoplankton were grouped into 3 types urban agriculture and parkland according to their dominant land use types as mentioned in section 2 2 fig 3 a and b the mean concentrations of viruses and picoplankton in urban agriculture and parkland dominated land use were 4 0 107 counts ml and 2 9 106 counts ml 1 2 108 counts ml and 4 6 106 counts ml 1 5 107 counts ml and 1 4 106 counts ml respectively similarly the lowest mean concentrations of picoheterotrophs and picophytoplankton were detected in parkland dominated area while relatively higher concentrations were measured in urban and agriculture dominated reservoirs table s6 the mean concentrations of picocyanobacteria in urban agriculture and parkland dominated land use were 2 8 105 counts ml 2 7 105 counts ml and 1 5 105 counts ml accounting for about 88 1 84 7 and 82 5 of the picophytoplankton amount respectively the higher abundance of all types of cells in agriculture dominated reservoirs than other areas is probably because of the higher concentrations of n p and lower n p mass ratio which are suitable for cells to grow katsiapi et al 2012 paerl et al 2016 other human activities could also contribute to nutrient pollution to further examine the land use impacts on the distribution of different pico microbial targets spearman s rank correlations were performed among pico microbial targets and different percentage of land use areas at each sampling site table 1 viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs positively correlated p 0 01 with the percentage of residential areas 0 326 r 0 383 urban areas 0 323 r 0 418 but negatively correlated with the percentage of green areas 0 455 r 0 395 these results suggested that viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs were correlated with land use patterns and anthropogenic activities different land use patterns were characterized by specific physicochemical properties and nutrients in this study the urban and residential land were highly positively correlated with nitrogen and phosphorus whereas green areas were negatively correlated with nutrients table s7 the lack of correlations between the percentage of agriculture areas and concentrations of nutrients is attributed to the fact that the variation of nutrient concentrations in agricultural areas across different sampling locations is within a relatively small range during our sampling period nonetheless concentrations of nutrients are still high in agriculture areas in short urban residential and agricultural areas were the main sources of nutrient input for local freshwater ecosystems factors in shaping the microbial communities have been investigated in various aquatic environments for instance a recent study conducted in singapore urbanized catchments reported positive correlations between specific species e g e coli ent and alternative faecal indicators and turbidity do conductivity and nutrients liang et al 2015 however this study was limited to specific targets and did not explore the land use factors in contrast in this study we expanded this to include different land use patterns and found that the latter influenced the distribution of microbial targets strongly in another case land use in catchments contributed little to the variation of cyanobacterial diversity in danish lakes özkan et al 2013 as opposed to this study although the geometric concentrations of picocyanobacteria in both catchments were low our study showed that urbanized catchments were significantly lower than those in agricultural catchments p 0 05 as mentioned earlier this may be due to the relatively high p concentration and low n p mass ratio in agricultural areas these results are consistent with previous studies of cyanobacteria investigated in different water shed land use types which also showed that p was the limiting nutrient beaver et al 2014 katsiapi et al 2012 3 3 relationships between viruses picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton picocyanobacteria concentrations and water quality parameters among the pico microbial targets and nutrients tn showed the strongest positive correlations with viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 534 r 0 570 followed by ammonia 0 426 r 0 466 and tp 0 446 r 0 462 as expected nutrients are key sources for picoplankton and picoheterotrophs to grow in this study picoheterotrophs are largely heterotrophic bacteria that can biodegrade dissolved organic matter dom and particulate organic matter pom into inorganic nutrients azam and malfatti 2007 which explains the positive correlations between picoheterotrophs and nutrients the positive correlations between viruses and nutrients could be attributed to lytic processes specifically viruses lyse bacteria and release their cell contents particulate and dissolved organic matter into aquatic environments which could then be utilized by uninfected bacteria where bacteria growth is stimulated shelford et al 2012 it was confirmed in experiments that virus replete samples increased the ammonium concentration compared to virus free samples shelford et al 2012 our results also suggest that viruses are important players in nutrient cycling in aquatic environments in terms of the physiochemical parameters turbidity had moderate positive correlations with viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 371 r 0 441 consistent with greater cell growth resulting in increased turbidity hammes et al 2008 in addition weak correlations were observed with conductivity total dissolved solids tds salinity and dissolved oxygen do conductivity measures the amount of ions that can be derived from mineral dissolution and atmospheric deposition tds which represents the concentrations of inorganic salts organic matter and other dissolved materials in water can provide suitable media containing supportive nutrients for cells to grow narkis et al 1995 salinity regulates the osmotic pressure of microbial cells and alter their ability to uptake dissolved organic carbon compounds liu et al 2011 do is involved in cell metabolic pathways since it measures electron acceptor availability berdjeb et al 2011 weak correlations could be due to the pooled datasets as different associations among microbial targets and water quality parameters were observed for different sampling sites the concentrations of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria were correlated negatively with the concentrations of viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 365 r 0 262 picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria also showed negative correlations with nutrients turbidity conductivity tds salinity and positive correlations with do which exhibited reverse correlation coefficients with water quality parameters compared to viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs using pooled datasets table 2 picophytoplankton are known to be ubiquitous and able to thrive in a wide trophic range from hyperoligotrophy to hypereutrophy weisse 1993 this might be attributed to their tiny cell sizes which require lower maintenance energy but enable faster nutrient uptake through diffusion due to higher surface area to volume ratio generally earlier studies showed that the abundance of picophytoplankton increased with an increase in nutrient availability however their contribution to the total phytoplankton relative abundance decreased when water became more eutrophic as other larger algae out competed picophytoplankton callieri et al 2012 negative correlations between picophytoplankton and nutrients found in this study was likely due to the dominance of eukaryotic phytoplankton with physiological advantages that can proliferate rapidly under nutrient rich environment therefore surpassing the growth of picophytoplankton gin et al 1999 2003 stockner 1991 a strong positive correlation was observed between picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria r 0 988 as picocyanobacteria are the major component among picophytoplankton in our samples regardless of different locations comprising 85 3 in reservoirs and 86 8 in catchments among viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs picoheterotrophs correlated well with picoplankton r 0 99 on average 88 59 of the picoplankton belonged to picoheterotrophs as a result the distribution and behavior of picoheterotrophs largely influenced the dynamics of picoplankton in surface waters viruses correlated well with picoheterotrophs and picoplankton with r values of 0 724 and 0 715 respectively it is well known that the majority of the virome are found to be bacteriophage in aquatic environments breitbart and rohwer 2005 which can explain the strong correlation coefficients observed the data further suggested that picoheterotrophs was a primary food source for these viruses by lytic infection 3 4 relationships between viruses picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton picocyanobacteria concentrations and bacterial indicators and viral indicators the concentrations of several bacterial indicators i e ent e coli pseudomonas and viral indicators i e total coliphage f coliphage somatic coliphage frna gi giv and pmmov were measured and quantified in the previous studies liang et al 2015 vergara et al 2015 spearman s rank correlations were performed to examine the associations between pico microbial targets and specific viral and bacterial indicators bacterial indicators correlated well with viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs 0 427 r 0 590 although they were responsible for only a small percentage of the total bacteria table 3 by comparison specific bacterial indicators had slightly better correlations with picoheterotrophs 0 450 r 0 500 compared to total picoplankton 0 427 r 0 482 this is not surprising as ent e coli and p aeruginosa belong to heterotrophic bacteria and they share similar energy utilization sources picoplankton contained autotrophic cells with contrasting behavior and consequently decreased the associations between ent e coli and p aeruginosa overall these results suggested that faecal contamination could contribute to the abundance of picoplankton picoheterotrophs in surface waters since e coli and ent are traditional faecal indicator bacteria on the other hand viral indicators had significant correlations with picoplankton picoheterotrophs picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria frna gii giii and pmmov are human specific faecal indicators which indicate that the concentrations of picoplankton picoheterotrophs and viruses were correlated with anthropogenic activities including sewage contamination viral indicators had better correlations with total viruses 0 247 r 0 563 compared to picoheterotrophs 0 207 r 0 505 and picoplankton 0 201 r 0 482 this might be due to the fact that total viruses share similar persistence and replication mode picoplankton and picoheterotrophs were associated with specific virus through virus host interaction by comparison since most viral indicators are bacteriophages they were correlated slightly better with picoheterotrophs than picoplankton interestingly picoplankton picoheterotrophs and viruses had pronounced correlations with frna gii 0 343 r 0 405 and frna giii 0 247 r 0 563 but not for frna gi and frna giv p 0 05 generally frna gii giii are human specific indicators and frna gi giv are animal specific indicators in particular their human and animal specificity were reported in singapore urbanized catchments previously frna gii showed higher correlations with the majority of the enteric viruses followed by frna giii while frna gi frna giv were detected exclusively in animal faeces vergara et al 2015 accordingly the results indicated that the impact of human activities would outweigh the animal activities in influencing the overall quantification and distribution of pico microbial targets meanwhile higher positive detection frequency and human specific sensitivity of frna gii resulted in greater correlation coefficients than frna giii vergara et al 2015 in addition pmmov a plant pathogenic virus which has exhibited particular human specificity in human faeces rosario et al 2009 zhang et al 2005 correlated well with pico microbial targets 0 482 r 0 563 in a recent study pmmov was found to be associated with anthropogenic activities in terms of land use assessment in singapore urbanized watersheds on the whole associations between pico microbial targets and viral indicators suggested that anthropogenic inputs and land use patterns could augment the presence and concentrations of pico microbial targets in aquatic environments 3 5 implications on fcm as a tool for monitoring microorganisms cyanobacterial blooms are the cause for water quality concerns due to their potential to produce bioactive compounds known as secondary metabolites in the form of toxins and off flavours thus rapid and accurate detection of cyanobacteria concentration is extremely important in providing early warning to prevent the occurrence of potentially hazardous conditions recently many fluorescent sensor systems have been developed for the real time detection of cyanobacteria based on the direct measurement of the fluorescence of chl a and pc in spite of advances accurate and sensitive quantification of cyanobacteria is still problematic as the chl a and pc contents can vary significantly among different species and physiological states fcm is one of the most promising alternatives for monitoring single celled cyanobacteria particularly picocyanobacteria as they are much more abundant than the micro and macro planktonic cyanobacteria and are thought to be responsible for up to 75 of primary production in aquatic environments pittera et al 2017 steitz and velimirov 1999 it is noteworthy however that fcm may not be able to analyze certain cyanobacteria such as filamentous cyanobacteria this is because the filamentous cyanobacteria have different trichome lengths which light scattering cannot distinguish and the upper size limit of most fcm is typically 30 150 μm cellamare et al 2010 nevertheless in this study the mean percentages of picocyanobacteria out of the total picoplankton are 17 1 and 0 7 in reservoirs and catchments and 11 2 5 6 and 24 80 in urban agriculture and parkland dominated areas respectively which are very close to the percentage of cyanobacteria in total bacteria from our 16s rrna amplicon sequencing results reservoirs 10 74 catchments 7 55 urban 3 27 agriculture 12 59 and parkland dominated areas 13 7 our results further validate that fcm is preferred for routine picocyanobacteria monitoring and could be adapted to provide an early cyanobacterial warning system viruses constitute the most abundant and dynamic form of life in global aquatic ecosystems however their abundance and importance in aquatic environments have been underestimated for many years although different methodologies e g epifluorescence microscopy and fcm can lead to different results the concentrations of marine viruses is well recognized to range from 106 counts ml in the deep sea to 108 counts ml in productive coastal waters and does not vary strongly over time suttle 2005 in freshwater ecosystems however the virus abundance could be as high as 1010 counts ml brown et al 2015 and be considerably impacted by many natural disturbances i e strong winds and torrential rain the abundance of total viruses was found to be linked with rainfall and storm events in temperate lakes hewson et al 2012 mohiuddin and schellhorn 2015 and followed seasonal variations in subtropical regions tseng et al 2013 in this study however the mean concentrations of viruses heterotrophs and phytoplankton of different reservoirs in different months were similar p 0 05 table s9 probably because singapore is a typical tropical city with little month to month climate variation throughout the year although experiencing dry and wet seasons further examination showed that there was no significant difference between concentrations of viruses heterotrophs and phytoplankton in monsoon and inter monsoon seasons p 0 05 table s8 however there are limitations in fcm especially for small viruses 20 30 nm and plant viruses with rod shapes at this size range of 20 30 nm the wavelengths of light used in fcm are larger than the minimal levels of light scattering from particles bonar and tilton 2017 and hence there will likely be poor resolution of these very small particles pronounced relationships could be found between the following pairs viruses and heterotrophs and viruses and autotrophs viruses can influence the heterotrophs or autotrophs through lytic or lysogenic processes directly or through the viral shunt indirectly in terms of nutrients the viral shunt is a virus mediated lysis of host cells to release dom and pom which can subsequently be utilized by the host cells hence viruses play a significant role in nutrient cycles in the aquatic environment jover et al 2014 in this study the virus to heterotrophic bacteria ratio varied from 1 1 to 1581 2 with a geometric mean of 18 4 in general higher geometric mean values of this ratio were observed in catchments 26 than in reservoirs 14 with a distinction between three land use patterns urban 18 agriculture 31 and parkland dominated areas 16 this virus to heterotrophic bacteria ratio could indicate their mutual interactions as driven by land use likewise a similar ratio termed as virus to bacteria ratio vbr ranged from 2 in the human gut to as high as 2750 in agricultural soil prussin et al 2015 williamson et al 2005 in our study the picoheterotroph population is likely to comprise a substantial portion of the total heterotrophic bacteria population and thus our virus to picoheterotroph ratio covered a large range similar to the reported vbr in previous literature 4 conclusions total viruses heterotrophic and autotrophic cells were impacted by reservoirs catchments and land use patterns high associations were found between the concentrations of overall water borne microbial organisms and specific microbial targets i e bacterial and viral indicators with anthropogenic modification of the land contributing significantly to the abundance of total viruses and bacteria the concentrations of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria correlated negatively with the concentrations of total viruses picoplankton and picoheterotrophs providing important insights into understanding tropical urban freshwater ecosystems acknowledgements

19157,microbial communities are the main drivers of biogeochemical cycling of multiple elements sustaining life in the ocean the rapidity of their response to stressors and abrupt environmental changes implies that even fast and infrequent events can affect local transformations of organic matter and nutrients modern molecular techniques now allow for monitoring of microbial activities and functions in the environment through the analysis of genes and expressed genes contained in natural microbial assemblages however messenger rna turnover in cells can be as short as 30 seconds and stability varies greatly between transcripts sampling of in situ communities involves an inevitable delay between the collection of seawater and the extraction of its rna leaving the bacterial communities plenty of time to alter their gene expression the characteristics of microbial rna turnover make time series very difficult because samples need to be processed immediately to limit alterations to the metatranscriptomes to address these challenges we designed an autonomous in situ fixation multi sampler afissys for the reliable sampling of microbial metatranscriptomes at frequent intervals for refined temporal resolution to advance the development of this instrument we examined the minimal seawater volume necessary for adequate coverage of community gene expression and the suitability of phenol ethanol fixation for immediate and long term preservation of transcripts from a microbial community we then evaluated the field eligibility of the instrument itself with two case studies in a brackish system afissys is able to collect fix and store water samples independently at a predefined temporal resolution phenol ethanol fixation can conserve metatranscriptomes directly in the environment for up to a week for later analysis in the laboratory thus the afissys constitutes an invaluable tool for the integration of molecular functional analyses in environmental monitoring in brackish waters and in aquatic environments in general graphical abstract image 1 keywords afissys in situ fixation metatranscriptomics rna sampling gene expression 1 introduction microbial communities play a major role in global biogeochemical fluxes through their metabolic processes and interactions with each other and the environment suttle 2007 falkowski et al 2008 fuhrman et al 2015 rapid responses to changing environmental conditions either by the emergence of underlying populations or by the phenotypic plasticity of established organisms confer a strong ecological advantage to microbial communities biogeochemical processes and corresponding in situ community functional dynamics are increasingly investigated through functional gene expression the sequencing of whole community messenger rna using next generation high throughput methods provides a snapshot of the expressed natural microbial functions as this direct approach does not require any incubation of the community contrary to rate measurements or stable isotope incorporation experiments it reduces the risk of modifying the cellular processes occurring in situ massana et al 2001 kim et al 2011 most of the early challenges of microbial metatranscriptomics have been methodologically resolved such as the selective removal of ribosomal rna prior to sequencing gilbert et al 2008 to enrich messenger rna however the highly unstable nature of rna belasco and brawerman 1993 hui et al 2014 remains problematic gallego romero et al 2014 modifications in gene expression patterns can be orchestrated by the disappearance of transcripts due to degradation and or the synthesis of new transcripts bandyra and luisi 2013 during and after sampling as cells rapidly adjust their physiology in response to stress and new surrounding conditions e g temperature pressure or light progressing technologies of high throughput sequencing have favoured an increasing amount of in depth comprehensive metatranscriptomic investigations which have revealed the risk for bias related to sampling and processing of biomass as suspected in earlier studies frias lopez et al 2008 gilbert et al 2008 poretsky et al 2009 the inevitable delay of minutes to hours between collection of seawater and flash freezing or chemical preservation of filters combined with the stress of the filtration step can overrule the signal of in situ processes feike et al 2012 wurzbacher et al 2012 the risk of inducing biases in metatranscriptomes is particularly pronounced when the in situ conditions differ substantially from the conditions during sample collection and filtration particularly for microbial communities from deep ocean habitats taylor et al 2015 edgcomb et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 or from strong vertical chemical gradients such as the redox zones found in the baltic sea feike et al 2012 the black sea marschall et al 2010 or saanich inlet zaikova et al 2010 to sample such environments and to facilitate high resolution time series pioneering studies have invented novel instruments for collection of nucleic acids for example the autonomous microbial genosensor fries et al 2007 the maclane remote access sampler winslow et al 2014 the environmental sample processor ottesen et al 2011 and the fixation filter device 3 taylor et al 2015 carry out automated underwater in situ filtration after which filters are submerged in a fixative such as sucrose lysis buffer or rnalater using a novel approach feike et al 2012 developed an automatic flow injection sampler afis for in situ fixation of seawater at the time of sample collection this sampling strategy limits biases in the metatranscriptomes induced by stress on microbial cells such as the up regulation of reca expression that overwrites the in situ expression patterns of environmentally relevant genes feike et al 2012 furthermore as fixation is conducted before filtration the afis avoids artefacts attributable to the pressure exerted during the filtration step ferguson et al 1984 which have yet to be systematically evaluated stewart 2013 following the success of the afis we have developed an automated multi sampler system afissys to fix liquid samples in situ for offshore temporal investigations of microbial functional dynamics the usefulness of such a multi sampler is necessarily contingent on a number of constraints to examine these we conducted an experiment on a natural marine microbial community to determine the effects of volume and time exposed to fixative on the integrity of microbial metatranscriptomes in order to maximise the number of individual samplers to be appended onto the physical support one must minimize their volume as much as possible our first objective therefore was to investigate whether a representative metatranscriptome could be obtained from a volume smaller than normally used for metatranscriptomics from the baltic sea traditionally fixation pertains to the preservation of cell or tissue morphology for microscopy lovejoy et al 1993 kiernan 2000 or histopathology milcheva et al 2013 and relies on aldehyde based fixatives which do not provide optimal rna yields goldsworthy et al 1999 cox et al 2006 most studies concerning nucleic acid preservation have focused on rna integrity dotti et al 2010 camacho sanchez et al 2013 groelz et al 2013 or specific genes targeted by qpcr páska et al 2004 dotti et al 2010 feike et al 2012 wurzbacher et al 2012 and microarrays vincek et al 2003 howat and wilson 2014 few studies have investigated the effects of fixatives on whole genome gene expression patterns using high throughput mrna sequencing kruse et al 2017 a surprising result from one such study suggests that the traditional and frequently used rna stabilising agent rnalater weber et al 2010 taylor et al 2015 is unable to prevent a transcriptional response in plant tissue during the time it takes for the fixative to penetrate the cells kruse et al 2017 in this regard little is known about the temporal effects of 10 stop solution a phenol ethanol fixative used successfully with the afis sampler feike et al 2012 on the stability of microbial metatranscriptomes the long term preservation of gene expression is crucial for the operation of autonomous offshore samplers despite the advantages of fixation knowledge on the effects of chemical preservation on transcript molecules in cells is still limited fukatsu 1999 vincek et al 2003 eichler et al 2004 we sought to ensure that the fixative could irreversibly fix community transcriptomes without causing chemical degradation of the fragile mrna molecules over the course of one week subsequently illumina rna sequencing of metatranscriptomes was conducted on a selection of experimental treatments to evaluate the stability of gene expression profiles in preserved environmental microbial community samples based on the results of long term fixation and volume analyses the afissys was developed and two prototype versions were tested in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 choice and use of fixatives the stop solution 5 phenol ph 4 3 95 pure ethanol used at a 10 volume to sample

ball casing fig 1 a and b and a protective cover cylinder fig 1c when the cover is closed tight over the chamber fig 1d the unit can be filled with a sterile liquid before the operation and avoids any biological activities inside the sampler this sterile set up allows the collection of pristine samples even after a prolonged immersion in the environment mechanical rotation of the spherical chamber to a 90 position moves the protective cover laterally and opens the chamber for inflow of the seawater an additional 90 step of the ball seals the chamber opens the injection valve and simultaneously slides the protective cylinder back into its original position after pumping the fixative into the chamber the injection valve is closed to completely seal the sample for storage briefly the closing and opening of the sampling ball is driven by a spring loaded mechanism fig 1e and f before the sampling takes place the spring must be loaded by hand by turning the chamber housing 180 counterclockwise the housing catches a release pin each 90 during the sampling process an actuator fig 2 a releases these pins and allows the outer housing to turn back as the inner sampling ball stays in place inside the spherical chamber the thin injection nozzle extends some millimeters into the sample volume fig 2b a couple of tiny injection holes allow immediate dispersion of the injected fixative in all directions the turbulence and speed of each injection stroke creates a mixing motion in geometrical interaction with the inner forms of the sampling ball a medical grade ceramic piston pump delivers the injection volume of 1 4 ml per stroke 2 6 comparisons of afissys afis and free flow bottles along a diurnal cycle as an initial trial of the afissys instrument we conducted a diurnal in situ sampling campaign with the first non automated prototype from the pier of the rostock baltic divers baltic taucherei und bergungsbetrieb rostock gmbh this pier 54 11154n 12 09222e extends into a region of the warnow river germany frequently influenced by the baltic sea alongside the afissys we sampled with the afis feike et al 2012 and a manually triggered standalone free flow bottle hydrobios for nine time points samples were collected 1 m apart from each other every third hour starting at 15 30 eastern standard time afis and free flow samples were immediately aliquoted into 250 ml subsamples a volume comparable to that collected by afissys then 0 2 μm filtered and flash frozen this processing took less than 20 min the afissys prototype remained underwater for six hours until the third constitutive sample was collected after which all three modules were recovered and the fixed 250 ml samples were 0 2 μm filtered and flash frozen before rewinding and submerging the afissys prototype for the next time points rna was extracted as described above and after removal of ribosomal rna was sequenced on nextseq illumina 2 150bp at lgc genomics gmbh due to costs

final afissys prototype in january 2017 from the same site in the warnow river physical and chemical data was collected with a sbe37 microcat ctp recorder sea bird scientific left submerged for the duration of the trial the afissys platforms were composed of six individual sample modules fixed to a support base metal spring and control panel motor rotation ramp injection rail and tubing fig 3 the objective of the in situ application of the afissys was to determine its capacity to conduct high resolution ship independent autonomous triggered in situ fixation sampling the two platforms were programmed through ocean lab 3 hydro bios kiel germany for a weeklong autonomous sampling to collect water twice a day four hours after sunrise and four hours after sunset the afissys1 platform sampled every day at 13 00 while afissys2 sampled at 20 00 eastern standard time respectively in addition after each evening sample was collected the two platforms were lowered by 16 5 cm ensuring that the next sampling chambers were positioned at the same depth as the previous sample in parallel to the samples collected autonomously by the afissys platforms reference samples were collected at the same time points with a free flow bottle lowered next to the afissys at the programmed sampling time these unfixed reference samples were filtered onsite immediately the 2l sample was split into subsamples of 250 ml corresponding to the volume of the afissys sample chamber filters were flash frozen within 15 minutes of water collection 2 8 accession numbers raw reads from this study have been

metatranscriptomics analyses the rna sequencing of ss10 t0 t12 t24 t192 and natural seawater replicates provided approximately 25 million reads per sample resulting in an average of 1 8 million reads

supp fig s1 indicated a low level of degradation of the messenger molecules within the samples despite storage time in fixative the megahit de novo assembly resulted in 313 954 contigs and the proportion of reads that successfully mapped to the contigs remained constant over time with approximately 70 of the total cleaned reads per sample hierarchical clustering with bray curtis dissimilarity fig 4 based on rpkm gene counts grouped the replicate samples for the same time fixative treatments indicating reproducibility of the results taxonomic annotation of functional genes revealed a natural microbial community dominated by eukaryote reads which represented 40 of the reads while bacterial reads constituted 20 25 of the reads and the rest mapped to unclassified sequences fig s2 the bacterial community was dominated by proteobacteria 10 12 of total reads and bacteroidetes 5 7 of total reads while actinobacteria cyanobacteria firmicutes chlamydiae and planctomycetes together constituted less than 1 of the total reads fig s3 haptophytes 15 of total dominated the eukaryote community accompanied by chlorophyte reads 3 of total very low proportions of alveolate stramenopile and cryptophyta reads were also detected not shown to further investigate differences between metatranscriptomes throughout the experiment we compared the overall gene expression of each experimental treatment to a reference treatment the comparisons presented below were conducted by correlation analyses rarefaction analyses and differential expression analyses 3 3 effects of volume and fixed unfixed treatments on metatranscriptomes deseq2 comparisons of the metatranscriptomes obtained from different volumes showed that only 0 02 of the genes displayed significant differential expression in 250 ml aliquots of seawater compared to the reference 1 l volume fig 5 a to determine systematic effects of fixing or not fixing on the gene expression profiles differential expression was investigated between the fixed treatments at the time of fixation t0 and the samples of live seawater deseq analyses showed that 94 9 of the gene expression between microbial communities fixed with ss10 and the live samples were not significantly differently expressed 3 2 were underrepresented and 1 9 overrepresented fig 5b supp table s1 3 4 effects of time spent in fixative on metatranscriptomes after having been fixed with ss10 no significant differentially expressed de genes were detected with deseq2 when comparing the 0 h and 12 h samples and the two later time points showed less than 0 2 de genes fig 5c d e of the 65 differentially abundant transcripts after 24 h only one was annotated with the cog database and 9 were annotated from the 462 differentially abundant transcripts after 192 h supp table s1 the only annotated de gene after 24 h rsmd a small subunit rrna methylase was under represented and not shared with the other time points five of the genes that were de directly after fixation were further over represented after 192 h in ss10 compared to the initially fixed treatment manb pria nuob nth and spou the integrity of the metatranscriptomes over time was further investigated by correlation analyses with the initial fixed sample as well as with the unfixed sample confirming the de analyses in fig 5 pearson correlation coefficients r 0 6 were observed between the initially fixed sample and non fixed seawater fig 6 a correlation coefficients were even higher between the initially fixed and fixed 12 h sample and declined only slightly with longer storage times in fixative fig 6b correlation coefficients between fixed replicates at each time point remained relatively constant with time fig 6c similarly rarefaction analyses showed no significant differences between the initial and later time points with the exception of two of the replicates filtered after 192 h which reflected lower numbers of detected predicted genes per number of reads sampled fig 6d the limited difference in gene expression was further illustrated by constant community taxonomic composition over time in the ss10 treatments supp figs s2 and s3 3 5 afissys afis and free flow sample comparisons along a diurnal cycle a field test was conducted in order to evaluate the capacity of afissys to identify similar trends in gene expression as the other two samplers along a diurnal time series pearson coefficients based on tpm counts were determined for the different samplers followed by principal coordinate analysis pcoa of the pearson distance for the full 24 h time series of the warnow river station fig 7 varying salinities between 14 and 16 during the time of the field experiment indicated saline baltic sea water intrusions into the river leading to unstable conditions in the pelagic system but still the pcoa presenting data from all three sampling systems indicates an overnight biological shift in metatranscriptomes over the diurnal cycle gene expression patterns clustered into a day time group and a night time group within the day time cluster the time points 9 30 12 30 and 15 30 of the second day displayed pearson correlation coefficients 0 7 with each other purple ellipse but their 0 5 coefficients in relation to the same time points on the first day suggest a possible return to day time gene expression patterns the night time group was more disparate and did not show pearson correlation coefficients above 0 4 even among each other hence a succession following the diurnal cycle was detectable by all three sampling methods despite the fact that two thirds of the afissys samples were stored in the warnow river for 3 6 h after fixation 3 6 afissys time series in the warnow river the sb37 microcat revealed daily variations in water temperature salinity and oxygen throughout the week fig 8 temperature varied between 3 7 and 1 2 c and salinity varied between 16 and 10 values already much higher than usual for river waters fig 8a dynamics in temperature and salinity indicated movement of water masses throughout the week of the in situ field study probably due to inflow from the baltic sea a thin ice cover was formed on the 14th january but had disappeared by the 15th january the afissys sampled successfully in an autonomous manner over the course of the week 11 16 january providing two samples per day at 13 h and 20 h the amount of rna extracted from the samples at the 11th was low fig 8b but aside from these two samples there appeared a general trend of increasing rna over the week rna extracted from unfixed communities was not significantly different from the afissys samples but did show a tendency to be higher in day samples compared to night samples corresponding to the low rna amounts in samples from the 11th january the rin values could not be calculated by the bioanalyzer due to the low amounts of the rna and high degradation it should be noted that the samples from the 11th january were stored the longest in the fixative in the sampler and upon collection at the end of the week they had a whitish milky appearance and took a long time to filter the later afissys samples from the 12th to the 16th january displayed higher rin values average 6 65 with limited variability between daylight and darkness and between consecutive days fig 8c 4 discussion in the present study we tested the afissys a novel autonomous multi sampler in the tidal impacted warnow river the instrument conducted regular sample collection for a full week despite low temperatures and a temporary ice cover the preceding evaluations of the volume requirements for metatranscriptomic samples and the effects of the stop solution on microbial metatranscriptomes also indicated that the afissys could be used for recovery of sufficient amounts of rna for metatranscriptomics analyses from coastal environments the fixative ensured quick inactivation of cellular processes specifically those involved in the turnover of mrna and provided long term stability of the original metatranscriptomes 4 1 effects of volume on metatranscriptome cell abundance remained the same throughout the duration of the incubation in the fixatives proving that adsorption of cells to the plastic bottles was negligible hence loss of cells during prolonged storage of fixed seawater in an autonomous multi sampler instrument should be minor despite the increased surface to volume ratio of a small sampling device there was no effect of sample volume on the quality of the total rna although the decreasing amount of extracted rna over time needs to be considered when choosing the sample volume for time series it is worth noting furthermore that the ideal volume will depend on the environment and time of year at which the sample is being collected the lack of significant differential expression and the high correlations between expression levels of the different volumes of the same treatment indicates that sample volume does not affect gene expression patterns the lower amounts of total rna extracted from the 250 ml aliquots potentially require more pcr amplification steps during library preparation for rna sequencing increasing the implicit risk of biased pcr amplification of specific community transcripts nonetheless the rarefaction analyses showed that a similar diversity of transcripts was obtained in 1 l and 250 ml volumes hence the difference in rna amount extracted does not affect the detected diversity of expressed genes 4 2 effects of long term exposure to stop solution the comparison of unfixed seawater and the initially fixed sample showed differential expression for in total 5 1 of the genes this was expected because according to our hypothesis sampling of unfixed water introduces gene expression biases feike et al 2012 for example during filtration to improve knowledge on the cause for differential expression we performed thymidine incorporation experiments supp meth 1 which indicated that dna synthesis was immediately stopped by ss10 and in comparison also significantly reduced by rnalater suppl fig s4a uracil incorporation measurements showed that ss10 also immediately blocked rna synthesis supp fig s4b rendering up expression of genes through transcription impossible after fixation the effects of ss10 on bacterial rnase enzyme activity supp meth 2 revealed that rnases from the seawater sample were still active after fixation with ss10 similar to the unfixed treatment suppl fig s5 nonetheless the activity was greatly reduced up to the point where it stopped after 25 30 min exposure to ss10 at half the maximal activity of the unfixed seawater in contrast rnalater induced immediate reduction of the rnase activity but the activity persisted despite the fixative suppl fig s5 thus as ss10 stopped dna and rna synthesis immediately and decreased rnase activity after 10 20 min the differential gene expression between fixed and unfixed samples is likely to have resulted for the most part from alterations in live metatranscriptomes of unfixed seawater such alterations were possibly induced by the delay before sample processing stewart et al 2012 during which seawater was confined for a few hours or by the filtration itself in addition despite an apparent chemical effect of ss10 fixation on the rin values seemingly amplified with time of storage in the fixative the differential expression of genes was minimal and not confined to any specific pathways these limited changes in expression levels conceivably alter metatranscriptome profiles equally irrespective of sample origin fixing before recovery has already been shown to be particularly essential for samples taken from extremely distinctive environments feike et al 2012 edgcomb et al 2016 hence fixation with ss10 is increasingly being used feike et al 2012 beier et al 2017 bentzon tilia et al 2015 but the present study was the first to look into long term stability of transcriptomes during storage in stop solution a similar fixative carnoy s fixative allows the recovery of the same amounts of total rna as flash frozen samples but causes degradation of transcripts at the moment of fixation and long term preservation was never attempted urieli shoval et al 1992 the quantity and quality of rna filtered fixed with rnalater and stored in other novel in situ samplers remained similar to unfixed samples wurzbacher et al 2012 and constant over 1 week intervals ottesen et al 2011 in contrast integrity of rna in human cell lines fixed with finefix methacarn and formalin was shown to deteriorate after only one hour in fixative with relatively constant amounts during the following 24 h in finefix and methacarn but a rapid decrease in formalin dotti et al 2010 the first field evaluation of the afissys prototype allowed us to confirm that in situ storage of samples fixed with stop solution did not hinder our capacity to read the biological shifts in natural metatranscriptomes in fact diurnal succession in gene expression was as strong in the afissys samples as in the freshly fixed afis and unfixed free flow samples 5 conclusion with the added advantage of autonomy and long term storage the afissys provides gene expression profiles good enough to follow the evolution of an ecosystem through its microbial components the instrument should be adequate for a broad application not only in waters of the baltic region but also in practically all aquatic systems worldwide we anticipate a need to evaluate the afissys functionality in different environments particularly under higher salinities and a wider range of temperatures certain marine environments exhibit much lower bacterial counts than the reference that we used here and this might affect the volume of sample required in such a case the parallel afissys platforms could be programmed to sample simultaneously to double the sample volume for each time point the capacity of such an autonomous multi sampler is to by pass the need for direct and immediate handling of samples allowing ship independent sampling promises advantages for environmental monitoring of pelagic

19157,microbial communities are the main drivers of biogeochemical cycling of multiple elements sustaining life in the ocean the rapidity of their response to stressors and abrupt environmental changes implies that even fast and infrequent events can affect local transformations of organic matter and nutrients modern molecular techniques now allow for monitoring of microbial activities and functions in the environment through the analysis of genes and expressed genes contained in natural microbial assemblages however messenger rna turnover in cells can be as short as 30 seconds and stability varies greatly between transcripts sampling of in situ communities involves an inevitable delay between the collection of seawater and the extraction of its rna leaving the bacterial communities plenty of time to alter their gene expression the characteristics of microbial rna turnover make time series very difficult because samples need to be processed immediately to limit alterations to the metatranscriptomes to address these challenges we designed an autonomous in situ fixation multi sampler afissys for the reliable sampling of microbial metatranscriptomes at frequent intervals for refined temporal resolution to advance the development of this instrument we examined the minimal seawater volume necessary for adequate coverage of community gene expression and the suitability of phenol ethanol fixation for immediate and long term preservation of transcripts from a microbial community we then evaluated the field eligibility of the instrument itself with two case studies in a brackish system afissys is able to collect fix and store water samples independently at a predefined temporal resolution phenol ethanol fixation can conserve metatranscriptomes directly in the environment for up to a week for later analysis in the laboratory thus the afissys constitutes an invaluable tool for the integration of molecular functional analyses in environmental monitoring in brackish waters and in aquatic environments in general graphical abstract image 1 keywords afissys in situ fixation metatranscriptomics rna sampling gene expression 1 introduction microbial communities play a major role in global biogeochemical fluxes through their metabolic processes and interactions with each other and the environment suttle 2007 falkowski et al 2008 fuhrman et al 2015 rapid responses to changing environmental conditions either by the emergence of underlying populations or by the phenotypic plasticity of established organisms confer a strong ecological advantage to microbial communities biogeochemical processes and corresponding in situ community functional dynamics are increasingly investigated through functional gene expression the sequencing of whole community messenger rna using next generation high throughput methods provides a snapshot of the expressed natural microbial functions as this direct approach does not require any incubation of the community contrary to rate measurements or stable isotope incorporation experiments it reduces the risk of modifying the cellular processes occurring in situ massana et al 2001 kim et al 2011 most of the early challenges of microbial metatranscriptomics have been methodologically resolved such as the selective removal of ribosomal rna prior to sequencing gilbert et al 2008 to enrich messenger rna however the highly unstable nature of rna belasco and brawerman 1993 hui et al 2014 remains problematic gallego romero et al 2014 modifications in gene expression patterns can be orchestrated by the disappearance of transcripts due to degradation and or the synthesis of new transcripts bandyra and luisi 2013 during and after sampling as cells rapidly adjust their physiology in response to stress and new surrounding conditions e g temperature pressure or light progressing technologies of high throughput sequencing have favoured an increasing amount of in depth comprehensive metatranscriptomic investigations which have revealed the risk for bias related to sampling and processing of biomass as suspected in earlier studies frias lopez et al 2008 gilbert et al 2008 poretsky et al 2009 the inevitable delay of minutes to hours between collection of seawater and flash freezing or chemical preservation of filters combined with the stress of the filtration step can overrule the signal of in situ processes feike et al 2012 wurzbacher et al 2012 the risk of inducing biases in metatranscriptomes is particularly pronounced when the in situ conditions differ substantially from the conditions during sample collection and filtration particularly for microbial communities from deep ocean habitats taylor et al 2015 edgcomb et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 or from strong vertical chemical gradients such as the redox zones found in the baltic sea feike et al 2012 the black sea marschall et al 2010 or saanich inlet zaikova et al 2010 to sample such environments and to facilitate high resolution time series pioneering studies have invented novel instruments for collection of nucleic acids for example the autonomous microbial genosensor fries et al 2007 the maclane remote access sampler winslow et al 2014 the environmental sample processor ottesen et al 2011 and the fixation filter device 3 taylor et al 2015 carry out automated underwater in situ filtration after which filters are submerged in a fixative such as sucrose lysis buffer or rnalater using a novel approach feike et al 2012 developed an automatic flow injection sampler afis for in situ fixation of seawater at the time of sample collection this sampling strategy limits biases in the metatranscriptomes induced by stress on microbial cells such as the up regulation of reca expression that overwrites the in situ expression patterns of environmentally relevant genes feike et al 2012 furthermore as fixation is conducted before filtration the afis avoids artefacts attributable to the pressure exerted during the filtration step ferguson et al 1984 which have yet to be systematically evaluated stewart 2013 following the success of the afis we have developed an automated multi sampler system afissys to fix liquid samples in situ for offshore temporal investigations of microbial functional dynamics the usefulness of such a multi sampler is necessarily contingent on a number of constraints to examine these we conducted an experiment on a natural marine microbial community to determine the effects of volume and time exposed to fixative on the integrity of microbial metatranscriptomes in order to maximise the number of individual samplers to be appended onto the physical support one must minimize their volume as much as possible our first objective therefore was to investigate whether a representative metatranscriptome could be obtained from a volume smaller than normally used for metatranscriptomics from the baltic sea traditionally fixation pertains to the preservation of cell or tissue morphology for microscopy lovejoy et al 1993 kiernan 2000 or histopathology milcheva et al 2013 and relies on aldehyde based fixatives which do not provide optimal rna yields goldsworthy et al 1999 cox et al 2006 most studies concerning nucleic acid preservation have focused on rna integrity dotti et al 2010 camacho sanchez et al 2013 groelz et al 2013 or specific genes targeted by qpcr páska et al 2004 dotti et al 2010 feike et al 2012 wurzbacher et al 2012 and microarrays vincek et al 2003 howat and wilson 2014 few studies have investigated the effects of fixatives on whole genome gene expression patterns using high throughput mrna sequencing kruse et al 2017 a surprising result from one such study suggests that the traditional and frequently used rna stabilising agent rnalater weber et al 2010 taylor et al 2015 is unable to prevent a transcriptional response in plant tissue during the time it takes for the fixative to penetrate the cells kruse et al 2017 in this regard little is known about the temporal effects of 10 stop solution a phenol ethanol fixative used successfully with the afis sampler feike et al 2012 on the stability of microbial metatranscriptomes the long term preservation of gene expression is crucial for the operation of autonomous offshore samplers despite the advantages of fixation knowledge on the effects of chemical preservation on transcript molecules in cells is still limited fukatsu 1999 vincek et al 2003 eichler et al 2004 we sought to ensure that the fixative could irreversibly fix community transcriptomes without causing chemical degradation of the fragile mrna molecules over the course of one week subsequently illumina rna sequencing of metatranscriptomes was conducted on a selection of experimental treatments to evaluate the stability of gene expression profiles in preserved environmental microbial community samples based on the results of long term fixation and volume analyses the afissys was developed and two prototype versions were tested in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 choice and use of fixatives the stop solution 5 phenol ph 4 3 95 pure ethanol used at a 10 volume to sample

ball casing fig 1 a and b and a protective cover cylinder fig 1c when the cover is closed tight over the chamber fig 1d the unit can be filled with a sterile liquid before the operation and avoids any biological activities inside the sampler this sterile set up allows the collection of pristine samples even after a prolonged immersion in the environment mechanical rotation of the spherical chamber to a 90 position moves the protective cover laterally and opens the chamber for inflow of the seawater an additional 90 step of the ball seals the chamber opens the injection valve and simultaneously slides the protective cylinder back into its original position after pumping the fixative into the chamber the injection valve is closed to completely seal the sample for storage briefly the closing and opening of the sampling ball is driven by a spring loaded mechanism fig 1e and f before the sampling takes place the spring must be loaded by hand by turning the chamber housing 180 counterclockwise the housing catches a release pin each 90 during the sampling process an actuator fig 2 a releases these pins and allows the outer housing to turn back as the inner sampling ball stays in place inside the spherical chamber the thin injection nozzle extends some millimeters into the sample volume fig 2b a couple of tiny injection holes allow immediate dispersion of the injected fixative in all directions the turbulence and speed of each injection stroke creates a mixing motion in geometrical interaction with the inner forms of the sampling ball a medical grade ceramic piston pump delivers the injection volume of 1 4 ml per stroke 2 6 comparisons of afissys afis and free flow bottles along a diurnal cycle as an initial trial of the afissys instrument we conducted a diurnal in situ sampling campaign with the first non automated prototype from the pier of the rostock baltic divers baltic taucherei und bergungsbetrieb rostock gmbh this pier 54 11154n 12 09222e extends into a region of the warnow river germany frequently influenced by the baltic sea alongside the afissys we sampled with the afis feike et al 2012 and a manually triggered standalone free flow bottle hydrobios for nine time points samples were collected 1 m apart from each other every third hour starting at 15 30 eastern standard time afis and free flow samples were immediately aliquoted into 250 ml subsamples a volume comparable to that collected by afissys then 0 2 μm filtered and flash frozen this processing took less than 20 min the afissys prototype remained underwater for six hours until the third constitutive sample was collected after which all three modules were recovered and the fixed 250 ml samples were 0 2 μm filtered and flash frozen before rewinding and submerging the afissys prototype for the next time points rna was extracted as described above and after removal of ribosomal rna was sequenced on nextseq illumina 2 150bp at lgc genomics gmbh due to costs

final afissys prototype in january 2017 from the same site in the warnow river physical and chemical data was collected with a sbe37 microcat ctp recorder sea bird scientific left submerged for the duration of the trial the afissys platforms were composed of six individual sample modules fixed to a support base metal spring and control panel motor rotation ramp injection rail and tubing fig 3 the objective of the in situ application of the afissys was to determine its capacity to conduct high resolution ship independent autonomous triggered in situ fixation sampling the two platforms were programmed through ocean lab 3 hydro bios kiel germany for a weeklong autonomous sampling to collect water twice a day four hours after sunrise and four hours after sunset the afissys1 platform sampled every day at 13 00 while afissys2 sampled at 20 00 eastern standard time respectively in addition after each evening sample was collected the two platforms were lowered by 16 5 cm ensuring that the next sampling chambers were positioned at the same depth as the previous sample in parallel to the samples collected autonomously by the afissys platforms reference samples were collected at the same time points with a free flow bottle lowered next to the afissys at the programmed sampling time these unfixed reference samples were filtered onsite immediately the 2l sample was split into subsamples of 250 ml corresponding to the volume of the afissys sample chamber filters were flash frozen within 15 minutes of water collection 2 8 accession numbers raw reads from this study have been

metatranscriptomics analyses the rna sequencing of ss10 t0 t12 t24 t192 and natural seawater replicates provided approximately 25 million reads per sample resulting in an average of 1 8 million reads

supp fig s1 indicated a low level of degradation of the messenger molecules within the samples despite storage time in fixative the megahit de novo assembly resulted in 313 954 contigs and the proportion of reads that successfully mapped to the contigs remained constant over time with approximately 70 of the total cleaned reads per sample hierarchical clustering with bray curtis dissimilarity fig 4 based on rpkm gene counts grouped the replicate samples for the same time fixative treatments indicating reproducibility of the results taxonomic annotation of functional genes revealed a natural microbial community dominated by eukaryote reads which represented 40 of the reads while bacterial reads constituted 20 25 of the reads and the rest mapped to unclassified sequences fig s2 the bacterial community was dominated by proteobacteria 10 12 of total reads and bacteroidetes 5 7 of total reads while actinobacteria cyanobacteria firmicutes chlamydiae and planctomycetes together constituted less than 1 of the total reads fig s3 haptophytes 15 of total dominated the eukaryote community accompanied by chlorophyte reads 3 of total very low proportions of alveolate stramenopile and cryptophyta reads were also detected not shown to further investigate differences between metatranscriptomes throughout the experiment we compared the overall gene expression of each experimental treatment to a reference treatment the comparisons presented below were conducted by correlation analyses rarefaction analyses and differential expression analyses 3 3 effects of volume and fixed unfixed treatments on metatranscriptomes deseq2 comparisons of the metatranscriptomes obtained from different volumes showed that only 0 02 of the genes displayed significant differential expression in 250 ml aliquots of seawater compared to the reference 1 l volume fig 5 a to determine systematic effects of fixing or not fixing on the gene expression profiles differential expression was investigated between the fixed treatments at the time of fixation t0 and the samples of live seawater deseq analyses showed that 94 9 of the gene expression between microbial communities fixed with ss10 and the live samples were not significantly differently expressed 3 2 were underrepresented and 1 9 overrepresented fig 5b supp table s1 3 4 effects of time spent in fixative on metatranscriptomes after having been fixed with ss10 no significant differentially expressed de genes were detected with deseq2 when comparing the 0 h and 12 h samples and the two later time points showed less than 0 2 de genes fig 5c d e of the 65 differentially abundant transcripts after 24 h only one was annotated with the cog database and 9 were annotated from the 462 differentially abundant transcripts after 192 h supp table s1 the only annotated de gene after 24 h rsmd a small subunit rrna methylase was under represented and not shared with the other time points five of the genes that were de directly after fixation were further over represented after 192 h in ss10 compared to the initially fixed treatment manb pria nuob nth and spou the integrity of the metatranscriptomes over time was further investigated by correlation analyses with the initial fixed sample as well as with the unfixed sample confirming the de analyses in fig 5 pearson correlation coefficients r 0 6 were observed between the initially fixed sample and non fixed seawater fig 6 a correlation coefficients were even higher between the initially fixed and fixed 12 h sample and declined only slightly with longer storage times in fixative fig 6b correlation coefficients between fixed replicates at each time point remained relatively constant with time fig 6c similarly rarefaction analyses showed no significant differences between the initial and later time points with the exception of two of the replicates filtered after 192 h which reflected lower numbers of detected predicted genes per number of reads sampled fig 6d the limited difference in gene expression was further illustrated by constant community taxonomic composition over time in the ss10 treatments supp figs s2 and s3 3 5 afissys afis and free flow sample comparisons along a diurnal cycle a field test was conducted in order to evaluate the capacity of afissys to identify similar trends in gene expression as the other two samplers along a diurnal time series pearson coefficients based on tpm counts were determined for the different samplers followed by principal coordinate analysis pcoa of the pearson distance for the full 24 h time series of the warnow river station fig 7 varying salinities between 14 and 16 during the time of the field experiment indicated saline baltic sea water intrusions into the river leading to unstable conditions in the pelagic system but still the pcoa presenting data from all three sampling systems indicates an overnight biological shift in metatranscriptomes over the diurnal cycle gene expression patterns clustered into a day time group and a night time group within the day time cluster the time points 9 30 12 30 and 15 30 of the second day displayed pearson correlation coefficients 0 7 with each other purple ellipse but their 0 5 coefficients in relation to the same time points on the first day suggest a possible return to day time gene expression patterns the night time group was more disparate and did not show pearson correlation coefficients above 0 4 even among each other hence a succession following the diurnal cycle was detectable by all three sampling methods despite the fact that two thirds of the afissys samples were stored in the warnow river for 3 6 h after fixation 3 6 afissys time series in the warnow river the sb37 microcat revealed daily variations in water temperature salinity and oxygen throughout the week fig 8 temperature varied between 3 7 and 1 2 c and salinity varied between 16 and 10 values already much higher than usual for river waters fig 8a dynamics in temperature and salinity indicated movement of water masses throughout the week of the in situ field study probably due to inflow from the baltic sea a thin ice cover was formed on the 14th january but had disappeared by the 15th january the afissys sampled successfully in an autonomous manner over the course of the week 11 16 january providing two samples per day at 13 h and 20 h the amount of rna extracted from the samples at the 11th was low fig 8b but aside from these two samples there appeared a general trend of increasing rna over the week rna extracted from unfixed communities was not significantly different from the afissys samples but did show a tendency to be higher in day samples compared to night samples corresponding to the low rna amounts in samples from the 11th january the rin values could not be calculated by the bioanalyzer due to the low amounts of the rna and high degradation it should be noted that the samples from the 11th january were stored the longest in the fixative in the sampler and upon collection at the end of the week they had a whitish milky appearance and took a long time to filter the later afissys samples from the 12th to the 16th january displayed higher rin values average 6 65 with limited variability between daylight and darkness and between consecutive days fig 8c 4 discussion in the present study we tested the afissys a novel autonomous multi sampler in the tidal impacted warnow river the instrument conducted regular sample collection for a full week despite low temperatures and a temporary ice cover the preceding evaluations of the volume requirements for metatranscriptomic samples and the effects of the stop solution on microbial metatranscriptomes also indicated that the afissys could be used for recovery of sufficient amounts of rna for metatranscriptomics analyses from coastal environments the fixative ensured quick inactivation of cellular processes specifically those involved in the turnover of mrna and provided long term stability of the original metatranscriptomes 4 1 effects of volume on metatranscriptome cell abundance remained the same throughout the duration of the incubation in the fixatives proving that adsorption of cells to the plastic bottles was negligible hence loss of cells during prolonged storage of fixed seawater in an autonomous multi sampler instrument should be minor despite the increased surface to volume ratio of a small sampling device there was no effect of sample volume on the quality of the total rna although the decreasing amount of extracted rna over time needs to be considered when choosing the sample volume for time series it is worth noting furthermore that the ideal volume will depend on the environment and time of year at which the sample is being collected the lack of significant differential expression and the high correlations between expression levels of the different volumes of the same treatment indicates that sample volume does not affect gene expression patterns the lower amounts of total rna extracted from the 250 ml aliquots potentially require more pcr amplification steps during library preparation for rna sequencing increasing the implicit risk of biased pcr amplification of specific community transcripts nonetheless the rarefaction analyses showed that a similar diversity of transcripts was obtained in 1 l and 250 ml volumes hence the difference in rna amount extracted does not affect the detected diversity of expressed genes 4 2 effects of long term exposure to stop solution the comparison of unfixed seawater and the initially fixed sample showed differential expression for in total 5 1 of the genes this was expected because according to our hypothesis sampling of unfixed water introduces gene expression biases feike et al 2012 for example during filtration to improve knowledge on the cause for differential expression we performed thymidine incorporation experiments supp meth 1 which indicated that dna synthesis was immediately stopped by ss10 and in comparison also significantly reduced by rnalater suppl fig s4a uracil incorporation measurements showed that ss10 also immediately blocked rna synthesis supp fig s4b rendering up expression of genes through transcription impossible after fixation the effects of ss10 on bacterial rnase enzyme activity supp meth 2 revealed that rnases from the seawater sample were still active after fixation with ss10 similar to the unfixed treatment suppl fig s5 nonetheless the activity was greatly reduced up to the point where it stopped after 25 30 min exposure to ss10 at half the maximal activity of the unfixed seawater in contrast rnalater induced immediate reduction of the rnase activity but the activity persisted despite the fixative suppl fig s5 thus as ss10 stopped dna and rna synthesis immediately and decreased rnase activity after 10 20 min the differential gene expression between fixed and unfixed samples is likely to have resulted for the most part from alterations in live metatranscriptomes of unfixed seawater such alterations were possibly induced by the delay before sample processing stewart et al 2012 during which seawater was confined for a few hours or by the filtration itself in addition despite an apparent chemical effect of ss10 fixation on the rin values seemingly amplified with time of storage in the fixative the differential expression of genes was minimal and not confined to any specific pathways these limited changes in expression levels conceivably alter metatranscriptome profiles equally irrespective of sample origin fixing before recovery has already been shown to be particularly essential for samples taken from extremely distinctive environments feike et al 2012 edgcomb et al 2016 hence fixation with ss10 is increasingly being used feike et al 2012 beier et al 2017 bentzon tilia et al 2015 but the present study was the first to look into long term stability of transcriptomes during storage in stop solution a similar fixative carnoy s fixative allows the recovery of the same amounts of total rna as flash frozen samples but causes degradation of transcripts at the moment of fixation and long term preservation was never attempted urieli shoval et al 1992 the quantity and quality of rna filtered fixed with rnalater and stored in other novel in situ samplers remained similar to unfixed samples wurzbacher et al 2012 and constant over 1 week intervals ottesen et al 2011 in contrast integrity of rna in human cell lines fixed with finefix methacarn and formalin was shown to deteriorate after only one hour in fixative with relatively constant amounts during the following 24 h in finefix and methacarn but a rapid decrease in formalin dotti et al 2010 the first field evaluation of the afissys prototype allowed us to confirm that in situ storage of samples fixed with stop solution did not hinder our capacity to read the biological shifts in natural metatranscriptomes in fact diurnal succession in gene expression was as strong in the afissys samples as in the freshly fixed afis and unfixed free flow samples 5 conclusion with the added advantage of autonomy and long term storage the afissys provides gene expression profiles good enough to follow the evolution of an ecosystem through its microbial components the instrument should be adequate for a broad application not only in waters of the baltic region but also in practically all aquatic systems worldwide we anticipate a need to evaluate the afissys functionality in different environments particularly under higher salinities and a wider range of temperatures certain marine environments exhibit much lower bacterial counts than the reference that we used here and this might affect the volume of sample required in such a case the parallel afissys platforms could be programmed to sample simultaneously to double the sample volume for each time point the capacity of such an autonomous multi sampler is to by pass the need for direct and immediate handling of samples allowing ship independent sampling promises advantages for environmental monitoring of pelagic

19158,the microbiological water quality of drinking water distribution system dwds is of primary importance for human health high throughput sequencing has gained more and more attention in the last decade to describe this microbial diversity in water networks however there are few studies describing this approach on large drinking water distribution systems and for extended periods of time to fill this gap and observe the potential subtle variation in microbiota of a water network through time and space we aimed to apply high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene approach to characterize bacterial communities of the paris dwds over a one year period in this study the paris network composed of four different dwdss was sampled at 31 sites each month for one year the sampling campaign was one of the largest described so far n 368 and the importance of key spatio temporal and physico chemical parameters was investigated overall 1321 taxa were identified within the paris network although only fifteen of them were found in high relative abundance 1 in all samples two genera phreatobacter and hyphomicrobium were dominant the whole bacterial diversity was not significantly affected between the four dwdss spatial parameter and by physico chemical parameters however the bacterial diversity was slightly modified over the one year period temporal parameter as we were able to observe dwds microbiome perturbations presumably linked to a preceding flood event comparison of high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene amplicons vs cultivation based techniques showed that only 1 8 of bacterial diversity was recovered through cultivation high throughput sequencing has made it possible to monitor dwds more accurately than conventional methods by describing the whole diversity and detecting slight fluctuations in bacterial communities this method would be further used to supervise drinking water networks to follow any perturbations due to internals events such as treatments or external events such as flooding graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbiome drinking water bacteria ecology 16s 1 introduction water quality is crucial for human health therefore drinking water is carefully protected monitored and managed proctor and hammes 2015 the quality of water in drinking water distribution systems dwds depends on different parameters including microbial indicators chemical composition is also monitored by several parameters following the who recommendation and state regulation world health organization 2017 for over a century microbial quality of drinking water has been assessed mainly by measuring of cultivable bacteria i e heterotrophic plate count hpc frankland and frankland 1894 and detection of faecal indicators anderson et al 2005 however these estimators do not represent a reliable proxy for assessing the microbial diversity dwelling in drinking water i hpc are indicators of the water degradation through the water network but only a slight fraction of bacteria found in water is measurable by hpc staley and konopka 1985 and ii faecal indicators escherichia coli and enterococcus are monitored for the efficacy of the water treatment and detection of faecal pathogens saxena et al 2015 by definition they are not related to other pathogens like opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens oppp ashbolt 2015a issues that can be encountered at a drinking water treatment plant or during water distribution can lead to proliferation of opportunistic pathogens such as mycobacterium spp pseudomonas aeruginosa and legionella pneumophila ashbolt 2015b lu et al 2015 among others concerning drinking water utilities bacterial overgrowth can lead to technical complications during distribution such as pipe fouling or biocorrosion due to biofilm development or degradation of water quality allion et al 2011 nawrocki et al 2010 drinking water with a low variation of bacterial communities between the point of production and the tap can be considered as biologically stable prest et al 2016a therefore the abundance and composition of microbial communities along the drinking water network are key parameters to allow a fine monitoring of drinking water s microbiological composition across time and space to date such analyses are not routinely done but new tools might be developed to allow this approach in the future liu et al 2018 currently the microbiome depicting the whole microbial diversity can be characterized by the use of high throughput sequencing hts which allows culture independent analysis of this diversity caporaso et al 2011 goodrich et al 2014 there are several studies describing the microbiome of drinking water ji et al 2015 pinto et al 2014 2012 roeselers et al 2015 shaw et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 a review has recently pointed out the usefulness of hts in assessing of microbial water quality tan et al 2015 for example by enabling the detection of any genome of faecal indicator bacteria pathogens tracking antibiotic resistance genes and anticipating the biodegradation of pollutants these investigations showed that bacterial diversity might be influenced by raw water origin gomez alvarez et al 2015 ji et al 2015 various treatment steps lin et al 2014 pinto et al 2012 chlorination type if any hwang et al 2012 stanish et al 2016 pipeline material ji et

2018 prest et al 2016b roeselers et al 2015 while these studies have greatly helped to define and understand the drinking water microbiome most were conducted on limited space e g building or time scales e g one month sampling using simulated pipe systems in laboratory conditions for some knowledge about the spatial and temporal microbial diversity consequently remains scarce especially in the context of large cities pinto et al 2014 potgieter et al 2018 roeselers et al 2015 to fill this gap we performed in our study a large scale sampling campaign over one year in the four different dwdss supplying the city of paris france high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes was used to characterize and monitor bacterial communities in these samples our objective was to understand which factors could influence the microbiome such as the origin of water groundwater or surface water temporality and the selected physico chemical parameters and also to compare microbial variation with the required data provided by hpc 2 materials and methods 2 1 network features and sample collection the city of paris is supplied in drinking water with four separated dwdss each of them is composed of one reservoir storing treated drinking water for short periods of time and of one distribution network supplied by the affiliated reservoir fig 1 paris distribution networks are complex a factor which greatly hampers the estimation of water time of residency and pipe length from the reservoir the total size of the network is estimated at 1800 km of cast iron pipes an estimation of the direct distances between the sampling points and the reservoirs is presented in table a1 they are between 1 and 16 km on average the residence time of drinking water in the pipes is roughly estimated at 24 h saint cloud and montsouris dwdss are supplied with groundwater from multiple sources around paris ménilmontant dwds is supplied with surface water from the marne river and l haÿ les roses dwds is supplied with a mix of groundwater and surface water from the seine river groundwater is treated with a filtration on activated charcoal and an ultrafiltration surface water is treated with a succession of physical or biological filtrations pre ozonation decantation pre filtration and sand filtration and ozonation stages before undergoing filtration on granulated activated charcoal and ultraviolet disinfection prior to chlorination and distribution for each of the four dwdss we collected the reservoir and the distribution network at different sites monthly one sample corresponding to the reservoir was collected monthly in each dwds seven sites for montsouris l haÿ les roses and saint cloud dwdss and six sites for ménilmontant dwds were sampled monthly on the pipes of the distribution network fig 1 table a 1 due to technical problems sampling on the seventh point of menilmontant dwds was stopped after two months it is therefore not included in the analysis in order to minimize the influence of stagnation in private networks pepper et al 2004 the samples were not collected at household taps but rather directly on the final point of the distribution network from month to month sampling from a sampling site could vary by one or two days in total from march 2016 to february 2017 368 water samples of 1 l were collected and transported to the laboratory at 4 c they were processed within 24 h and monitored according to the european regulation and physico chemical parameters were documented temperature ph total chlorine conductivity nitrate and phosphate concentrations these parameters were measured in situ using standardized procedures by the eau de paris accredited laboratory nf t90 008 for ph nf en iso 7393 2 and nf en 27888 for chlorine concentration and conductivity respectively all the information of each sample is available in appendix b 2 2 dna purification and amplicon sequencing one liter water samples were filtered through a 0

bp fragment corresponding to the variable regions v3 v4 of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the primers u341f 5 cctacgggrsgcagcag 3 baker et al 2003 and bakt 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc

without any mismatch 84 0 and 49 3 of bacterial and archaeal sequences respectively pcr and sequencing were subcontracted by the genotyping and sequencing platform of the institut du cerveau et de la moelle épinière paris france https icm institute org fr briefly amplicons were amplified 35 cycles using faststart pcr master kit roche life science with a 20 bp adaptor at each end index and processing p5 and p7 sequence were added in a second pcr step using faststart high fidelity pcr system kit roche life science the amplicon libraries were sequenced 2 x 250 bp paired end using an illumina miseq platform using a 2 x 250 bp paired end the process of demultiplexing was carried out automatically at the end of sequencing 2 3 sequence data processing sequences were analysed using the qiime quantitative insights into microbial ecology pipeline version 1 9 0 http qiime org caporaso et al 2010b the 20bp of each adaptor were removed on each side before sequence data processing sequences harbouring an overall quality score below 30 and more than 3 ambiguous bases were discarded chimeras were identified and discarded using usearch 6 1 edgar 2010 remaining reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity threshold using uclust edgar 2010 singletons i e otus represented by less than 2 sequences were not considered in subsequent analyses a representative sequence for each otu corresponding to the most abundant sequence was picked sequences were aligned using pynast v1 2 2 caporaso et al 2010a taxonomy was assigned up to the genus level using uclust consensus taxonomy assigner coupled with the silva database release 128 quast et al 2013 illumina miseq amplicon sequencing enabled us to obtain 47 277 387 v3 v4 16s rrna gene sequences after quality filtering and removal of chimeric sequences and singletons 22 837 823 high quality reads were obtained and clustered in 141 701 otus at a 97 similarity cut off 2 4 blank samples seven blank samples corresponding to the extraction and sequencing of seven cellulose acetate membrane which had no contact with water were performed comparison of blanks vs samples was performed using principal coordinates analyses pcoa based on their weighted unifrac distances as detailed below fig 3 additionally the decontam r package was used to identify and eliminate contaminating otus by comparing prevalence of each otus in blanks and samples after sequence data processing davis et al 2017 thus 5315 otus corresponding to 381 107 sequences were removed the final dataset was consequently composed of 136 386 otus an average of 59 725 2155 mean se sequences was obtained for each sample 2 5 statistical analyses of samples the final biom file generated by qiime was imported in r version 3 3 3 r core team 2017 large sequence number variations across samples can affect relative abundance estimates and subsequent ordination analyses goodrich et al 2014 weiss et al 2017 to prevent such bias the final otu table was normalized with the package metagenomeseq paulson et al 2013 using a method where counts of each sample were scaled by the sample sum afterwards microbial communities were explored using the phyloseq package mcmurdie and holmes 2013 comparisons of microbial diversity across dwds location or temporality were performed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova anderson 2001 with 999 permutations and beta dispersivity analyses betadisper function using the vegan package oksanen et al 2017 pcoa were performed with the phyloseq package mcmurdie and holmes 2013 using quantitative bray curtis and weighted unifrac or qualitative compositional dissimilarities jaccard and unweighted unifrac table a 2 pairwise pearson s

package lahti et al 2017 2 6 heterotrophic plate count for each sample heterotrophic cultivable bacteria were cultured according to nf en iso 6222 briefly 1 ml of drinking water was grown on r2a agar plates which are commonly used to monitor cultivable bacteria from water samples for 3 days at 22 c or 2 days at 36 c identification of bacterial colonies was performed by matrix assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms bacterial colonies were transferred onto stainless steel target and 1 μl of 70 formic acid was added to each spot of the target to facilitate

composition are similar between the four dwds to assess the bacterial diversity and modification of a large drinking water network a one year sampling campaign was performed in the four dwdss of paris overall 368 drinking water samples were collected their total dna was purified amplified using 16s rrna primers and sequenced all otus were assigned to 1321 different taxa among which 544 were shared by the four networks fig 2 a table a 3 we identified 331 taxa present in only one of the four dwdss although with very low relative abundances 0 01 focusing on the most abundant taxa 1 relative abundance shared by the four dwds bacterial communities exhibited low variations as they were dominated by only 15 different taxa representing 64 4 72 7 of the relative abundance alphaproteobacteria was the most dominant class in all samples with a high proportion of two orders namely rhizobiales and sphingomonadales rhizobiales were mostly represented by phreatobacter and hyphomicrobium genera fig 2b hyphomicrobium was highly dominant representing up to 34 1 of relative abundance in montsouris dwds in the four networks without significant difference tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 phreatobacter was significantly more abundant in ménilmontant dwds accounting for 23 7 of the sequences in contrast with montsouris saint cloud and l haÿ les roses dwds accounting for 4 5 10 3 and 4 5 respectively tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 the sphingomonadales order also presented high relative abundance in montsouris saint cloud and l haÿ les roses dwdss 16 2 17 1 and 19 2 respectively with a high proportion of sphingorhabdus sphingomonas and sphingopyxis whereas this order represented only 9 6 in ménilmontant dwds tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 according to sample location i e reservoirs or distribution networks fig 1 the relative abundance of microbial communities differed in each dwds fig 2c most of the abundant taxa 1 relative abundance showed dwds specific colonization patterns for example no difference in relative abundance of acidovorax genus and undefined comamonadaceae were observed between reservoir and the distribution network of montsouris and l haÿ les roses dwds unlike ménilmontant and saint cloud dwds where their relative abundance varied student s test p value 0 05 therefore no general pattern of bacterial diversity with respect to sample location could be established with the exception of rhizobiales whose abundance increased significantly from the reservoirs to the final distribution points student s test p value 0 05 bacterial alpha diversity was assessed for each sample through calculation of shannon h indexes figure a1 no significant differences were observed between the bacterial alpha diversity of the four dwdss tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 figure a1a focusing on microbial diversity according to sample location no differences were observed between the reservoir and its associated distribution network in montsouris ménilmontant and l haÿ les roses dwdss shannon h index student test p value 0 05 figure a1b on the contrary saint cloud dwds showed significantly higher alpha diversity in distribution network in comparison with the reservoir student s test p value 0 05 calculation of pielou s evenness indexes indicated that all analysed samples regardless of the dwds were above 0 94 figure a2 such high evenness indexes underline a strong equitability of microbial communities across spatial gradient considering beta diversity pcoa using weighted unifrac distance between bacterial communities did not highlight any marked difference between dwdss fig 3 thus dwds origin did not appear as a strong driver of phylogenetic dissimilarity although the permanova test supported a significant impact of this parameter the variation explained by dwds origin was very low r 2 0 12 p value 0 001 table a 2 the impact of sample locations was also investigated considering the whole microbial community with permanova tests followed by beta dispersivity analyses the location of samples explained only 4 9 of the variation between communities r 2 0 05 p value 0 001 table a 2 beta dispersivity analysis showed divergent results depending on the networks and metrics used the same analyses were performed on each dwds separately and comparable results were obtained 3 2 bacterial diversity is influenced by temporality the sampling scheme presented in this study permitted the assessment changes of bacterial diversity in dwdss over a full year fig 4 the following highly abundant taxa showed significant variations along the year relative abundance of phreatobacter maricaulis and mycobacterium genera was significantly higher during warm period june 2016 to october 2016 corresponding to a water temperature 15 c than during cold period march 2016 to may 2016 and november 2016 to february 2017 water temperature 15 c in the four dwdss student s test p value 0 05 conversely hyphomicrobium and pseudomonas abundances were significantly higher during cold period than in warm period student s test p value 0 05 the genera of sphingomonadaceae family were not affected by these periods student s test p value 0 05 except for the sphingomonas and sphingopyxis genera whose relative abundance was higher in cold period student s test p value 0 05 as regards the shannon h index l haÿ les roses and montsouris dwdss showed a significant decrease in bacterial diversity during cold period as compared to warm period fig 5 student s test p value 0 05 furthermore some temporal changes i e a monthly scale were observed bacterial diversity was significantly lower in march and april 2016 in montsouris dwds and between december 2016 to february 2017 in l haÿ les roses ménilmontant and montsouris dwdss compared to july to october 2016 fig 5 tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 because of this bacterial diversity seems to evolve on a parabolic pattern these observations constitute trends in saint cloud dwds in addition a significant decrease in microbial diversity was observed during the month of june fig 5 tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 although this difference did not modify the composition of the most abundant taxa fig 4 the relative abundance of legionella and escherichia genera increased drastically during the year legionella and escherichia showed a relative abundance of 0 10 and 0 14 in average respectively over the june july period their relative abundance reached 0 65 and 1 35 respectively this increase may be correlated with the exceptional rise of the seine river level in june 2016 fig 6 other bacterial genera known to contain oppps such as mycobacterium and pseudomonas or faecal indicators such as enterococcus did not present significant variations in relative abundance impact of temporality and temperature periods parameters on bacterial community were analysed with permanova tests table a 2 the variability of microbial communities was poorly explained by these two parameters r 2 0 13 p value 0 01 r 2 0 05 p value 0 01 respectively and showed a heterogeneity of dispersion however temporality seems to have a moderate impact on the bacterial community of each dwds considered independently of one another since 21 23 of the variability is explained by this parameter 3 3 bacterial community composition is poorly explained by the physico chemical parameters several physico chemical parameters total chlorine electrical conductivity ph temperature phosphate and nitrate concentrations were measured for each water sample and compared using pearson s correlation and pca figure a3 nitrate concentration and conductivity are linked pearson s r 0 61 p value 0 001 and inversely correlated with ph pearson s r 0 42 p value 0 001 analyses of average and range of the different parameters suggest that nitrate concentration and conductivity depend on water origin table a 4 respectively they are on average 27 9 mg l and 523 μs cm in l haÿ les roses dwds 22 2 mg l and 535 7 μs cm in menilmontant dwds 36 7 mg l and 585 9 μs cm in montsouris dwds and 33 7 mg l and 537 8 μs cm in saint cloud dwds chlorine and phosphate concentration varied slightly between the 4 dwdss from 0 11 to 0 13 mg l and 1 02 mg l to 1 09 mg l respectively ph varied to 7 5 to 7 8 on average the temperature is 13 8 c in l haÿ les roses dwds 12 5 c in menilmontant dwds 14 1 c in montsouris dwds and 13 4 c in saint cloud dwds then we assessed the possible correlation between physico chemical parameters and bacterial diversity a correlation between alpha diversity based on shannon h index and water temperature was observed in ménilmontant pearson s r 0 39 p value 2 42e 4 montsouris pearson s r 0 60 p value 1 63e 10 l haÿ les roses pearson s r 0 47 p value 1 78e 6 and saint cloud pearson s r 0 24 p value 0 02 dwdss conversely a negative correlation between bacterial diversity and nitrate concentration was observed in ménilmontant pearson s r 0 27 p value 0 013 l haÿ les roses pearson s r 0 33 p value 0 001 and saint cloud pearson s r 0 22 p value 0 037 dwdss impact of physico chemical parameters on beta diversity was investigated using canonical correspondence analyses cca based on weighted unifrac distances however the constrained inertia values were low representing 1 9 of the total inertia considering either the relative abundance of all taxa 11 6 of the total inertia or the most abundant taxa only 8 02 of the total inertia data not shown therefore as minor taxa showed neglible impact on total inertia we further focused our analyses on the most abundant taxa with linear trends through pairwise pearson s correlation coefficients fig 7 nitrate concentration temperature conductivity and ph were the most influential parameters in contrast total chlorine and phosphate concentration had no significant impact on the most abundant taxa these results are not surprising since these two parameters are tightly monitored and controlled throughout the dwds to reach the same desired concentrations nitrate concentration appeared to have a positive impact on the relative abundance of the most represented taxa except for the undefined rhizobiales undefined hyphomicrobiaceae sm2d12 taxa and phreatobacter genera conversely higher ph led to a decrease in relative abundance of all major taxa except for the undefined rhizobiales and phreatoacter genera which are positively correlated with this parameter 3 4 bacterial abundance via heterotrophic plate count qpcr and high throughput sequencing concomitantly with the hts based monitoring of microbial communities we identified cultivable aerobic flora present in drinking water according to the european regulations through hpc hpc measured by accredited analytical laboratories showed a stability of cultivable aerobic flora in the four dwdss with a mean count between 2 and 4 colony forming units cfu ml moreover we estimated the total bacterial cells by qpcr targeting the 16s rrna genes the measured copy number of 16s rrna genes was on average 1 2 107 9 0 106 copy l in l haÿ les roses dwds 1 8 106 7 8 105 copy l in menilmontant dwds 1 2 106 4 7 105 copy l in montsouris dwds and 9 9 106 5 1 106 copy l in saint cloud dwds these results did not reveal any significant difference in a dwds during the campaign and between the dwdss underlying the stability in bacterial abundance kruskal wallis dunn s test pvalue 0 05 to identify the bacteria we isolated 1550 clones corresponding to 668 339 159 and 384 different colony forming units in l haÿ les roses ménilmontant montsouris and saint cloud dwdss respectively table a 5 the number of identified taxa based on the culture and high throughput sequencing is presented in table 1 in total 24 different taxa were identified using the culture based method while 1321 different taxa were identified using sequencing considering dwdss separately 1 3 1 8 of all detected taxa were covered by the culture based method from these identifying cultivable aerobic flora data rarefaction curves of colonies were produced and showed that our sampling effort was sufficient to capture the major part of the cultivable bacterial diversity present in the four dwdss figure a4 the cultivable flora was highly dominated by mycobacteria and bacteria from the sphingomonadaceae group which were also among the most abundant taxa detected by hts of the 16s rrna gene despite their high proportion in sequencing data no bacteria from the rhizobiales order was found in cultivable flora 4 discussion in the present work we studied the four different dwdss of the paris through a large campaign and aimed to analyse their microbial communities their changes and the impact of physico chemical parameters in total 1321 taxa were identified in the four dwdss although bacterial communities were dominated by 15 different taxa fig 2 interestingly 1071 out of the 1321 identified taxa were detected with a relative abundance lower than 0 01 such low abundances might question whether these identifications reflect live bacteria or simply relic dna carini et al 2016 li et al 2017 4 1 bacterial population is dominated by rhizobiales within the dwdss there was a clear domination of the rhizobiales order alphaproteobacteria with the two genera hyphomicrobium and phreatobacter hyphomicrobium was found as a predominant member of the drinking water of a dwds stanish et al 2016 it has been reported that the hyphomicrobium genus was particularly abundant in the biofilm of iron cast pipe which is the same material as that used in the four dwdss of paris ren et al 2015 we hypothesize that the high abundance of hyphomicrobium in our planktonic microbial population could result from biofilm indeed the balance between biofilm and plankton is very dynamic liu et al 2013 as a result biofilm detachments with a high abundance of hyphomicrobium bacteria could contribute to these observations the second predominant genus phreatobacter is scarcely documented the first description of this genus is originating from an ultrapure water purification system tóth et al 2014 to our knowledge only one study has highlighted the presence of this genus referred to as group f0723 sp in the drinking water microbial community stanish et al 2016 according to these authors hyphomicrobium and phreatobacter tended to be more abundant in waters with low chlorine concentration stanish et al 2016 in the paris network chlorine concentrations did not exceed 0 22 mg l 1 corresponding to the upper threshold of the eau de paris chlorination system therefore we could speculate that this low concentration could allow the hyphomicrobium and phreatobacter growth in microbial populations of the paris dwds 4 2 bacterial community composition is similar between the four dwdss the characterization of microbial communities through pcoa and permanova tests did not allow to differentiate specific populations according to spatial parameters a significant effect was nevertheless observed in community diversity though only in the saint cloud dwds which showed a lower diversity in the reservoir compared to the others this might have been observed only in the saint cloud dwds due to the spatial proximity between the reservoir and the drinking water treatment plant the poor differentiation of microbial communities between dwdss might be surprising as it is well described that the origin of water ground or surface water the treatment strategies applied biological filtration ozonation ultrafiltration and or chlorination and the dwds characteristics pipe materials hydraulic parameters residence time can impact bacterial populations composition and structure gomez alvarez et al 2015 ji et al 2015 pinto et al 2012 prest et al 2016a santos et al 2016 stanish et al 2016 recent works have highlighted that after water treatment bacterial communities of waters with different origins were similar liu et al 2018 and that these communities were stable until the end point tap roeselers et al 2015 besides other publications show differences in microbial communities from a spatial point of view gomez alvarez et al 2015 stanish et al 2016 in the present study saint cloud and montsouris dwds are supplied by groundwater while ménilmontant dwds is supplied by surface water and l haÿ les roses dwds contains a mix of groundwater and surface water from a technical point of view treatment represents the major difference as surface water receives additional biological filtration and ozonation steps despite these differences all four dwdss harboured similar microbial communities the only observed variations especially in terms of diversity involved bacterial taxa present in trace amounts 0 01 due to their low abundances these variations had minute impacts on the bacterial communities while the paris drinking water network is composed of four independent dwdss it must be noted that in case of maintenance or closing of one of the reservoir a dwds is fed by one of the other resources the rest of the time few interconnexions could occur between dwdss but the transferred volume is considered as negligible in any case origin of water could be traced through physico chemical indicators such as nitrate concentration or conductivity the poor differentiation of the bacterial diversity between the four dwdss might be explained by the long history of the paris network and the interconnexions that might have happened we could hypothesize that the biofilm is similar along the four networks and that it might impact on the diversity of planktonic bacteria 4 3 bacterial community composition is stable overtime regarding temporal parameters our results showed a moderate impact with an increase of bacterial diversity during summer and autumn but without changes in the community structure pinto et al have observed the same variation in diversity but with communities structures varying over time pinto et al 2014 other studies have shown an increase of diversity during winter potgieter et al 2018 or a stability of bacterial communities over time roeselers et al 2015 these different trends can be due to the specific characteristics of each dwds both in terms of the origin of the raw water used and therefore its physico chemical parameters the treatment systems and the size of the distribution network as each study look at different dwdss with specific features it is difficult to compare the results between each study and to define a common pattern for the bacterial communities variations in dwds 4 4 flooding could influence bacterial community composition the relative abundance of escherichia and legionella genera rose in june as well as in july such variability may be explained by different events like sudden climatic change and bacterial or predator increase invasion smeets et al 2009 interestingly high rainfall during late may 2016 caused a substantial rise of water and a rapid flow rate resulting in a flooding of the seine river in june 2016 river flooding typically leads to soil erosion which entails a high loading of suspended matter and organic compounds and therefore a significant increase of bacteria concentration in raw waters murshed et al 2014 this type of qualitative change in raw water input can affect the efficiency of a drinking water treatment plant and might subsequently be observed in the treated water consequently we hypothesize that differences in communities diversity and composition in june may be explained by the flooding event resulting in the rise of undesirable bacteria in treated water moreover escherichia and legionella genera were not detected by the culture based method implemented in the monitoring and control of dwds of paris by the eau de paris accredited laboratory thereby indicating that water distributed during this period complied with safety criteria for consumption this conclusion underlines the power of hts based monitoring of dwds which enabled the detection of dwds microbiome perturbations including taxa potentially containing pathogens at thresholds that are below the ones used in standards to ensure the microbiological safety of water tan et al 2015 4 5 physico chemical parameters poorly correlate with the bacterial community composition the observed variabilities of microbial communities were weakly explained by the impact of physico chemical parameters of water through cca it should be noted that we followed only some of a part of influential physico chemical parameters it has been demonstrated that variations in quantity and diversity of organic carbon compounds impact bacterial community structure and composition prest et al 2016a sulfate and oxygen concentrations can promote growth of sulfate reducing bacteria gomez smith et al 2015 and deficiency in trace elements e g metallic elements can result in bacterial growth limitation finney and o halloran 2003 comparisons based on pairwise pearson s coefficients highlighted correlations between abundances of the most abundant taxa and several of the monitored abiotic parameters fig 7 these taxa were for the most part positively influenced by nitrate concentration conductivity and temperature impact of nitrate concentration and conductivity are similar owing to their close correlation figure a3 conversely an increase of ph led to a decrease in the relative abundance of most abundant taxa the impact of chlorine and phosphate on most abundant taxa could not be adequately determined since their concentration is controlled chlorine is used as a residual treatment with order value of 0 2 mg l 1 of water and phosphate is used to precipitate soluble lead due to potential old pipe material in private household connected to the dwds due to the size and design of paris dwdss hydraulic parameters measurement could not reliably be implemented on the selected sampling sites changes in flow rates and shear stress were described to influence bacterial communities ji et al 2015 lautenschlager et al 2010 mathieu et al 2014 and further implementation of such variables may improve our understanding of bacterial community dynamics in such environments also the total organic carbon was always below 2 mg l 4 6 hts vs culture to assess dwdss bacterial diversity we compared the culture dependent method with the hts based characterization described in this study to evaluate the bacterial diversity captured by the culture dependent standard all isolated colonies were identified using maldi tof ms based on the identification of 1550 colonies 24 taxa were identified the proteobacteria phylum was clearly dominant encompassing 14 of the 24 identified bacterial genera as in most studies dealing with bacterial communities in drinking water pinto et al 2014 proctor and hammes 2015 while the isolation effort was sufficient to capture most of the cultivable diversity this approach covered only 1 3 1 8 of the bacterial diversity determined by hts to our knowledge our study is the first one to compare hts and culture at such as large scale moreover neither phreatobacter nor hyphomicrobium could be identified in the colonies indicating that they are most likely not cultivable in the conditions stipulated by european standards as with this current work another study showed the presence of phreatobacter and hyphomicrobium in high abundance in drinking water by hts without confirming its presence by culture method greenspan 2011 this comparison showed that only a minor fraction of bacterial diversity is accessible through classical monitoring techniques such as hpc indeed while hpc represents a useful and affordable way to monitor bacterial communities especially in a continuous manner the low cultivability fraction clearly highlights its poor sensitivity overall the present study provides arguments highlighting the power of using hts for describing and following the drinking water microbiome such implementation has now become inexpensive and is providing a level of detail that is likely to ensure improved water quality and security similar to the human microbiome drinking water microbiome can be viewed as a complex microbial community whose equilibrium is fragile changes induced by specific events e g flooding treatments or modification of process can result in perturbations dysbiosis of this microbiome current monitoring approaches are not sensitive enough to detect such modifications implementing hts in a routine monitoring of drinking water microbiome allow to i identify the healthy and steady state of the microbiome and ii detect perturbations events linked to external e g climate change and internal e g treatment changes in this way hts based monitoring provides a suited tool to help managing appropriate water treatments and network maintenances in response to various changes 5 conclusion we designed a sampling campaign with large spatial and temporal scales to characterize the bacterial communities in paris dwdss spatial distribution showed a clear homogeneity of communities between and within dwdss significant but moderate shifts in bacterial community composition were observed according to temporality variation in relative abundance of opportunistic pathogen and faecal indicators followed climatic event the use of unchanged processing in drinking water treatment plants and identical distribution systems for years permitted a quasi stabilization of bacterial populations between the four dwdss microbial monitoring using hts appeared as a pertinent and useful tool detecting fluctuations of bacterial populations and specific taxa with high sensitivity declarations of interest none

19158,the microbiological water quality of drinking water distribution system dwds is of primary importance for human health high throughput sequencing has gained more and more attention in the last decade to describe this microbial diversity in water networks however there are few studies describing this approach on large drinking water distribution systems and for extended periods of time to fill this gap and observe the potential subtle variation in microbiota of a water network through time and space we aimed to apply high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene approach to characterize bacterial communities of the paris dwds over a one year period in this study the paris network composed of four different dwdss was sampled at 31 sites each month for one year the sampling campaign was one of the largest described so far n 368 and the importance of key spatio temporal and physico chemical parameters was investigated overall 1321 taxa were identified within the paris network although only fifteen of them were found in high relative abundance 1 in all samples two genera phreatobacter and hyphomicrobium were dominant the whole bacterial diversity was not significantly affected between the four dwdss spatial parameter and by physico chemical parameters however the bacterial diversity was slightly modified over the one year period temporal parameter as we were able to observe dwds microbiome perturbations presumably linked to a preceding flood event comparison of high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene amplicons vs cultivation based techniques showed that only 1 8 of bacterial diversity was recovered through cultivation high throughput sequencing has made it possible to monitor dwds more accurately than conventional methods by describing the whole diversity and detecting slight fluctuations in bacterial communities this method would be further used to supervise drinking water networks to follow any perturbations due to internals events such as treatments or external events such as flooding graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbiome drinking water bacteria ecology 16s 1 introduction water quality is crucial for human health therefore drinking water is carefully protected monitored and managed proctor and hammes 2015 the quality of water in drinking water distribution systems dwds depends on different parameters including microbial indicators chemical composition is also monitored by several parameters following the who recommendation and state regulation world health organization 2017 for over a century microbial quality of drinking water has been assessed mainly by measuring of cultivable bacteria i e heterotrophic plate count hpc frankland and frankland 1894 and detection of faecal indicators anderson et al 2005 however these estimators do not represent a reliable proxy for assessing the microbial diversity dwelling in drinking water i hpc are indicators of the water degradation through the water network but only a slight fraction of bacteria found in water is measurable by hpc staley and konopka 1985 and ii faecal indicators escherichia coli and enterococcus are monitored for the efficacy of the water treatment and detection of faecal pathogens saxena et al 2015 by definition they are not related to other pathogens like opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens oppp ashbolt 2015a issues that can be encountered at a drinking water treatment plant or during water distribution can lead to proliferation of opportunistic pathogens such as mycobacterium spp pseudomonas aeruginosa and legionella pneumophila ashbolt 2015b lu et al 2015 among others concerning drinking water utilities bacterial overgrowth can lead to technical complications during distribution such as pipe fouling or biocorrosion due to biofilm development or degradation of water quality allion et al 2011 nawrocki et al 2010 drinking water with a low variation of bacterial communities between the point of production and the tap can be considered as biologically stable prest et al 2016a therefore the abundance and composition of microbial communities along the drinking water network are key parameters to allow a fine monitoring of drinking water s microbiological composition across time and space to date such analyses are not routinely done but new tools might be developed to allow this approach in the future liu et al 2018 currently the microbiome depicting the whole microbial diversity can be characterized by the use of high throughput sequencing hts which allows culture independent analysis of this diversity caporaso et al 2011 goodrich et al 2014 there are several studies describing the microbiome of drinking water ji et al 2015 pinto et al 2014 2012 roeselers et al 2015 shaw et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 a review has recently pointed out the usefulness of hts in assessing of microbial water quality tan et al 2015 for example by enabling the detection of any genome of faecal indicator bacteria pathogens tracking antibiotic resistance genes and anticipating the biodegradation of pollutants these investigations showed that bacterial diversity might be influenced by raw water origin gomez alvarez et al 2015 ji et al 2015 various treatment steps lin et al 2014 pinto et al 2012 chlorination type if any hwang et al 2012 stanish et al 2016 pipeline material ji et

2018 prest et al 2016b roeselers et al 2015 while these studies have greatly helped to define and understand the drinking water microbiome most were conducted on limited space e g building or time scales e g one month sampling using simulated pipe systems in laboratory conditions for some knowledge about the spatial and temporal microbial diversity consequently remains scarce especially in the context of large cities pinto et al 2014 potgieter et al 2018 roeselers et al 2015 to fill this gap we performed in our study a large scale sampling campaign over one year in the four different dwdss supplying the city of paris france high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes was used to characterize and monitor bacterial communities in these samples our objective was to understand which factors could influence the microbiome such as the origin of water groundwater or surface water temporality and the selected physico chemical parameters and also to compare microbial variation with the required data provided by hpc 2 materials and methods 2 1 network features and sample collection the city of paris is supplied in drinking water with four separated dwdss each of them is composed of one reservoir storing treated drinking water for short periods of time and of one distribution network supplied by the affiliated reservoir fig 1 paris distribution networks are complex a factor which greatly hampers the estimation of water time of residency and pipe length from the reservoir the total size of the network is estimated at 1800 km of cast iron pipes an estimation of the direct distances between the sampling points and the reservoirs is presented in table a1 they are between 1 and 16 km on average the residence time of drinking water in the pipes is roughly estimated at 24 h saint cloud and montsouris dwdss are supplied with groundwater from multiple sources around paris ménilmontant dwds is supplied with surface water from the marne river and l haÿ les roses dwds is supplied with a mix of groundwater and surface water from the seine river groundwater is treated with a filtration on activated charcoal and an ultrafiltration surface water is treated with a succession of physical or biological filtrations pre ozonation decantation pre filtration and sand filtration and ozonation stages before undergoing filtration on granulated activated charcoal and ultraviolet disinfection prior to chlorination and distribution for each of the four dwdss we collected the reservoir and the distribution network at different sites monthly one sample corresponding to the reservoir was collected monthly in each dwds seven sites for montsouris l haÿ les roses and saint cloud dwdss and six sites for ménilmontant dwds were sampled monthly on the pipes of the distribution network fig 1 table a 1 due to technical problems sampling on the seventh point of menilmontant dwds was stopped after two months it is therefore not included in the analysis in order to minimize the influence of stagnation in private networks pepper et al 2004 the samples were not collected at household taps but rather directly on the final point of the distribution network from month to month sampling from a sampling site could vary by one or two days in total from march 2016 to february 2017 368 water samples of 1 l were collected and transported to the laboratory at 4 c they were processed within 24 h and monitored according to the european regulation and physico chemical parameters were documented temperature ph total chlorine conductivity nitrate and phosphate concentrations these parameters were measured in situ using standardized procedures by the eau de paris accredited laboratory nf t90 008 for ph nf en iso 7393 2 and nf en 27888 for chlorine concentration and conductivity respectively all the information of each sample is available in appendix b 2 2 dna purification and amplicon sequencing one liter water samples were filtered through a 0

without any mismatch 84 0 and 49 3 of bacterial and archaeal sequences respectively pcr and sequencing were subcontracted by the genotyping and sequencing platform of the institut du cerveau et de la moelle épinière paris france https icm institute org fr briefly amplicons were amplified 35 cycles using faststart pcr master kit roche life science with a 20 bp adaptor at each end index and processing p5 and p7 sequence were added in a second pcr step using faststart high fidelity pcr system kit roche life science the amplicon libraries were sequenced 2 x 250 bp paired end using an illumina miseq platform using a 2 x 250 bp paired end the process of demultiplexing was carried out automatically at the end of sequencing 2 3 sequence data processing sequences were analysed using the qiime quantitative insights into microbial ecology pipeline version 1 9 0 http qiime org caporaso et al 2010b the 20bp of each adaptor were removed on each side before sequence data processing sequences harbouring an overall quality score below 30 and more than 3 ambiguous bases were discarded chimeras were identified and discarded using usearch 6 1 edgar 2010 remaining reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity threshold using uclust edgar 2010 singletons i e otus represented by less than 2 sequences were not considered in subsequent analyses a representative sequence for each otu corresponding to the most abundant sequence was picked sequences were aligned using pynast v1 2 2 caporaso et al 2010a taxonomy was assigned up to the genus level using uclust consensus taxonomy assigner coupled with the silva database release 128 quast et al 2013 illumina miseq amplicon sequencing enabled us to obtain 47 277 387 v3 v4 16s rrna gene sequences

blank samples corresponding to the extraction and sequencing of seven cellulose acetate membrane which had no contact with water were performed comparison of blanks vs samples was performed using principal coordinates analyses pcoa based on their weighted unifrac distances as detailed below fig 3 additionally the decontam r package was used to identify and eliminate contaminating otus by comparing prevalence of each otus in blanks and samples after sequence data processing davis et al 2017 thus 5315 otus corresponding to 381 107 sequences were removed the final dataset was consequently composed of 136 386 otus an average of 59 725 2155 mean se sequences was obtained for each sample 2 5 statistical analyses of samples the final biom file generated by qiime was imported in r version 3 3 3 r core team 2017 large sequence number variations across samples can affect relative abundance estimates and subsequent ordination analyses goodrich et al 2014 weiss et al 2017 to prevent such bias the final otu table was normalized with the package metagenomeseq paulson et al 2013 using a method where counts of each sample were scaled by the sample sum afterwards microbial communities were explored using the phyloseq package mcmurdie and holmes 2013 comparisons of microbial diversity across dwds location or temporality were performed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova anderson 2001 with 999 permutations and beta dispersivity analyses betadisper function using the vegan package oksanen et al 2017 pcoa were performed with the phyloseq package mcmurdie and holmes 2013 using quantitative bray curtis and weighted unifrac or qualitative compositional dissimilarities jaccard and unweighted unifrac table a 2 pairwise pearson s correlations were performed to assess the relationships between physico chemical parameters and the most abundant taxa or bacterial diversity pielou s evenness was calculated with the microbiome package lahti et al 2017 2 6 heterotrophic plate count for each sample heterotrophic cultivable bacteria were cultured according to nf en iso 6222 briefly 1 ml of drinking water was grown on r2a agar plates which are commonly used to monitor cultivable bacteria from water samples for 3 days at 22 c or 2 days at 36 c identification of bacterial colonies was performed by matrix assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms bacterial colonies were transferred onto stainless steel target and 1 μl of 70 formic acid was added to each spot of the target to facilitate

composition are similar between the four dwds to assess the bacterial diversity and modification of a large drinking water network a one year sampling campaign was performed in the four dwdss of paris overall 368 drinking water samples were collected their total dna was purified amplified using 16s rrna primers and sequenced all otus were assigned to 1321 different taxa among which 544 were shared by the four networks fig 2 a table a 3 we identified 331 taxa present in only one of the four dwdss although with very low relative abundances 0 01 focusing on the most abundant taxa 1 relative abundance shared by the four dwds bacterial communities exhibited low variations as they were dominated by only 15 different taxa representing 64 4 72 7 of the relative abundance alphaproteobacteria was the most dominant class in all samples with a high proportion of two orders namely rhizobiales and sphingomonadales rhizobiales were mostly represented by phreatobacter and hyphomicrobium genera fig 2b hyphomicrobium was highly dominant representing up to 34 1 of relative abundance in montsouris dwds in the four networks without significant difference tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 phreatobacter was significantly more abundant in ménilmontant dwds accounting for 23 7 of the sequences in contrast with montsouris saint cloud and l haÿ les roses dwds accounting for 4 5 10 3 and 4 5 respectively tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 the sphingomonadales order also presented high relative abundance in montsouris saint cloud and l haÿ les roses dwdss 16 2 17 1 and 19 2 respectively with a high proportion of sphingorhabdus sphingomonas and sphingopyxis whereas this order represented only 9 6 in ménilmontant dwds tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 according to sample location i e reservoirs or distribution networks fig 1 the relative abundance of microbial communities differed in each dwds fig 2c most of the abundant taxa 1 relative abundance showed dwds specific colonization patterns for example no difference in relative abundance of acidovorax genus and undefined comamonadaceae were observed between reservoir and the distribution network of montsouris and l haÿ les roses dwds unlike ménilmontant and saint cloud dwds where their relative abundance varied student s test p value 0 05 therefore no general pattern of bacterial diversity with respect to sample location could be established with the exception of rhizobiales whose abundance increased significantly from the reservoirs to the final distribution points student s test p value 0 05 bacterial alpha diversity was assessed for each sample through calculation of shannon h indexes figure a1 no significant differences were observed between the bacterial alpha diversity of the four dwdss tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 figure a1a focusing on microbial diversity according to sample location no differences were observed between the reservoir and its associated distribution network in montsouris ménilmontant and l haÿ les roses dwdss shannon h index student test p value 0 05 figure a1b on the contrary saint cloud dwds showed significantly higher alpha diversity in distribution network in comparison with the reservoir student s test p value 0 05 calculation of pielou s evenness indexes indicated that all analysed samples regardless of the dwds were above 0 94 figure a2 such high evenness indexes underline a strong equitability of microbial communities across spatial gradient considering beta diversity pcoa using weighted unifrac distance between bacterial communities did not highlight any marked difference between dwdss fig 3 thus dwds origin did not appear as a strong driver of phylogenetic dissimilarity although the permanova test supported a significant impact of this parameter the variation explained by dwds origin was very low r 2 0 12 p value 0 001 table a 2 the impact of sample locations was also investigated considering the whole microbial community with permanova tests followed by beta dispersivity analyses the location of samples explained only 4 9 of the variation between communities r 2 0 05 p value 0 001 table a 2 beta dispersivity analysis showed divergent results depending on the networks and metrics used the same analyses were performed on each dwds separately and comparable results were obtained 3 2 bacterial diversity is influenced by temporality the sampling scheme presented in this study permitted the assessment changes of bacterial diversity in dwdss over a full year fig 4 the following highly abundant taxa showed significant variations along the year relative abundance of phreatobacter maricaulis and mycobacterium genera was significantly higher during warm period june 2016 to october 2016 corresponding to a water temperature 15 c than during cold period march 2016 to may 2016 and november 2016 to february 2017 water temperature 15 c in the four dwdss student s test p value 0 05 conversely hyphomicrobium and pseudomonas abundances were significantly higher during cold period than in warm period student s test p value 0 05 the genera of sphingomonadaceae family were not affected by these periods student s test p value 0 05 except for the sphingomonas and sphingopyxis genera whose relative abundance was higher in cold period student s test p value 0 05 as regards the shannon h index l haÿ les roses and montsouris dwdss showed a significant decrease in bacterial diversity during cold period as compared to warm period fig 5 student s test p value 0 05 furthermore some temporal changes i e a monthly scale were observed bacterial diversity was significantly lower in march and april 2016 in montsouris dwds and between december 2016 to february 2017 in l haÿ les roses ménilmontant and montsouris dwdss compared to july to october 2016 fig 5 tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 because of this bacterial diversity seems to evolve on a parabolic pattern these observations constitute trends in saint cloud dwds in addition a significant decrease in microbial diversity was observed during the month of june fig 5 tukey hsd adjusted p value 0 05 although this difference did not modify the composition of the most abundant taxa fig 4 the relative abundance of legionella and escherichia genera increased drastically during the year legionella and escherichia showed a relative abundance of 0 10 and 0 14 in average respectively over the june july period their relative abundance reached 0 65 and 1 35 respectively this increase may be correlated with the exceptional rise of the seine river level in june 2016 fig 6 other bacterial genera known to contain oppps such as mycobacterium and pseudomonas or faecal indicators such as enterococcus did not present significant variations in relative abundance impact of temporality and temperature periods parameters on bacterial community were analysed with permanova tests table a 2 the variability of microbial communities was poorly explained by these two parameters r 2 0 13 p value 0 01 r 2 0 05 p value 0 01 respectively and showed a heterogeneity of dispersion however temporality seems to have a moderate impact on the bacterial community of each dwds considered independently of one another since 21 23 of the variability is explained by this parameter 3 3 bacterial community composition is poorly explained by the physico chemical parameters several physico chemical parameters total chlorine electrical conductivity ph temperature phosphate and nitrate concentrations were measured for each water sample and compared using pearson s correlation and pca figure a3 nitrate concentration and conductivity are linked pearson s r 0 61 p value 0 001 and inversely correlated with ph pearson s r 0 42 p value 0 001 analyses of average and range of the different parameters suggest that nitrate concentration and conductivity depend on water origin table a 4 respectively they are on average 27 9 mg l and 523 μs cm in l haÿ les roses dwds 22 2 mg l and 535 7 μs cm in menilmontant dwds 36 7 mg l and 585 9 μs cm in montsouris dwds and 33 7 mg l and 537 8 μs cm in saint cloud dwds chlorine and phosphate concentration varied slightly between the 4 dwdss from 0 11 to 0 13 mg l and 1 02 mg l to 1 09 mg l respectively ph varied to 7 5 to 7 8 on average the temperature is 13 8 c in l haÿ les roses dwds 12 5 c in menilmontant dwds 14 1 c in montsouris dwds and 13 4 c in saint cloud dwds then we assessed the possible correlation between physico chemical parameters and bacterial diversity a correlation between alpha diversity based on shannon h index and water temperature was observed in ménilmontant pearson s r 0 39 p value 2 42e 4 montsouris pearson s r 0 60 p value 1 63e 10 l haÿ les roses pearson s r 0 47 p value 1 78e 6 and saint cloud pearson s r 0 24 p value 0 02 dwdss conversely a negative correlation between bacterial diversity and nitrate concentration was observed in ménilmontant pearson s r 0 27 p value 0 013 l haÿ les roses pearson s r 0 33 p value 0 001 and saint cloud pearson s r 0 22 p value 0 037 dwdss impact of physico chemical parameters on beta diversity was investigated using canonical correspondence analyses cca based on weighted unifrac distances however the constrained inertia values were low representing 1 9 of the total inertia considering either the relative abundance of all taxa 11 6 of the total inertia or the most abundant taxa only 8 02 of the total inertia data not shown therefore as minor taxa showed neglible impact on total inertia we further focused our analyses on the most abundant taxa with linear trends through pairwise pearson s correlation coefficients fig 7 nitrate concentration temperature conductivity and ph were the most influential parameters in contrast total chlorine and phosphate concentration had no significant impact on the most abundant taxa these results are not surprising since these two parameters are tightly monitored and controlled throughout the dwds to reach the same desired concentrations nitrate concentration appeared to have a positive impact on the relative abundance of the most represented taxa except for the undefined rhizobiales undefined hyphomicrobiaceae sm2d12 taxa and phreatobacter genera conversely higher ph led to a decrease in relative abundance of all major taxa except for the undefined rhizobiales and phreatoacter genera which are positively correlated with this parameter 3 4 bacterial abundance via heterotrophic plate count qpcr and high throughput sequencing concomitantly with the hts based monitoring of microbial communities we identified cultivable aerobic flora present in drinking water according to the european regulations through hpc hpc measured by accredited analytical laboratories showed a stability of cultivable aerobic flora in the four dwdss with a mean count between 2 and 4 colony forming units cfu ml moreover we estimated the total bacterial cells by qpcr targeting the 16s rrna genes the measured copy number of 16s rrna genes was on average 1 2 107 9 0 106 copy l in l haÿ les roses dwds 1 8 106 7 8 105 copy l in menilmontant dwds 1 2 106 4 7 105 copy l in montsouris dwds and 9 9 106 5 1 106 copy l in saint cloud dwds these results did not reveal any significant difference in a dwds during the campaign and between the dwdss underlying the stability in bacterial abundance kruskal wallis dunn s test pvalue 0 05 to identify the bacteria we isolated 1550 clones corresponding to 668 339 159 and 384 different colony forming units in l haÿ les roses ménilmontant montsouris and saint cloud dwdss respectively table a 5 the number of identified taxa based on the culture and high throughput sequencing is presented in table 1 in total 24 different taxa were identified using the culture based method while 1321 different taxa were identified using sequencing considering dwdss separately 1 3 1 8 of all detected taxa were covered by the culture based method from these identifying cultivable aerobic flora data rarefaction curves of colonies were produced and showed that our sampling effort was sufficient to capture the major part of the cultivable bacterial diversity present in the four dwdss figure a4 the cultivable flora was highly dominated by mycobacteria and bacteria from the sphingomonadaceae group which were also among the most abundant taxa detected by hts of the 16s rrna gene despite their high proportion in sequencing data no bacteria from the rhizobiales order was found in cultivable flora 4 discussion in the present work we studied the four different dwdss of the paris through a large campaign and aimed to analyse their microbial communities their changes and the impact of physico chemical parameters in total 1321 taxa were identified in the four dwdss although bacterial communities were dominated by 15 different taxa fig 2 interestingly 1071 out of the 1321 identified taxa were detected with a relative abundance lower than 0 01 such low abundances might question whether these identifications reflect live bacteria or simply relic dna carini et al 2016 li et al 2017 4 1 bacterial population is dominated by rhizobiales within the dwdss there was a clear domination of the rhizobiales order alphaproteobacteria with the two genera hyphomicrobium and phreatobacter hyphomicrobium was found as a predominant member of the drinking water of a dwds stanish et al 2016 it has been reported that the hyphomicrobium genus was particularly abundant in the biofilm of iron cast pipe which is the same material as that used in the four dwdss of paris ren et al 2015 we hypothesize that the high abundance of hyphomicrobium in our planktonic microbial population could result from biofilm indeed the balance between biofilm and plankton is very dynamic liu et al 2013 as a result biofilm detachments with a high abundance of hyphomicrobium bacteria could contribute to these observations the second predominant genus phreatobacter is scarcely documented the first description of this genus is originating from an ultrapure water purification system tóth et al 2014 to our knowledge only one study has highlighted the presence of this genus referred to as group f0723 sp in the drinking water microbial community stanish et al 2016 according to these authors hyphomicrobium and phreatobacter tended to be more abundant in waters with low chlorine concentration stanish et al 2016 in the paris network chlorine concentrations did not exceed 0 22 mg l 1 corresponding to the upper threshold of the eau de paris chlorination system therefore we could speculate that this low concentration could allow the hyphomicrobium and phreatobacter growth in microbial populations of the paris dwds 4 2 bacterial community composition is similar between the four dwdss the characterization of microbial communities through pcoa and permanova tests did not allow to differentiate specific populations according to spatial parameters a significant effect was nevertheless observed in community diversity though only in the saint cloud dwds which showed a lower diversity in the reservoir compared to the others this might have been observed only in the saint cloud dwds due to the spatial proximity between the reservoir and the drinking water treatment plant the poor differentiation of microbial communities between dwdss might be surprising as it is well described that the origin of water ground or surface water the treatment strategies applied biological filtration ozonation ultrafiltration and or chlorination and the dwds characteristics pipe materials hydraulic parameters residence time can impact bacterial populations composition and structure gomez alvarez et al 2015 ji et al 2015 pinto et al 2012 prest et al 2016a santos et al 2016 stanish et al 2016 recent works have highlighted that after water treatment bacterial communities of waters with different origins were similar liu et al 2018 and that these communities were stable until the end point tap roeselers et al 2015 besides other publications show differences in microbial communities from a spatial point of view gomez alvarez et al 2015 stanish et al 2016 in the present study saint cloud and montsouris dwds are supplied by groundwater while ménilmontant dwds is supplied by surface water and l haÿ les roses dwds contains a mix of groundwater and surface water from a technical point of view treatment represents the major difference as surface water receives additional biological filtration and ozonation steps despite these differences all four dwdss harboured similar microbial communities the only observed variations especially in terms of diversity involved bacterial taxa present in trace amounts 0 01 due to their low abundances these variations had minute impacts on the bacterial communities while the paris drinking water network is composed of four independent dwdss it must be noted that in case of maintenance or closing of one of the reservoir a dwds is fed by one of the other resources the rest of the time few interconnexions could occur between dwdss but the transferred volume is considered as negligible in any case origin of water could be traced through physico chemical indicators such as nitrate concentration or conductivity the poor differentiation of the bacterial diversity between the four dwdss might be explained by the long history of the paris network and the interconnexions that might have happened we could hypothesize that the biofilm is similar along the four networks and that it might impact on the diversity of planktonic bacteria 4 3 bacterial community composition is stable overtime regarding temporal parameters our results showed a moderate impact with an increase of bacterial diversity during summer and autumn but without changes in the community structure pinto et al have observed the same variation in diversity but with communities structures varying over time pinto et al 2014 other studies have shown an increase of diversity during winter potgieter et al 2018 or a stability of bacterial communities over time roeselers et al 2015 these different trends can be due to the specific characteristics of each dwds both in terms of the origin of the raw water used and therefore its physico chemical parameters the treatment systems and the size of the distribution network as each study look at different dwdss with specific features it is difficult to compare the results between each study and to define a common pattern for the bacterial communities variations in dwds 4 4 flooding could influence bacterial community composition the relative abundance of escherichia and legionella genera rose in june as well as in july such variability may be explained by different events like sudden climatic change and bacterial or predator increase invasion smeets et al 2009 interestingly high rainfall during late may 2016 caused a substantial rise of water and a rapid flow rate resulting in a flooding of the seine river in june 2016 river flooding typically leads to soil erosion which entails a high loading of suspended matter and organic compounds and therefore a significant increase of bacteria concentration in raw waters murshed et al 2014 this type of qualitative change in raw water input can affect the efficiency of a drinking water treatment plant and might subsequently be observed in the treated water consequently we hypothesize that differences in communities diversity and composition in june may be explained by the flooding event resulting in the rise of undesirable bacteria in treated water moreover escherichia and legionella genera were not detected by the culture based method implemented in the monitoring and control of dwds of paris by the eau de paris accredited laboratory thereby indicating that water distributed during this period complied with safety criteria for consumption this conclusion underlines the power of hts based monitoring of dwds which enabled the detection of dwds microbiome perturbations including taxa potentially containing pathogens at thresholds that are below the ones used in standards to ensure the microbiological safety of water tan et al 2015 4 5 physico chemical parameters poorly correlate with the bacterial community composition the observed variabilities of microbial communities were weakly explained by the impact of physico chemical parameters of water through cca it should be noted that we followed only some of a part of influential physico chemical parameters it has been demonstrated that variations in quantity and diversity of organic carbon compounds impact bacterial community structure and composition prest et al 2016a sulfate and oxygen concentrations can promote growth of sulfate reducing bacteria gomez smith et al 2015 and deficiency in trace elements e g metallic elements can result in bacterial growth limitation finney and o halloran 2003 comparisons based on pairwise pearson s coefficients highlighted correlations between abundances of the most abundant taxa and several of the monitored abiotic parameters fig 7 these taxa were for the most part positively influenced by nitrate concentration conductivity and temperature impact of nitrate concentration and conductivity are similar owing to their close correlation figure a3 conversely an increase of ph led to a decrease in the relative abundance of most abundant taxa the impact of chlorine and phosphate on most abundant taxa could not be adequately determined since their concentration is controlled chlorine is used as a residual treatment with order value of 0 2 mg l 1 of water and phosphate is used to precipitate soluble lead due to potential old pipe material in private household connected to the dwds due to the size and design of paris dwdss hydraulic parameters measurement could not reliably be implemented on the selected sampling sites changes in flow rates and shear stress were described to influence bacterial communities ji et al 2015 lautenschlager et al 2010 mathieu et al 2014 and further implementation of such variables may improve our understanding of bacterial community dynamics in such environments also the total organic carbon was always below 2 mg l 4 6 hts vs culture to assess dwdss bacterial diversity we compared the culture dependent method with the hts based characterization described in this study to evaluate the bacterial diversity captured by the culture dependent standard all isolated colonies were identified using maldi tof ms based on the identification of 1550 colonies 24 taxa were identified the proteobacteria phylum was clearly dominant encompassing 14 of the 24 identified bacterial genera as in most studies dealing with bacterial communities in drinking water pinto et al 2014 proctor and hammes 2015 while the isolation effort was sufficient to capture most of the cultivable diversity this approach covered only 1 3 1 8 of the bacterial diversity determined by hts to our knowledge our study is the first one to compare hts and culture at such as large scale moreover neither phreatobacter nor hyphomicrobium could be identified in the colonies indicating that they are most likely not cultivable in the conditions stipulated by european standards as with this current work another study showed the presence of phreatobacter and hyphomicrobium in high abundance in drinking water by hts without confirming its presence by culture method greenspan 2011 this comparison showed that only a minor fraction of bacterial diversity is accessible through classical monitoring techniques such as hpc indeed while hpc represents a useful and affordable way to monitor bacterial communities especially in a continuous manner the low cultivability fraction clearly highlights its poor sensitivity overall the present study provides arguments highlighting the power of using hts for describing and following the drinking water microbiome such implementation has now become inexpensive and is providing a level of detail that is likely to ensure improved water quality and security similar to the human microbiome drinking water microbiome can be viewed as a complex microbial community whose equilibrium is fragile changes induced by specific events e g flooding treatments or modification of process can result in perturbations dysbiosis of this microbiome current monitoring approaches are not sensitive enough to detect such modifications implementing hts in a routine monitoring of drinking water microbiome allow to i identify the healthy and steady state of the microbiome and ii detect perturbations events linked to external e g climate change and internal e g treatment changes in this way hts based monitoring provides a suited tool to help managing appropriate water treatments and network maintenances in response to various changes 5 conclusion we designed a sampling campaign with large spatial and temporal scales to characterize the bacterial communities in paris dwdss spatial distribution showed a clear homogeneity of communities between and within dwdss significant but moderate shifts in bacterial community composition were observed according to temporality variation in relative abundance of opportunistic pathogen and faecal indicators followed climatic event the use of unchanged processing in drinking water treatment plants and identical distribution systems for years permitted a quasi stabilization of bacterial populations between the four dwdss microbial monitoring using hts appeared as a pertinent and useful tool detecting fluctuations of bacterial populations and specific taxa with high sensitivity declarations of interest none

19159,the ability of soils and sediments to promote in situ activation of persulfate and persulfate combined with hydrogen peroxide was investigated for treatment of 1 4 dioxane dioxane experiments were conducted with both batch reactor and column systems to examine reaction rates and activation mechanisms four soils and aquifer sediments were used icp ms and xrd analyses were used to characterize geochemical properties of the solutions and sediments while epr spectroscopy was used to characterize radical formation for the batch experiments degradation of dioxane was significantly greater in the presence of each of the four subsurface geomedia compared to the controls with no geomedia this indicates that all four geomedia induced oxidant activation thereby enhancing dioxane degradation dioxane degradation was significantly enhanced by the addition of peroxide to the persulfate solution it is hypothesized that iron associated with the geomedia is primarily responsible for activation and that the degree of degradation enhancement relates in part to dissolved phase iron content epr results indicate that manganese oxides and soil organic matter may also have contributed to some degree to persulfate activation and that manganese oxides enhanced activation of peroxide under the study conditions approximately 10 of dioxane was degraded in the miscible displacement experiments consistent with the short residence time compared to dioxane s half life the pseudo first order rate coefficients obtained from the batch and column experiments were similar the results of this study indicate that subsurface geomedia can induce activation of persulfate and peroxide to enhance in situ chemical oxidation applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural oxidant activation dioxane persulfate hydrogen peroxide 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane dioxane is a probable carcinogenic compound that commonly co occurs with chlorinated solvent compounds in groundwater iarc 1999 anderson et al 2012 adamson et al 2015 extensive groundwater contaminant plumes of dioxane are readily formed due to its high water solubility and low sorption and such plumes are present at many sites zenker et al 2003 isaacson et al 2006 mohr et al 2010 adamson et al 2014 the cost effective management of dioxane plumes is a challenging endeavor given the physical and chemical properties of dioxane and is a current focus of research few alternatives to pump and treat exist for remediating large groundwater contaminant plumes nrc 2013 monitored natural attenuation mna is one potential option of great interest however its effectiveness is often limited for plumes comprised of dioxane and chlorinated solvent compounds methods to increase the rates of natural attenuation i e enhanced attenuation and thus improve the effectiveness of mna are being investigated one concept of particular interest is the potential for using the capacity of resident soils and sediments to foment abiotic oxidative or reductive transformation of the target contaminants it is well known that certain constituents of geomedia can promote abiotic transformation reactions for some contaminants laha and luthy 1990 hofstetter et al 1999 li and lee 1999 elsner et al 2004 neumann et al 2009 ahmad et al 2010 however the rates of attenuation associated with these reactions are typically insufficient to effect or maintain plume stasis prior research has investigated the use of oxidant reductant reagents to synergize with geomedia to enhance attenuation rates for example it has been shown that certain minerals can activate persulfate or hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to enhance oxidation of contaminants such as trichloroethene tce pentachlorophenol and benzene ravikumar and gurol 1994 ahmad et al 2010 teel et al 2011 huang et al 2012 yan et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2014 however the oxidant catalysis potential of subsurface sediment is likely influenced by many properties and factors given the physical and geochemical complexity of the media hence results obtained with specific minerals in isolation may not always be representative of the overall catalysis capacity of natural bulk sediment the results of recent research indicate that advanced oxidation processes implemented with activated persulfate particularly in some combination with other oxidants is effective for degradation of dioxane e g zhao et al 2014 zhong et al 2015 eberle et al 2016 yan et al 2016 very few studies have investigated the effectiveness of persulfate activation by natural aquifer materials sra et al 2010 liu et al 2014 and these few studies have focused on oxidant activation and not on the efficacy of contaminant degradation nor on dioxane specifically the objective of the current study is to investigate the capacity of natural soils and sediments to activate a binary persulfate peroxide system to specifically enhance in situ degradation of dioxane this work is focused on a binary oxidant system as opposed to the traditional fenton like reaction activated hydrogen peroxide because while the rates of dioxane degradation are similar the oxidant decomposition rate is much faster for the peroxide only system compared to the binary persulfate peroxide system which results in excessive waste of oxidant figure s1 the addition of persulfate moderates the decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide yan et al 2013 2015 batch and column experiments are conducted with four natural geomedia x ray diffraction xrd and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms are used to characterize solid and aqueous phase geochemistry while electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy is used to characterize radical formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials four natural

standard sandy alluvial aquifer sediment florence mr was collected from florence military reservation az camp gruber was collected from camp gruber ok florence mr and camp gruber were chosen due to their higher clay and lower organic carbon oc contents the br1 soil was collected from a site in brazil and has high iron and organic carbon contents commercially available natural silica sand 40 50

co usa 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 98 was purchased from matrix scientific columbia sc the concentration of dioxane was 0 57 mm 50 mg l for all experiments which is representative of the upper range of groundwater concentrations reported for contaminated sites mohr et al 2010 concentrations of persulfate and peroxide were 6 3 mm and 150 mm 1190 mg l and 5100 mg l respectively for most experiments based on results of our prior work that showed that these concentrations produced significant contaminant degradation while maintaining moderate oxidant utilization yan et al 2013 while these oxidant concentrations are significantly greater than the concentration of dioxane they are much lower than the concentrations typically used for standard field isco applications itrc 2005 these lower concentrations are employed to enhance cost effectiveness of projected field scale applications 2 2 batch experiments the degradation of dioxane by persulfate alone and by a persulfate peroxide binary solution was measured using batch reactors batch experiments in duplicate were conducted at a room temperature of 25 1 c with borosilicate vials fitted with ptfe septum caps each vial contained 5 g of the selected subsurface media for the persulfate system solutions of 21 mm na2s2o8 and 11 3 mm dioxane were mixed 6 1 v v in the vial for the persulfate h2o2 binary oxidant system solutions of 21 mm na2s2o8 300 mm h2o2 and 11 3 mm dioxane were mixed 6 10 1 v v v in the vial ultrapure water was added to a final volume of 40 ml subsamples 0 5 ml were collected over the course of the batch experiment extracted with 0 5 ml hexane and centrifuged for 5 min to separate solid and liquid phases the samples 10 μl were then analyzed immediately using gas chromatography a preliminary experiment was conducted for 192 h using persulfate and peroxide in the presence of florence soil to characterize temporal dioxane degradation behavior figure s2 there was minimal degradation after 36 h and 98 h under persulfate alone and persulfate peroxide combined conditions respectively therefore the experiments were conducted for a maximum of 98 h several control treatments were conducted during the experiments the first control contained only ultrapure water and dioxane which was used to monitor non oxidative mass loss of dioxane during the experiment the purpose of the second control dioxane oxidant with no sediment was to determine dioxane degradation by oxidant in the absence of porous media the third control dioxane solution with porous media but no oxidant tested for sorption and native sediment associated degradation potential of dioxane the fourth control was conducted to provide a comparison to the standard isco approach of using dissolved iron feso4 to activate the binary persulfate hydrogen peroxide system for this control the same dioxane persulfate and peroxide concentrations were used and no sediment was added the concentration of feso4 was 0 8 mm 121 6 mg l a set of experiments was conducted to characterize the formation of radicals for the different treatments described above to support delineation of operative activation oxidation mechanisms radical generation was detected by epr spectroscopy using dmpo as a spin trap agent fang et al 2013 yan et al 2015 zhong et al 2015 br1 soil and two differentially treated fractions of the br1 soil were used for this test br1 soil bulk soil was pre treated by adding hydrogen peroxide and heating in the aqua bath until no bubbles evolved to remove soil organic matter providing a mineral only fraction mineral fraction a portion of the mineral fraction was further treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl in nitric acid hno3 to remove manganese oxides providing an iron only fraction iron fraction chao 1972 four ml of the reaction solution was mixed with dmpo to a final dmpo concentration of 0 4 m the mixed solution was transferred to a 1 mm id capillary tube and analyzed with epr spectroscopy the concentrations of metals in aqueous and solid phases of all the soils and for the different soil fractions of br1 soil were measured for parallel batch experiments aqueous samples were collected at 1 h and 192 h after the reaction began solids were rinsed more than 10 times with de ionized water after separation from the aqueous phase and then dried with pure n2 the dried solids were then subjected to acid digestion x ray diffraction was used to identify surface element composition and mineral formation for the geomedia the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in aqueous solution was also measured for all media samples were collected after 98 h of contact of geomedia with ultrapure water samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter and measured by a toc analyzer 2 3 miscible displacement experiments the br1 soil was selected as the representative porous medium for the subsequent miscible displacement experiments due to its relatively poorer performance in the batch experiments thus providing a conservative representation of column based performance the miscible displacement experiments were conducted using a stainless steel column 7 5 cm long by 2 2 cm inner diameter stainless steel distribution plates were placed on each end of the column to promote uniform flow and retain the porous media all tubing and connectors were constructed of stainless steel after packing the column was vertically positioned and flushed with co2 to displace air it was then saturated with de aired water using a single piston precision flow hplc pump gilson acuflow series іі once complete saturation of the column was obtained a constant mass was attained the column was then oriented horizontally for the experiments four sets of tests were conducted for the first set a solution of 5 mm persulfate was injected into the column to test for activation decomposition of persulfate a solution of 5 mm persulfate and 0 5 mm dioxane was injected for the second set to test for dioxane degradation by persulfate alone the third set was conducted using a mixed solution of 6 3 mm persulfate 150 mm peroxide and 0 57 mm dioxane to test for dioxane degradation by the binary oxidant the final set was designed to determine the impact of a higher oxidant concentration by injecting a mixed solution of 21 mm persulfate 300 mm peroxide and 0 57 mm dioxane control experiments were conducted to examine the transport and degradation of persulfate and peroxide in silica sand tracer tests were also conducted using bromide br as conservative tracer to characterize the hydrodynamic properties of the packed porous media a constant flow rate of 0 1 ml min equivalent to pore water velocity of 3 cm h was used for the experiments after 5 6 pore volumes of injection the influent was switched to water to begin elution effluent samples were collected in glass tubes and placed in an ice water bath to quench the reaction the fluid discharge determined by the mass of the sample collected concentrations of dioxane oxidant sulfate and ph were analyzed immediately the concentrations of dioxane oxidant sulfate in the reservoir were measured

amplitude of 1 g 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch experiments the degradation of dioxane by persulfate in the absence presence of subsurface media is presented in fig 1 a the control tests for dioxane in water fig 1 and water solids figure s4 show minimal loss of dioxane during the experiment the loss of dioxane in persulfate solution with no solids was minimal after 36 h however dioxane underwent slight degradation in the presence of persulfate and solids for all four media with concentration decreases ranging from 10 to 15 fig 1a the results indicate that all four subsurface media used in the experiment have the ability to enhance persulfate induced oxidation of dioxane a first order rate equation was applied to the data and pseudo first order reaction rate constants for dioxane degradation by persulfate alone in the presence of the soils ranged from 0 003 to 0 009 h 1 table 2 the capacity of the four media to enhance persulfate induced oxidation of dioxane followed the order camp gruber florence mr br1 afp44 dioxane degradation by persulfate in the presence of iron filings has been reported with a rate constant of 0 016 h 1 obtained from a batch experiment zhong et al 2015 the smaller rate constants observed for the soils are expected based on the higher iron content and surface area of the iron filing particles compared to the soils the addition of peroxide to the system creating a binary oxidant greatly increased the rate of dioxane degradation fig 1b specifically dioxane degradation in the presence of persulfate and peroxide but without soil was approximately 17 after 36 h and 25 after 98 h comparison of the single and binary oxidant results in the absence of soil reveals that the addition of peroxide produced a significant factor of 6 increase in dioxane degradation 3 vs 17 in 36 h the interactions between persulfate and peroxide and the advantages of employing a binary oxidant system have been discussed in our prior work yan et al 2013 2015 persulfate moderates the decomposition of peroxide producing a more sustainable release of ho in addition the heat released by the decomposition of peroxide helps promote the activation of persulfate the results of molecular probe and epr tests indicated that hydroxyl sulfate hydroperoxyl and superoxide radicals were present in the binary oxidant system the addition of soil to the binary oxidant system increased dioxane degradation to approximately 30 56 after 36 h and 41 100 in 98 h the addition of peroxide to the systems containing soil increased dioxane degradation greatly compared to the persulfate only treatment in addition the presence of soil increased dioxane degradation by factors of 3 4 for the binary system suggesting that the soils used in the experiment can promote peroxide induced oxidation of dioxane in addition to enhancing persulfate induced oxidation similar magnitudes of dioxane degradation were attained within the first 24 h in the presence of camp gruber florence mr and br1 after 24 h however the rate of degradation slowed for florence mr and br1 compared to camp gruber dioxane degradation exhibited a multi stage reaction pattern for the latter medium with an extremely high rate of degradation in the first hour followed by a steady state stage concentration plateau for several hours and a final stage with a relatively slow rate of degradation conversely dioxane degradation exhibited a two stage reaction pattern for the other three porous media pseudo first order reaction rate constants for dioxane degradation by the binary oxidant in the presence of the porous media ranged from 0 09 to 0 45 h 1 for the initial degradation stage and from 0 004 to 0 014 h 1 for the later stage table 2 the capacity of the four soils to enhance peroxide persulfate induced oxidation of dioxane follows the same order as the persulfate induced reaction which is camp gruber florence mr br1 afp44 complete degradation of dioxane was attained within 4 h for the persulfate peroxide system activated with dissolved fe2 figure s5 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant for dioxane degradation for this system is 3 5 h 1 the k for dissolved fe2 activation is approximately 10 times larger than the fast stage values for the porous media activation the initial concentration of dissolved fe2 used for the standard feso4 activation was 0 8 mm approximately 30 1000 times larger than the dissolved iron generated from the soils table 4 the significantly smaller rate coefficients obtained for the porous media activation are consistent with the much lower iron availability it is well known that the oxidation effectiveness of persulfate and peroxide can vary as a function of ph in this study the afp44 and florence mr systems had identical solution ph 7 but the degree of degradation enhancement was much greater for florence mr than for afp44 table s1 similarly degradation enhancement was much great for camp gruber compared to br1 even though they have similar solution ph 4 5 table s1 these results indicate that factors other than ph are primarily responsible for the differences in degradation enhancement observed among the soils 3 2 constituents contributing to oxidant activation several components of geomedia have been identified as having the potential to activate persulfate and peroxide these include iron other transition metals i e mn2 ag under acidic conditions co2 ni2 and soil organic carbon anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 liang et al 2004 ahmad et al 2010 2013 liu et al 2014 the icp ms analysis for the four porous media shows that the br1 soil has a much greater iron content compared to the other three porous media table 3 florence mr and camp gruber have comparable iron contents while afp44 has the lowest iron content however the degree of degradation enhancement was much greater for camp gruber than for br1 this indicates that total sediment phase iron is not the determinant factor for magnitude of activation iron concentrations in the aqueous phase after 1 and 192 h of contact between soil and ultrapure water were measured by icp ms table 4 the iron concentrations for afp44 and florence mr after 192 h were smaller than after 1 h contact indicating precipitation of dissolved iron although icp ms gives total ion concentrations fe2 and fe3 fe3 can convert to fe2 in the presence of peroxide the results show that the dissolved iron concentrations decreased in the order camp gruber florence mr br1 afp44 this order is consistent with the observed degree of dioxane degradation enhancement the results indicate the crucial role of available iron from the porous media on the activation of oxidant inspection of tables 3 and 4 shows that the magnitudes of dissolved iron do not correlate directly to the respective solid phase iron contents this likely reflects differences in iron mineralogy and surface distribution dissolved mn co and ni are also present in solution with mn the only one at significant levels table s2 dissolved mn concentrations are much lower than dissolved iron concentrations for all of the geomedia except the br1 soil other elements and their concentrations in the aqueous phase measured by icp ms are also presented in table s2 as discussed above the florence mr and the br1 soils had similar degrees of enhancement of dioxane degradation however the florence mr soil has almost a factor of 10 higher dissolved iron concentration than the br1 soil table s2 shows that the br1 soil has considerably more dissolved mn compared to the florence soil this suggests that dissolved mn may have contributed to the enhanced activation of oxidant for the br1 soil prior research indicates that soil organic matter has the potential to enhance oxidant activation persulfate decomposition was compared for a bulk soil and a mineral only fraction of the soil oc removed by ahmad et al 2010 the results were similar for both treatments at ph 7 with a small magnitude of decomposition conversely decomposition was much greater for the bulk soil compared to the mineral only fraction at ph 12 fang et al 2013 reported that persulfate could be activated by humic acids at neutral ph bissey et al 2006 concluded that soil organic matter had no influence on peroxide decomposition and radical generation at ph 3 whereas it could promote radical generation at neutral ph these results indicate that activation of persulfate and peroxide by soil organic matter is ph dependent with greatest effect at neutral to alkaline phs among the porous media used in the present study br1 has the highest solid phase organic carbon content table 1 and dissolved organic carbon table s3 but it exhibited relatively lower degradation enhancement the solution ph of all of the systems before and after the reactions are presented in table s1 inspection shows that all reaction systems maintained ph less than 8 with most under acidic condition these results suggest that soil organic matter was not a significant source of oxidant activation for the tested systems it should also be noted that soil organic matter and dissolved organic matter are sources of natural oxidant demand and that the presence of substantial quantities of som and doc may reduce the magnitude of dioxane degradation the solid and dissolved organic carbon contents of br1 soil are several times larger than the other geomedia the substantial amount of organic carbon present for the br1 soil may partially explain the lower magnitude of dioxane degradation obtained the concentration of doc measured for the br1 soil was 87032 μg l table s3 this converts to a molar concentration of 0 1 mm using a molecular weight of 900 g mol hendry et al 2003 the relatively considerable amount of doc for the br1 soil may be sufficient to affect the magnitude of dioxane degradation initial concentration of 0 57 mm depending upon the relative lability of the two the concentrations of doc for the other porous media are much lower and unlikely to have a significant impact 3 3 activation mechanisms to further investigate the role of the various soil constituents organic matter fe and mn in oxidant activation br1 soil was pre treated to generate a fraction containing minerals but devoid of soil organic matter and a fraction containing iron oxides but no soil organic matter or manganese oxides epr spectroscopy was used to examine radical generation among the soil fractions using dmpo as the spin trap dmpo oh dmpo so4 and dmpo h dmpo r signals were observed in the epr spectrum for both persulfate and persulfate peroxide systems fig 2 indicating the presence of ho so4 and a spin adduct with a h carbon centered radical in addition the signal of dmpo oh is the strongest that is because dmpo so4 is short lived and can easily decay into dmpo oh davies et al 1992 zalibera et al 2009 yan et al 2015 therefore ho was used to indicate the activation ability of different treatments of br1 in the persulfate only system the ho concentrations decreased in the order of bulk soil mineral fraction iron fraction fig 2a this indicates that soil organic matter and manganese oxides as well as iron oxides contributed to the activation of persulfate conversely the generation of ho in the persulfate peroxide system was similar for the bulk soil and the mineral fraction fig 2b this indicates that soil organic matter was not a significant activator for the binary system less ho was generated for the iron fraction compared to the bulk soil and mineral fraction indicating that manganese oxides may have contributed to the activation of the binary oxidants as shown in table s4 the dissolved iron concentration in the bulk soil system is higher than for the mineral and iron fraction treatments for which soil organic matter was removed this indicates that soil organic matter in the bulk soil system facilitated the dissolution of iron which thereby facilitated the generation of ho assuming that dissolved iron is the primary activator the amount of dioxane degraded should be proportional to the amount of dissolved iron present on this basis the dissolved iron data were normalized by the concentration reported for br1 29 3 μg l the medium with the lowest value the normalized dioxane degradation for the persulfate peroxide system was then calculated for each soil system using the normalized dissolved iron present details of the calculations are provided in si text s1 inspection of table s5 shows that the normalized dioxane degraded values are similar for afp44 florence mr and camp gruber these results illustrate the significant corresponding relationship between the magnitude of dioxane degradation and the amount of dissolved iron indicating the essential role of dissolved iron in the activation process however the normalized degraded dioxane in the br1 system was significantly larger than for the other soils which illustrates the existence of other sources of activation for this soil in total the above results indicate that dissolved iron was the primary source of oxidant activation with additional contributions from mn and soil organic matter particularly for the br1 soil 3 4 miscible displacement experiments persulfate exhibited slight mass loss for the miscible displacement experiments conducted with the br1 soil mass loss of 5 was observed at the 3 cm h pore water velocity hydraulic residence time tr 2 5 h fig 3 the generation of sulfate was also identified consistent with the observed persulfate mass loss mass balance on sulfur sum of persulfate and sulfate was complete persulfate breakthrough pore volume at which c c0 0 5 was observed at approximately 1 4 pore volumes and the breakthrough of sulfate was observed at approximately 1 6 pore volumes figure s6 the transport of a standard non reactive tracer bromide also exhibited retardation breakthrough at approximately 1 4 pore volumes fig 3 these results indicate that the transport of the anionic solutes is influenced by adsorption which is consistent with the fact that the br1 soil has a measurable anion exchange capacity aec the br1 is an acidic soil ph 4 2 table 1 the points of zero charge pzc of the primary iron minerals of the soil hematite 8 gibbsite 5 goethite 8 and magnetite 7 are higher than the soil ph which provides measurable aec to produce the observed anion retardation an experiment was also conducted with a pore water velocity of 30 cm h tr 0 25 h to test the influence of hydraulic residence time tr on persulfate transport figure s7 the results indicate that the impact of hydraulic residence time tr on persulfate transport was minimal persulfate breakthrough showed at approximately 1 4 pore volumes and mass loss during transport was 6 the lower pore water velocity 3 cm h was used for the subsequent experiments transport and degradation of dioxane in the br1 column in the presence of persulfate is shown in fig 4 ideal transport of dioxane was observed with no retardation or degradation persulfate breakthrough in the presence of dioxane was approximately 1 6 pore volumes the residence time for the column experiment is 2 5 h significantly shorter than dioxane s half life t 1 2 108 h obtained from the batch experiments hence no dioxane degradation was anticipated persulfate decomposition 6 exhibited minimal difference with and without dioxane during transport sulfate generation was also observed and the calculated total sulfur recovery was complete the dioxane breakthrough curve for transport in the presence of persulfate and peroxide in the br1 column is presented in fig 5 a small 8 loss of dioxane in the presence of peroxide and persulfate was observed fig 5a the pseudo first order reaction rate constant for dioxane degradation obtained from the column experiment is 0 035 0 002 h 1 text s2 this value is intermediate to the k values calculated for the fast and slow degradation stages of the batch experiment and is essentially identical to the geometric mean of the two 0 032 h 1 increasing the oxidant both persulfate and peroxide concentration resulted in a slight increase in the degradation of dioxane to 11 fig 5b 4 conclusion the batch and column experiments demonstrated that the selected subsurface media successfully induced activation of oxidant which led to enhanced dioxane degradation the oxidation enhancement potential of the four geomedia used herein varied and was demonstrated to depend primarily upon the magnitude of available readily soluble sediment phase iron mn and soil organic matter possibly provided additional contributions to activation particularly for the br1 soil the magnitude of dioxane degradation in the column experiments was relatively small due to the short residence time 2 5 h compared to dioxane s half life t 1 2 100 h approximate transport distances required to achieve a targeted degree of dioxane degradation can be estimated using the measured rate coefficients and assumed values for groundwater velocity for example transport distances of 3 and 10 m are estimated to be required to achieve 99 reduction of dioxane for the camp gruber and afp44 media respectively with a velocity of 0 2 m d these calculations suggest that geomedia promoted oxidation has the potential to achieve effective in situ degradation of dioxane and other contaminants employing in situ activation of oxidants by natural soils and sediments may reduce or obviate the need for addition of catalysts such as dissolved iron to the oxidant solutions this would in turn have the potential to reduce premature activation and increase the transport distance of oxidant from the injection points which would reduce application costs the effectiveness of employing in situ activated isco will depend on numerous site specific factors including groundwater hydraulics and contaminant concentrations in addition to geochemical properties of the geomedia and groundwater for smaller scale sites it may be cost effective to apply oxidant solution to the entire plume an alternative strategy for larger scale sites

19159,the ability of soils and sediments to promote in situ activation of persulfate and persulfate combined with hydrogen peroxide was investigated for treatment of 1 4 dioxane dioxane experiments were conducted with both batch reactor and column systems to examine reaction rates and activation mechanisms four soils and aquifer sediments were used icp ms and xrd analyses were used to characterize geochemical properties of the solutions and sediments while epr spectroscopy was used to characterize radical formation for the batch experiments degradation of dioxane was significantly greater in the presence of each of the four subsurface geomedia compared to the controls with no geomedia this indicates that all four geomedia induced oxidant activation thereby enhancing dioxane degradation dioxane degradation was significantly enhanced by the addition of peroxide to the persulfate solution it is hypothesized that iron associated with the geomedia is primarily responsible for activation and that the degree of degradation enhancement relates in part to dissolved phase iron content epr results indicate that manganese oxides and soil organic matter may also have contributed to some degree to persulfate activation and that manganese oxides enhanced activation of peroxide under the study conditions approximately 10 of dioxane was degraded in the miscible displacement experiments consistent with the short residence time compared to dioxane s half life the pseudo first order rate coefficients obtained from the batch and column experiments were similar the results of this study indicate that subsurface geomedia can induce activation of persulfate and peroxide to enhance in situ chemical oxidation applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural oxidant activation dioxane persulfate hydrogen peroxide 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane dioxane is a probable carcinogenic compound that commonly co occurs with chlorinated solvent compounds in groundwater iarc 1999 anderson et al 2012 adamson et al 2015 extensive groundwater contaminant plumes of dioxane are readily formed due to its high water solubility and low sorption and such plumes are present at many sites zenker et al 2003 isaacson et al 2006 mohr et al 2010 adamson et al 2014 the cost effective management of dioxane plumes is a challenging endeavor given the physical and chemical properties of dioxane and is a current focus of research few alternatives to pump and treat exist for remediating large groundwater contaminant plumes nrc 2013 monitored natural attenuation mna is one potential option of great interest however its effectiveness is often limited for plumes comprised of dioxane and chlorinated solvent compounds methods to increase the rates of natural attenuation i e enhanced attenuation and thus improve the effectiveness of mna are being investigated one concept of particular interest is the potential for using the capacity of resident soils and sediments to foment abiotic oxidative or reductive transformation of the target contaminants it is well known that certain constituents of geomedia can promote abiotic transformation reactions for some contaminants laha and luthy 1990 hofstetter et al 1999 li and lee 1999 elsner et al 2004 neumann et al 2009 ahmad et al 2010 however the rates of attenuation associated with these reactions are typically insufficient to effect or maintain plume stasis prior research has investigated the use of oxidant reductant reagents to synergize with geomedia to enhance attenuation rates for example it has been shown that certain minerals can activate persulfate or hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to enhance oxidation of contaminants such as trichloroethene tce pentachlorophenol and benzene ravikumar and gurol 1994 ahmad et al 2010 teel et al 2011 huang et al 2012 yan et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2014 however the oxidant catalysis potential of subsurface sediment is likely influenced by many properties and factors given the physical and geochemical complexity of the media hence results obtained with specific minerals in isolation may not always be representative of the overall catalysis capacity of natural bulk sediment the results of recent research indicate that advanced oxidation processes implemented with activated persulfate particularly in some combination with other oxidants is effective for degradation of dioxane e g zhao et al 2014 zhong et al 2015 eberle et al 2016 yan et al 2016 very few studies have investigated the effectiveness of persulfate activation by natural aquifer materials sra et al 2010 liu et al 2014 and these few studies have focused on oxidant activation and not on the efficacy of contaminant degradation nor on dioxane specifically the objective of the current study is to investigate the capacity of natural soils and sediments to activate a binary persulfate peroxide system to specifically enhance in situ degradation of dioxane this work is focused on a binary oxidant system as opposed to the traditional fenton like reaction activated hydrogen peroxide because while the rates of dioxane degradation are similar the oxidant decomposition rate is much faster for the peroxide only system compared to the binary persulfate peroxide system which results in excessive waste of oxidant figure s1 the addition of persulfate moderates the decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide yan et al 2013 2015 batch and column experiments are conducted with four natural geomedia x ray diffraction xrd and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms are used to characterize solid and aqueous phase geochemistry while electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy is used to characterize radical formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials four natural soils and aquifer sediments were used afp44 florence mr camp gruber and br1 afp44 was collected from the tucson international airport area tiaa superfund site in tucson az it is used to represent a standard sandy alluvial aquifer sediment florence mr was collected from florence military reservation az camp gruber was collected from camp gruber ok florence mr and camp gruber were chosen due to their higher clay and lower organic carbon oc contents the br1 soil was collected from a site in brazil and has high iron and organic carbon contents commercially available natural silica sand 40 50

co usa 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 98 was purchased from matrix scientific columbia sc the concentration of dioxane was 0 57 mm 50 mg l for all experiments which is representative of the upper range of groundwater concentrations reported for contaminated sites mohr et al 2010 concentrations of persulfate and peroxide were 6 3 mm and 150 mm 1190 mg l and 5100 mg l respectively for most experiments based on results of our prior work that showed that these concentrations produced significant contaminant degradation while maintaining moderate oxidant utilization yan et al 2013 while these oxidant concentrations are significantly greater than the concentration of dioxane they are much lower than the concentrations typically used for standard field isco applications itrc 2005 these lower concentrations are employed to enhance cost effectiveness of projected field scale applications 2 2 batch experiments the degradation of dioxane by persulfate alone and by a persulfate peroxide binary solution was measured using batch reactors batch experiments in duplicate were conducted at a room temperature of 25 1 c with borosilicate vials fitted with ptfe septum caps each vial contained 5 g of the selected subsurface media for the persulfate system solutions of 21 mm na2s2o8 and 11 3 mm dioxane were mixed 6 1 v v in the vial for the persulfate h2o2 binary oxidant system solutions of 21 mm na2s2o8 300 mm h2o2 and 11 3 mm dioxane were mixed 6 10 1 v v v in the vial ultrapure water was added to a final volume of 40 ml subsamples 0 5 ml were collected over the course of the batch experiment extracted with 0 5 ml hexane and centrifuged for 5 min to separate solid and liquid phases the samples 10 μl were then analyzed immediately using gas chromatography a preliminary experiment was conducted for 192 h using persulfate and peroxide in the presence of florence soil to characterize temporal dioxane degradation behavior figure s2 there was minimal degradation after 36 h and 98 h under persulfate alone and persulfate peroxide combined conditions respectively therefore the experiments were conducted for a maximum of 98 h several control treatments were conducted during the experiments the first control contained only ultrapure water and dioxane which was used to monitor non oxidative mass loss of dioxane during the experiment the purpose of the second control dioxane oxidant with no sediment was to determine dioxane degradation by oxidant in the absence of porous media the third control dioxane solution with porous media but no oxidant tested for sorption and native sediment associated degradation potential of dioxane the fourth control was conducted to provide a comparison to the standard isco approach of using dissolved iron feso4 to activate the binary persulfate hydrogen peroxide system for this control the same dioxane persulfate and peroxide concentrations were used and no sediment was added the concentration of feso4 was 0 8 mm 121 6 mg l a set of experiments was conducted to characterize the formation of radicals for the different treatments described above to support delineation of operative activation oxidation mechanisms radical generation was detected by epr spectroscopy using dmpo as a spin trap agent fang et al 2013 yan et al 2015 zhong et al 2015 br1 soil and two differentially treated fractions of the br1 soil were used for this test br1 soil bulk soil was pre treated by adding hydrogen peroxide and heating in the aqua bath until no bubbles evolved to remove soil organic matter providing a mineral only fraction mineral fraction a portion of the mineral fraction was further treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl in nitric acid hno3 to remove manganese oxides providing an iron only fraction iron fraction chao 1972 four ml of the reaction solution was mixed with dmpo to a final dmpo concentration of 0 4 m the mixed solution was transferred to a 1 mm id capillary tube and analyzed with epr spectroscopy the concentrations of metals in aqueous and solid phases of all the soils and for the different soil fractions of br1 soil were measured for parallel batch experiments aqueous samples were collected at 1 h and 192 h after the reaction began solids were rinsed more than 10 times with de ionized water after separation from the aqueous phase and then dried with pure n2 the dried solids were then subjected to acid digestion x ray diffraction was used to identify surface element composition and mineral formation for the geomedia the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in aqueous solution was also measured for all media samples were collected after 98 h of contact of geomedia with ultrapure water samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter and measured by a toc analyzer 2 3 miscible displacement experiments the br1 soil was selected as the representative porous medium for the subsequent miscible displacement experiments due to its relatively poorer performance in the batch experiments thus providing a conservative representation of column based performance the miscible displacement experiments were conducted using a stainless steel column 7 5 cm long by 2 2 cm inner diameter stainless steel distribution plates were placed on each end of the column to promote uniform flow and retain the porous media all tubing and connectors were constructed of stainless steel after packing the column was vertically positioned and flushed with co2 to displace air it was then saturated with de aired water using a single piston precision flow hplc pump gilson acuflow series іі once complete saturation of the column was obtained a constant mass was attained the column was then oriented horizontally for the experiments four sets of tests were conducted for the first set a solution of 5 mm persulfate was injected into the column to test for activation decomposition of persulfate a solution of 5 mm persulfate and 0 5 mm dioxane was injected for the second set to test for dioxane degradation by persulfate alone the third set was conducted using a mixed solution of 6 3 mm persulfate 150 mm peroxide and 0 57 mm dioxane to test for dioxane degradation by the binary oxidant the final set was designed to determine the impact of a higher oxidant concentration by injecting a mixed solution of 21 mm persulfate 300 mm peroxide and 0 57 mm dioxane control experiments were conducted to examine the transport and degradation of persulfate and peroxide in silica sand tracer tests were also conducted using bromide br as conservative tracer to characterize the hydrodynamic properties of the packed porous media a constant flow rate of 0 1 ml min equivalent to pore water velocity of 3 cm h was used for the experiments after 5 6 pore volumes of injection the influent was switched to water to begin elution effluent samples were collected in glass tubes and placed in an ice water bath to quench the reaction the fluid discharge determined by the mass of the sample collected concentrations of dioxane oxidant sulfate and ph were analyzed immediately the concentrations of dioxane oxidant sulfate in the reservoir were measured before during and after each experiment to monitor for potential loss 2 4 chemical analysis dioxane was analyzed using gas chromatography shimadu gc 14a columbia md equipped with a 30 m 0 53 mm spbtm

underwent slight degradation in the presence of persulfate and solids for all four media with concentration decreases ranging from 10 to 15 fig 1a the results indicate that all four subsurface media used in the experiment have the ability to enhance persulfate induced oxidation of dioxane a first order rate equation was applied to the data and pseudo first order reaction rate constants for dioxane degradation by persulfate alone in the presence of the soils ranged from 0 003 to 0 009 h 1 table 2 the capacity of the four media to enhance persulfate induced oxidation of dioxane followed the order camp gruber florence mr br1 afp44 dioxane degradation by persulfate in the presence of iron filings has been reported with a rate constant of 0 016 h 1 obtained from a batch experiment zhong et al 2015 the smaller rate constants observed for the soils are expected based on the higher iron content and surface area of the iron filing particles compared to the soils the addition of peroxide to the system creating a binary oxidant greatly increased the rate of dioxane degradation fig 1b specifically dioxane degradation in the presence of persulfate and peroxide but without soil was approximately 17 after 36 h and 25 after 98 h comparison of the single and binary oxidant results in the absence of soil reveals that the addition of peroxide produced a significant factor of 6 increase in dioxane degradation 3 vs 17 in 36 h the interactions between persulfate and peroxide and the advantages of employing a binary oxidant system have been discussed in our prior work yan et al 2013 2015 persulfate moderates the decomposition of peroxide producing a more sustainable release of ho in addition the heat released by the decomposition of peroxide helps promote the activation of persulfate the results of molecular probe and epr tests indicated that hydroxyl sulfate hydroperoxyl and superoxide radicals were present in the binary oxidant system the addition of soil to the binary oxidant system increased dioxane degradation to approximately 30 56 after 36 h and 41 100 in 98 h the addition of peroxide to the systems containing soil increased dioxane degradation greatly compared to the persulfate only treatment in addition the presence of soil increased dioxane degradation by factors of 3 4 for the binary system suggesting that the soils used in the experiment can promote peroxide induced oxidation of dioxane in addition to enhancing persulfate induced oxidation similar magnitudes of dioxane degradation were attained within the first 24 h in the presence of camp gruber florence mr and br1 after 24 h however the rate of degradation slowed for florence mr and br1 compared to camp gruber dioxane degradation exhibited a multi stage reaction pattern for the latter medium with an extremely high rate of degradation in the first hour followed by a steady state stage concentration plateau for several hours and a final stage with a relatively slow rate of degradation conversely dioxane degradation exhibited a two stage reaction pattern for the other three porous media pseudo first order reaction rate constants for dioxane degradation by the binary oxidant in the presence of the porous media ranged from 0 09 to 0 45 h 1 for the initial degradation stage and from 0 004 to 0 014 h 1 for the later stage table 2 the capacity of the four soils to enhance peroxide persulfate induced oxidation of dioxane follows the same order as the persulfate induced reaction which is camp gruber florence mr br1 afp44 complete degradation of dioxane was attained within 4 h for the persulfate peroxide system activated with dissolved fe2 figure s5 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant for dioxane degradation for this system is 3 5 h 1 the k for dissolved fe2 activation is approximately 10 times larger than the fast stage values for the porous media activation the initial concentration of dissolved fe2 used for the standard feso4 activation was 0 8 mm approximately 30 1000 times larger than the dissolved iron generated from the soils table 4 the significantly smaller rate coefficients obtained for the porous media activation are consistent with the much lower iron availability it is well known that the oxidation effectiveness of persulfate and peroxide can vary as a function of ph in this study the afp44 and florence mr systems had identical solution ph 7 but the degree of degradation enhancement was much greater for florence mr than for afp44 table s1 similarly degradation enhancement was much great for camp gruber compared to br1 even though they have similar solution ph 4 5 table s1 these results indicate that factors other than ph are primarily responsible for the differences in degradation enhancement observed among the soils 3 2 constituents contributing to oxidant activation several components of geomedia have been identified as having the potential to activate persulfate and peroxide these include iron other transition metals i e mn2 ag under acidic conditions co2 ni2 and soil organic carbon anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 liang et al 2004 ahmad et al 2010 2013 liu et al 2014 the icp ms analysis for the four porous media shows that the br1 soil has a much greater iron content compared to the other three porous media table 3 florence mr and camp gruber have comparable iron contents while afp44 has the lowest iron content however the degree of degradation enhancement was much greater for camp gruber than for br1 this indicates that total sediment phase iron is not the determinant factor for magnitude of activation iron concentrations in the aqueous phase after 1 and 192 h of contact between soil and ultrapure water were measured by icp ms table 4 the iron concentrations for afp44 and florence mr after 192 h were smaller than after 1 h contact indicating precipitation of dissolved iron although icp ms gives total ion concentrations fe2 and fe3 fe3 can convert to fe2 in the presence of peroxide the results show that the dissolved iron concentrations decreased in the order camp gruber florence mr br1 afp44 this order is consistent with the observed degree of dioxane degradation enhancement the results indicate the crucial role of available iron from the porous media on the activation of oxidant inspection of tables 3 and 4 shows that the magnitudes of dissolved iron do not correlate directly to the respective solid phase iron contents this likely reflects differences in iron mineralogy and surface distribution dissolved mn co and ni are also present in solution with mn the only one at significant levels table s2 dissolved mn concentrations are much lower than dissolved iron concentrations for all of the geomedia except the br1 soil other elements and their concentrations in the aqueous phase measured by icp ms are also presented in table s2 as discussed above the florence mr and the br1 soils had similar degrees of enhancement of dioxane degradation however the florence mr soil has almost a factor of 10 higher dissolved iron concentration than the br1 soil table s2 shows that the br1 soil has considerably more dissolved mn compared to the florence soil this suggests that dissolved mn may have contributed to the enhanced activation of oxidant for the br1 soil prior research indicates that soil organic matter has the potential to enhance oxidant activation persulfate decomposition was compared for a bulk soil and a mineral only fraction of the soil oc removed by ahmad et al 2010 the results were similar for both treatments at ph 7 with a small magnitude of decomposition conversely decomposition was much greater for the bulk soil compared to the mineral only fraction at ph 12 fang et al 2013 reported that persulfate could be activated by humic acids at neutral ph bissey et al 2006 concluded that soil organic matter had no influence on peroxide decomposition and radical generation at ph 3 whereas it could promote radical generation at neutral ph these results indicate that activation of persulfate and peroxide by soil organic matter is ph dependent with greatest effect at neutral to alkaline phs among the porous media used in the present study br1 has the highest solid phase organic carbon content table 1 and dissolved organic carbon table s3 but it exhibited relatively lower degradation enhancement the solution ph of all of the systems before and after the reactions are presented in table s1 inspection shows that all reaction systems maintained ph less than 8 with most under acidic condition these results suggest that soil organic matter was not a significant source of oxidant activation for the tested systems it should also be noted that soil organic matter and dissolved organic matter are sources of natural oxidant demand and that the presence of substantial quantities of som and doc may reduce the magnitude of dioxane degradation the solid and dissolved organic carbon contents of br1 soil are several times larger than the other geomedia the substantial amount of organic carbon present for the br1 soil may partially explain the lower magnitude of dioxane degradation obtained the concentration of doc measured for the br1 soil was 87032 μg l table s3 this converts to a molar concentration of 0 1 mm using a molecular weight of 900 g mol hendry et al 2003 the relatively considerable amount of doc for the br1 soil may be sufficient to affect the magnitude of dioxane degradation initial concentration of 0 57 mm depending upon the relative lability of the two the concentrations of doc for the other porous media are much lower and unlikely to have a significant impact 3 3 activation mechanisms to further investigate the role of the various soil constituents organic matter fe and mn in oxidant activation br1 soil was pre treated to generate a fraction containing minerals but devoid of soil organic matter and a fraction containing iron oxides but no soil organic matter or manganese oxides epr spectroscopy was used to examine radical generation among the soil fractions using dmpo as the spin trap dmpo oh dmpo so4 and dmpo h dmpo r signals were observed in the epr spectrum for both persulfate and persulfate peroxide systems fig 2 indicating the presence of ho so4 and a spin adduct with a h carbon centered radical in addition the signal of dmpo oh is the strongest that is because dmpo so4 is short lived and can easily decay into dmpo oh davies et al 1992 zalibera et al 2009 yan et al 2015 therefore ho was used to indicate the activation ability of different treatments of br1 in the persulfate only system the ho concentrations decreased in the order of bulk soil mineral fraction iron fraction fig 2a this indicates that soil organic matter and manganese oxides as well as iron oxides contributed to the activation of persulfate conversely the generation of ho in the persulfate peroxide system was similar for the bulk soil and the mineral fraction fig 2b this indicates that soil organic matter was not a significant activator for the binary system less ho was generated for the iron fraction compared to the bulk soil and mineral fraction indicating that manganese oxides may have contributed to the activation of the binary oxidants as shown in table s4 the dissolved iron concentration in the bulk soil system is higher than for the mineral and iron fraction treatments for which soil organic matter was removed this indicates that soil organic matter in the bulk soil system facilitated the dissolution of iron which thereby facilitated the generation of ho assuming that dissolved iron is the primary activator the amount of dioxane degraded should be proportional to the amount of dissolved iron present on this basis the dissolved iron data were normalized by the concentration reported for br1 29 3 μg l the medium with the lowest value the normalized dioxane degradation for the persulfate peroxide system was then calculated for each soil system using the normalized dissolved iron present details of the calculations are provided in si text s1 inspection of table s5 shows that the normalized dioxane degraded values are similar for afp44 florence mr and camp gruber these results illustrate the significant corresponding relationship between the magnitude of dioxane degradation and the amount of dissolved iron indicating the essential role of dissolved iron in the activation process however the normalized degraded dioxane in the br1 system was significantly larger than for the other soils which illustrates the existence of other sources of activation for this soil in total the above results indicate that dissolved iron was the primary source of oxidant activation with additional contributions from mn and soil organic matter particularly for the br1 soil 3 4 miscible displacement experiments persulfate exhibited slight mass loss for the miscible displacement experiments conducted with the br1 soil mass loss of 5 was observed at the 3 cm h pore water velocity hydraulic residence time tr 2 5 h fig 3 the generation of sulfate was also identified consistent with the observed persulfate mass loss mass balance on sulfur sum of persulfate and sulfate was complete persulfate breakthrough pore volume at which c c0 0 5 was observed at approximately 1 4 pore volumes and the breakthrough of sulfate was observed at approximately 1 6 pore volumes figure s6 the transport of a standard non reactive tracer bromide also exhibited retardation breakthrough at approximately 1 4 pore volumes fig 3 these results indicate that the transport of the anionic solutes is influenced by adsorption which is consistent with the fact that the br1 soil has a measurable anion exchange capacity aec the br1 is an acidic soil ph 4 2 table 1 the points of zero charge pzc of the primary iron minerals of the soil hematite 8 gibbsite 5 goethite 8 and magnetite 7 are higher than the soil ph which provides measurable aec to produce the observed anion retardation an experiment was also conducted with a pore water velocity of 30 cm h tr 0 25 h to test the influence of hydraulic residence time tr on persulfate transport figure s7 the results indicate that the impact of hydraulic residence time tr on persulfate transport was minimal persulfate breakthrough showed at approximately 1 4 pore volumes and mass loss during transport was 6 the lower pore water velocity 3 cm h was used for the subsequent experiments transport and degradation of dioxane in the br1 column in the presence of persulfate is shown in fig 4 ideal transport of dioxane was observed with no retardation or degradation persulfate breakthrough in the presence of dioxane was approximately 1 6 pore volumes the residence time for the column experiment is 2 5 h significantly shorter than dioxane s half life t 1 2 108 h obtained from the batch experiments hence no dioxane degradation was anticipated persulfate decomposition 6 exhibited minimal difference with and without dioxane during transport sulfate generation was also observed and the calculated total sulfur recovery was complete the dioxane breakthrough curve for transport in the presence of persulfate and peroxide in the br1 column is presented in fig 5 a small 8 loss of dioxane in the presence of peroxide and persulfate was observed fig 5a the pseudo first order reaction rate constant for dioxane degradation obtained from the column experiment is 0 035 0 002 h 1 text s2 this value is intermediate to the k values calculated for the fast and slow degradation stages of the batch experiment and is essentially identical to the geometric mean of the two 0 032 h 1 increasing the oxidant both persulfate and peroxide concentration resulted in a slight increase in the degradation of dioxane to 11 fig 5b 4 conclusion the batch and column experiments demonstrated that the selected subsurface media successfully induced activation of oxidant which led to enhanced dioxane degradation the oxidation enhancement potential of the four geomedia used herein varied and was demonstrated to depend primarily upon the magnitude of available readily soluble sediment phase iron mn and soil organic matter possibly provided additional contributions to activation particularly for the br1 soil the magnitude of dioxane degradation in the column experiments was relatively small due to the short residence time 2 5 h compared to dioxane s half life t 1 2 100 h approximate transport distances required to achieve a targeted degree of dioxane degradation can be estimated using the measured rate coefficients and assumed values for groundwater velocity for example transport distances of 3 and 10 m are estimated to be required to achieve 99 reduction of dioxane for the camp gruber and afp44 media respectively with a velocity of 0 2 m d these calculations suggest that geomedia promoted oxidation has the potential to achieve effective in situ degradation of dioxane and other contaminants employing in situ activation of oxidants by natural soils and sediments may reduce or obviate the need for addition of catalysts such as dissolved iron to the oxidant solutions this would in turn have the potential to reduce premature activation and increase the transport distance of oxidant from the injection points which would reduce application costs the effectiveness of employing in situ activated isco will depend on numerous site specific factors including groundwater hydraulics and contaminant concentrations in addition to geochemical properties of the geomedia and groundwater for smaller scale sites it may be cost effective to apply oxidant solution to the entire plume an alternative strategy for larger scale sites could involve application at the leading edge of the plume to prevent further migration declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
