9625,agriculture heavy alluvial aquifer regions around the world have experienced severe groundwater declines due to irrigation demand this consequence has been observed in the united states in the latter half of the 20th century notably in the central valley of california and in the mississippi river valley in some portions of the mississippi river valley such as the cache river critical groundwater area crcga of northeast arkansas drawdown has exceeded 30 m and portends aquifer depletion in the near future in addition to adopting surface water storage and irrigation efficiency methods farm scale managed aquifer recharge mar with infiltration galleries ig gravel filled trenches designed to move surface water into the aquifer may be a useful tool for reducing declines low permeability surface deposits which limit and create significant variation in natural recharge across the region also control the placement of mar systems it is therefore critical to understand the variability of surface deposits as well as underlying aquifer properties to best plan the placement design and operation of such systems this study aimed to characterize surface and upper aquifer conditions to assess the feasibility of ig in the central crcga available well logs were used to interpolate the approximate thickness of surface deposits and identify thinner areas approximately 37 of the study area has less than 5 m of confining material at the surface and included 28 existing reservoirs that could act as recharge water sources guided by this mapping effort geophysical and sediment surveys were conducted at selected sites the upper unsaturated alluvial aquifer of fine silty sand had estimated hydraulic conductivities of 0 20 2 79 m d 1 these results are promising for the implementation of farm scale ig in the study region and suggest that small mar systems could be a useful tool for groundwater management in other agricultural aquifer systems given the proper placement keywords groundwater on farm reservoirs conjunctive use water conservation 1 introduction 1 1 groundwater decline in the arkansas delta to keep up with the water demands of intensive agriculture in the arkansas delta the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrva has been pumped at unsustainable levels for decades clark et al 2011 nearly 2 million ha of farmland in arkansas are irrigated most of this land is located in the arkansas delta defined by the extent of the mrva fig 1 and 95 of irrigation water is sourced from the mrva arkansas natural resources commission 2017 usda national agricultural statistics service 2014 across the delta region the mrva supplies an average of 35 ml d 1 for irrigation maupin and barber 2005 the water pumped from the mrva produces approximately 6 5 billion in agricultural products each year much of this in rice and soybean crops or about 14 of the total united states agricultural value alhassan et al 2019 clark et al 2011 reba et al 2017 groundwater mining in the arkansas delta to meet irrigation needs has led to the formation of two major cones of depression fig 1 in the mrva arkansas natural resources commission 2017 the grand prairie critical groundwater area gpcga established in the counties east of little rock in 1998 has experienced over pumping of the mrva since the 1910 s resulting in declines of over 30 m kresse et al 2014 the cache river area of western craighead poinsett and cross counties has experienced similar groundwater declines mostly since the 1980s leslie et al 2021 reba et al 2017 less than 20 of the mrva remains saturated with the center of the cache cone of depression being less than 5 of its pre pumping saturated thickness yaeger et al 2018 in response the cache river critical groundwater area crcga was designated in 2009 by the arkansas natural resources commission arkansas natural resources commission 2009 models estimating groundwater storage in the mrva based on current pumping levels anticipate continued depletion of parts of the aquifer in the next few decades clark et al 2011 several water conservation approaches are being taken to reduce groundwater usage and improve water sustainability in arkansas the us army corps of engineers usace has developed large scale surface water diversion projects in the gpcga region to drastically reduce groundwater reliance white river irrigation district 2016 although no such project exists or is being planned in the crcga alternative rice growing techniques are currently being considered to reduce agricultural water usage reba et al 2017 in addition the construction of on farm reservoirs and tailwater recovery systems in both the gpcga and the crcga has helped reduce the groundwater usage across all crop types yaeger et al 2017 a third approach to water management and conservation managed aquifer recharge mar has not yet been tested in the arkansas delta region mar could augment groundwater replenishment in the crcga enhance the water usage efficiency of the available storage in on farm reservoirs and along with efficient irrigation techniques and conversion to surface water sources improve the overall water balance of the mrva the trends observed in the critical groundwater areas of arkansas are not unique to the mrva numerous other heavily agricultural aquifer systems worldwide many of which are unconfined or semi confined alluvial aquifers have experienced the same general pattern of increased irrigation and worsening declines over the last 50 years maples et al 2019 wada et al 2012 for example groundwater levels in the dupi tila and other alluvial aquifers of bangladesh have declined at rates exceeding 1 m yr 1 due to increased pumping since the 1960s and 1970s hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 shamsudduha et al 2011 these aquifers are critically important for food production and especially in less affluent regions for drinking water supply therefore better management and recovery of groundwater supply and protection of groundwater quality in these systems is critically important in the case of the indo gangetic alluvial aquifer in northwest india artificial recharge from irrigation canal leakage has been found to be a significant recharge source in some areas van dijk et al 2019 observations like this raise the possibility of using basic infiltration systems like infiltration galleries to artificially recharge stressed agricultural aquifers the hydrogeology water usage and land use conditions in the mrva of arkansas make it a good model system in which to investigate the use of infiltration mar 1 2 regional hydrogeology the mississippi alluvial plain map stretches from the gulf of mexico to southern illinois covering nearly 200 000 km2 in parts of arkansas kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri and tennessee clark et al 2011 the recent pleistocene unconsolidated sediments that fill the alluvial valley overlay tertiary and cretaceous bedrock boswell et al 1965 the map is characterized by low elevation and low topographic relief bounded to the east and west by outcroppings of the underlying rock the region slopes gently to the south falling only about 80 m over the 800 km from southern missouri to the gulf of mexico schumm and spitz 1996 besides terrace formations associated with the major rivers of the region one of the few topographic features within the map is crowley s ridge a thin band of tertiary age silt and clay dominated deposits that runs through northeast arkansas and the missouri boot heel broom and lyford 1981 the ridge extends up to 90 m above the surrounding floodplain and averages about 16 km in width crowley s ridge acts as a hydrologic barrier creating a discontinuity in the otherwise spatially extensive and connected aquifer system in arkansas czarnecki 2010 the mrva is the uppermost and thinnest member of a larger aquifer system within the map that includes the sparta memphis sands claiborne and wilcox aquifers broom and lyford 1981 ranging from about 15 to 60 m in thickness the mrva is primarily composed of sand and gravel of quaternary age lower coarse sediments typically fine upwards to sand and silt due to numerous depositional environments that existed in the region during formation discontinuous layers of silt and clay are common although their presence is highly variable boswell et al 1965 saucier 1994 hydraulic conductivity can vary by more than three orders of magnitude between the silt and clay loam layers and the sands within the mrva rose 2007 much of the upper portion of the mrva is dominated by clay rich backswamp deposits which act as a surface confining unit that reduces or completely restricts natural recharge fisk 1944 the confining unit can be nearly absent in some areas and up to 20 m thick in others corresponding with a thinner mrva water bearing unit some of the thickest areas of clayey deposits are along the boundaries of crowley s ridge which defines the eastern edge of the crcga gonthier and mahon 1993 in this area annual recharge rates from precipitation are likely less than about 50 mm because of the low permeability surface deposits broom and lyford 1981 limited recharge through the surface confining unit and excessive groundwater extraction have generated a large cone of depression across the cache river region 1 3 infiltration galleries for managed aquifer recharge as water usage continues to increase and groundwater declines in the mrva become more severe all options for groundwater conservation will need to be considered arkansas is not by any means a dry state the arkansas delta region receives about 1200 mm of precipitation each year on average average rainfall therefore exceeds the typical irrigation needs of rice and soybean in the region or about 920 and 280 mm respectively massey et al 2017 however much of the rainfall is not appropriately timed to meet the irrigation needs of these primary crops this has led to a dependence on groundwater for irrigation regionally only about 12 of irrigation water is from surface water sources usda national agricultural statistics service 2019 capture and storage of ample surface water flow in the winter non production season october march is generally underutilized a recent increase in on farm storage reservoir construction is aimed at addressing this problem yaeger et al 2018 2017 on farm reservoirs collect precipitation and ditch flow during the non production season for later irrigation use but can reach their limited storage capacity early in the winter during wetter conditions despite this farms with reservoir storage can meet much more of their irrigation demand with surface water than the regional average of 12 mar systems could facilitate additional underground storage of winter surface water if used in conjunction with on farm reservoirs mar and aquifer storage and recovery asr are commonly used groundwater conservation methods in semi arid or arid regions where surface water may only be abundant over a short portion of the year and usually not timed with periods of greatest need bouwer 2002 dillon 2005 the volume of water stored each year through mar systems has increased by about 5 each year over the last half century with the united states and india being the largest rechargers dillon et al 2019 despite the growth in mar recharge rates are being outpaced by increases in groundwater pumping dillon et al 2019 the authors recognize that adopting water use metering technology and increasing monitoring of groundwater systems where conservation actions are implemented is also critical for optimization of groundwater resource management thomas 2019 mar is no exception and successful testing and implementation of infiltration galleries and other mar technologies must be accompanied by improved metering and groundwater level tracking wendt et al 2021 a common recharge method is direct injection where water is pumped through a dedicated well directly back into the saturated zone of the aquifer the recharge water used for direct injection must be treated to a high degree which for farm scale implementation of galleries would require treatment facilities at each injection site direct injection was not considered in this study in order to keep infrastructure costs energy usage and cost for pre treatment of surface water to a minimum cost benefit analysis has shown that surface infiltration can be financially competitive or favorable to direct injection in the right setting arshad et al 2014 the high initial costs and strict water quality regulations for injection would hinder the adoption of such systems by producers and landowners this is not only true in the mrva but also in systems like the dupi tila aquifer of bangladesh where there is much more limited infrastructure capital large scale spreading basins are also not feasible because of both high value of agricultural land and the presence of a surface confining unit however an infiltration gallery should be adaptable to variable surface conditions and land use challenges of the mrva and other agricultural regions infiltration galleries also called infiltration trenches or vadose zone galleries are essentially percolation trenches that are backfilled with a porous structural fill and buried beneath the surface the porous fill can store a large volume of water and also provides filtration as the infiltrated water passes through bouwer 2002 galleries are often used for stormwater management and wastewater treatment but can be tailored for use in groundwater recharge amoozegar et al 2008 bekele et al 2013 an example of successful implementation of galleries for mar is the walla walla basin project in washington state the project tested multiple gallery designs using irrigation canal water as the source and achieved recharge rates as high as 0 46 l s 1 per m3 equivalent to 3974 m3 d 1 3 2 ac ft d 1 for a 100 m2 gallery bower 2011 infiltration galleries have also been applied for mar using treated wastewater and have resulted in improved recharge water quality bekele et al 2013 unlike other mar methods gallery systems are ideal where a thin surface confining unit overlays more permeable aquifer sediments such as in many alluvial aquifers bouwer 2002 the gallery trench can be excavated to the depth necessary to expose permeable sediments but also covered to restore the surface to near pre excavation conditions bekele et al 2013 the only surface manifestation of buried infiltration galleries are the water conveyance system and any monitoring instrumentation the inherent flexibility in the design of infiltration galleries makes them an appropriate fit for most agricultural landscapes especially that of the mrva common construction materials the need for little to no pre treatment of the recharge water and low energy requirements for operation can make infiltration galleries a low cost recharge method bouwer 2002 however cost effective implementation of galleries hinges on a strong understanding of the variable surface and subsurface conditions characteristic of alluvial aquifer systems in this case study we assumed that a major component constraining the economic implementation of infiltration galleries is the distance to the recharge water source on farm reservoir pond river ditch etc 1 4 purpose and aims groundwater declines in the mrva pose a threat to the sustainability of regional agriculture this is true for many other agricultural alluvial aquifers worldwide multiple approaches have been taken to reduce groundwater withdrawals from the mrva including increasing surface water retention and developing water saving irrigation practices mar has shown promise for groundwater conservation in other areas particularly in western united states e g henry et al 2013 in washington and oregon but implementation has lagged elsewhere including in the mrva low permeability surface geology limited surface water recharge sources protection of aquifer water quality and a lack of available non agricultural land are typical challenges to mar in many alluvial aquifers maples et al 2019 infiltration galleries may be flexible enough in design construction and operation to circumvent these challenges the goal of this work is to determine the feasibility of small scale infiltration galleries for local groundwater recharge in the mrva as a model system specifically this three part study aims to investigate the thickness and variability of the confining unit characterize the physical and geochemical properties of the confining unit and uppermost mrva sediments and to assess the potential recharge performance capabilities of small infiltration galleries furthermore this study presents a combined desktop and field methodology for evaluating potential sites for mar with infiltration galleries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the central crcga study area is located along the western edge of crowley s ridge from approximately 35 53 to 35 30 n and extends westward to approximately 91 03 w fig 2 this 1650 km2 area is located within two hydrologic unit code 8 watersheds the cache river watershed 08020302 and the l anguille river watershed 08020205 the study area averages an annual precipitation of 1200 mm and a mean temperature of 16 2 c reba et al 2017 the topography of the central crcga is relatively flat averaging less than 1 slope ferguson 1979 most precipitation does not infiltrate deeply into the mrva and instead flows into agricultural ditches and channelized streams into the cache and l anguille rivers which then flow out of the crcga and into the mississippi river the study area contains 70 on farm reservoirs identified by yaeger et al 2017 and updated as of 2019 which collect rain and surface water for irrigation use fig 2 on farm reservoirs in the crcga average 14 1 ha in size but range from 1 to 125 ha most reservoirs in the crcga are located where less than 40 of the mrva remains saturated and groundwater levels are deep yaeger et al 2018 on farm reservoirs are the only reliable surface water source throughout the study area with sufficient volume and low sediment levels required for infiltration multiple years of water quality monitoring in a subset of on farm reservoirs in the crcga suggest that levels of suspended sediments and agricultural nutrients may be lowest in the non production season kahill 2016 furthermore reservoir water quality tends to be much more favorable compared to other surface water sources in the delta region such as streams and agricultural ditches grantz et al 2020 kahill 2016 to date infiltration galleries have not been implemented in the region and on farm reservoirs continue to be developed for surface water storage for the purposes of this study it was assumed that on farm reservoirs would be the primary recharge water source and that galleries would be constructed within close proximity to these features 2 2 mapping survey methods a mapping survey was conducted to identify areas with a thin confining unit defined as 5 m for potential placement of an infiltration gallery focusing on where groundwater declines have been the greatest within the central crcga the 5 m threshold while largely arbitrary was chosen as the limit of reasonable excavation for a gallery trench previously published maps of the mrva confining unit thickness in eastern arkansas were developed from interpolation of irrigation well logs gonthier and mahon 1993 the number and location of wells used by gonthier and mahon were unclear thus a new mapping effort in the crcga using well logs located specifically in the project area of interest was developed mapping subsurface geology from well logs requires many data points the arkansas water well construction commission awwcc keeps a publicly available database of irrigation industrial and domestic well construction logs installed in the state water well construction commission of arkansas 2019 many well logs within the project area contained unclear or were missing critical information logs lacking exact coordinates and thickness of the surface confining layer were excluded from the mapping effort nearly two thirds of the approximately 1000 irrigation well logs in the study area were missing some critical information or were duplicates the locations of well logs containing all necessary information were digitized using arcgis desktop with a total of 391 wells available within the area of interest version 10 5 1 esri redlands ca in addition to location each well data point also included the depth from the surface to the base of the surface confining unit as described in the corresponding well log the interpolation toolset spatial analyst tools was used to create a contour surface representing the anticipated thickness of the confining unit a natural neighbor interpolation with a 100 m cell size was applied and the resulting confining unit surface was manually reclassified with eight depth classes spanning 0 15 m intervals of 0 75 3 0 m the locations of on farm reservoirs were superimposed on the interpolated confining unit surface using the spatial join tool the minimum confining unit thickness within the footprint of each reservoir was calculated the thickness estimated within the reservoir footprint was used as a proxy for the thickness in the area immediately around the reservoir where infiltration galleries would potentially be placed the spatial extent and distribution of areas where the confining unit was 5 m thick were then compared to the locations of existing on farm reservoirs 2 3 geophysical survey methods the mapping efforts described above resulted in a map of anticipated confining unit thickness in relation to on farm reservoirs although a useful guide the interpolation results need to be assessed further using field based measurements of the confining unit thickness five on farm reservoirs sites c ht hb s and w in the study area with long term water quality data grantz et al 2020 were chosen for further investigation with ground based geophysical surveys using electrical resistivity fig 2 electrical resistivity surveying ers measures the electrical properties of the subsurface along a two dimensional profile using grounded electrodes us environmental protection agency 2016 and silts are more conductive relative to coarser materials and materials rich in silica which act as resistors thus ers is a suitable method for locating the base of the clayey confining unit further verifying the thickness of the layer and characterizing the upper aquifer ers and similar methods such as towed time domain electromagnetic ttem and frequency domain electromagnetic surveys fdem have been used for a recent mar site assessment study in the central valley of california behroozmand et al 2019 in this study which was evaluating sites for large scale spreading basins ttem gave better spatial coverage at a higher efficiency than would be possible with ers for relatively small elongated areas located on the margins of existing reservoirs ers surveys were an efficient way to obtain high horizontal and vertical resolution targeted to the relatively smaller area of interest in coordination with the united states geological survey usgs ers was conducted at the five selected sites to gain more accurate site specific estimates of the confining unit thickness an iris syscal pro switch system iris instruments orleans france was used for the surveys survey line lengths and configurations varied based on available space and conditions at each site table s1 inverse schlumberger array method was used for all ers surveys us environmental protection agency 2016 all survey lines had minimal elevation variability within the approximate vertical resolution of a 1 m electrode spacing survey therefore the impact of site topography on the data was expected to be minimal apparent resistivity values were inverted using res2dinv ver 3 59 which automatically selects the ideal forward model and inversion parameters to apply to the smoothness constrained gauss newton least squares inversion technique geotomo software 2018 because the range of resistivity values varied widely among sites the base of the confining unit was identified by the interval of greatest resistivity change per unit length transition between two materials and not by a single resistivity value the depth of this transition and the resistivity at that depth were both noted the ers profiles were further validated by completing shallow borings in the same areas 2 4 aquifer sediment sampling and analysis methods shallow borings and aquifer sediment collection focused on sites where the interpolated and ers survey estimated confining unit thickness was less than 5 m for this reason sites c and s were not included in the sediment survey the goal of these borings was to sample the lower confining unit transition zone and upper unsaturated zone of the mrva for site specific characterization of grain size distribution major minor and trace element sediment geochemistry and mineralogy at least two shallow soil borings were drilled near each of the three reservoir sites ht hb and w soil borings were completed as close to the ers survey lines as possible within approximately 30 m in collaboration with the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs a trailer mounted giddings probe with a 5 1 cm diameter continuous flight auger was used to advance each boring and collect samples the auger was advanced until refusal variations in soil density across boring locations resulted in varied maximum sampling depths of 5 5 9 5 m sediment samples were obtained from the auger after extracted from the borehole following the standard practice for soil exploration and sampling by auger borings astm d1452 two composite soil samples referred to as a samples and b samples were collected over an approximately 30 cm interval at each sampling point a samples were placed in a sealed plastic sample bag for in situ moisture content measurements and b samples were placed in a soil sample box for grain size distribution and chemical and mineralogical analyses moisture content from a samples was determined in the usda agricultural research service ars delta water management research unit dwmru lab following a standard method astm d2216 b samples were sent to the university of missouri soil and plant testing lab for textural and chemical analysis university of missouri extension 2019 specific analyses included grain size analysis soil texture ph organic matter cation exchange capacity cec and elemental analyses see supplemental data major minor and trace elements and nutrients were analyzed for adsorbed sediment bound and soluble phase concentrations it is these phases that are most readily mobilized during infiltration through the aquifer sediment all methods used are outlined in soil testing in missouri nathan et al 2012 hydraulic conductivities of the samples were estimated from the grain size distribution data using two empirical formulas the chapuis and beyer equations are less commonly used than the hazen and kozeny carman equations but are more appropriate for very fine materials d10 0 25 mm the formulas for the chapuis and beyer equations respectively are below rosas et al 2014 chapuis et al 2005 beyer 1964 1 cm s 2 4622 d 10 2 e 3 1 e 2 2 k m s 6 10 4 g µ log 500 c d 10 2 in the above formulas for hydraulic conductivity k sat d10 is the 10th percentile grain diameter in mm the porosity n was assumed to be 0 3 for all samples typical for fine sand and the void ratio e was assumed to be 0 429 for all samples other variables include the coefficient of curvature c a ratio of d10 d30 and d60 grain sizes mineralogical analysis was conducted on dried a samples using fourier transform infrared ftir analysis with a perkin elmer spectrum ii spectrometer perkinelmer inc waltham ma at the dwmru lab samples were hand pulverized using a mortar and pestle until the material reached a fine powder consistency attenuated total reflectance atr was used to directly analyze the solid samples without further preparation sample spectra collection occurred at 120 130 n from 4000 to 360 cm 1 spectra were analyzed qualitatively using spectragryph menges 2019 v1 2 12 oberstdorf germany and peaks were identified by manual comparison with similar spectra of minerals commonly found in alluvial sediments 3 results and discussion 3 1 mapping survey the interpolated thickness estimate of the surface confining unit within the study area varied between 1 4 and nearly 15 m and did not exhibit a regular spatial pattern fig 3 the thickest portions of the confining unit were in the southwest corner of the study area and are potentially associated with relict meander paths of the lower cache river saucier 1994 confining unit sediment exceeding 10 m thick was also mapped along the western edge of crowley s ridge near harrisburg and jonesboro which agrees with previous mapping of the confining unit gonthier and mahon 1993 only two small regions of very thin confining unit less than 3 m were identified covering 0 8 of the study area the confining unit in the northwest portion of the study area may be even thinner than the 1 4 m minimum predicted by the map as several well logs that existed there failed to note the presence of the confining unit both of these areas are coincident with the channelized reaches of the northern portion of the cache river which may provide some local recharge to the mrva overall 37 of the study area was predicted to have a confining unit thickness as less than 5 m of the 70 existing on farm reservoirs within the study area 28 were located in areas with a confining unit thickness of less than 5 m mostly in the central and southeastern portion of the study area only two reservoirs were located where the confining unit was less than 4 m and there were none in the regions with less than 3 m because several meters of excavation are usually required for reservoir construction it makes sense that fewer reservoirs are located where the confining unit is less than 4 m thick any thinner would result in leaky reservoirs the thinner confining unit regions were also located primarily along the northwest edge of the crcga cone of depression where lesser groundwater declines have led to fewer reservoirs being constructed a significant portion of the study area appears to have favorable surface conditions for infiltration gallery construction based solely on the confining unit thickness the inherent variability in fine surface deposits that is a challenge common to other agricultural alluvial aquifer systems maples et al 2019 rahman et al 2013 makes conditions in many areas impractical but leaves plenty of room for innovation importantly in the study area 40 of existing reservoirs are located in these favorable areas which removes an engineering barrier to wide implementation of galleries simply put the recharge source water already exists in the reservoirs the locations of reservoirs with favorable surface conditions also correlated with areas of significant decline and therefore the greatest need for groundwater replenishment eight on farm reservoirs within the study area have been the subject of long term water quality monitoring by the dwmru of these reservoirs c ht hb s and w are immediately surrounded by open areas potentially suitable for infiltration gallery construction and were selected for further investigation using geophysical surveying see fig 3 based on the mapping results the anticipated confining unit thickness for the five selected sites ranged from 4 0 to 7 5 m 3 2 geophysical survey the same overall patterns in resistivity were observed across all sites and survey lines very conductive material less than 50 ωm at the surface interpreted as silt and clay dominated soil was underlain by more resistive material more than 150 ωm coarser silt and sand in all cases fig 4 a brief transition zone was observed between the conductive and resistive layers the conductive layer above the transition zone typically between about 4 and 100 ωm was interpreted as the confining unit the survey sites also differed in the resistivity of the underlying material site w for example reached resistivities in the range of 2000 4000 ωm at a depth of 6 7 m in comparison resistivities in one survey line at site c only reached about 150 ωm even at a depth of 8 m in an mar site survey in the central valley of california resistivity was converted to approximate lithology using regional well bore resistivity data behroozmand et al 2019 without similar regional data and details on how the differences in pore water chemistry and aquifer mineralogy affect resistivity it is not feasible to directly relate resistivity values among sites or convert resistivity data to lithological units in turn the base of the confining unit was identified not by a single predetermined resistivity value but instead by the location of a rapid transition in relative resistivity table 1 generally the confining unit was of consistent thickness across the survey lines and was homogenous both vertically and laterally fig 4 sites c ht and s had thin layers of moderate resistivity 75 150 ωm in the upper 0 5 1 0 m these surveys were all conducted between the reservoir levee and adjacent tailwater recovery ditch excess material from the excavation of the reservoir is often placed as fill around the levee the moderate resistivity surface layer at these sites was interpreted as this fill resistivity increased rapidly at the base of the confining unit at all sites eventually becoming once again fairly homogenous this transition zone appears to span 1 0 m at sites ht and hb 1 5 m at sites c and up to 2 0 m at site s the transition zone varied from approximately 0 5 1 0 m at site w possibly because of the larger area covered by the survey lines at this site the depth to the transition in resistivity interpreted as the thickness of the confining unit varied across the five study sites as well as between survey lines within each site the thickness of the confining unit was generally within 2 m of the mapped thickness for sites ht hb and c table 1 the confining unit at site s was significantly thicker than the map estimate the 192 m line at site s was the only survey to detect substantial variation in confining unit thickness this along with the different appearance of the upper soil layer at site s suggested that artificial fill related to the construction of the reservoir may be responsible for this discrepancy the confining unit at site w was thinner than the map estimate the interpolated thickness at site w was heavily influenced by three well points which were located along a major agricultural ditch the ditch was channelized along what was a meandering natural drainage feature fine grained overbank deposits and fill material from the channelization process could make the confining unit effectively thicker in these areas as a result the predicted thickness at nearby site w may have been skewed based on the ers survey results sites c and s were not considered for further investigation because the confining unit thickness was in excess of 5 m excavating through the 6 8 m of confining sediment at these sites would not be feasible given the large footprint and construction costs sites w ht and hb were investigated further through sediment analysis unlike with the ttem subsurface method the depth of measurement for ers is proportional to the total survey line length the survey line lengths used in this survey maximum of 192 m limited the overall depth of measurement to about 25 m for this reason the regional water table about 30 m depth was not detected by resistivity methods this is an advantage of the ttem system which can provide deeper measurements within a smaller area behroozmand et al 2019 3 3 aquifer sediment analysis sediment analysis showed grain size and soil texture chemical and mineralogical differences between the confining unit transition zone and the upper aquifer the texture of the confining unit was primarily silt loam with a 1 3 m thick loam or sandy loam transition zone fig 4 in most borings loamy sand or clean sand was encountered at a depth of about 5 m however in two borings hb 2 and w 1 the sandy loam material extended to the deepest samples at approximately 8 5 10 0 m the discrepancy between these borings and the shallower transition observed in the ers data may be related to the method of sampling by auger recovery which risks contamination with material from the upper portion of the borehole grain size distributions were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity the chapuis and beyer methods developed for materials with 0 03 d10 0 60 mm are appropriate for the materials in this study rosas et al 2014 hydraulic conductivities of about 0 3 2 5 m d 1 were estimated for samples from a depth of approximately 5 m table 2 these conductivity values are adequate to quickly infiltrate water by maintaining a constant water level in an infiltration gallery of sufficient size chemical conditions in the upper aquifer were also found to be largely favorable for mar levels of minor elements trace metals and nutrients in the aquifer sediments were found to be very low table s2 posing little threat of leaching into groundwater during recharge godwin 2020 sediment cec 3 4 6 2 meq 100 g and organic matter 0 0 0 3 were also very low which is expected for sandy alluvial deposits but which may limit the natural treatment potential of the soil negligible organic matter likely supports a limited microbial community in the upper aquifer that may play only a minor biological role in the cycling of introduced nutrients such as nitrate ammonium and phosphate however the introduction of oxygenated reservoir water containing suspended and dissolved organic matter and an existing microbial population to the upper vadose zone may raise the level of beneficial microbial activity immediately below a gallery site hb had higher levels of soil sodium 160 5 ppm manganese 214 0 ppm and nitrate 8 80 ppm than the other sites less than 58 0 ppm 106 5 ppm and 1 0 ppm respectively it is unclear why this is but it could indicate a more rapid infiltration of water from surface at the sampling location resulting in less attenuation of these components higher sodium could develop if irrigation water was infiltrating into the subsurface through the confining unit this process could also carry more nitrates to the vadose zone from the surface soil ph 4 5 7 5 was one of the more variable factors across sites and may explain some variability in major elements elements such as calcium magnesium phosphorus and potassium are most available mobile in solution closer to a neutral ph like found at sites w and hb the acidic soils at site ht had the lowest calcium concentrations conversely iron manganese boron copper and zinc are most available in acidic conditions sims and patrick 1978 the acidic soils at site ht had elevated iron 20 1 ppm slightly higher zinc 0 8 ppm and moderate levels of manganese 106 5 ppm compared to the other sites under the acidic conditions at site ht introduction of reservoir water which tends to be slightly alkaline could cause a large shift in soil chemistry as calcium iron magnesium or other elements may exhibit greater mobility mineralogy analysis determined that major mineral assemblages across sites were consistent to some extent mineral composition was also consistent between the confining unit and the upper aquifer the confining unit was a kaolinite montmorillonite quartz feldspar assemblage similarly the upper aquifer was a quartz kaolinite montmorillonite feldspar assemblage carbonates gypsum and iron oxides appeared to be trace components most original feldspar has weathered to kaolinite although some remains gypsum is likely related to the dissolution of carbonate minerals in the presence of sulfuric acid which could be derived from bacterial activity van breemen 1973 goethite hematite was visible in some samples as a reddish coating on quartz sand grains and in kaolinite clumps the presence of such iron oxides is important because of their ability to absorb many potential contaminants the limitation of ftir compared to x ray diffraction is that minerals with very similar ir spectral reflectance cannot be easily distinguished several other minerals such as muscovite vermiculite and smectite may be present in trace levels in these samples but were potentially undetectable because of spectral overlap with other major components similarly some dark or opaque minerals that may be found in these samples such as magnetite have few distinguishing ir spectral peaks some dark opaque mineral grains were present in the material and it is unclear if these were accounted for in the ftir analysis given the soil ph 4 5 7 5 of the upper aquifer material at sites w and hb and of typical on farm reservoirs of about 8 0 8 7 godwin 2020 there is little concern of metal mobility by mineral dissolution from ph changes dolomite calcite and gypsum dissolution and re precipitation which could reduce the porosity of the aquifer material would be a potential concern in the acidic soils of site ht or if surface waters were acidic in nature the presence of clays and iron oxide minerals in the upper aquifer may assist in removal of recharge contaminants specifically ammonium glyphosate and metals through absorption and cation exchange al rajab et al 2008 bergström et al 2011 hartley et al 2004 miles and moye 1988 however because the dominant clay mineral is kaolinite the impact of cation exchange and therefore metal mobilization is expected to be low 3 4 site favorability for mar in the mrva confining unit thickness and sediment chemistry in the central crcga do present opportunities for the use of infiltration galleries for mar approximately a third of the study area is expected to have a confining unit less than 5 m thick allowing for reasonable excavation for placement of recharge systems such as infiltration galleries although this study focused on the central crcga similar surface patterns are expected in other parts of the mississippi alluvial plain about 40 of the existing on farm reservoirs in the study area are located above thin confining sediments and could act as the recharge water sources for mar reservoirs have several advantages to other surface water sources primarily less suspended sediment concentrations during the non production season which will help to extend the operational lifespan of infiltration galleries by minimizing clogging much like the confining unit the upper vadose zone conditions of the mrva appear to vary however in the study locations where geophysical and sampling surveys were conducted upper aquifer sediment was conducive to mar although estimated hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost aquifer material is relatively low compared to other gallery studies bekele et al 2013 this should be adequate to make small inexpensive gallery systems that are cost effective over a moderate lifespan for example a narrow gallery trench 1 25 m wide constructed along one side of a typical 16 ha square reservoir could theoretically recharge 1250 m3d 1 within the conditions observed at the study sites one such gallery would only recharge about 0 024 of the annual groundwater extraction volume for the study area craighead and poinsett counties arkansas which highlights the water balance challenges facing mar kresse et al 2014 however this rate over one recharge season is equivalent to a 47 increase in the storage capacity of that reservoir on the farm scale mar could be a step to significantly reduce groundwater over pumping and provide an opportunity for aquifer stabilization or recovery moreover none of the major minor or trace elements or nutrients measured in the upper aquifer were found at elevated levels that would raise water quality concerns having now defined these parameters close monitoring of recharge water quality should allow for informed decision making on when to stop or reduce recharge due to changes in water quality further sediment chemistry and grain size analysis deeper into the mrva sands should be completed around the region data from sample borings can be used in conjunction with new usgs airborne geophysical data to gain a much clearer and more accurate understanding of mrva properties and potential connectivity with surface water the large scale high resolution usgs survey data will be a crucial tool for the placement and design of mar systems in the delta 4 conclusions improving water management is a major focus of research and policy action throughout agricultural regions of the united states and around the world in the mississippi river valley alluvial mrva aquifer where groundwater irrigated agriculture is often a significant economic sector much of the focus has been on transitioning to using more surface water and less groundwater source conversion is a critical piece of the solution to improving groundwater resource management and there is evidence to support its effectiveness in improving local water balance in the mrva leslie et al 2021 the on farm reservoir and tailwater recovery systems that have developed in the arkansas delta region also present the opportunity for conjunctive use of stored surface water in this study a three phase survey of a portion of the mrva was completed to assess the feasibility of implementing inexpensive passive managed aquifer recharge mar through infiltration galleries this type of mar could essentially extend the storage capacity of on farm reservoirs by moving part of that storage to the subsurface the conditions in the study area indicate that infiltration galleries could be a feasible groundwater conservation tool in as much as 37 of the region based on confining surface sediments the upper mrva sediments appear to be conducive to effective infiltration systems infiltration rate up to 2 5 m d 1 although perhaps at different depths beneath the confining unit furthermore this simple three phase survey demonstrates how spatial analysis remote geophysical and physical sampling of the subsurface can be used in conjunction for efficient site selection for mar systems over a large area the results presented here are of course specific to the central cache river critical groundwater area crcga however the study area functions as a good model system for many other agricultural alluvial aquifer regions the surface and upper aquifer conditions in the central crcga are likely representative of other parts of the mrva including critical groundwater areas in southern arkansas and mississippi where mar could also be beneficial the dupi tila aquifer system of bangladesh is remarkably similar to the mrva the very flat riverine sand and gravel dupi tila aquifer is comparable to the mrva is utilized heavily for irrigation is recharge limited by a silty clay cap at the surface and has experienced significant groundwater declines over the last 50 years hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 like in the mrva a recent response in bangladesh has been the construction of on farm reservoirs to capture and store rain hasan et al 2019 therefore the opportunity exists for conjunctive use of reservoirs and mar in other alluvial aquifer systems the results of investigation and testing of simple mar systems like infiltration galleries in the mrva can be directly applied to other systems furthermore the methodology applied in this study presents a new way for assessing sites specifically for infiltration gallery mar it is important that all groundwater conservation options are weighed however where the use of large infiltration basins or surface spreading is limited by geology site assessment methods designed to cover larger areas may not be the most efficient the survey methods and results presented in this case study will likely encourage and inform similar studies elsewhere to improve groundwater management with infiltration galleries this study did not factor in the cost of infiltration gallery construction in its site selection nor does this study measure the recharge capacity or lifespan of such mar systems given the location of the study area recharge source limitations due to water rights regulations were also not considered here all of these factors will vary significantly by aquifer the agricultural system in with galleries are implemented and operational management and were therefore outside of the scope of this study the fact remains that the technical considerations of mar including site selection and aquifer characterization continue to be a major hurdle for mar implementation this study aimed to address these factors ongoing work in the mrva to pilot test small infiltration galleries in conjunction with on farm reservoirs will fill in many gaps related to recharge capacity cost local water balance and lifespan of infiltration gallery systems declaration of competing interest the

9625,agriculture heavy alluvial aquifer regions around the world have experienced severe groundwater declines due to irrigation demand this consequence has been observed in the united states in the latter half of the 20th century notably in the central valley of california and in the mississippi river valley in some portions of the mississippi river valley such as the cache river critical groundwater area crcga of northeast arkansas drawdown has exceeded 30 m and portends aquifer depletion in the near future in addition to adopting surface water storage and irrigation efficiency methods farm scale managed aquifer recharge mar with infiltration galleries ig gravel filled trenches designed to move surface water into the aquifer may be a useful tool for reducing declines low permeability surface deposits which limit and create significant variation in natural recharge across the region also control the placement of mar systems it is therefore critical to understand the variability of surface deposits as well as underlying aquifer properties to best plan the placement design and operation of such systems this study aimed to characterize surface and upper aquifer conditions to assess the feasibility of ig in the central crcga available well logs were used to interpolate the approximate thickness of surface deposits and identify thinner areas approximately 37 of the study area has less than 5 m of confining material at the surface and included 28 existing reservoirs that could act as recharge water sources guided by this mapping effort geophysical and sediment surveys were conducted at selected sites the upper unsaturated alluvial aquifer of fine silty sand had estimated hydraulic conductivities of 0 20 2 79 m d 1 these results are promising for the implementation of farm scale ig in the study region and suggest that small mar systems could be a useful tool for groundwater management in other agricultural aquifer systems given the proper placement keywords groundwater on farm reservoirs conjunctive use water conservation 1 introduction 1 1 groundwater decline in the arkansas delta to keep up with the water demands of intensive agriculture in the arkansas delta the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrva has been pumped at unsustainable levels for decades clark et al 2011 nearly 2 million ha of farmland in arkansas are irrigated most of this land is located in the arkansas delta defined by the extent of the mrva fig 1 and 95 of irrigation water is sourced from the mrva arkansas natural resources commission 2017 usda national agricultural statistics service 2014 across the delta region the mrva supplies an average of 35 ml d 1 for irrigation maupin and barber 2005 the water pumped from the mrva produces approximately 6 5 billion in agricultural products each year much of this in rice and soybean crops or about 14 of the total united states agricultural value alhassan et al 2019 clark et al 2011 reba et al 2017 groundwater mining in the arkansas delta to meet irrigation needs has led to the formation of two major cones of depression fig 1 in the mrva arkansas natural resources commission 2017 the grand prairie critical groundwater area gpcga established in the counties east of little rock in 1998 has experienced over pumping of the mrva since the 1910 s resulting in declines of over 30 m kresse et al 2014 the cache river area of western craighead poinsett and cross counties has experienced similar groundwater declines mostly since the 1980s leslie et al 2021 reba et al 2017 less than 20 of the mrva remains saturated with the center of the cache cone of depression being less than 5 of its pre pumping saturated thickness yaeger et al 2018 in response the cache river critical groundwater area crcga was designated in 2009 by the arkansas natural resources commission arkansas natural resources commission 2009 models estimating groundwater storage in the mrva based on current pumping levels anticipate continued depletion of parts of the aquifer in the next few decades clark et al 2011 several water conservation approaches are being taken to reduce groundwater usage and improve water sustainability in arkansas the us army corps of engineers usace has developed large scale surface water diversion projects in the gpcga region to drastically reduce groundwater reliance white river irrigation district 2016 although no such project exists or is being planned in the crcga alternative rice growing techniques are currently being considered to reduce agricultural water usage reba et al 2017 in addition the construction of on farm reservoirs and tailwater recovery systems in both the gpcga and the crcga has helped reduce the groundwater usage across all crop types yaeger et al 2017 a third approach to water management and conservation managed aquifer recharge mar has not yet been tested in the arkansas delta region mar could augment groundwater replenishment in the crcga enhance the water usage efficiency of the available storage in on farm reservoirs and along with efficient irrigation techniques and conversion to surface water sources improve the overall water balance of the mrva the trends observed in the critical groundwater areas of arkansas are not unique to the mrva numerous other heavily agricultural aquifer systems worldwide many of which are unconfined or semi confined alluvial aquifers have experienced the same general pattern of increased irrigation and worsening declines over the last 50 years maples et al 2019 wada et al 2012 for example groundwater levels in the dupi tila and other alluvial aquifers of bangladesh have declined at rates exceeding 1 m yr 1 due to increased pumping since the 1960s and 1970s hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 shamsudduha et al 2011 these aquifers are critically important for food production and especially in less affluent regions for drinking water supply therefore better management and recovery of groundwater supply and protection of groundwater quality in these systems is critically important in the case of the indo gangetic alluvial aquifer in northwest india artificial recharge from irrigation canal leakage has been found to be a significant recharge source in some areas van dijk et al 2019 observations like this raise the possibility of using basic infiltration systems like infiltration galleries to artificially recharge stressed agricultural aquifers the hydrogeology water usage and land use conditions in the mrva of arkansas make it a good model system in which to investigate the use of infiltration mar 1 2 regional hydrogeology the mississippi alluvial plain map stretches from the gulf of mexico to southern illinois covering nearly 200 000 km2 in parts of arkansas kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri and tennessee clark et al 2011 the recent pleistocene unconsolidated sediments that fill the alluvial valley overlay tertiary and cretaceous bedrock boswell et al 1965 the map is characterized by low elevation and low topographic relief bounded to the east and west by outcroppings of the underlying rock the region slopes gently to the south falling only about 80 m over the 800 km from southern missouri to the gulf of mexico schumm and spitz 1996 besides terrace formations associated with the major rivers of the region one of the few topographic features within the map is crowley s ridge a thin band of tertiary age silt and clay dominated deposits that runs through northeast arkansas and the missouri boot heel broom and lyford 1981 the ridge extends up to 90 m above the surrounding floodplain and averages about 16 km in width crowley s ridge acts as a hydrologic barrier creating a discontinuity in the otherwise spatially extensive and connected aquifer system in arkansas czarnecki 2010 the mrva is the uppermost and thinnest member of a larger aquifer system within the map that includes the sparta memphis sands claiborne and wilcox aquifers broom and lyford 1981 ranging from about 15 to 60 m in thickness the mrva is primarily composed of sand and gravel of quaternary age lower coarse sediments typically fine upwards to sand and silt due to numerous depositional environments that existed in the region during formation discontinuous layers of silt and clay are common although their presence is highly variable boswell et al 1965 saucier 1994 hydraulic conductivity can vary by more than three orders of magnitude between the silt and clay loam layers and the sands within the mrva rose 2007 much of the upper portion of the mrva is dominated by clay rich backswamp deposits which act as a surface confining unit that reduces or completely restricts natural recharge fisk 1944 the confining unit can be nearly absent in some areas and up to 20 m thick in others corresponding with a thinner mrva water bearing unit some of the thickest areas of clayey deposits are along the boundaries of crowley s ridge which defines the eastern edge of the crcga gonthier and mahon 1993 in this area annual recharge rates from precipitation are likely less than about 50 mm because of the low permeability surface deposits broom and lyford 1981 limited recharge through the surface confining unit and excessive groundwater extraction have generated a large cone of depression across the cache river region 1 3 infiltration galleries for managed aquifer recharge as water usage continues to increase and groundwater declines in the mrva become more severe all options for groundwater conservation will need to be considered arkansas is not by any means a dry state the arkansas delta region receives about 1200 mm of precipitation each year on average average rainfall therefore exceeds the typical irrigation needs of rice and soybean in the region or about 920 and 280 mm respectively massey et al 2017 however much of the rainfall is not appropriately timed to meet the irrigation needs of these primary crops this has led to a dependence on groundwater for irrigation regionally only about 12 of irrigation water is from surface water sources usda national agricultural statistics service 2019 capture and storage of ample surface water flow in the winter non production season october march is generally underutilized a recent increase in on farm storage reservoir construction is aimed at addressing this problem yaeger et al 2018 2017 on farm reservoirs collect precipitation and ditch flow during the non production season for later irrigation use but can reach their limited storage capacity early in the winter during wetter conditions despite this farms with reservoir storage can meet much more of their irrigation demand with surface water than the regional average of 12 mar systems could facilitate additional underground storage of winter surface water if used in conjunction with on farm reservoirs mar and aquifer storage and recovery asr are commonly used groundwater conservation methods in semi arid or arid regions where surface water may only be abundant over a short portion of the year and usually not timed with periods of greatest need bouwer 2002 dillon 2005 the volume of water stored each year through mar systems has increased by about 5 each year over the last half century with the united states and india being the largest rechargers dillon et al 2019 despite the growth in mar recharge rates are being outpaced by increases in groundwater pumping dillon et al 2019 the authors recognize that adopting water use metering technology and increasing monitoring of groundwater systems where conservation actions are implemented is also critical for optimization of groundwater resource management thomas 2019 mar is no exception and successful testing and implementation of infiltration galleries and other mar technologies must be accompanied by improved metering and groundwater level tracking wendt et al 2021 a common recharge method is direct injection where water is pumped through a dedicated well directly back into the saturated zone of the aquifer the recharge water used for direct injection must be treated to a high degree which for farm scale implementation of galleries would require treatment facilities at each injection site direct injection was not considered in this study in order to keep infrastructure costs energy usage and cost for pre treatment of surface water to a minimum cost benefit analysis has shown that surface infiltration can be financially competitive or favorable to direct injection in the right setting arshad et al 2014 the high initial costs and strict water quality regulations for injection would hinder the adoption of such systems by producers and landowners this is not only true in the mrva but also in systems like the dupi tila aquifer of bangladesh where there is much more limited infrastructure capital large scale spreading basins are also not feasible because of both high value of agricultural land and the presence of a surface confining unit however an infiltration gallery should be adaptable to variable surface conditions and land use challenges of the mrva and other agricultural regions infiltration galleries also called infiltration trenches or vadose zone galleries are essentially percolation trenches that are backfilled with a porous structural fill and buried beneath the surface the porous fill can store a large volume of water and also provides filtration as the infiltrated water passes through bouwer 2002 galleries are often used for stormwater management and wastewater treatment but can be tailored for use in groundwater recharge amoozegar et al 2008 bekele et al 2013 an example of successful implementation of galleries for mar is the walla walla basin project in washington state the project tested multiple gallery designs using irrigation canal water as the source and achieved recharge rates as high as 0 46 l s 1 per m3 equivalent to 3974 m3 d 1 3 2 ac ft d 1 for a 100 m2 gallery bower 2011 infiltration galleries have also been applied for mar using treated wastewater and have resulted in improved recharge water quality bekele et al 2013 unlike other mar methods gallery systems are ideal where a thin surface confining unit overlays more permeable aquifer sediments such as in many alluvial aquifers bouwer 2002 the gallery trench can be excavated to the depth necessary to expose permeable sediments but also covered to restore the surface to near pre excavation conditions bekele et al 2013 the only surface manifestation of buried infiltration galleries are the water conveyance system and any monitoring instrumentation the inherent flexibility in the design of infiltration galleries makes them an appropriate fit for most agricultural landscapes especially that of the mrva common construction materials the need for little to no pre treatment of the recharge water and low energy requirements for operation can make infiltration galleries a low cost recharge method bouwer 2002 however cost effective implementation of galleries hinges on a strong understanding of the variable surface and subsurface conditions characteristic of alluvial aquifer systems in this case study we assumed that a major component constraining the economic implementation of infiltration galleries is the distance to the recharge water source on farm reservoir pond river ditch etc 1 4 purpose and aims groundwater declines in the mrva pose a threat to the sustainability of regional agriculture this is true for many other agricultural alluvial aquifers worldwide multiple approaches have been taken to reduce groundwater withdrawals from the mrva including increasing surface water retention and developing water saving irrigation practices mar has shown promise for groundwater conservation in other areas particularly in western united states e g henry et al 2013 in washington and oregon but implementation has lagged elsewhere including in the mrva low permeability surface geology limited surface water recharge sources protection of aquifer water quality and a lack of available non agricultural land are typical challenges to mar in many alluvial aquifers maples et al 2019 infiltration galleries may be flexible enough in design construction and operation to circumvent these challenges the goal of this work is to determine the feasibility of small scale infiltration galleries for local groundwater recharge in the mrva as a model system specifically this three part study aims to investigate the thickness and variability of the confining unit characterize the physical and geochemical properties of the confining unit and uppermost mrva sediments and to assess the potential recharge performance capabilities of small infiltration galleries furthermore this study presents a combined desktop and field methodology for evaluating potential sites for mar with infiltration galleries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the central crcga study area is located along the western edge of crowley s ridge from approximately 35 53 to 35 30 n and extends westward to approximately 91 03 w fig 2 this 1650 km2 area is located within two hydrologic unit code 8 watersheds the cache river watershed 08020302 and the l anguille river watershed 08020205 the study area averages an annual precipitation of 1200 mm and a mean temperature of 16 2 c reba et al 2017 the topography of the central crcga is relatively flat averaging less than 1 slope ferguson 1979 most precipitation does not infiltrate deeply into the mrva and instead flows into agricultural ditches and channelized streams into the cache and l anguille rivers which then flow out of the crcga and into the mississippi river the study area contains 70 on farm reservoirs identified by yaeger et al 2017 and updated as of 2019 which collect rain and surface water for irrigation use fig 2 on farm reservoirs in the crcga average 14 1 ha in size but range from 1 to 125 ha most reservoirs in the crcga are located where less than 40 of the mrva remains saturated and groundwater levels are deep yaeger et al 2018 on farm reservoirs are the only reliable surface water source throughout the study area with sufficient volume and low sediment levels required for infiltration multiple years of water quality monitoring in a subset of on farm reservoirs in the crcga suggest that levels of suspended sediments and agricultural nutrients may be lowest in the non production season kahill 2016 furthermore reservoir water quality tends to be much more favorable compared to other surface water sources in the delta region such as streams and agricultural ditches grantz et al 2020 kahill 2016 to date infiltration galleries have not been implemented in the region and on farm reservoirs continue to be developed for surface water storage for the purposes of this study it was assumed that on farm reservoirs would be the primary recharge water source and that galleries would be constructed within close proximity to these features 2 2 mapping survey methods a mapping survey was conducted to identify areas with a thin confining unit defined as 5 m for potential placement of an infiltration gallery focusing on where groundwater declines have been the greatest within the central crcga the 5 m threshold while largely arbitrary was chosen as the limit of reasonable excavation for a gallery trench previously published maps of the mrva confining unit thickness in eastern arkansas were developed from interpolation of irrigation well logs gonthier and mahon 1993 the number and location of wells used by gonthier and mahon were unclear thus a new mapping effort in the crcga using well logs located specifically in the project area of interest was developed mapping subsurface geology from well logs requires many data points the arkansas water well construction commission awwcc keeps a publicly available database of irrigation industrial and domestic well construction logs installed in the state water well construction commission of arkansas 2019 many well logs within the project area contained unclear or were missing critical information logs lacking exact coordinates and thickness of the surface confining layer were excluded from the mapping effort nearly two thirds of the approximately 1000 irrigation well logs in the study area were missing some critical information or were duplicates the locations of well logs containing all necessary information were digitized using arcgis desktop with a total of 391 wells available within the area of interest version 10 5 1 esri redlands ca in addition to location each well data point also included the depth from the surface to the base of the surface confining unit as described in the corresponding well log the interpolation toolset spatial analyst tools was used to create a contour surface representing the anticipated thickness of the confining unit a natural neighbor interpolation with a 100 m cell size was applied and the resulting confining unit surface was manually reclassified with eight depth classes spanning 0 15 m intervals of 0 75 3 0 m the locations of on farm reservoirs were superimposed on the interpolated confining unit surface using the spatial join tool the minimum confining unit thickness within the footprint of each reservoir was calculated the thickness estimated within the reservoir footprint was used as a proxy for the thickness in the area immediately around the reservoir where infiltration galleries would potentially be placed the spatial extent and distribution of areas where the confining unit was 5 m thick were then compared to the locations of existing on farm reservoirs 2 3 geophysical survey methods the mapping efforts described above resulted in a map of anticipated confining unit thickness in relation to on farm reservoirs although a useful guide the interpolation results need to be assessed further using field based measurements of the confining unit thickness five on farm reservoirs sites c ht hb s and w in the study area with long term water quality data grantz et al 2020 were chosen for further investigation with ground based geophysical surveys using electrical resistivity fig 2 electrical resistivity surveying ers measures the electrical properties of the subsurface along a two dimensional profile using grounded electrodes us environmental protection agency 2016 and silts are more conductive relative to coarser materials and materials rich in silica which act as resistors thus ers is a suitable method for locating the base of the clayey confining unit further verifying the thickness of the layer and characterizing the upper aquifer ers and similar methods such as towed time domain electromagnetic ttem and frequency domain electromagnetic surveys fdem have been used for a recent mar site assessment study in the central valley of california behroozmand et al 2019 in this study which was evaluating sites for large scale spreading basins ttem gave better spatial coverage at a higher efficiency than would be possible with ers for relatively small elongated areas located on the margins of existing reservoirs ers surveys were an efficient way to obtain high horizontal and vertical resolution targeted to the relatively smaller area of interest in coordination with the united states geological survey usgs ers was conducted at the five selected sites to gain more accurate site specific estimates of the confining unit thickness an iris syscal pro switch system iris instruments orleans france was used for the surveys survey line lengths and configurations varied based on available space and conditions at each site table s1 inverse schlumberger array method was used for all ers surveys us environmental protection agency 2016 all survey lines had minimal elevation variability within the approximate vertical resolution of a 1 m electrode spacing survey therefore the impact of site topography on the data was expected to be minimal apparent resistivity values were inverted using res2dinv ver 3 59 which automatically selects the ideal forward model and inversion parameters to apply to the smoothness constrained gauss newton least squares inversion technique geotomo software 2018 because the range of resistivity values varied widely among sites the base of the confining unit was identified by the interval of greatest resistivity change per unit length transition between two materials and not by a single resistivity value the depth of this transition and the resistivity at that depth were both noted the ers profiles were further validated by completing shallow borings in the same areas 2 4 aquifer sediment sampling and analysis methods shallow borings and aquifer sediment collection focused on sites where the interpolated and ers survey estimated confining unit thickness was less than 5 m for this reason sites c and s were not included in the sediment survey the goal of these borings was to sample the lower confining unit transition zone and upper unsaturated zone of the mrva for site specific characterization of grain size distribution major minor and trace element sediment geochemistry and mineralogy at least two shallow soil borings were drilled near each of the three reservoir sites ht hb and w soil borings were completed as close to the ers survey lines as possible within approximately 30 m in collaboration with the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs a trailer mounted giddings probe with a 5 1 cm diameter continuous flight auger was used to advance each boring and collect samples the auger was advanced until refusal variations in soil density across boring locations resulted in varied maximum sampling depths of 5 5 9 5 m sediment samples were obtained from the auger after extracted from the borehole following the standard practice for soil exploration and sampling by auger borings astm d1452 two composite soil samples referred to as a samples and b samples were collected over an approximately 30 cm interval at each sampling point a samples were placed in a sealed plastic sample bag for in situ moisture content measurements and b samples were placed in a soil sample box for grain size distribution and chemical and mineralogical analyses moisture content from a samples was determined in the usda agricultural research service ars delta water management research unit dwmru lab following a standard method astm d2216 b samples were sent to the university of missouri soil and plant testing lab for textural and chemical analysis university of missouri extension 2019 specific analyses included grain size analysis soil texture ph organic matter cation exchange capacity cec and elemental analyses see supplemental data major minor and trace elements and nutrients were analyzed for adsorbed sediment bound and soluble phase concentrations it is these phases that are most readily mobilized during infiltration through the aquifer sediment all methods used are outlined in soil testing in missouri nathan et al 2012 hydraulic conductivities of the samples were estimated from the grain size distribution data using two empirical formulas the chapuis and beyer equations are less commonly used than the hazen and kozeny carman equations but are more appropriate for very fine materials d10 0 25 mm the formulas for the chapuis and beyer equations respectively are below rosas et al 2014 chapuis et al 2005 beyer 1964 1 cm s 2

for all samples typical for fine sand and the void ratio e was assumed to be 0 429 for all samples other variables include the coefficient of curvature c a ratio of d10 d30 and d60 grain sizes mineralogical analysis was conducted on dried a samples using fourier transform infrared ftir analysis with a perkin elmer spectrum ii spectrometer perkinelmer inc waltham ma at the dwmru lab samples were hand pulverized using a mortar and pestle until the material reached a fine powder consistency attenuated total reflectance atr was used to directly analyze the solid samples without further preparation sample spectra collection occurred at 120 130 n from 4000 to 360 cm 1 spectra were analyzed qualitatively using spectragryph menges 2019 v1 2 12 oberstdorf germany and peaks were identified by manual comparison with similar spectra of minerals commonly found in alluvial sediments 3 results and discussion 3 1 mapping survey the interpolated thickness estimate of the surface confining unit within the study area varied between 1 4 and nearly 15 m and did not exhibit a regular spatial pattern fig 3 the thickest portions of the confining unit were in the southwest corner of the study area and are potentially associated with relict meander paths of the lower cache river saucier 1994 confining unit sediment exceeding 10 m thick was also mapped along the western edge of crowley s ridge near harrisburg and jonesboro which agrees with previous mapping of the confining unit gonthier and mahon 1993 only two small regions of very thin confining unit less than 3 m were identified covering 0 8 of the study area the confining unit in the northwest portion of the study area may be even thinner than the 1 4 m minimum predicted by the map as several well logs that existed there failed to note the presence of the confining unit both of these areas are coincident with the channelized reaches of the northern portion of the cache river which may provide some local recharge to the mrva overall 37 of the study area was predicted to have a confining unit thickness as less than 5 m of the 70 existing on farm reservoirs within the study area 28 were located in areas with a confining unit thickness of less than 5 m mostly in the central and southeastern portion of the study area only two reservoirs were located where the confining unit was less than 4 m and there were none in the regions with less than 3 m because several meters of excavation are usually required for reservoir construction it makes sense that fewer reservoirs are located where the confining unit is less than 4 m thick any thinner would result in leaky reservoirs the thinner confining unit regions were also located primarily along the northwest edge of the crcga cone of depression where lesser groundwater declines have led to fewer reservoirs being constructed a significant portion of the study area appears to have favorable surface conditions for infiltration gallery construction based solely on the confining unit thickness the inherent variability in fine surface deposits that is a challenge common to other agricultural alluvial aquifer systems maples et al 2019 rahman et al 2013 makes conditions in many areas impractical but leaves plenty of room for innovation importantly in the study area 40 of existing reservoirs are located in these favorable areas which removes an engineering barrier to wide implementation of galleries simply put the recharge source water already exists in the reservoirs the locations of reservoirs with favorable surface conditions also correlated with areas of significant decline and therefore the greatest need for groundwater replenishment eight on farm reservoirs within the study area have been the subject of long term water quality monitoring by the dwmru of these reservoirs c ht hb s and w are immediately surrounded by open areas potentially suitable for infiltration gallery construction and were selected for further investigation using geophysical surveying see fig 3 based on the mapping results the anticipated confining unit thickness for the five selected sites ranged from 4 0 to 7 5 m 3 2 geophysical survey the same overall patterns in resistivity were observed across all sites and survey lines very conductive material less than 50 ωm at the surface interpreted as silt and clay dominated soil was underlain by more resistive material more than 150 ωm coarser silt and sand in all cases fig 4 a brief transition zone was observed between the conductive and resistive layers the conductive layer above the transition zone typically between about 4 and 100 ωm was interpreted as the confining unit the survey sites also differed in the resistivity of the underlying material site w for example reached resistivities in the range of 2000 4000 ωm at a depth of 6 7 m in comparison resistivities in one survey line at site c only reached about 150 ωm even at a depth of 8 m in an mar site survey in the central valley of california resistivity was converted to approximate lithology using regional well bore resistivity data behroozmand et al 2019 without similar regional data and details on how the differences in pore water chemistry and aquifer mineralogy affect resistivity it is not feasible to directly relate resistivity values among sites or convert resistivity data to lithological units in turn the base of the confining unit was identified not by a single predetermined resistivity value but instead by the location of a rapid transition in relative resistivity table 1 generally the confining unit was of consistent thickness across the survey lines and was homogenous both vertically and laterally fig 4 sites c ht and s had thin layers of moderate resistivity 75 150 ωm in the upper 0 5 1 0 m these surveys were all conducted between the reservoir levee and adjacent tailwater recovery ditch excess material from the excavation of the reservoir is often placed as fill around the levee the moderate resistivity surface layer at these sites was interpreted as this fill resistivity increased rapidly at the base of the confining unit at all sites eventually becoming once again fairly homogenous this transition zone appears to span 1 0 m at sites ht and hb 1 5 m at sites c and up to 2 0 m at site s the transition zone varied from approximately 0 5 1 0 m at site w possibly because of the larger area covered by the survey lines at this site the depth to the transition in resistivity interpreted as the thickness of the confining unit varied across the five study sites as well as between survey lines within each site the thickness of the confining unit was generally within 2 m of the mapped thickness for sites ht hb and c table 1 the confining unit at site s was significantly thicker than the map estimate the 192 m line at site s was the only survey to detect substantial variation in confining unit thickness this along with the different appearance of the upper soil layer at site s suggested that artificial fill related to the construction of the reservoir may be responsible for this discrepancy the confining unit at site w was thinner than the map estimate the interpolated thickness at site w was heavily influenced by three well points which were located along a major agricultural ditch the ditch was channelized along what was a meandering natural drainage feature fine grained overbank deposits and fill material from the channelization process could make the confining unit effectively thicker in these areas as a result the predicted thickness at nearby site w may have been skewed based on the ers survey results sites c and s were not considered for further investigation because the confining unit thickness was in excess of 5 m excavating through the 6 8 m of confining sediment at these sites would not be feasible given the large footprint and construction costs sites w ht and hb were investigated further through sediment analysis unlike with the ttem subsurface method the depth of measurement for ers is proportional to the total survey line length the survey line lengths used in this survey maximum of 192 m limited the overall depth of measurement to about 25 m for this reason the regional water table about 30 m depth was not detected by resistivity methods this is an advantage of the ttem system which can provide deeper measurements within a smaller area behroozmand et al 2019 3 3 aquifer sediment analysis sediment analysis showed grain size and soil texture chemical and mineralogical differences between the confining unit transition zone and the upper aquifer the texture of the confining unit was primarily silt loam with a 1 3 m thick loam or sandy loam transition zone fig 4 in most borings loamy sand or clean sand was encountered at a depth of about 5 m however in two borings hb 2 and w 1 the sandy loam material extended to the deepest samples at approximately 8 5 10 0 m the discrepancy between these borings and the shallower transition observed in the ers data may be related to the method of sampling by auger recovery which risks contamination with material from the upper portion of the borehole grain size distributions were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity the chapuis and beyer methods developed for materials with 0 03 d10 0 60 mm are appropriate for the materials in this study rosas et al 2014 hydraulic conductivities of about 0 3 2 5 m d 1 were estimated for samples from a depth of approximately 5 m table 2 these conductivity values are adequate to quickly infiltrate water by maintaining a constant water level in an infiltration gallery of sufficient size chemical conditions in the upper aquifer were also found to be largely favorable for mar levels of minor elements trace metals and nutrients in the aquifer sediments were found to be very low table s2 posing little threat of leaching into groundwater during recharge godwin 2020 sediment cec 3 4 6 2 meq 100 g and organic matter 0 0 0 3 were also very low which is expected for sandy alluvial deposits but which may limit the natural treatment potential of the soil negligible organic matter likely supports a limited microbial community in the upper aquifer that may play only a minor biological role in the cycling of introduced nutrients such as nitrate ammonium and phosphate however the introduction of oxygenated reservoir water containing suspended and dissolved organic matter and an existing microbial population to the upper vadose zone may raise the level of beneficial microbial activity immediately below a gallery site hb had higher levels of soil sodium 160 5 ppm manganese 214 0 ppm and nitrate 8 80 ppm than the other sites less than 58 0 ppm 106 5 ppm and 1 0 ppm respectively it is unclear why this is but it could indicate a more rapid infiltration of water from surface at the sampling location resulting in less attenuation of these components higher sodium could develop if irrigation water was infiltrating into the subsurface through the confining unit this process could also carry more nitrates to the vadose zone from the surface soil ph 4 5 7 5 was one of the more variable factors across sites and may explain some variability in major elements elements such as calcium magnesium phosphorus and potassium are most available mobile in solution closer to a neutral ph like found at sites w and hb the acidic soils at site ht had the lowest calcium concentrations conversely iron manganese boron copper and zinc are most available in acidic conditions sims and patrick 1978 the acidic soils at site ht had elevated iron 20 1 ppm slightly higher zinc 0 8 ppm and moderate levels of manganese 106 5 ppm compared to the other sites under the acidic conditions at site ht introduction of reservoir water which tends to be slightly alkaline could cause a large shift in soil chemistry as calcium iron magnesium or other elements may exhibit greater mobility mineralogy analysis determined that major mineral assemblages across sites were consistent to some extent mineral composition was also consistent between the confining unit and the upper aquifer the confining unit was a kaolinite montmorillonite quartz feldspar assemblage similarly the upper aquifer was a quartz kaolinite montmorillonite feldspar assemblage carbonates gypsum and iron oxides appeared to be trace components most original feldspar has weathered to kaolinite although some remains gypsum is likely related to the dissolution of carbonate minerals in the presence of sulfuric acid which could be derived from bacterial activity van breemen 1973 goethite hematite was visible in some samples as a reddish coating on quartz sand grains and in kaolinite clumps the presence of such iron oxides is important because of their ability to absorb many potential contaminants the limitation of ftir compared to x ray diffraction is that minerals with very similar ir spectral reflectance cannot be easily distinguished several other minerals such as muscovite vermiculite and smectite may be present in trace levels in these samples but were potentially undetectable because of spectral overlap with other major components similarly some dark or opaque minerals that may be found in these samples such as magnetite have few distinguishing ir spectral peaks some dark opaque mineral grains were present in the material and it is unclear if these were accounted for in the ftir analysis given the soil ph 4 5 7 5 of the upper aquifer material at sites w and hb and of typical on farm reservoirs of about 8 0 8 7 godwin 2020 there is little concern of metal mobility by mineral dissolution from ph changes dolomite calcite and gypsum dissolution and re precipitation which could reduce the porosity of the aquifer material would be a potential concern in the acidic soils of site ht or if surface waters were acidic in nature the presence of clays and iron oxide minerals in the upper aquifer may assist in removal of recharge contaminants specifically ammonium glyphosate and metals through absorption and cation exchange al rajab et al 2008 bergström et al 2011 hartley et al 2004 miles and moye 1988 however because the dominant clay mineral is kaolinite the impact of cation exchange and therefore metal mobilization is expected to be low 3 4 site favorability for mar in the mrva confining unit thickness and sediment chemistry in the central crcga do present opportunities for the use of infiltration galleries for mar approximately a third of the study area is expected to have a confining unit less than 5 m thick allowing for reasonable excavation for placement of recharge systems such as infiltration galleries although this study focused on the central crcga similar surface patterns are expected in other parts of the mississippi alluvial plain about 40 of the existing on farm reservoirs in the study area are located above thin confining sediments and could act as the recharge water sources for mar reservoirs have several advantages to other surface water sources primarily less suspended sediment concentrations during the non production season which will help to extend the operational lifespan of infiltration galleries by minimizing clogging much like the confining unit the upper vadose zone conditions of the mrva appear to vary however in the study locations where geophysical and sampling surveys were conducted upper aquifer sediment was conducive to mar although estimated hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost aquifer material is relatively low compared to other gallery studies bekele et al 2013 this should be adequate to make small inexpensive gallery systems that are cost effective over a moderate lifespan for example a narrow gallery trench 1 25 m wide constructed along one side of a typical 16 ha square reservoir could theoretically recharge 1250 m3d 1 within the conditions observed at the study sites one such gallery would only recharge about 0 024 of the annual groundwater extraction volume for the study area craighead and poinsett counties arkansas which highlights the water balance challenges facing mar kresse et al 2014 however this rate over one recharge season is equivalent to a 47 increase in the storage capacity of that reservoir on the farm scale mar could be a step to significantly reduce groundwater over pumping and provide an opportunity for aquifer stabilization or recovery moreover none of the major minor or trace elements or nutrients measured in the upper aquifer were found at elevated levels that would raise water quality concerns having now defined these parameters close monitoring of recharge water quality should allow for informed decision making on when to stop or reduce recharge due to changes in water quality further sediment chemistry and grain size analysis deeper into the mrva sands should be completed around the region data from sample borings can be used in conjunction with new usgs airborne geophysical data to gain a much clearer and more accurate understanding of mrva properties and potential connectivity with surface water the large scale high resolution usgs survey data will be a crucial tool for the placement and design of mar systems in the delta 4 conclusions improving water management is a major focus of research and policy action throughout agricultural regions of the united states and around the world in the mississippi river valley alluvial mrva aquifer where groundwater irrigated agriculture is often a significant economic sector much of the focus has been on transitioning to using more surface water and less groundwater source conversion is a critical piece of the solution to improving groundwater resource management and there is evidence to support its effectiveness in improving local water balance in the mrva leslie et al 2021 the on farm reservoir and tailwater recovery systems that have developed in the arkansas delta region also present the opportunity for conjunctive use of stored surface water in this study a three phase survey of a portion of the mrva was completed to assess the feasibility of implementing inexpensive passive managed aquifer recharge mar through infiltration galleries this type of mar could essentially extend the storage capacity of on farm reservoirs by moving part of that storage to the subsurface the conditions in the study area indicate that infiltration galleries could be a feasible groundwater conservation tool in as much as 37 of the region based on confining surface sediments the upper mrva sediments appear to be conducive to effective infiltration systems infiltration rate up to 2 5 m d 1 although perhaps at different depths beneath the confining unit furthermore this simple three phase survey demonstrates how spatial analysis remote geophysical and physical sampling of the subsurface can be used in conjunction for efficient site selection for mar systems over a large area the results presented here are of course specific to the central cache river critical groundwater area crcga however the study area functions as a good model system for many other agricultural alluvial aquifer regions the surface and upper aquifer conditions in the central crcga are likely representative of other parts of the mrva including critical groundwater areas in southern arkansas and mississippi where mar could also be beneficial the dupi tila aquifer system of bangladesh is remarkably similar to the mrva the very flat riverine sand and gravel dupi tila aquifer is comparable to the mrva is utilized heavily for irrigation is recharge limited by a silty clay cap at the surface and has experienced significant groundwater declines over the last 50 years hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 like in the mrva a recent response in bangladesh has been the construction of on farm reservoirs to capture and store rain hasan et al 2019 therefore the opportunity exists for conjunctive use of reservoirs and mar in other alluvial aquifer systems the results of investigation and testing of simple mar systems like infiltration galleries in the mrva can be directly applied to other systems furthermore the methodology applied in this study presents a new way for assessing sites specifically for infiltration gallery mar it is important that all groundwater conservation options are weighed however where the use of large infiltration basins or surface spreading is limited by geology site assessment methods designed to cover larger areas may not be the most efficient the survey methods and results presented in this case study will likely encourage and inform similar studies elsewhere to improve groundwater management with infiltration galleries this study did not factor in the cost of infiltration gallery construction in its site selection nor does this study measure the recharge capacity or lifespan of such mar systems given the location of the study area recharge source limitations due to water rights regulations were also not considered here all of these factors will vary significantly by aquifer the agricultural system in with galleries are implemented and operational management and were therefore outside of the scope of this study the fact remains that the technical considerations of mar including site selection and aquifer characterization continue to be a major hurdle for mar implementation this study aimed to address these factors ongoing work in the mrva to pilot test small infiltration galleries in conjunction with on farm reservoirs will fill in many gaps related to recharge capacity cost local water balance and lifespan of infiltration gallery systems declaration of competing interest the

located in the three main avocado growing regions of new zealand from 2016 to 2019 the three regions the bay of plenty the whangarei district and the aupouri peninsula in the far north district differ in climate and soil type allophanic clay and sandy soils respectively at each site local meteorological conditions were monitored avocado tree water use was quantified using heat pulse sap flow measurement total leaf area was obtained periodically fruit load was recorded at harvest and shaded area was measured in mid summer reference evapotranspiration et o calculated by the fao 56 penman montieth equation was highest in january at 3 8 mm whangarei to 4 3 mm bay of plenty and lowest in june at 0 7 mm bay of plenty to 0 8 mm whangarei and far north the three sites had similar patterns of tree water use relative to et o regardless of the differences in soil type and tree water use was highest in january at 2 7 mm d 1 and lowest in june at 1 2 1 4 mm d 1 across the three sites individual tree water use was related to variation in tree spacing and leaf area per tree but on an orchard area basis was influenced more by fruit load resulting in variation in estimated crop coefficients k c among individual trees and seasons at all sites average monthly k c was similar across all sites with a value of 0 60 0 65 in mid summer as all three orchards were considered mature with fully grown canopies and 75 orchard shaded area however tree water use also increased from light to heavy fruit load therefore when irrigation is applied to avocado k c values should be adjusted for variation in fruit load with a range from 0 50 to 0 85 in mid summer keywords evapotranspiration transpiration irrigation crop factor fruit yield new zealand nomenclature e soil evaporation et c crop evapotranspiration e t et o reference evapotranspiration et wb crop evapotranspiration calculated from soil water balance method k c crop coefficient k cb basal crop coefficient t plant transpiration 1 introduction planting of horticultural crops across the world is increasing putting pressure on the amount of water available for crop production this is true for the new zealand avocado industry where orchard area has increased over the past 20 years current 2021 plantings are approximately 4000 ha and this is projected to increase to around 10 000 ha by 2041 to improve fruit production avocado trees should be irrigated if there is a prolonged dry period during fruit development carr 2013 pleguezuelo et al 2018 however developing an irrigation strategy for a novel crop requires research that incorporates the effects of climate soils and crop management plant water use is influenced by weather conditions such as air temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed allen et al 1998a alves et al 2007 the k c et o approach the fao56 method may be the simplest method to calculate plant water use if weather data are available the crop coefficient k c is defined as the ratio of crop evapotranspiration et c to reference evapotranspiration et o allen 1986 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 wright 1982 et o can be calculated from weather data using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998a 2006 thus from a known k c for a specific crop and measurements of local weather conditions et c can be estimated however compared to herbaceous crops the k c values of fruiting trees can be variable and dependent on a number of plant physiological variables such as leaf area tree density pruning operations fruit load and ground cover juhasz et al 2013 avocado in particular has unique characteristics compared to other tree crops including a very long fruit development period and a strong tendency towards alternate or variable bearing that creates variation in fruit yield between on and off cropping years lovatt 2010 to account for this variation and understand the water use of fruiting trees independently of evaporation from other surfaces et c can be divided into two components plant transpiration t and water loss from the ground surface or ground cover crop e allen et al 1998b wright 1982 in this case the basal crop coefficient k cb is determined as the ratio of t to et o whereas k c is defined as a ratio of et c to et o and et c is the sum of t and e flumignan et al 2011 goodwin et al 2006 paco et al 2006 the k cb values represent plant water use itself regardless of soil evaporation and transpiration from ground cover such as grass for accurate estimation of the k cb values t can be obtained by sap flow measurement that involves the installation of needle like probes in the main trunk of woody species green et al 2003 sap flow measurement with the compensation heat pulse method chpm has been widely used to quantify the water use of tree crops such as lemon alarcon et al 2005 apricot nicolas et al 2005 olive fernandez et al 2001 almond nortes et al 2009 orange fernandez et al 2006 and avocado kaneko 2016 in contrast k c values include both plant water use and the water loss from the soil and soil evaporation can be influenced by the type of ground cover and the proportion of ground area shaded by the crop allen and pereira 2009 both t and e are required for calculation of k c et c et o e can be obtained from the difference between t and crop evapotranspiration calculated from the soil water balance method et wb estimation of et wb is based on continuous soil moisture measurements knowledge of drainage and surface flows and the concept of water fluxes from the soil to plant to atmosphere or from the soil to atmosphere as a continuum bonan et al 2014 avocado is a large evergreen tree that can grow over 10 15 m in height chanderbali et al 2013 for large trees t and e are strongly influenced by tree size leaf area and planting density due to solar energy partitioning wang et al 2007 when trees are young there is generally a linear relationship between the k c values of an orchard and the area of soil surface shaded by the tree canopy as has been observed in peach johnson et al 2002 and pecan trees winer 2007 however this linear relationship usually reaches a plateau or maximum k c when the proportion of area shaded reaches a threshold value typically around 0 8 as the tree canopy develops andales et al 2006 thus adjustment of k c may be needed for avocado to account for tree spacing and age crown size leaf area and consequent variation in shaded area in new zealand avocado is grown in the warmer regions of the north island namely the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north thorp et al 1997 and these areas have different characteristic soil types allophanic clay and sandy soils respectively hewitt 2010 soil properties influence both plant performance and the way irrigation should be managed allophanic soil in the bay of plenty has a high water holding capacity and lower soil bulk density that offers less resistance to root growth environment bay of plenty 2010 compared to allophanic soil clay soils in whangarei consist of smaller particles less pore spaces and are poorly drained therefore a longer irrigation interval may be adequate in contrast sandy soil in the far north has larger particles and poor water retention properties and requires a shorter irrigation interval molloy 1988 in new zealand avocado trees are generally irrigated in spring and summer during the periods of the early fruit growth and intensive shoot growth however avocado tree water requirements under variable new zealand soil conditions have not been quantified in addition for fruiting trees fruit load also has an important role many studies have reported that plant water use increases from light to heavy fruit load for example in apple naor et al 2008 olive gucci et al 2007 peach berman and dejong 1996 grapevine naor et al 1997 and avocado silber et al 2013b there is some literature carr 2013 du plessis 1991 kaneko 2016 lahav et al 2013 that provides k c for avocado orchards as a basic irrigation guideline however plants behave differently from place to place and these k c values were determined without consideration of fruit load the effect of fruit load may be particularly important for avocado because of the strong tendency for variable bearing especially under new zealand conditions gould et al 2019 the aim of this research was to measure et o t and e for mature hass avocado trees in the three avocado growing regions of the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north et o was calculated from local meteorological data with the fao 56 penman monteith equation t was obtained from sap flow measurement and e was determined from the difference between sap flow measurement and the soil water balance based on the et o t and e values k c values for avocado were determined to provide reliable k c values this study examines variation in avocado tree water use associated with the combination of the weather conditions soil type and fruit load 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and the experiment this research was conducted at orchards in three avocado growing regions here referred to as the bay of plenty 37 39 17 964 s 176 1 12 936 e whangarei 35 46 41 376 e 174 7 56 9712 e and the far north 34 48 54 s 173 7 4 8 e the mean annual air temperatures were 14 9 15 8 and 15 7 c and the normal annual total rainfall was 1190 1300 and 1250

in whangarei and houhora sand typic sandy brown soil in the far north hewitt 2010 the experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 in the far north the experimental trees began to show symptoms of disease from july 2018 all branches were pruned at this site in january 2019 and all sensors were removed in april 2019 2 2 plant materials and orchard management at each site five mature trees of persea americana hass avocado grafted on zutano seedling rootstock were selected basic tree information is presented in table 1 experimental trees were considered well irrigated with one micro sprinkler per tree positioned under the canopy between 1 and 3 m above the ground a portable soil water measurement system hydrosense campbell scientific logan ut was used to check for even spread of water from the micro sprinklers up to the canopy drip line the amount of water applied at each irrigation was 600 l in the bay of plenty and whangarei and 210 l in the far north equivalent to 8 12 mm and 6 6 mm based on tree spacing table 1 respectively irrigation intervals were 6 8 days 8 12 days and 3 4 days respectively with irrigation decisions made by the individual growers based on measurements of soil moisture content within the orchards the ground was covered by leaf litter under the tree canopy and the grass between rows was mowed periodically by the growers 2 3 weather

2020 2 4 sap flow plant transpiration t was obtained from sap flow measurements two sap flow probe sets model hp3tc s tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north new zealand per tree were installed at each site with measurements recorded from 2017 to 2019 each sap flow probe set was composed of two temperature probes and one heater and the temperature probes had three copper constantan thermocouples positioned at depths of 15 25 and 40 mm from the bark the heater probe was 1 8 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length the probes were installed on the main trunk around 500 mm above the soil by using a drill with a 2 0 mm drill bit and a jig to make three vertically aligned holes the distance from the heater to downstream and upstream temperature probes were 10 mm and 5 mm respectively at each site the sap flow probes were connected to a multiplexor and data logger am25t and cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut every 30 min heat was applied for 3 s and temperatures were measured every 1 5 s for 8 min 2 5 sap flow calculation heat pulse velocities were calculated using the compensation heat pulse method chpm green et al 2003 swanson and whitfield 1981 initially the heat pulse velocity v h cm h 1 was calculated from 2 v h ｘ d ｘ u 2 t z 3600 where x d was the distance from the heater to the downstream temperature probe and x u was the distance from the heater to the upstream temperature probe v h was corrected for probe induced effects and wounding using 3 v a 0 a 1 v h a 2 v h 2 where v cm h 1 is corrected heat pulse velocity v h cm h 1 is the uncorrected heat pulse velocity and a o a 1 and a 2 are correction factors green et al 2003 the sapwood consists of three phases gas liquid and solid matrix and sap flow velocity was calculated based on the equation of edwards and warwick 1984 as 4 j s k v wood v water v where j s is the velocity profile cm h 1 v wood refers to the volume fraction of the woody matrix in the xylem and v water is mean volume fraction of water and the k factor is related to the thermal capacity of the woody matrix here j s is calculated based on v wood 0 45 v water 0 45 green et al 2003 and k 0 505 edwards and warwick 1984 as the value is expected to be constant within and between species alarcon et al 2000 sap flux density in the trunk was not uniform therefore v h was measured and j s calculated for the three radial depths per probe cohen et al 1981 green et al 2003 total sap flow of each tree was calculated from the mean sap flux density as 5 f 2 π h r rj s r d r where f is the volume sap flux l h 1 r is a cambial radius m identified from the measurements of bark depths h is heartwood radius m and r is the radial depth in this experiment based on previous dye injection tests the full stem cross sectional area under bark was assumed to be hydro active sapwood with no heartwood because each tree had two probe sets tree water use l h 1 tree 1 was taken as the average of two measurements and daily tree water use was calculated t was calculated from tree water use obtained from sap flow measurements as 6 t s pa where t is tree transpiration mm d 1 s is daily tree water use l d 1 and pa is projected area of the canopy m2 all three orchards were considered mature therefore pa was assumed to be equivalent to the orchard area per plant estimated from plant spacing table 1 to examine the relationship between tree water use and fruit load light to heavy crop t was calculated for each tree 2 6 leaf area at each site the total leaf area of five experimental trees was estimated before and after shoot flush and pruning using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2200c li cor inc lincoln ne using a 90 view cap above and below canopy readings were obtained the measurements below canopy were taken around the trunk facing outward at a height of 1 m and at each tree the measurements were repeated on the north east south and west sides direct sunlight induces a probable error therefore the measurement was taken at either dawn or dusk the calculation of total leaf area was accomplished using the fv 2000 software li cor biosciences 2019 2 7 soil water content crop evapotranspiration et wb was obtained from the soil water balance the soil water content below the five sap flow trees was monitored using soil moisture probes cs615 cs616 and cs650 campbell scientific inc logan ut from 2017 to 2019 these probes were calibrated before installation using soil samples taken from the three orchards at the depths where the probes were buried calibration was based on moistening dry soil to a range of water contents packing the soil into a cylinder to the same bulk density as observed in the field and obtaining the linear relationship between the probe output and the known volumetric soil water content at each site the probes were installed vertically at the halfway point between the trunk and the edge of the canopy on the east side spanning three depth ranges 0 30 31 60 and 61 90 cm measurements were replicated underneath five trees rather than within the root zone of individual trees because variation between trees was considered to be the largest potential source of variation the probes were connected to a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut and soil water content was recorded every hour based on data obtained from volumetric soil moisture measurements et wb was calculated using the equation 7 et wb p i c d where et wb is crop water consumption p is precipitation i is irrigation c is the change in soil water content and d is drainage mm the et wb was calculated from changes in soil water content by selecting periods of 3 5 days without irrigation or significant rainfall p i 0 and after rapid changes in soil water content in the deepest soil layer had ceased the field capacity method eg maule and chanasyk 1987 niaghi and jia 2019 this method assumes that deep percolation ceases once field capacity has been reached in the deepest soil layer d 0 the soil water balance provided an alternative estimate of et that was independent of sap flow measurements and allowed estimation of soil evaporation see below but may over estimate evaporation because it was obtained during periods of fine weather the et wb was obtained for each month during the experiment 2 8 the basal crop coefficient kcb and crop coefficient kc monthly k cb values were calculated as 8 k cb t et o individual k cb values were compared with fruit yield each year and then compared across the three different regions based on the t values obtained from sap flow measurements and the et wb values obtained from soil water balance soil evaporation e was calculated as 9 e et wb t in this study e includes loss of water from the ground surface including soil evaporation and transpiration from grass then k c was calculated as 10 k c et c et o where et c is the sum of t and e the et c and k c values were calculated monthly during the experiment monthly mean et c and k c values were calculated from the average of two years of observations and for trees with the lowest and highest crop 2 9 harvest fruit of the experimental trees were harvested in september october each year at harvest fruit yield per experimental tree was obtained by total fruit weight and then 50 fruit samples were selected randomly and weighed to measure the average fruit size table 2 there was a failure of fruit set in the bay of plenty in 2019 resulting in no harvest for that year fruit yield in the far north in 2018 and 2019 was excluded because of a decline in tree health see discussion 2 10 shaded area a light bar was used to measure shaded area at each site at 10 00 12 00 and 14 00 in january 2019 the light bar was made using a 1 m length and 25 mm width of aluminium box section with 20 photodiodes g2711 01 hamamatsu photonics k k hamamatsu japan aligned on the bar the light bar was connected to a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut and installed on a trolley during the measurements data were recorded every second and output was summed from all 20 sensors to compare solar radiation between above and below canopy a pyranometer type sensor li200 li cor inc lincoln ne was installed in the open and connected to a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut with data recorded every second shaded area was calculated as the ratio of the light bar to above canopy measurements the area of one measurement was from the trunk to the middle of the inter row under three to five average sized trees moving the light bar at a velocity of approximately 0 3 m s 1 the measurement was taken within the area occupied by three trees 9 22 5 m in the bay of plenty three trees 7 21 m in whangarei and five trees 4 20 m in the far north and replicated three times in different rows in addition data for tree spacing crown diameter and k c for a young avocado orchard in the bay of plenty were obtained from kaneko 2016 for investigation of the relationship between shaded area and k c values 2 11 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using r r core team 2016 regression analysis was used to compare between t and total leaf area and between the k cb values and fruit yield or leaf area analysis of variance anova was used to compare the monthly k cb values between the three sites 3 results 3 1 weather monthly average meteorological data over three years from 2017 to 2019 were compared with the 30 year normal 1981 2010 figs 1 3 from the observations at the study sites the annual mean air temperatures were 15 5 c in the bay of plenty and whangarei and 16 4 c in the far north the bay of plenty and the far north had slightly higher annual air temperatures than the 30 year normal niwa 2020 whereas temperature at the whangarei was similar to the normal there was a tendency for increasing daily maximum temperatures from year to year in particular the summer of 2018 19 was warmer compared to the 30 year normal and february 2019 had the highest average daily maximum temperature for the recorded period of three years at 28 0 c in the bay of plenty 25 3 c in whangarei and 26 7 c in the far north rainfall was characterized by drier summers and wetter winters in all three years at all three sites figs 1 3 over the three years from 2017 to 2019 the annual total rainfalls were 1931 1951 and 1037 mm in the bay of plenty 1479 1708 and 826 mm in whangarei and 1112 1115 and 908 mm in the far north in the bay of plenty and whangarei the annual rainfall was above normal in 2017 and 2018 but below normal in 2019 in the wetter years excess precipitation tended to occur in late summer or winter and all three sites were well drained and therefore unaffected by high rainfall events the far north had fewer rainfall events compared to the other two regions over the three years but a prolonged dry period occurred each summer in all three regions in particular the summer of 2018 19 was far drier and rainfall events were scarce with a significant dry period from january to march 3 2 sap flow measurement daily tree water use was measured over two years in the bay of plenty fig 4a whangarei fig 4b and the far north fig 4c and compared with the seasonal trend of daily et o at the study sites overall there was a strong relationship between the daily tree water use and et o and this relationship changed seasonally regardless of the local weather conditions and different soil types avocado trees functioned with a similar seasonal cycle at all three sites although the absolute amount of water transpired depended on tree size in january when et o was highest at over 4 mm d 1 tree water use was also highest at approximately 150 l d 1 in the bay of plenty 120 l d 1 in whangarei and 70 l d 1 in the far north in june when et o was below 0 8 mm d 1 tree water use also decreased to 70 l d 1 in the bay of plenty 60 l d 1 in whangarei and 30 l d 1 in the far north however in relative terms the decline in tree water use from summer to winter was less than the decline in et o at all study sites a brief decline or plateau in tree water use was identified after all fruit were removed in september or october but tree water use increased again in late november to early december compared between years average tree water use in late summer was higher relative to et o in 2018 a high crop year compared to 2019 a low crop year in the bay of plenty and whangarei in the far north tree water use dropped dramatically after may 2018 in response to leaf abscission fig 4c due to a health issue all branches of the experimental trees were pruned in january 2019 3 3 leaf area over the experimental period average total leaf area per tree ranged from 200 to 320 m2 in the bay of plenty from 180 to 350 m2 in whangarei and 120 m2 in the far north fig 5a in the bay of plenty and whangarei the trees increased in canopy size each year as new shoots were developed however in the far north leaf area decreased after significant leaf abscission started in may 2018 the relationship between total leaf area and tree water use in january 2018 was analysed fig 5b comparing across the three sites at a single point in time water use per tree in mid summer was strongly related to total leaf area p 0 05 leaf area was related to tree size in general tree size and leaf area per tree increased from the orchard with the closest tree spacing far north to the orchard with the largest tree spacing bay of plenty fig 5b 3 4 soil water content volumetric soil water content was monitored throughout the experimental period in the bay of plenty fig 6a whangarei fig 6b and the far north fig 6c the soils of these three sites had different water holding capacities whangarei had higher mean soil water content due to the high clay content of the soil while the far north had lower mean soil water content due to the higher sand content based on soil moisture monitoring the volumetric soil water content of the top layer increased to 0 45 m3 m 3 in the bay of plenty 0 50 m3 m 3 in whangarei and 0 28 m3 m 3 in the far north within a few days after rainfall and decreased by approximately 0 01 m3 m 3 each day in mid summer at all sites the allophanic soil of the bay of plenty also had a high soil water content at saturation but drained more readily than a clay soil and had a steeper gradient in water content with depth than the other two sites at all study sites soil water content was highest in winter and tended to decline in summer during periods of low rainfall and higher evaporation there was significantly less rainfall in the mid summer 2018 19 at all three sites with decreasing soil water content even though irrigation was applied 3 5 the basal crop coefficient kcb mean monthly et o t and e for avocado were calculated from october flowering to september harvest fig 7a b c at all three study sites t was highest in january at 2 4 mm d 1 when et o was highest and lowest at 1 mm d 1 in june and july when et o was lowest the mean monthly k cb was calculated based on et o and t at each site fig 7d all three sites had the lowest k cb in november at 0 45 and the highest k cb in june at 1 45 p 0 05 anova 3 6 effects of total leaf area and fruit yield total leaf area and fruit yield for each tree were compared with k cb for the preceding january the middle of the irrigation period for three years of observation in the bay of plenty fig 8a d and whangarei fig 8b e and two years in the far north fig 8c f when data were combined across years k cb estimated for individual trees was significantly positively related to fruit yield from the tree at all three sites but was only significantly related to leaf area per tree in the bay of plenty in years that individual trees had higher fruit loads they had higher k cb values p 0 05 3 7 shaded area the overall relationship between k cb and orchard shaded area for the mature orchards in the present study the bay of plenty whangarei the far north and the young orchard 3 years kaneko 2016 is summarized in fig 9 based on crown dimensions and plant spacing the canopy cover of the three mature orchards was high with 83 93 and 77 of the ground surface shaded by the canopy in the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north respectively regardless of the percentage of the shaded area these three sites had similar k cb values around 0 6 in mid summer the young orchard had a lower shaded area and a correspondingly lower k cb 3 8 crop coefficients in new zealand daily water usage of the avocado plant was summarized by month for the bay of plenty table 3 whangarei table 4 and the far north table 5 the average et o values range from 0 7 to 0 8 mm d 1 in june to 3 8 4 3 mm d 1 in january and the average of et c values for the avocado tree range from 1 2 to 1 4 mm d 1 in june to 2 7 2 8 mm d 1 in january the monthly average k c values ranged from 0 6 to 0 65 in october november to 1 5 1 75 in june 4 discussion this research provided new insight into tree water use of hass avocado in the three main avocado growing regions of new zealand there was a strong and seasonally variable relationship between et o and t but the three study sites had similar t and k cb values even though soil water holding capacity differed among the regions the results demonstrate that avocado tree water use was more strongly influenced by fruit load than other site factors with heavier cropping trees using more water this finding is significant because avocado yields are typically highly variable particularly under the temperate growing conditions prevailing in new zealand 4 1 avocado tree water use sap flow measurement was used to estimate avocado tree water use and the results clearly corresponded with weather conditions daily observations of t correlated well with daily et o values with seasonal changes in the relationship regardless of different local weather conditions and soil types the overall seasonal patterns of avocado tree water use were similar at all three sites however there were significant differences between years and regions that can be explained by interactions between climate fruit load and tree health in the first full summer of measurement 2017 18 water use was highest at all sites through mid summer from december to march and remained high or even increased as reference et o began to decrease in march fig 4 in this year all three orchards were carrying a significant crop and tree health was good in the second full summer of measurement 2018 19 the three orchards diverged markedly in behaviour in the bay of plenty orchard a complete failure of fruit set may have contributed to an earlier reduction in water use in february fig 4 around the time that maximum fruit growth normally occurs in whangarei the experimental trees produced a similar yield of fruit in both years but water use also began to decline earlier than in the previous summer however in 2019 there was also a significant decline in soil water content from mid january to march in both the bay of plenty and whangarei orchards caused by prolonged dry conditions and suggesting that the amount of irrigation water applied may not have matched tree demand january 2019 was the second warmest january in whangarei on record since 1967 niwa 2019 depletion of soil moisture on the shallower clay soils in whangarei may have contributed to earlier late summer reductions in tree water use in that year compared to the orchards in the other two regions the far north orchard had a similar seasonal pattern of water use in the 2017 18 year but lower water use on a per plant basis because the trees were more closely spaced and tree size was smaller fig 4 however in the far north orchard tree water use declined rather than increased as expected over the following summer with the reduction in water use corresponding with the appearance of visual symptoms of root disease these included branch dieback leaf abscission and necrotic shoot tips suggesting infection by phytophthora cinnamomi a common cause of disease in new zealand avocado orchards dann et al 2013 zentmyer 1984 phytophthora infection restricts water transport from soil to leaf within avocado plants sterne et al 1978 and therefore all measurements ceased in this orchard the similarities and differences between the three regional orchards over a period of three years illustrates several important aspects of avocado tree water use strongly alternate or irregular bearing is a major challenge for avocado production worldwide and is particularly acute in new zealand where the fruit may be retained on the tree for longer than 12 months resulting in competition between fruit and flower development for the following season gould et al 2019 in the present study fruit load varied from no fruit to high among individual study trees within the same season from year to year and among orchards fig 8 avocado trees are also considered sensitive to relatively mild water stress and exhibit isohydric stomatal behaviour kaneko 2021 resulting in limitations to transpiration and carbon assimilation if water deficits occur and further contributing to complex interactions between fruit size yield and water requirements finally avocado rootstocks are vulnerable to water and soil borne pathogens and other forms of tree decline that are often associated with variation in soil type drainage and over or under irrigation lahav et al 2013 however despite these many potential sources of variation in tree behaviour an important finding of this study is that when trees were in good health avocado water use was a simple and consistent function of leaf area and crop load irrespective of climate and soil type 4 2 tree water use and leaf area in general plant transpiration is directly related to tree size and total leaf area goodwin et al 2006 the results confirmed that the avocado trees in the bay of plenty had the highest water use per tree while the trees in the far north had the lowest because of differences in tree size fig 5 however tree size was less variable within each orchard and when water use was normalized for differences in tree size and spacing between orchards by expression as a crop coefficient variation in water use within orchards and among seasons was more related to variation in fruit load than leaf area per tree fig 8 despite the importance of leaf area at the individual tree level water use was surprisingly insensitive to pruning operations pruning did not always result in a clear reduction in transpiration fig 4 even though pruning of the large avocado trees included in this study can involve the removal of approximately 25 of the total leaf area tree water use depends on the net solar radiation absorbed by the leaves green 1993 johnson et al 2000 maddonni et al 2001 pruning decreases self shading within the tree and redistributes light onto previously shaded areas of the canopy a sudden reduction in canopy size also usually enhances new vegetative growth resulting in higher water use for photosynthesis and new shoot development heilman et al 1996 overall leaf area is a significant determinant of avocado tree water use but can be accounted for by measures of tree spacing and size and percent shaded area of the orchard floor see below 4 3 tree water use and fruit load fruit load was an important determinant of tree water use positive relationships between fruit yield and tree water use in january were evident at all three sites both when data for all three seasons were combined and among trees within individual seasons fig 8 silber et al 2013a found that fruiting avocado trees grown in lysimeters had 60 higher daily water use compared to non fruiting trees the present study documents a similar effect in large trees across a continuous range of fruit loads and at multiple sites fruit are a strong sink for carbohydrate therefore the presence of fruit on a tree can strongly influence source sink carbon relationships and stomatal behaviour sade and moshelion 2014 studies of peach ayars et al 2003 johnson et al 2002 olive bustan et al 2016 apple wibbe and blanke 1995 and pear marsal et al 2014 have also reported a sharp decline in daily tree water use after de fruiting the decline in tree water use after fruit removal is likely to be the result of a sudden decrease in sink demand and consequently a reduction in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance bustan et al 2016 silber et al 2013a however this decline is usually only temporary because fruit growth inhibits vegetative growth and fruit removal enhances new growth lavee 2006 silber et al 2013a tree water use also decreased after fruit were removed in the present study but recovered within a month of harvest fig 4 in the case of avocado under new zealand conditions the fruit requires 10 months or longer from flowering to maturity at the study sites flowering started in early october and fruit were picked in september and october soon after harvest there is a high water demand for flowering fruitlet and shoot growth at the same time that reference et o is increasing with the onset of summer 4 4 crop coefficients for avocado crop coefficients were derived for the three study regions for healthy fruiting trees on a monthly basis and with a range of values that account for the effect of fruit load on water use fig 7 tables 3 5 the gradual increase in k c observed at all sites from the beginning of the growing season may be related to effects of flowering and fruiting on stomatal behaviour with tree water use decreasing more slowly than the reference as fruit development progressed k c for avocado increased above 1 in the late autumn and winter from april to august indicating that crop water use is higher than the reference during this period there is little information regarding k c for evergreen fruit tree species during the non irrigated season except for citrus peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 and olive villalobos et al 2000 that also show an increase in k c during winter when et o decreases avocado requires high energy in autumn and winter for oil accumulation in fruit and floral development salazar garcia et al 2013 and may therefore consume a significant amount of water for photosynthetic activity throughout the year comparison soil water balance estimates of et with sap flow measurements of t confirmed that evaporation from the soil and ground cover was a minor component of the water balance of the mature orchards used in this study the soil water balance estimate of evaporation was an approximation because it was based on assuming when drainage was not occurring but it indicates that evaporation was always less than 10 of total et from the orchard these three study sites had similar ground cover conditions with grass in the inter rows that was regularly mowed and a large proportion of the ground area covered by leaf litter and shaded by the canopy water loss from the ground surface depends on atmospheric demand shaded area the type of ground cover and the frequency of rainfall and irrigation compared to litter bare soil and active natural vegetation increase water loss from the soil allen and pereira 2009 shrestha and shukla 2014 also a shorter irrigation interval can increase soil evaporation as the rate of soil evaporation is relatively high after wetting the soil benli et al 2006 the crop coefficients derived in this study were consistent across sites because all three study orchards were mature with fully developed canopies and at least 77 shaded area however in other orchard crops k c is linearly correlated with the proportion of the area occupied by canopy as the trees grow in these crops the effect of canopy development is usually quantified as the relative shaded area johnson et al 2000 williams and ayars 2005 however water consumption typically plateaus and does not increase further after the individual tree crowns meet mcclymont et al 2009 williams and ayars 2005 this generally happens when shaded area reaches 80 or higher sammis et al 2004 wang et al 2007 at this point the leaf area exposed to direct sunlight reaches a maximum and the canopy becomes restricted in growth williams and ayars 2005 the relationship between k cb and shaded area for less mature avocado orchards in new zealand is proposed based on the addition of a single measurement of k cb from a younger orchard with a lower shaded area fig 9 whilst further estimates of k cb from orchards with a range of planting densities and tree sizes would be appropriate this preliminary relationship can be used to adjust k cb from young to mature orchards consideration should also be given to the effects of shaded area on soil and ground cover evaporation with increased losses expected from bare soil or ground cover vegetation in younger orchards this study found that avocado tree water use was similar in the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north orchards regardless of their different soil types soil type did not directly affect et c however the soils of these three regions have different soil water holding capacities that will influence the probability of water stress and that require different irrigation strategies irrigation should be applied when there is low rainfall from november to march and irrigation intervals should be 5 6 days in the bay of plenty 7 8 days in whangarei and 3 4 days in the far north examination of the soil moisture measurements over the summer period indicate that irrigation was needed for avocado when volumetric soil water content of the top layer decreased below 0 40 m3 m 3 in the bay of plenty allophanic soil 0 45 m3 m 3 in the whangarei clay soil and 0 25 m3 m 3 in the far north sandy soil 5 conclusions this research quantified hass avocado water use in the three avocado growing regions of new zealand relative to weather conditions soil type canopy size and fruit load and estimated k c values as a basis for irrigation within each region avocado tree water use was similar at all three sites with a range from 2 7 mm d 1 in mid summer to 1 2 1 4 mm d 1 in winter water use at an orchard scale was not strongly influenced by regional differences in climate and soil type however there was a strong effect of fruit load on tree water use in healthy trees leaf area per tree was less important for determining water use on an orchard area basis and it is proposed that the effects of variation in tree size between orchards of different age on water use can be accounted for by estimating the relative shaded area of the orchard the average k c in mid summer was 0 60 0 65 but increased by approximately 20 for heavy crop trees that variation in k c depends on their fruit load is important for avocado given high tree to tree variation in fruit load within a single year and the susceptibility of avocado to irregular cropping between years funding

new zealand plant food research ltd hawke s bay research centre p bag1401 havelock north 4157 new zealand handling editor j e fernández hass avocado tree water use was quantified within orchards located in the three main avocado growing regions of new zealand from 2016 to 2019 the three regions the bay of plenty the whangarei district and the aupouri peninsula in the far north district differ in climate and soil type allophanic clay and sandy soils respectively at each site local meteorological conditions were monitored avocado tree water use was quantified using heat pulse sap flow measurement total leaf area was obtained periodically fruit load was recorded at harvest and shaded area was measured in mid summer reference evapotranspiration et o calculated by the fao 56 penman montieth equation was highest in january at 3 8 mm whangarei to 4 3 mm bay of plenty and lowest in june at 0 7 mm bay of plenty to 0 8 mm whangarei and far north the three sites had similar patterns of tree water use relative to et o regardless of the differences in soil type and tree water use was highest in january at 2 7 mm d 1 and lowest in june at 1 2 1 4 mm d 1 across the three sites individual tree water use was related to variation in tree spacing and leaf area per tree but on an orchard area basis was influenced more by fruit load resulting in variation in estimated crop coefficients k c among individual trees and seasons at all sites average monthly k c was similar across all sites with a value of 0 60 0 65 in mid summer as all three orchards were considered mature with fully grown canopies and 75 orchard shaded area however tree water use also increased from light to heavy fruit load therefore when irrigation is applied to avocado k c values should be adjusted for variation in fruit load with a range from 0 50 to 0 85 in mid summer keywords evapotranspiration transpiration irrigation crop factor fruit yield new zealand nomenclature e soil evaporation et c crop evapotranspiration e t et o reference evapotranspiration et wb crop evapotranspiration calculated from soil water balance method k c crop coefficient k cb basal crop coefficient t plant transpiration 1 introduction planting of horticultural crops across the world is increasing putting pressure on the amount of water available for crop production this is true for the new zealand avocado industry where orchard area has increased over the past 20 years current 2021 plantings are approximately 4000 ha and this is projected to increase to around 10 000 ha by 2041 to improve fruit production avocado trees should be irrigated if there is a prolonged dry period during fruit development carr 2013 pleguezuelo et al 2018 however developing an irrigation strategy for a novel crop requires research that incorporates the effects of climate soils and crop management plant water use is influenced by weather conditions such as air temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed allen et al 1998a alves et al 2007 the k c et o approach the fao56 method may be the simplest method to calculate plant water use if weather data are available the crop coefficient k c is defined as the ratio of crop evapotranspiration et c to reference evapotranspiration et o allen 1986 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 wright 1982 et o can be calculated from weather data using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998a 2006 thus from a known k c for a specific crop and measurements of local weather conditions et c can be estimated however compared to herbaceous crops the k c values of fruiting trees can be variable and dependent on a number of plant physiological variables such as leaf area tree density pruning operations fruit load and ground cover juhasz et al 2013 avocado in particular has unique characteristics compared to other tree crops including a very long fruit development period and a strong tendency towards alternate or variable bearing that creates variation in fruit yield between on and off cropping years lovatt 2010 to account for this variation and understand the water use of fruiting trees independently of evaporation from other surfaces et c can be divided into two components plant transpiration t and water loss from the ground surface or ground cover crop e allen et al 1998b wright 1982 in this case the basal crop coefficient k cb is determined as the ratio of t to et o whereas k c is defined as a ratio of et c to et o and et c is the sum of t and e flumignan et al 2011 goodwin et al 2006 paco et al 2006 the k cb values represent plant water use itself regardless of soil evaporation and transpiration from ground cover such as grass for accurate estimation of the k cb values t can be obtained by sap flow measurement that involves the installation of needle like probes in the main trunk of woody species green et al 2003 sap flow measurement with the compensation heat pulse method chpm has been widely used to quantify the water use of tree crops such as lemon alarcon et al 2005 apricot nicolas et al 2005 olive fernandez et al 2001 almond nortes et al 2009 orange fernandez et al 2006 and avocado kaneko 2016 in contrast k c values include both plant water use and the water loss from the soil and soil evaporation can be influenced by the type of ground cover and the proportion of ground area shaded by the crop allen and pereira 2009 both t and e are required for calculation of k c et c et o e can be obtained from the difference between t and crop evapotranspiration calculated from the soil water balance method et wb estimation of et wb is based on continuous soil moisture measurements knowledge of drainage and surface flows and the concept of water fluxes from the soil to plant to atmosphere or from the soil to atmosphere as a continuum bonan et al 2014 avocado is a large evergreen tree that can grow over 10 15 m in height chanderbali et al 2013 for large trees t and e are strongly influenced by tree size leaf area and planting density due to solar energy partitioning wang et al 2007 when trees are young there is generally a linear relationship between the k c values of an orchard and the area of soil surface shaded by the tree canopy as has been observed in peach johnson et al 2002 and pecan trees winer 2007 however this linear relationship usually reaches a plateau or maximum k c when the proportion of area shaded reaches a threshold value typically around 0 8 as the tree canopy develops andales et al 2006 thus adjustment of k c may be needed for avocado to account for tree spacing and age crown size leaf area and consequent variation in shaded area in new zealand avocado is grown in the warmer regions of the north island namely the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north thorp et al 1997 and these areas have different characteristic soil types allophanic clay and sandy soils respectively hewitt 2010 soil properties influence both plant performance and the way irrigation should be managed allophanic soil in the bay of plenty has a high water holding capacity and lower soil bulk density that offers less resistance to root growth environment bay of plenty 2010 compared to allophanic soil clay soils in whangarei consist of smaller particles less pore spaces and are poorly drained therefore a longer irrigation interval may be adequate in contrast sandy soil in the far north has larger particles and poor water retention properties and requires a shorter irrigation interval molloy 1988 in new zealand avocado trees are generally irrigated in spring and summer during the periods of the early fruit growth and intensive shoot growth however avocado tree water requirements under variable new zealand soil conditions have not been quantified in addition for fruiting trees fruit load also has an important role many studies have reported that plant water use increases from light to heavy fruit load for example in apple naor et al 2008 olive gucci et al 2007 peach berman and dejong 1996 grapevine naor et al 1997 and avocado silber et al 2013b there is some literature carr 2013 du plessis 1991 kaneko 2016 lahav et al 2013 that provides k c for avocado orchards as a basic irrigation guideline however plants behave differently from place to place and these k c values were determined without consideration of fruit load the effect of fruit load may be particularly important for avocado because of the strong tendency for variable bearing especially under new zealand conditions gould et al 2019 the aim of this research was to measure et o t and e for mature hass avocado trees in the three avocado growing regions of the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north et o was calculated from local meteorological data with the fao 56 penman monteith equation t was obtained from sap flow measurement and e was determined from the difference between sap flow measurement and the soil water balance based on the et o t and e values k c values for avocado were determined to provide reliable k c values this study examines variation in avocado tree water use associated with the combination of the weather conditions soil type and fruit load 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and the experiment this research was conducted at orchards in three avocado growing regions here referred to as the bay of plenty 37 39 17 964 s 176 1 12 936 e whangarei 35 46 41 376 e 174 7 56 9712 e and the far north 34 48 54 s 173 7 4 8 e the mean annual air temperatures were 14 9 15 8 and 15 7 c and the normal annual total rainfall was 1190 1300 and 1250 mm in the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north respectively niwa 2020 soil types were sandy loam typic orthic allophanic soil in the bay of plenty whatitiri clay loam typic oxidic granular soil in whangarei and houhora sand typic sandy brown soil in the far north hewitt 2010 the experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 in the far north the experimental trees began to show symptoms of disease from july 2018 all branches were pruned at this site in january 2019 and all sensors were removed in april 2019 2 2 plant materials and orchard management at each site five mature trees of persea americana hass avocado grafted on zutano seedling rootstock were selected basic tree information is presented in table 1 experimental trees were considered well irrigated with one micro sprinkler per tree positioned under the canopy between 1 and 3 m above the ground a portable soil water measurement system hydrosense campbell scientific logan ut was used to check for even spread of water from the micro sprinklers up to the canopy drip line the amount of water applied at each irrigation was 600 l in the bay of plenty and whangarei and 210 l in the far north equivalent to 8 12 mm and 6 6 mm based on tree spacing table 1 respectively irrigation intervals were 6 8 days 8 12 days and 3 4 days respectively with irrigation decisions made by the individual growers based on measurements of soil moisture content within the orchards the ground was covered by leaf litter under the tree canopy and the grass between rows was mowed periodically by the growers 2 3 weather

2020 2 4 sap flow plant transpiration t was obtained from sap flow measurements two sap flow probe sets model hp3tc s tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north new zealand per tree were installed at each site with measurements recorded from 2017 to 2019 each sap flow probe set was composed of two temperature probes and one heater and the temperature probes had three copper constantan thermocouples positioned at depths of 15 25 and 40 mm from the bark the heater probe was 1 8 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length the probes were installed on the main trunk around 500 mm above the soil by using a drill with a 2 0 mm drill bit and a jig to make three vertically aligned holes the distance from the heater to downstream and upstream temperature probes were 10 mm and 5 mm respectively at each site the sap flow probes were connected to a multiplexor and data logger am25t and cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut every 30 min heat was applied for 3 s and temperatures were measured every 1 5 s for 8 min 2 5 sap flow calculation heat pulse velocities were calculated using the compensation heat pulse method chpm green et al 2003 swanson and whitfield 1981 initially the heat pulse velocity v h cm h 1 was calculated from 2 v h ｘ d ｘ u 2 t z 3600 where x d was the distance from the heater to the downstream temperature probe and x u was the distance from the heater to the upstream temperature probe v h was corrected for probe induced effects and wounding using 3 v a 0 a 1 v h a 2 v h 2 where v cm h 1 is corrected heat pulse velocity v h cm h 1 is the uncorrected heat pulse velocity and a o a 1 and a 2 are correction factors green et al 2003 the sapwood consists of three phases gas liquid and solid matrix and sap flow velocity was calculated based on the equation of edwards and warwick 1984 as 4 j s k v wood v water v where j s is the velocity profile cm h 1 v wood refers to the volume fraction of the woody matrix in the xylem and v water is mean volume fraction of water and the k factor is related to the thermal capacity of the woody matrix here j s is calculated based on v wood 0 45 v water 0 45 green et al 2003 and k 0 505 edwards and warwick 1984 as the value is expected to be constant within and between species alarcon et al 2000 sap flux density in the trunk was not uniform therefore v h was measured and j s calculated for the three radial depths per probe cohen et al 1981 green et al 2003 total sap flow of each tree was calculated from the mean sap flux density as 5 f 2 π h r rj s r d r where f is the volume sap flux l h 1 r is a cambial radius m identified from the measurements of bark depths h is heartwood radius m and r is the radial depth in this experiment based on previous dye injection tests the full stem cross sectional area under bark was assumed to be hydro active sapwood with no heartwood because each tree had two probe sets tree water use l h 1 tree 1 was taken as the average of two measurements and daily tree water use was calculated t was calculated from tree water use obtained from sap flow measurements as 6 t s pa where t is tree transpiration mm d 1 s is daily tree water use l d 1 and pa is projected area of the canopy m2 all three orchards were considered mature therefore pa was assumed to be equivalent to the orchard area per plant estimated from plant spacing table 1 to examine the relationship between tree water use and fruit load light to heavy crop t was calculated for each tree 2 6 leaf area at each site the total leaf area of five experimental trees was estimated before and after shoot flush and pruning using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2200c li cor inc lincoln ne using a 90 view cap above and below canopy readings were obtained the measurements below canopy were taken around the trunk facing outward at a height of 1 m and at each tree the measurements were repeated on the north east south and west sides direct sunlight induces a probable error therefore the measurement was taken at either dawn or dusk the calculation of total leaf area was accomplished using the fv 2000 software li cor biosciences 2019 2 7 soil water content crop evapotranspiration et wb was obtained from the soil water balance the soil water content below the five sap flow trees was monitored using soil moisture probes cs615 cs616 and cs650 campbell scientific inc logan ut from 2017 to 2019 these probes were calibrated before installation using soil samples taken from the three orchards at the depths where the probes were buried calibration was based on moistening dry soil to a range of water contents packing the soil into a cylinder to the same bulk density as observed in the field and obtaining the linear relationship between the probe output and the known volumetric soil water content at each site the probes were installed vertically at the halfway point between the trunk and the edge of the canopy on the east side spanning three depth ranges 0 30 31 60 and 61 90 cm measurements were replicated underneath five trees rather than within the root zone of individual trees because variation between trees was considered to be the largest potential source of variation the probes were connected to a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut and soil water content was recorded every hour based on data obtained from volumetric soil moisture measurements et wb was calculated using the equation 7 et wb p i c d where et wb is crop water consumption p is precipitation i is irrigation c is the change in soil water content and d is drainage mm the et wb was calculated from changes in soil water content by selecting periods of 3 5 days without irrigation or significant rainfall p i 0 and after rapid changes in soil water content in the deepest soil layer had ceased the field capacity method eg maule and chanasyk 1987 niaghi and jia 2019 this method assumes that deep percolation ceases once field capacity has been reached in the deepest soil layer d 0 the soil water balance provided an alternative estimate of et that was independent of sap flow measurements and allowed estimation of soil evaporation see below but may over estimate evaporation because it was obtained during periods of fine weather the et wb was obtained for each month during the experiment 2 8 the basal crop coefficient kcb and crop coefficient kc monthly k cb values were calculated as 8 k cb t et o individual k cb values were compared with fruit yield each year and then compared across the three different regions based on the t values obtained from sap flow measurements and the et wb values obtained from soil water balance soil evaporation e was calculated as 9 e et wb t in this study e includes loss of water from the ground surface including soil evaporation and transpiration from grass then k c was calculated as 10 k c et c et o where et c is the sum of t and e the et c and k c values were calculated monthly during the experiment monthly mean et c and k c values were calculated from the average of two years of observations and for trees with the lowest and highest crop 2 9 harvest fruit of the experimental trees were harvested in september october each year at harvest fruit yield per experimental tree was obtained by total fruit weight and then 50 fruit samples were selected randomly and weighed to measure the average fruit size table 2 there was a failure of fruit set in the bay of plenty in 2019 resulting in no harvest for that year fruit yield in the far north in 2018 and 2019 was excluded because of a decline in tree health see discussion 2 10 shaded area a light bar was used to measure shaded area at each site at 10 00 12 00 and 14 00 in january 2019 the light bar was made using a 1 m length and 25 mm width of aluminium box section with 20 photodiodes g2711 01 hamamatsu photonics k k hamamatsu japan aligned on the bar the light bar was connected to a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut and installed on a trolley during the measurements data were recorded every second and output was summed from all 20 sensors to compare solar radiation between above and below canopy a pyranometer type sensor li200 li cor inc lincoln ne was installed in the open and connected to a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut with data recorded every second shaded area was calculated as the ratio of the light bar to above canopy measurements the area of one measurement was from the trunk to the middle of the inter row under three to five average sized trees moving the light bar at a velocity of approximately 0 3 m s 1 the measurement was taken within the area occupied by three trees 9 22 5 m in the bay of plenty three trees 7 21 m in whangarei and five trees 4 20 m in the far north and replicated three times in different rows in addition data for tree spacing crown diameter and k c for a young avocado orchard in the bay of plenty were obtained from kaneko 2016 for investigation of the relationship between shaded area and k c values 2 11 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using r r core team 2016 regression analysis was used to compare between t and total leaf area and between the k cb values and fruit yield or leaf area analysis of variance anova was used to compare the monthly k cb values between the three sites 3 results 3 1 weather monthly average meteorological data over three years from 2017 to 2019 were compared with the 30 year normal 1981 2010 figs 1 3 from the observations at the study sites the annual mean air temperatures were 15 5 c in the bay of plenty and whangarei and 16 4

daily maximum temperature for the recorded period of three years at 28 0 c in the bay of plenty 25 3 c in whangarei and 26 7 c in the far north rainfall was characterized by drier summers and wetter winters in all three years at all three sites figs 1 3 over the three years from 2017 to 2019 the annual total rainfalls were 1931 1951 and 1037 mm in the bay of plenty 1479 1708 and 826 mm in whangarei and 1112 1115 and 908 mm in the far north in the bay of plenty and whangarei the annual rainfall was above normal in 2017 and 2018 but below normal in 2019 in the wetter years excess precipitation tended to occur in late summer or winter and all three sites were well drained and therefore unaffected by high rainfall events the far north had fewer rainfall events compared to the other two regions over the three years but a prolonged dry period occurred each summer in all three regions in particular the summer of 2018 19 was far drier and rainfall events were scarce with a significant dry period from january to march 3 2 sap flow measurement daily tree water use was measured over two years in the bay of plenty fig 4a whangarei fig 4b and the far north fig 4c and compared with the seasonal trend of daily et o at the study sites overall there was a strong relationship between the daily tree water use and et o and this relationship changed seasonally regardless of the local weather conditions and different soil types avocado trees functioned with a similar seasonal cycle at all three sites although the absolute amount of water transpired depended on tree size in january when et o was highest at over 4 mm d 1 tree water use was also highest at approximately 150 l d 1 in the bay of plenty 120 l d 1 in whangarei and 70 l d 1 in the far north in june when et o was below 0 8 mm d 1 tree water use also decreased to 70 l d 1 in the bay of plenty 60 l d 1 in whangarei and 30 l d 1 in the far north however in relative terms the decline in tree water use from summer to winter was less than the decline in et o at all study sites a brief decline or plateau in tree water use was identified after all fruit were removed in september or october but tree water use increased again in late november to early december compared between years average tree water use in late summer was higher relative to et o in 2018 a high crop year compared to 2019 a low crop year in the bay of plenty and whangarei in the far north tree water use dropped dramatically after may 2018 in response to leaf abscission fig 4c due to a health issue all branches of the experimental trees were pruned in january 2019 3 3 leaf area over the experimental period average total leaf area per tree ranged from 200 to 320 m2 in the bay of plenty from 180 to 350 m2 in whangarei and 120 m2 in the far north fig 5a in the bay of plenty and whangarei the trees increased in canopy size each year as new shoots were developed however in the far north leaf area decreased after significant leaf abscission started in may 2018 the relationship between total leaf area and tree water use in january 2018 was analysed fig 5b comparing across the three sites at a single point in time water use per tree in mid summer was strongly related to total leaf area p 0 05 leaf area was related to tree size in general tree size and leaf area per tree increased from the orchard with the closest tree spacing far north to the orchard with the largest tree spacing bay of plenty fig 5b 3 4 soil water content volumetric soil water content was monitored throughout the experimental period in the bay of plenty fig 6a whangarei fig 6b and the far north fig 6c the soils of these three sites had different water holding capacities whangarei had higher mean soil water content due to the high clay content of the soil while the far north had lower mean soil water content due to the higher sand content based on soil moisture monitoring the volumetric soil water content of the top layer increased to 0 45 m3 m 3 in the bay of plenty 0 50 m3 m 3 in whangarei and 0 28 m3 m 3 in the far north within a few days after rainfall and decreased by approximately 0 01 m3 m 3 each day in mid summer at all sites the allophanic soil of the bay of plenty also had a high soil water content at saturation but drained more readily than a clay soil and had a steeper gradient in water content with depth than the other two sites at all study sites soil water content was highest in winter and tended to decline in summer during periods of low rainfall and higher evaporation there was significantly less rainfall in the mid summer 2018 19 at all three sites with decreasing soil water content even though irrigation was applied 3 5 the basal crop coefficient kcb mean monthly et o t and e for avocado were calculated from october flowering to september harvest fig 7a b c at all three study sites t was highest in january at 2 4 mm d 1 when et o was highest and lowest at 1 mm d 1 in june and july when et o was lowest the mean monthly k cb was calculated based on et o and t at each site fig 7d all three sites had the lowest k cb in november at 0 45 and the highest k cb in june at 1 45 p 0 05 anova 3 6 effects of total leaf area and fruit yield total leaf area and fruit yield for each tree were compared with k cb for the preceding january the middle of the irrigation period for three years of observation in the bay of plenty fig 8a d and whangarei fig 8b e and two years in the far north fig 8c f when data were combined across years k cb estimated for individual trees was significantly positively related to fruit yield from the tree at all three sites but was only significantly related to leaf area per tree in the bay of plenty in years that individual trees had higher fruit loads they had higher k cb values p 0 05 3 7 shaded area the overall relationship between k cb and orchard shaded area for the mature orchards in the present study the bay of plenty whangarei the far north and the young orchard 3 years kaneko 2016 is summarized in fig 9 based on crown dimensions and plant spacing the canopy cover of the three mature orchards was high with 83 93 and 77 of the ground surface shaded by the canopy in the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north respectively regardless of the percentage of the shaded area these three sites had similar k cb values around 0 6 in mid summer the young orchard had a lower shaded area and a correspondingly lower k cb 3 8 crop coefficients in new zealand daily water usage of the avocado plant was summarized by month for the bay of plenty table 3 whangarei table 4 and the far north table 5 the average et o values range from 0 7 to 0 8 mm d 1 in june to 3 8 4 3 mm d 1 in january and the average of et c values for the avocado tree range from 1 2 to 1 4 mm d 1 in june to 2 7 2 8 mm d 1 in january the monthly average k c values ranged from 0 6 to 0 65 in october november to 1 5 1 75 in june 4 discussion this research provided new insight into tree water use of hass avocado in the three main avocado growing regions of new zealand there was a strong and seasonally variable relationship between et o and t but the three study sites had similar t and k cb values even though soil water holding capacity differed among the regions the results demonstrate that avocado tree water use was more strongly influenced by fruit load than other site factors with heavier cropping trees using more water this finding is significant because avocado yields are typically highly variable particularly under the temperate growing conditions prevailing in new zealand 4 1 avocado tree water use sap flow measurement was used to estimate avocado tree water use and the results clearly corresponded with weather conditions daily observations of t correlated well with daily et o values with seasonal changes in the relationship regardless of different local weather conditions and soil types the overall seasonal patterns of avocado tree water use were similar at all three sites however there were significant differences between years and regions that can be explained by interactions between climate fruit load and tree health in the first full summer of measurement 2017 18 water use was highest at all sites through mid summer from december to march and remained high or even increased as reference et o began to decrease in march fig 4 in this year all three orchards were carrying a significant crop and tree health was good in the second full summer of measurement 2018 19 the three orchards diverged markedly in behaviour in the bay of plenty orchard a complete failure of fruit set may have contributed to an earlier reduction in water use in february fig 4 around the time that maximum fruit growth normally occurs in whangarei the experimental trees produced a similar yield of fruit in both years but water use also began to decline earlier than in the previous summer however in 2019 there was also a significant decline in soil water content from mid january to march in both the bay of plenty and whangarei orchards caused by prolonged dry conditions and suggesting that the amount of irrigation water applied may not have matched tree demand january 2019 was the second warmest january in whangarei on record since 1967 niwa 2019 depletion of soil moisture on the shallower clay soils in whangarei may have contributed to earlier late summer reductions in tree water use in that year compared to the orchards in the other two regions the far north orchard had a similar seasonal pattern of water use in the 2017 18 year but lower water use on a per plant basis because the trees were more closely spaced and tree size was smaller fig 4 however in the far north orchard tree water use declined rather than increased as expected over the following summer with the reduction in water use corresponding with the appearance of visual symptoms of root disease these included branch dieback leaf abscission and necrotic shoot tips suggesting infection by phytophthora cinnamomi a common cause of disease in new zealand avocado orchards dann et al 2013 zentmyer 1984 phytophthora infection restricts water transport from soil to leaf within avocado plants sterne et al 1978 and therefore all measurements ceased in this orchard the similarities and differences between the three regional orchards over a period of three years illustrates several important aspects of avocado tree water use strongly alternate or irregular bearing is a major challenge for avocado production worldwide and is particularly acute in new zealand where the fruit may be retained on the tree for longer than 12 months resulting in competition between fruit and flower development for the following season gould et al 2019 in the present study fruit load varied from no fruit to high among individual study trees within the same season from year to year and among orchards fig 8 avocado trees are also considered sensitive to relatively mild water stress and exhibit isohydric stomatal behaviour kaneko 2021 resulting in limitations to transpiration and carbon assimilation if water deficits occur and further contributing to complex interactions between fruit size yield and water requirements finally avocado rootstocks are vulnerable to water and soil borne pathogens and other forms of tree decline that are often associated with variation in soil type drainage and over or under irrigation lahav et al 2013 however despite these many potential sources of variation in tree behaviour an important finding of this study is that when trees were in good health avocado water use was a simple and consistent function of leaf area and crop load irrespective of climate and soil type 4 2 tree water use and leaf area in general plant transpiration is directly related to tree size and total leaf area goodwin et al 2006 the results confirmed that the avocado trees in the bay of plenty had the highest water use per tree while the trees in the far north had the lowest because of differences in tree size fig 5 however tree size was less variable within each orchard and when water use was normalized for differences in tree size and spacing between orchards by expression as a crop coefficient variation in water use within orchards and among seasons was more related to variation in fruit load than leaf area per tree fig 8 despite the importance of leaf area at the individual tree level water use was surprisingly insensitive to pruning operations pruning did not always result in a clear reduction in transpiration fig 4 even though pruning of the large avocado trees included in this study can involve the removal of approximately 25 of the total leaf area tree water use depends on the net solar radiation absorbed by the leaves green 1993 johnson et al 2000 maddonni et al 2001 pruning decreases self shading within the tree and redistributes light onto previously shaded areas of the canopy a sudden reduction in canopy size also usually enhances new vegetative growth resulting in higher water use for photosynthesis and new shoot development heilman et al 1996 overall leaf area is a significant determinant of avocado tree water use but can be accounted for by measures of tree spacing and size and percent shaded area of the orchard floor see below 4 3 tree water use and fruit load fruit load was an important determinant of tree water use positive relationships between fruit yield and tree water use in january were evident at all three sites both when data for all three seasons were combined and among trees within individual seasons fig 8 silber et al 2013a found that fruiting avocado trees grown in lysimeters had 60 higher daily water use compared to non fruiting trees the present study documents a similar effect in large trees across a continuous range of fruit loads and at multiple sites fruit are a strong sink for carbohydrate therefore the presence of fruit on a tree can strongly influence source sink carbon relationships and stomatal behaviour sade and moshelion 2014 studies of peach ayars et al 2003 johnson et al 2002 olive bustan et al 2016 apple wibbe and blanke 1995 and pear marsal et al 2014 have also reported a sharp decline in daily tree water use after de fruiting the decline in tree water use after fruit removal is likely to be the result of a sudden decrease in sink demand and consequently a reduction in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance bustan et al 2016 silber et al 2013a however this decline is usually only temporary because fruit growth inhibits vegetative growth and fruit removal enhances new growth lavee 2006 silber et al 2013a tree water use also decreased after fruit were removed in the present study but recovered within a month of harvest fig 4 in the case of avocado under new zealand conditions the fruit requires 10 months or longer from flowering to maturity at the study sites flowering started in early october and fruit were picked in september and october soon after harvest there is a high water demand for flowering fruitlet and shoot growth at the same time that reference et o is increasing with the onset of summer 4 4 crop coefficients for avocado crop coefficients were derived for the three study regions for healthy fruiting trees on a monthly basis and with a range of values that account for the effect of fruit load on water use fig 7 tables 3 5 the gradual increase in k c observed at all sites from the beginning of the growing season may be related to effects of flowering and fruiting on stomatal behaviour with tree water use decreasing more slowly than the reference as fruit development progressed k c for avocado increased above 1 in the late autumn and winter from april to august indicating that crop water use is higher than the reference during this period there is little information regarding k c for evergreen fruit tree species during the non irrigated season except for citrus peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 and olive villalobos et al 2000 that also show an increase in k c during winter when et o decreases avocado requires high energy in autumn and winter for oil accumulation in fruit and floral development salazar garcia et al 2013 and may therefore consume a significant amount of water for photosynthetic activity throughout the year comparison soil water balance estimates of et with sap flow measurements of t confirmed that evaporation from the soil and ground cover was a minor component of the water balance of the mature orchards used in this study the soil water balance estimate of evaporation was an approximation because it was based on assuming when drainage was not occurring but it indicates that evaporation was always less than 10 of total et from the orchard these three study sites had similar ground cover conditions with grass in the inter rows that was regularly mowed and a large proportion of the ground area covered by leaf litter and shaded by the canopy water loss from the ground surface depends on atmospheric demand shaded area the type of ground cover and the frequency of rainfall and irrigation compared to litter bare soil and active natural vegetation increase water loss from the soil allen and pereira 2009 shrestha and shukla 2014 also a shorter irrigation interval can increase soil evaporation as the rate of soil evaporation is relatively high after wetting the soil benli et al 2006 the crop coefficients derived in this study were consistent across sites because all three study orchards were mature with fully developed canopies and at least 77 shaded area however in other orchard crops k c is linearly correlated with the proportion of the area occupied by canopy as the trees grow in these crops the effect of canopy development is usually quantified as the relative shaded area johnson et al 2000 williams and ayars 2005 however water consumption typically plateaus and does not increase further after the individual tree crowns meet mcclymont et al 2009 williams and ayars 2005 this generally happens when shaded area reaches 80 or higher sammis et al 2004 wang et al 2007 at this point the leaf area exposed to direct sunlight reaches a maximum and the canopy becomes restricted in growth williams and ayars 2005 the relationship between k cb and shaded area for less mature avocado orchards in new zealand is proposed based on the addition of a single measurement of k cb from a younger orchard with a lower shaded area fig 9 whilst further estimates of k cb from orchards with a range of planting densities and tree sizes would be appropriate this preliminary relationship can be used to adjust k cb from young to mature orchards consideration should also be given to the effects of shaded area on soil and ground cover evaporation with increased losses expected from bare soil or ground cover vegetation in younger orchards this study found that avocado tree water use was similar in the bay of plenty whangarei and the far north orchards regardless of their different soil types soil type did not directly affect et c however the soils of these three regions have different soil water holding capacities that will influence the probability of water stress and that require different irrigation strategies irrigation should be applied when there is low rainfall from november to march and irrigation intervals should be 5 6 days in the bay of plenty 7 8 days in whangarei and 3 4 days in the far north examination of the soil moisture measurements over the summer period indicate that irrigation was needed for avocado when volumetric soil water content of the top layer decreased below 0 40 m3 m 3 in the bay of plenty allophanic soil 0 45 m3 m 3 in the whangarei clay soil and 0 25 m3 m 3 in the far north sandy soil 5 conclusions this research quantified hass avocado water use in the three avocado growing regions of new zealand relative to weather conditions soil type canopy size and fruit load and estimated k c values as a basis for irrigation within each region avocado tree water use was similar at all three sites with a range from 2 7 mm d 1 in mid summer to 1 2 1 4 mm d 1 in winter water use at an orchard scale was not strongly influenced by regional differences in climate and soil type however there was a strong effect of fruit load on tree water use in healthy trees leaf area per tree was less important for determining water use on an orchard area basis and it is proposed that the effects of variation in tree size between orchards of different age on water use can be accounted for by estimating the relative shaded area of the orchard the average k c in mid summer was 0 60 0 65 but increased by approximately 20 for heavy crop trees that variation in k c depends on their fruit load is important for avocado given high tree to tree variation in fruit load within a single year and the susceptibility of avocado to irregular cropping between years funding

9627,water productivity enhancement in farming systems is one of the most critical challenges facing the agricultural sector in the twenty first century precision irrigation based on soil matric potential smp measurements effectively enhances water productivity however the temporal effect of an smp based comfort zone on potato crops is lacking this paper evaluates the temporal effect of a range of soil matric potential thresholds namely 7 10 15 18 21 24 30 and 45 kpa in a sandy soil on the marketable yield and irrigation water productivity wp of potato grown in containers in a greenhouse with the partial least square algorithm pls and a mixed model the results of this study suggest that a comfort zone maximizing potato yield is located between 10 and 24 kpa the 24 kpa threshold generated the highest yield while reducing the irrigation water use up to 47 and generating the highest wp the average yield in the comfort zone reached 496 4 g per plant an increase of 88 over the lowest yield achieved at an smp of 45 kpa in addition the leaf expansion and tuber initiation physiological stages are the most important periods where the daily smp had the most influence on the marketable yield this information will assist potato growers in maintaining high yields while optimizing their use of irrigation water keywords crop production tensiometer soil matric potential water stress partial least squares 1 introduction water scarcity rather than a lack of arable land is increasingly recognized as the most pressing limitation in regard to agricultural production improvement over the upcoming decades hanjra and qureshi 2010 watkins 2006 therefore overall water productivity enhancement is one of the most critical challenges of the twenty first century cosgrove and loucks 2015 kijne et al 2003 molden et al 2010 this endeavor entails the optimization of the magnitude and benefits of water consumption especially within the agricultural sector water productivity improvement is a widely promoted approach in the adaptation of farming systems to deliver a higher crop yield per water consumption unit this approach will become increasingly important as agricultural water use accounts for over 70 of the 3830 cubic km of the annual globe water consumption chen et al 2018 fao 2008 molden 2013 and water demand competition is expanding for instance human water use has increased at twice the population increase rate over the past century fao 2008 in this regard governments often support irrigation development to enhance water productivity by increasing the crop irrigation water productivity wp grafton et al 2018 with an annual production of 322 million tons and an 18 6 million ha planted area potato crop is the fourth most important crop after wheat maize and rice food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2014 over the last decade irrigated potato crop areas have increased and this trend is likely to be maintained due to climate changes and increasing food demands haverkort and verhagen 2008 richter et al 2006 usda national agricultural statistics service 2020 furthermore in certain areas of the world potato production is responsible for the highest irrigation water use thus potato crops could exert a more significant impact on local water scarcity than other crops hess et al 2015 although potato crop are the most efficient in term of calory production by water volume among the major crops fao 2008 potato yields are recognized as sensitive to water stress gumiere et al 2019 jacques et al 2020 matteau et al 2021a 2021b stark et al 2013 wang et al 2007 thus precise control of the amount and quality of applied irrigation water in addition to timing management of water application and prevailing micro meteorological conditions are critical factors influencing the plant health and yield ati et al 2012 yactayo et al 2013 the soil matric potential smp is a reliable criterion to characterize the soil water availability wang et al 2007 the sensing technique provides an approximation of the actual crop water requirements by emphasizing soil water interaction which is strongly linked with soil plant interaction and plant water requirements thus water management based on the smp increases the wp périard et al 2012 phene and howell 1984 vories et al 2019 wang et al 2007 and is widely applied to numerous crops like celery onion rekika et al 2014 tomato dukes et al 2015 lemay 2006 lettuce périard et al 2015 and strawberry crops létourneau et al 2015 however optimal smp thresholds are specific to each crop accordingly optimal irrigation management should be based on precise and specific smp optimal ranges hence avoiding an excessive water input or water shortage conditions to maintain plants in the comfort zone while enhancing their physiological process the temporal effect of irrigation management on potato crops a water demanding crop usually cultivated in soil with minimal water retention has hitherto not been assessed to ensure the most efficient water use and optimal potato yield the identification of a precise water management comfort zone based on the smp is needed the two hypotheses tested in this paper include that the potato crop yield can be optimized with a hydric comfort zone and that the partial least square pls krishnan et al 2011 algorithm can identify critical irrigation periods across all crop growth stages the purpose of this study was to evaluate the temporal effect of the soil matric potential thresholds smpt on the potato yield as such experiments entailing potato cultivation monitored by an smp network and irrigated with a drip irrigation system were conducted in a greenhouse complex at laval university québec qc canada with the use of the pls algorithm and a mixed model yang 2010 to analyze the collected data this paper a presents an accurate range of smpts comfort zone that optimizes the wp while maximizing the yield and determines based on the comfort zone the specific threshold that optimizes the wp and b identifies across various thresholds the critical irrigation management periods throughout the growing season i e periods with the most influence on the marketable yields the results of this study could allow potato growers to adapt their practices to include a more sustainable and optimal agroeconomic irrigation water management approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and irrigation process a total of four experiments was conducted in the high performance greenhouse complex of laval university québec qc canada in 2018 1 experiment w18 2019 2 experiments w19 and s19 and 2020 1 experiment w20 the experiment was arranged in a split plot design of four replicates of the various smp based thresholds a 2705 pencil tensiometer with integrated pressure sensor from soilmoisture equipment corp goleta ca usa was installed at a depth of 10 cm in each container the latter comprised plastic containers with a volume of 0 14 cubic meters 60 40 40 cm filled with the soil type described below a cr1000 datalogger obtained from campbell scientific inc logan ut usa collected data measured by the tensiometers at two minute time intervals these measurements were employed to calculate the mean smp for each planned threshold necessary to automatically trigger irrigation a schematic of the experimental design with a summary of the smpt ranges is shown in fig 1 two tubers were planted at a depth of 7 5 cm in each container individual irrigation lines comprising drip irrigation emitters placed atop the soil surface were installed to independently control irrigation for each smpt this technique caused smp fluctuations within each of the replicates thus a posteriori classification of the containers based on the smpt experienced for at least 75 of the growing season was adopted therefore the cumulative irrigation water volume for each smpt was evaluated by recording the operation duration of the automatic valves installed in the irrigation system di and the manufacturer provided flow rate for the in line emitters q 1 09 l h i e v di q the wp was determined based on the ratio of the total tuber weight and the amount of water applied within each smpt range the irrigation duration throughout the growing season was adjusted to reach an smp between 1 and 5kpa after irrigation from potato seeding to emergence the irrigation approach remained the same across all thresholds to ensure uniform emergence the irrigation experiment began with potato emergence and continued until harvest the wp was calculated with eq 1 1 w p y i e l d v where yield is the marketable yield for a given smpt and v is the cumulative irrigation water volume applied within the same smpt range the water content in 12 containers three units under smp thresholds of 15 30 and 45kpa were randomly selected was measured in 2018 at the 10 cm depth with gs3 probes decagon devices inc pullman wa usa at 15 minute intervals to create an in situ water retention curve 2 2 agronomic practices yield and grade the variety cultivated in this experiment was goldrush this variety is the most important variety among potato seed production areas in the province of québec agriculture and agri food canada 2017 fertilization was first applied at the seeding stage 120kg ha of npk and 10kg ha of mg and 55kg ha of ammonium n was applied at the post emergence stage following local recommendations for potato crops craaq 2010 the available nutrient concentrations p k and mg considered to calculate the fertilization needs were extracted with the mehlich iii extraction method mehlich 1984 and determined at the research and development institute for the agri environment institut de recherche et de développement en agroenvironnement or irda sainte foy qc canada via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model icap perkinelmer boston ma fungicides aprovia benzovindiflupyr and senator pspt thiophanate methyl were applied during planting following the manufacturer recommended rates to restrain soil borne diseases potatoes were harvested 14 days after the beginning of senescence i e after 110 109 106 and 105 days in winter 2018 winter 2019 summer 2019 and winter 2020 respectively tubers were collected weighed sized and graded by quality and size according to the standards of local growers two quality grades were considered marketable and non marketable tubers were graded as non marketable if one of the following conditions occurred on more than 5 of the surface growth cracks bottleneck shape abnormally curved shape blackleg rhizoctonia symptoms or potato scab lesions the four size based classes included cull below 42 g small tubers between 42 and 112 g medium tubers between 112 and 224 g and large tubers over 224 g the tuber density was measured based on three marketable tubers randomly selected among the containers by immersion in water 2 3 soil characteristics the soil was a podzolic sandy soil 0 clay 8 2 silt 91 8 sand and 3 1 organic c with a 48 porosity and a ph of 5 01 according to the canadian soil classification soil classification working group 1998 extracted from a potato field in dolbeau mistassini city 4 8 5 1 31 n and 7 2 1 1 50 w the soil comprised a topsoil sample 0 20 cm which was homogenized and placed in each container the sedimentation method was applied to determine the particle size distribution bouyoucos 1962 the soil was saturated with water before planting and was replaced between the experiments to avoid soil borne diseases smpt values were selected based on the smp distribution in the soil water retention curve to cover a wide range of realistic field water content conditions as shown in fig 2 the van genuchten parameters θ r 0 053 cm 3 cm 3 θ s 0 48 cm 3 cm 3 α 0 195 cm 1 and n 2 13 adopted to generate the water retention curve were fitted via optimization based on the smp and soil water volumetric data measured throughout one growing season genuchten 1980 2 4 greenhouse environmental conditions the environmental conditions in the greenhouse were measured with a complete weather station located inside the greenhouse during the growing season of the four experiments the mean temperature was 19 7 c 3 1 c the temperature and relative humidity in each experiment are provided in table 1 2 5 pls regression and statistical analysis in this study pls regression one of the two basic pls methods krishnan et al 2011 was adopted to analyze the temporal effect of the daily smp threshold predictors denoted x in eq 2 on the potato yield response denoted y in eq 3 across the various smpts the pls regression was applied to determine by correlation the most determinant period of the season in the development of the yield differentiation using only the yield data and daily average smp for instance if we denote by xik the actual smp measured on the ith dap in the kth container with a yield response denoted by yk the objective is to use pls to determine the importance of each ith irrigation event on the yield produced across all containers thus x is a full rank matrix with the daily smp measured across all experiments units as columns over the growth season as rows and y is a vector of the yield potato weights measured in each of the containers the pls regression method works by simultaneously and iteratively decomposing the predictor x and response y variables into few new variables named latent vectors or components that explain the covariance as much as possible between x and y abdi 2010 a pls regression model is described by 2 x t p e 3 y u q f 4 u t d where e and f are matrices containing the residuals for x and y respectively and d is a diagonal matrix representing the scaling of the bilinear inner relationship between t the scores matrix of x and u the scores matrix of y and the superscript the symbol for matrix transposition at each iteration the decomposition of x and y yields three categories of vectors a a set of orthogonal factors named score matrix t for x and u for y b a set of loadings non orthogonal named loading matrix p for x and q for y and c the regression weights w for x and c for y then the score matrix of the predictors which is a diagonal matrix with the regression weights of the response variable s as diagonal elements and the loading matrix transposed of the response s variable s are used to predict the response s variable s y as follows 5 y t d q the determination of the latent vectors columns of t requires the use of the regression weights w and c to generate two linear combinations of x and y such that these linear combinations have maximum covariance this is equivalent to finding a first pair of vectors t and u defined as follows and subject to the constraints that w w 1 t t 1 and t u is maximal 6 t x w 7 u y c the latent vector found at each iteration is then subtracted from both x and y until x becomes a null matrix a condition indicating that the whole set of latent vectors t is found the optimal number of latent vectors was determined using cross validation protocols and components irrigation events smp on the ith dap with an importance of over 85 were chosen as critical periods the variable importance calculation was based on weighted sums of the absolute regression coefficients using the varimp function of the caret packages kuhn 2020 data analysis was performed in r software r core team 2019 pls analysis was performed with the caret package kuhn 2020 and a cross validation control procedure the variance homogeneity was evaluated with the car package and the levene test fox 2020 the difference in yield between the various smpts was compared using a linear mixed model and contrasted with the lme4 package bates et al 2020 and the least square difference lsd post hoc test in the lmertest package kuznetsova et al 2020 the differences were considered significant when the p values were less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil matric potential thresholds a smpt between 10 and 24kpa generated the highest marketable tuber yield as shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows a quadratic repartition of the marketable potato yield with the 7kpa smpt achieving the lowest variability between the 7 and 24kpa smpts the lower marketable yields are similar but the difference in the maximum yield is notable the quadratic repartition of the marketable yield is more pronounced for the 50 most notably producing plants as shown in fig 3b the figure shows that the smpt directly affects the potential maximum marketable yield the marketable yield remain stable between 10 and 24kpa but is significantly reduced at smpt levels of 7 and 45kpa as confirmed by the significant effect on the smpt revealed in table 2 analysis with the lsd post hoc test indicated that the marketable yield under the 7kpa smpt was significantly lower than that under all other thresholds except 45kpa the analysis further indicated that the marketable yields under the 15 18 and 21 smpts were significantly higher than those under the 30 and 45kpa smpts finally no significant difference in the marketable yield was found between the 15 18 21 and 24kpa smpts the smpt did not significantly affect the tuber density as indicated in table 2 the 15 kpa smpt led to the highest potential yield there is a continuous descending trend of the potential maximal marketable yield starting at 15kpa with a marketable yield of 1935 g per plant declining to 265 g per plant at 43kpa as shown in fig 3c in the same figure the maximum curve blue curve based on the 80th percentile of 3b describes the effect of smpt values between 7 and 30kpa compared to the maximum curve a marketable yield under a smpt drier than 30kpa could be maintained but the potential maximal marketable yield was significantly reduced therefore a comfort zone for the goldrush variety could be established between 10 and 24kpa as shown in fig 3d a continuous increase occurred in the yield with increasing proportion of the season spent in the comfort zone the marketable tuber yield was maximized with 60 or more of the season spent in the comfort zone lsd analysis revealed that the marketable yield of potato plants spending less than 20 of the season in the comfort zone was significantly lower than that of potato plants spending more than 60 of the season in the comfort zone thus potato plants spending between 60 and 80 of the season in the comfort zone attained significantly higher marketable yields than those spending between 20 and 40 of the season in the comfort zone 3 1 1 tuber size distribution and quality the tuber size distribution remained uniform across the smpts interestingly no large tubers were produced by potato plants under the 7 24 and 30kpa smpts and these thresholds produced lower yields nevertheless as indicated in table 3 no significant effect of the smpt was found on the cull small medium or large tuber yields the number of tubers produced was not significantly affected by the smpt in any tuber size class as indicated in table 4 the absence of an effect on the tuber size yield or tuber number indicated that the difference between the various smpts was attributable to small weight difference in each size class the smpt imposed no significant effect on either the overall yield quality or the specific conditions affecting the yield quality such as scabs or blackleg symptoms therefore the effects of the smpt on the total and marketable yields were comparable 3 2 irrigation water productivity and irrigation volume the wp values for the different smpts are shown in fig 4a the wp under the 7kpa threshold is significantly lower than that under the 15 18 21 and 24kpa thresholds the highest wp is achieved under the 24kpa smpt which is significantly higher than thresholds lower than 15 and higher than 30kpa the cumulative irrigation volume is shown in fig 4b the water distribution during the growing season was comparable between the experiments and smpt values the cumulative irrigation volume was higher in s19 due to the increase in sunlight hours in summer leading to increased water requirements to maintain the same smpt the irrigation experiments started on approximately the 20th dap and ended between the 95th and 100th daps 3 3 temporal effect of the smp 3 3 1 temporalization via the pls analysis the effect of the smpt on the marketable potato yield was temporalized via pls analysis the daily average values of the smp were used as principal components in pls analysis and the number of daps with an importance higher than 85 in marketable yield determination was selected as the critical period as shown in fig 5 the critical period determining the marketable yield ranged fro the 18th dap to the 20th dap at the leaf expansion stage the difference in smpt was manifested early in the season as most pls principal components corresponded to the smp in the first quarter of the growing season as shown in fig 5 which was maintained until harvest the leaf expansion stage corresponds to young plants with notable vegetative growth before tuber development irrigation cycles and the smp are subject to a gradual and steady variation at the leaf expansion stage 3 3 2 temporalization via mixed analysis the smpt temporal effect on the marketable potato yield as evaluated with the linear mixed model was similar to that determined with the pls model again the smpt measured at the leaf expansion physiological stage generated the highest effect on the yield as shown in fig 6a p value of 0 0077 a smpt between 10 and 21kpa at the leaf expansion stage produced to the highest yield which was significantly higher than that under the 7 24 and 45kpa smpts the smpt measured at the tuber initiation stage also significantly affected the marketable tuber yield as shown in fig 6b a smpt of 7kpa resulted in a significantly lower yield than that under the 15 and 21kpa smpts and the 15kpa threshold generated a significantly higher yield than that under the 7 10 21 24 30 and 45kpa smpts the smpt measured at the tuber bulking stage did not significantly affect the marketable tuber yield nor resulted in significant differences between the smpts as shown in fig 6c 4 discussion the results in the present study demonstrate the occurrence of a hydrological comfort zone for the goldrush potato variety located between 10 and 24kpa outside the comfort zone an excessive or insufficient water input could lead to significant marketable yield reductions especially at smpt levels of 7kpa or 45kpa by maintaining the smp in the comfort zone an estimated increase in the potato yield of 17 4 tons per hectare was observed over the 7kpa smpt and a potato yield increase of 10 3 tons per hectare over the 30kpa smpt compared to the mean potato production per hectare in canada these potato yield increase indicate an enhancement between 25 and 40 these findings specify a certain smp range based on the previous assessment of the effect of an excessive water input or water shortage on potato the yield gumiere et al 2019 stark et al 2013 water is essential to maintain plant physiological and physicochemical processes reichardt and timm 2020 water is crucial in plants to allow photosynthesis turgidity cell elongation vegetative growth and nutrient availability kirkham 2005 reichardt and timm 2020 taiz and zeiger 2002 soil water management within the comfort zone allows potatoes to avoid water stress and physiological process reduction such as photosynthesis total biomass and chlorophyll content diminution dalla costa et al 1997 liu et al 2005 rolando et al 2015 thus irrigation management according to the comfort zone limits soil water excesses and high water fluxes which could lead to an increase in nitrate leaching in tile drains matteau et al 2019 downstream soluble reactive phosphorus concentration strohmenger et al 2020 and dissolved organic carbon concentration strohmenger et al 2020 therefore the comfort zone based irrigation management in potato cultivation could potentially limit water pollution involving agricultural nutrients as observed in this experiment where no leaching was observed under smpts higher than 7kpa the marketable yield under a smpt drier than 30kpa was higher than that under a smpt drier than 7kpa the time spent in the comfort zone partially explains this finding as under a threshold drier than 30kpa a greater proportion of the season was spent between 10 and 24kpa during the drying cycle moreover potato crops are known to develop physiological adjustment thereby improving their water restriction tolerance after early season water shortages yactayo et al 2013 it is further accepted that anoxic conditions could limit plant productivity bulot et al 2016 périard et al 2016 the optimal smpt is 24kpa which is the limit of the comfort zone as this smpt value generates both a higher yield and the highest wp comparing the limits of the comfort zone i e 24kpa and 10kpa an estimated water use reduction of approximately 47 was observed to achieve a similar yield these results are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that an smp of 25kpa can sustain optimal water uptake conditions and the highest yield in potato cultivation gumiere et al 2019 wang et al 2007 in this study the daily mean smp data were considered a spectrum in pls analysis to identify critical periods determining the marketable potato yield the results suggest that the importance of the pls component does not depend on the irrigation volume or the irrigation frequency one critical period was identified with the pls model corresponding to the stage with the highest pls component importance occurring at the potato leaf expansion physiological stage similarly the linear mixed model identified a critical period which corresponded to the potato leaf expansion stage this model further identified a second critical period corresponding to the tuber initiation stage the yield distribution with the smpt in the tuber initiation stage remained more stable than did the yield associated with the smp measured in the leaf expansion stage the quadratic repartition of the marketable potato yield with the smpt measured at the leaf expansion stage was similar to the distribution of the marketable yield with the smpt throughout the growing season observation of the marketable tuber yield at the three physiological stages indicated that in this study the smpt effect began at the leaf expansion stage and was maintained beyond the tuber initiation stage leaf expansion and tuber initiation are two critical steps in potato growth limiting the water availability at the leaf expansion stage could restrict plant development limit stolon initiation and inhibit root growth obidiegwu et al 2015 thereby curbing the potato plant ability to access soil nutrients and soil water and maintain its physiological processes allowing efficient tuber formation tuber initiation is commonly acknowledged as a critical period for potato crops especially regarding irrigation as up to 40 of the water uptake could occur at the tuber initiation stage darwish et al 2006 water stress occurring at the tuber initiation stage could limit the yield quality and tuber number king et al 2020 landry et al 2014 obidiegwu et al 2015 matteau et al 2021a 2021b determined that the pls algorithm could provide crucial insights into the critical stage of the potato plant water demand this assumption was confirmed by linear mixed model analysis which corroborated and detailed the pls results therefore the pls model is a suitable tool to evaluate smp effects on the yield the results further suggested that with a larger dataset pls analysis with the smp as a spectrum could be implemented to predict the potato yield in this study the goldrush variety comfort zone effect remained the same across all tuber dimensions no evidence of tuber number or tuber size decrease was found even considering only the smp values at specific physiological stages in contrast to the effect of water shortages reported by other researchers landry et al 2014 obidiegwu et al 2015 this absence of smpt effects indicates that none of the thresholds applied in the experiments in this paper created notable short term water shortage conditions to significantly impact the tuber number for the goldrush potato variety this study was conducted in a greenhouse to optimize the precision of the irrigation system management measures and smp sensor network to precisely evaluate the effect of the smpt also greenhouse experiments in containers can limit the data variability lahlou and ledent 2005 for this study the size of the container has been carefully chosen to allow 40cm of root depth where most potato roots grow wang et al 2007 and where 90 of the water is consumed darwish et al 2006 open field irrigation management field and design specific conditions may lead to spatial variability and soil or irrigation limitations which may require adaption of the optimal comfort zone determined in this study the soil used in this study was a sandy soil extracted from the field of a potato producer and is representative of potato production in eastern canada although potatoes are grown on various soil types the use of smpt allows for the comfort zone established in this study to be used as a knowledge base for other soil types because smp based thresholds established for a specific crop could be used across several soil types iersel et al 2013 additionally compared with outdoor grown crops greenhouse crops evapotranspiration is reduced due to reduced evaporative demand caused by a decrease in solar radiation fernández et al 2010 shading screens and shorter daylight due to late autumn or early spring culture can also cause solar radiation decreases therefore the open field increased evaporative demand could change the time between irrigation and the effect of the time spent within the optimal comfort zone the open field wp could also be lowered following the lowest evaporative demand and higher yield in greenhouses gallardo et al 2013 or more severe effect of water stress in the field ramirez et al 2014 singh et al 2021 however despite a lower magnitude of open field wp gain from irrigation management the change in wp tends to follow a similar pattern under both greenhouse and open field conditions singh et al 2021 5 conclusion in this study the optimal comfort zone for potato crops based on the smp was identified between 10 and 24kpa a precision irrigation design triggered by a tensiometer sensor network was employed to manage irrigation and obtain an accurate representation of the smp the optimal smpt combining the yield and wp was 24kpa the observed potato plants exhibited a better adaptatability to a moderate water stress than to an excessive water input the temporalization results demonstrated that optimal water management considering the potato smp based comfort zone should be initiated as early as the leaf expansion stage and should be maintained throughout the growing season therefore the data provided in this study suggest that the potato yield is mainly determined by the soil matric potential threshold future work should focus on the impact of the soil type on the comfort zone which could allow field integration across various environments and locations future research should adopt the same temporalization method with the smpt value specific to each physiological stage to adjust the optimal smpt throughout the growing season funding this

9627,water productivity enhancement in farming systems is one of the most critical challenges facing the agricultural sector in the twenty first century precision irrigation based on soil matric potential smp measurements effectively enhances water productivity however the temporal effect of an smp based comfort zone on potato crops is lacking this paper evaluates the temporal effect of a range of soil matric potential thresholds namely 7 10 15 18 21 24 30 and 45 kpa in a sandy soil on the marketable yield and irrigation water productivity wp of potato grown in containers in a greenhouse with the partial least square algorithm pls and a mixed model the results of this study suggest that a comfort zone maximizing potato yield is located between 10 and 24 kpa the 24 kpa threshold generated the highest yield while reducing the irrigation water use up to 47 and generating the highest wp the average yield in the comfort zone reached 496 4 g per plant an increase of 88 over the lowest yield achieved at an smp of 45 kpa in addition the leaf expansion and tuber initiation physiological stages are the most important periods where the daily smp had the most influence on the marketable yield this information will assist potato growers in maintaining high yields while optimizing their use of irrigation water keywords crop production tensiometer soil matric potential water stress partial least squares 1 introduction water scarcity rather than a lack of arable land is increasingly recognized as the most pressing limitation in regard to agricultural production improvement over the upcoming decades hanjra and qureshi 2010 watkins 2006 therefore overall water productivity enhancement is one of the most critical challenges of the twenty first century cosgrove and loucks 2015 kijne et al 2003 molden et al 2010 this endeavor entails the optimization of the magnitude and benefits of water consumption especially within the agricultural sector water productivity improvement is a widely promoted approach in the adaptation of farming systems to deliver a higher crop yield per water consumption unit this approach will become increasingly important as agricultural water use accounts for over 70 of the 3830 cubic km of the annual globe water consumption chen et al 2018 fao 2008 molden 2013 and water demand competition is expanding for instance human water use has increased at twice the population increase rate over the past century fao 2008 in this regard governments often support irrigation development to enhance water productivity by increasing the crop irrigation water productivity wp grafton et al 2018 with an annual production of 322 million tons and an 18 6 million ha planted area potato crop is the fourth most important crop after wheat maize and rice food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2014 over the last decade irrigated potato crop areas have increased and this trend is likely to be maintained due to climate changes and increasing food demands haverkort and verhagen 2008 richter et al 2006 usda national agricultural statistics service 2020 furthermore in certain areas of the world potato production is responsible for the highest irrigation water use thus potato crops could exert a more significant impact on local water scarcity than other crops hess et al 2015 although potato crop are the most efficient in term of calory production by water volume among the major crops fao 2008 potato yields are recognized as sensitive to water stress gumiere et al 2019 jacques et al 2020 matteau et al 2021a 2021b stark et al 2013 wang et al 2007 thus precise control of the amount and quality of applied irrigation water in addition to timing management of water application and prevailing micro meteorological conditions are critical factors influencing the plant health and yield ati et al 2012 yactayo et al 2013 the soil matric potential smp is a reliable criterion to characterize the soil water availability wang et al 2007 the sensing technique provides an approximation of the actual crop water requirements by emphasizing soil water interaction which is strongly linked with soil plant interaction and plant water requirements thus water management based on the smp increases the wp périard et al 2012 phene and howell 1984 vories et al 2019 wang et al 2007 and is widely applied to numerous crops like celery onion rekika et al 2014 tomato dukes et al 2015 lemay 2006 lettuce périard et al 2015 and strawberry crops létourneau et al 2015 however optimal smp thresholds are specific to each crop accordingly optimal irrigation management should be based on precise and specific smp optimal ranges hence avoiding an excessive water input or water shortage conditions to maintain plants in the comfort zone while enhancing their physiological process the temporal effect of irrigation management on potato crops a water demanding crop usually cultivated in soil with minimal water retention has hitherto not been assessed to ensure the most efficient water use and optimal potato yield the identification of a precise water management comfort zone based on the smp is needed the two hypotheses tested in this paper include that the potato crop yield can be optimized with a hydric comfort zone and that the partial least square pls krishnan et al 2011 algorithm can identify critical irrigation periods across all crop growth stages the purpose of this study was to evaluate the temporal effect of the soil matric potential thresholds smpt on the potato yield as such experiments entailing potato cultivation monitored by an smp network and irrigated with a drip irrigation system were conducted in a greenhouse complex at laval university québec qc canada with the use of the pls algorithm and a mixed model yang 2010 to analyze the collected data this paper a presents an accurate range of smpts comfort zone that optimizes the wp while maximizing the yield and determines based on the comfort zone the specific threshold that optimizes the wp and b identifies across various thresholds the critical irrigation management periods throughout the growing season i e periods with the most influence on the marketable yields the results of this study could allow potato growers to adapt their practices to include a more sustainable and optimal agroeconomic irrigation water management approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and irrigation process a total of four experiments was conducted in the high performance greenhouse complex of laval university québec qc canada in 2018 1 experiment w18 2019 2 experiments w19 and s19 and 2020 1 experiment w20 the experiment was arranged in a split plot design of four replicates of the various smp based thresholds a 2705 pencil tensiometer with integrated pressure sensor from soilmoisture equipment corp goleta ca usa was installed at a depth of 10 cm in each container the latter comprised plastic containers with a volume of 0 14 cubic meters 60 40 40 cm filled with the soil type described below a cr1000 datalogger obtained from campbell scientific inc logan ut usa collected data measured by the tensiometers at two minute time intervals these measurements were employed to calculate the mean smp for each planned threshold necessary to automatically trigger irrigation a schematic of the experimental design with a summary of the smpt ranges is shown in fig 1 two tubers were planted at a depth of 7 5 cm in each container individual irrigation lines comprising drip irrigation emitters placed atop the soil surface were installed to independently control irrigation for each smpt this technique caused smp fluctuations within each of the replicates thus a posteriori classification of the containers based on the smpt experienced for at least 75 of the growing season was adopted therefore the cumulative irrigation water volume for each smpt was evaluated by recording the operation duration of the automatic valves installed in the irrigation system di and the manufacturer provided flow rate for the in line emitters q 1 09 l h i e v di q the wp was determined based on the ratio of the total tuber weight and the amount of water applied within each smpt range the irrigation duration throughout the growing season was adjusted to reach an smp between 1 and 5kpa after irrigation from potato seeding to emergence the irrigation approach remained the same across all thresholds to ensure uniform emergence the irrigation experiment began with potato emergence and continued until harvest the wp was calculated with eq 1 1 w p y i e l d v where yield is the marketable yield for a given smpt and v is the cumulative irrigation water volume applied within the same smpt range the water content in 12 containers three units under smp thresholds of 15 30 and 45kpa were randomly selected was measured in 2018 at the 10 cm depth with gs3 probes decagon devices inc pullman wa usa at 15 minute intervals to create an in situ water retention curve 2 2 agronomic practices yield and grade the variety cultivated in this experiment was goldrush this variety is the most important variety among potato seed production areas in the province of québec agriculture and agri food canada 2017 fertilization was first applied at the seeding stage 120kg ha of npk and 10kg ha of mg and 55kg ha of ammonium n was applied at the post emergence stage following local recommendations for potato crops craaq 2010 the available nutrient concentrations p k and mg considered to calculate the fertilization needs were extracted with the mehlich iii extraction method mehlich 1984 and determined at the research and development institute for the agri environment institut de recherche et de développement en agroenvironnement or irda sainte foy qc canada via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model icap perkinelmer boston ma fungicides aprovia benzovindiflupyr and senator pspt thiophanate methyl were applied during planting following the manufacturer recommended rates to restrain soil borne diseases potatoes were harvested 14 days after the beginning of senescence i e after 110 109 106 and 105 days in winter 2018 winter 2019 summer 2019 and winter 2020 respectively tubers were collected weighed sized and graded by quality and size according to the standards of local growers two quality grades were considered marketable and non marketable tubers were graded as non marketable if one of the following conditions occurred on more than 5 of the surface growth cracks bottleneck shape abnormally curved shape blackleg rhizoctonia symptoms or potato scab lesions the four size based classes included cull below 42 g small tubers between 42 and 112 g medium tubers between 112 and 224 g and large tubers over 224 g the tuber density was measured based on three marketable tubers randomly selected among the containers by immersion in water 2 3 soil characteristics the soil was a podzolic sandy soil 0 clay 8 2 silt 91 8 sand and 3 1 organic c with a 48 porosity and a ph of 5 01 according to the canadian soil classification soil classification working group 1998 extracted from a potato field in dolbeau mistassini city 4 8 5 1 31 n and 7 2 1 1 50 w the soil comprised a topsoil sample 0 20 cm which was homogenized and placed in each container the sedimentation method was applied to determine the particle size distribution bouyoucos 1962 the soil was saturated with water before planting and was replaced between the experiments to avoid soil borne diseases smpt values were selected based on the smp distribution in the soil water retention curve to cover a wide range of realistic field water content conditions as shown in fig 2 the van genuchten parameters θ r 0 053 cm 3 cm 3 θ s 0 48 cm 3 cm 3 α 0 195 cm 1 and n 2 13 adopted to generate the water retention curve were fitted via optimization based on the smp and soil water volumetric data measured throughout one growing season genuchten 1980 2 4 greenhouse environmental conditions the environmental conditions in the greenhouse were measured with a complete weather station located inside the greenhouse during the growing season of the four experiments the mean temperature was 19 7 c 3 1 c the temperature and relative humidity in each experiment are provided in table 1 2 5 pls regression and statistical analysis in this study pls regression one of the two basic pls methods krishnan et al 2011 was adopted to analyze the temporal effect of the daily smp threshold predictors denoted x in eq 2 on the potato yield response denoted y in eq 3 across the various smpts the pls regression was applied to determine by correlation the most determinant period of the season in the development of the yield differentiation using only the yield data and daily average smp for instance if we denote by xik the actual smp measured on the ith dap in the kth container with a yield response denoted by yk the objective is to use pls to determine the importance of each ith irrigation event on the yield produced across all containers thus x is a full rank matrix with the daily smp measured across all experiments units as columns over the growth season as rows and y is a vector of the yield potato weights measured in each of the containers the pls regression method works by simultaneously and iteratively decomposing the predictor x and response y variables into few new variables named latent vectors or components that explain the covariance as much as possible between x and y abdi 2010 a pls regression model is described by 2 x t p e 3 y u q f 4 u t d where e and f are matrices containing the residuals for x and y respectively and d is a diagonal matrix representing the scaling of the bilinear inner relationship between t the scores matrix of x and u the scores matrix of y and the superscript the symbol for matrix transposition at each iteration the decomposition of x and y yields three categories of vectors a a set of orthogonal factors named score matrix t for x and u for y b a set of loadings non orthogonal named loading matrix p for x and q for y and c the regression weights w for x and c for y then the score matrix of the predictors which is a diagonal matrix with the regression weights of the response variable s as diagonal elements and the loading matrix transposed of the response s variable s are used to predict the response s variable s y as follows 5 y t d q the determination of the latent vectors columns of t requires the use of the regression weights w and c to generate two linear combinations of x and y such that these linear combinations have maximum covariance this is equivalent to finding a first pair of vectors t and u defined as follows and subject to the constraints that w w 1 t t 1 and t u is maximal 6 t x w 7 u y c the latent vector found at each iteration is then subtracted from both x and y until x becomes a null matrix a condition indicating that the whole set of latent vectors t is found the optimal number of latent vectors was determined using cross validation protocols and components irrigation events smp on the ith dap with an importance of over 85 were chosen as critical periods the variable importance calculation was based on weighted sums of the absolute regression coefficients using the varimp function of the caret packages kuhn 2020 data analysis was performed in r software r core team 2019 pls analysis was performed with the caret package kuhn 2020 and a cross validation control procedure the variance homogeneity was evaluated with the car package and the levene test fox 2020 the difference in yield between the various smpts was compared using a linear mixed model and contrasted with the lme4 package bates et al 2020 and the least square difference lsd post hoc test in the lmertest package kuznetsova et al 2020 the differences were considered significant when the p values were less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil matric potential thresholds a smpt between 10 and 24kpa generated the highest marketable tuber yield as shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows a quadratic repartition of the marketable potato yield with the 7kpa smpt achieving the lowest variability between the 7 and 24kpa smpts the lower marketable yields are similar but the difference in the maximum yield is notable the quadratic repartition of the marketable yield is more pronounced for the 50 most notably producing plants as shown in fig 3b the figure shows that the smpt directly affects the potential maximum marketable yield the marketable yield remain stable between 10 and 24kpa but is significantly reduced at smpt levels of 7 and 45kpa as confirmed by the significant effect on the smpt revealed in table 2 analysis with the lsd post hoc test indicated that the marketable yield under the 7kpa smpt was significantly lower than that under all other thresholds except 45kpa the analysis further indicated that the marketable yields under the 15 18 and 21 smpts were significantly higher than those under the 30 and 45kpa smpts finally no significant difference in the marketable yield was found between the 15 18 21 and 24kpa smpts the smpt did not significantly affect the tuber density as indicated in table 2 the 15 kpa smpt led to the highest potential yield there is a continuous descending trend of the potential maximal marketable yield starting at 15kpa with a marketable yield of 1935 g per plant declining to 265 g per plant at 43kpa as shown in fig 3c in the same figure the maximum curve blue curve based on the 80th percentile of 3b describes the effect of smpt values between 7 and 30kpa compared to the maximum curve a marketable yield under a smpt drier than 30kpa could be maintained but the potential maximal marketable yield was significantly reduced therefore a comfort zone for the goldrush variety could be established between 10 and 24kpa as shown in fig 3d a continuous increase occurred in the yield with increasing proportion of the season spent in the comfort zone the marketable tuber yield was maximized with 60 or more of the season spent in the comfort zone lsd analysis revealed that the marketable yield of potato plants spending less than 20 of the season in the comfort zone was significantly lower than that of potato plants spending more than 60 of the season in the comfort zone thus potato plants spending between 60 and 80 of the season in the comfort zone attained significantly higher marketable yields than those spending between 20 and 40 of the season in the comfort zone 3 1 1 tuber size distribution and quality the tuber size distribution remained uniform across the smpts interestingly no large tubers were produced by potato plants under the 7 24 and 30kpa smpts and these thresholds produced lower yields nevertheless as indicated in table 3 no significant effect of the smpt was found on the cull small medium or large tuber yields the number of tubers produced was not significantly affected by the smpt in any tuber size class as indicated in table 4 the absence of an effect on the tuber size yield or tuber number indicated that the difference between the various smpts was attributable to small weight difference in each size class the smpt imposed no significant effect on either the overall yield quality or the specific conditions affecting the yield quality such as scabs or blackleg symptoms therefore the effects of the smpt on the total and marketable yields were comparable 3 2 irrigation water productivity and irrigation volume the wp values for the different smpts are shown in fig 4a the wp under the 7kpa threshold is significantly lower than that under the 15 18 21 and 24kpa thresholds the highest wp is achieved under the 24kpa smpt which is significantly higher than thresholds lower than 15 and higher than 30kpa the cumulative irrigation volume is shown in fig 4b the water distribution during the growing season was comparable between the experiments and smpt values the cumulative irrigation volume was higher in s19 due to the increase in sunlight hours in summer leading to increased water requirements to maintain the same smpt the irrigation experiments started on approximately the 20th dap and ended between the 95th and 100th daps 3 3 temporal effect of the smp 3 3 1 temporalization via the pls analysis the effect of the smpt on the marketable potato yield was temporalized via pls analysis the daily average values of the smp were used as principal components in pls analysis and the number of daps with an importance higher than 85 in marketable yield determination was selected as the critical period as shown in fig 5 the critical period determining the marketable yield ranged fro the 18th dap to the 20th dap at the leaf expansion stage the difference in smpt was manifested early in the season as most pls principal components corresponded to the smp in the first quarter of the growing season as shown in fig 5 which was maintained until harvest the leaf expansion stage corresponds to young plants with notable vegetative growth before tuber development irrigation cycles and the smp are subject to a gradual and steady variation at the leaf expansion stage 3 3 2 temporalization via mixed analysis the smpt temporal effect on the marketable potato yield as evaluated with the linear mixed model was similar to that determined with the pls model again the smpt measured at the leaf expansion physiological stage generated the highest effect on the yield as shown in fig 6a p value of 0 0077 a smpt between 10 and 21kpa at the leaf expansion stage produced to the highest yield which was significantly higher than that under the 7 24 and 45kpa smpts the smpt measured at the tuber initiation stage also significantly affected the marketable tuber yield as shown in fig 6b a smpt of 7kpa resulted in a significantly lower yield than that under the 15 and 21kpa smpts and the 15kpa threshold generated a significantly higher yield than that under the 7 10 21 24 30 and 45kpa smpts the smpt measured at the tuber bulking stage did not significantly affect the marketable tuber yield nor resulted in significant differences between the smpts as shown in fig 6c 4 discussion the results in the present study demonstrate the occurrence of a hydrological comfort zone for the goldrush potato variety located between 10 and 24kpa outside the comfort zone an excessive or insufficient water input could lead to significant marketable yield reductions especially at smpt levels of 7kpa or 45kpa by maintaining the smp in the comfort zone an estimated increase in the potato yield of 17 4 tons per hectare was observed over the 7kpa smpt and a potato yield increase of 10 3 tons per hectare over the 30kpa smpt compared to the mean potato production per hectare in canada these potato yield increase indicate an enhancement between 25 and 40 these findings specify a certain smp range based on the previous assessment of the effect of an excessive water input or water shortage on potato the yield gumiere et al 2019 stark et al 2013 water is essential to maintain plant physiological and physicochemical processes reichardt and timm 2020 water is crucial in plants to allow photosynthesis turgidity cell elongation vegetative growth and nutrient availability kirkham 2005 reichardt and timm 2020 taiz and zeiger 2002 soil water management within the comfort zone allows potatoes to avoid water stress and physiological process reduction such as photosynthesis total biomass and chlorophyll content diminution dalla costa et al 1997 liu et al 2005 rolando et al 2015 thus irrigation management according to the comfort zone limits soil water excesses and high water fluxes which could lead to an increase in nitrate leaching in tile drains matteau et al 2019 downstream soluble reactive phosphorus concentration strohmenger et al 2020 and dissolved organic carbon concentration strohmenger et al 2020 therefore the comfort zone based irrigation management in potato cultivation could potentially limit water pollution involving agricultural nutrients as observed in this experiment where no leaching was observed under smpts higher than 7kpa the marketable yield under a smpt drier than 30kpa was higher than that under a smpt drier than 7kpa the time spent in the comfort zone partially explains this finding as under a threshold drier than 30kpa a greater proportion of the season was spent between 10 and 24kpa during the drying cycle moreover potato crops are known to develop physiological adjustment thereby improving their water restriction tolerance after early season water shortages yactayo et al 2013 it is further accepted that anoxic conditions could limit plant productivity bulot et al 2016 périard et al 2016 the optimal smpt is 24kpa which is the limit of the comfort zone as this smpt value generates both a higher yield and the highest wp comparing the limits of the comfort zone i e 24kpa and 10kpa an estimated water use reduction of approximately 47 was observed to achieve a similar yield these results are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that an smp of 25kpa can sustain optimal water uptake conditions and the highest yield in potato cultivation gumiere et al 2019 wang et al 2007 in this study the daily mean smp data were considered a spectrum in pls analysis to identify critical periods determining the marketable potato yield the results suggest that the importance of the pls component does not depend on the irrigation volume or the irrigation frequency one critical period was identified with the pls model corresponding to the stage with the highest pls component importance occurring at the potato leaf expansion physiological stage similarly the linear mixed model identified a critical period which corresponded to the potato leaf expansion stage this model further identified a second critical period corresponding to the tuber initiation stage the yield distribution with the smpt in the tuber initiation stage remained more stable than did the yield associated with the smp measured in the leaf expansion stage the quadratic repartition of the marketable potato yield with the smpt measured at the leaf expansion stage was similar to the distribution of the marketable yield with the smpt throughout the growing season observation of the marketable tuber yield at the three physiological stages indicated that in this study the smpt effect began at the leaf expansion stage and was maintained beyond the tuber initiation stage leaf expansion and tuber initiation are two critical steps in potato growth limiting the water availability at the leaf expansion stage could restrict plant development limit stolon initiation and inhibit root growth obidiegwu et al 2015 thereby curbing the potato plant ability to access soil nutrients and soil water and maintain its physiological processes allowing efficient tuber formation tuber initiation is commonly acknowledged as a critical period for potato crops especially regarding irrigation as up to 40 of the water uptake could occur at the tuber initiation stage darwish et al 2006 water stress occurring at the tuber initiation stage could limit the yield quality and tuber number king et al 2020 landry et al 2014 obidiegwu et al 2015 matteau et al 2021a 2021b determined that the pls algorithm could provide crucial insights into the critical stage of the potato plant water demand this assumption was confirmed by linear mixed model analysis which corroborated and detailed the pls results therefore the pls model is a suitable tool to evaluate smp effects on the yield the results further suggested that with a larger dataset pls analysis with the smp as a spectrum could be implemented to predict the potato yield in this study the goldrush variety comfort zone effect remained the same across all tuber dimensions no evidence of tuber number or tuber size decrease was found even considering only the smp values at specific physiological stages in contrast to the effect of water shortages reported by other researchers landry et al 2014 obidiegwu et al 2015 this absence of smpt effects indicates that none of the thresholds applied in the experiments in this paper created notable short term water shortage conditions to significantly impact the tuber number for the goldrush potato variety this study was conducted in a greenhouse to optimize the precision of the irrigation system management measures and smp sensor network to precisely evaluate the effect of the smpt also greenhouse experiments in containers can limit the data variability lahlou and ledent 2005 for this study the size of the container has been carefully chosen to allow 40cm of root depth where most potato roots grow wang et al 2007 and where 90 of the water is consumed darwish et al 2006 open field irrigation management field and design specific conditions may lead to spatial variability and soil or irrigation limitations which may require adaption of the optimal comfort zone determined in this study the soil used in this study was a sandy soil extracted from the field of a potato producer and is representative of potato production in eastern canada although potatoes are grown on various soil types the use of smpt allows for the comfort zone established in this study to be used as a knowledge base for other soil types because smp based thresholds established for a specific crop could be used across several soil types iersel et al 2013 additionally compared with outdoor grown crops greenhouse crops evapotranspiration is reduced due to reduced evaporative demand caused by a decrease in solar radiation fernández et al 2010 shading screens and shorter daylight due to late autumn or early spring culture can also cause solar radiation decreases therefore the open field increased evaporative demand could change the time between irrigation and the effect of the time spent within the optimal comfort zone the open field wp could also be lowered following the lowest evaporative demand and higher yield in greenhouses gallardo et al 2013 or more severe effect of water stress in the field ramirez et al 2014 singh et al 2021 however despite a lower magnitude of open field wp gain from irrigation management the change in wp tends to follow a similar pattern under both greenhouse and open field conditions singh et al 2021 5 conclusion in this study the optimal comfort zone for potato crops based on the smp was identified between 10 and 24kpa a precision irrigation design triggered by a tensiometer sensor network was employed to manage irrigation and obtain an accurate representation of the smp the optimal smpt combining the yield and wp was 24kpa the observed potato plants exhibited a better adaptatability to a moderate water stress than to an excessive water input the temporalization results demonstrated that optimal water management considering the potato smp based comfort zone should be initiated as early as the leaf expansion stage and should be maintained throughout the growing season therefore the data provided in this study suggest that the potato yield is mainly determined by the soil matric potential threshold future work should focus on the impact of the soil type on the comfort zone which could allow field integration across various environments and locations future research should adopt the same temporalization method with the smpt value specific to each physiological stage to adjust the optimal smpt throughout the growing season funding this

9628,an accurate in field estimate of soil moisture content smc is critical for precision irrigation management current ground methods to measure smc were limited by the disadvantages of small scale monitoring and high cost the development of unmanned aerial vehicle uav platforms now provides a cost effective means for measuring smc on a large scale however previous studies have considered only single sensor estimates of smc so the combination of multiple sensors has yet to be thoroughly discussed additionally the way in which soil depth canopy coverage and crop cultivars affect the smc estimation accuracy remains unclear therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the smc estimation accuracy provided by multimodal data fusion and four machine learning algorithms partial least squares regression k nearest neighbor random forest regression rfr and backpropagation neural network bpnn 2 discuss the accuracy of the remote sensing approach for estimating smc at different soil depths and 3 explore how canopy coverage and crop cultivars affect the accuracy of smc estimation the following results were obtained 1 data from multispectral sensors provided the most accurate smc estimates regardless of which of the four machine learning algorithms was used 2 multimodal data fusion improved the smc estimation accuracy especially when combining multispectral and thermal data 3 the rfr algorithm provided more accurate smc estimates than the other three algorithms with the highest accuracy obtained by combining data from rgb multispectral and thermal sensors with an r 2 0 78 0 78 and a relative root mean square error of 11 2 9 6 for 10 cm deep 20 cm deep soil 4 uav based smc estimation methods provided similar stable performance for smc estimates at various depths and even yielded smaller relative error for deeper estimates 20 cm 5 the rfr and bpnn machine learning algorithms both provided relatively accurate smc estimates for modest canopy coverage 0 2 0 4 but relatively poor estimates for higher 0 4 or lower 0 2 canopy coverage 6 the smc estimation accuracy for different maize cultivars jnk728 and zd958 did not differ significantly p 0 01 these results indicate that uav based multimodal data fusion combined with machine learning algorithms can provide relatively accurate and repeatable smc estimates this approach can thus be used to monitor smc and design precision irrigation systems keywords remote sensing soil moisture multimodality data fusion uav based 1 introduction soil moisture content smc is a critical indicator of the surface water cycle seneviratne et al 2010 and is the key factor for determining crop growth because it provides information on the water available to crop roots luo et al 2019 mccoll et al 2017 accurate smc estimation can provide a reliable reference for precision irrigation management cheng et al 2020 gago et al 2015 current ground methods to measure smc e g gravimetric measurements involving weighing soil samples before and after drying robinson et al 2008 time domain reflectometry tdr which is an indirect measurement method that exploits the dependence of soil dielectric permittivity on smc robinson et al 2003 neutron measurements that use radioactive elements as neutron sources hollinger and isard 1994 active heated distributed temperature sensing dts agliata et al 2019 gps interferometric reflectometry larson 2016 and cosmic ray soil moisture sensors cosmos evans et al 2016 are limited by the disadvantages of small scale monitoring and high cost therefore developing a more efficient and scalable smc measurement method is highly desirable for in field monitoring of smc currently remote sensing technology is used for in field smc estimates with high temporal and spatial resolutions blatchford et al 2019 the use of remote sensing for large scale estimates of smc is increasing because it provides a more cost effective method than ground measurements sadras et al 2015 the smc retrieval model is based on remote sensing smc estimates produced by fitting the linear or nonlinear relationship between in situ measured smc and smc determined from remote sensing data mulder et al 2011 or by using physical model such as radiative transfer models sadeghi 2018 remote sensing data can be divided into three types optical thermal i e infrared and microwave optical remote sensing mainly includes the visible and near infrared bands which contain reflectance data from the land surface as well as solar short wave radiation which reveals the spectral properties of soil as a function of smc serrano et al 2019 several vegetation indices e g the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the anomalous vegetation index avi and the vegetation condition index vci have been widely used to estimate smc kogan 1990 remote sensing in the thermal range detects the various thermodynamic characteristics of soil with different water content sohrabinia et al 2014 to estimate smc optical and thermal remote sensing data have been increasingly fused for example to characterized soil moisture status toby et al 1994 proposed the vegetation supply water index vswi which is calculated based on the ndvi and surface temperature moreover sandholt et al 2002 proposed the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi which fits the dry edge and wet edge of the ndvi and surface temperature and is now widely used to estimate smc microwave remote sensing has also been increasingly applied to estimate smc because microwaves can penetrate deeply into the soil so that this technique can probe the dielectric properties of the soil dong et al 2020 several smc data products are generated via microwave remote sensing and are widely used such as smos kerr et al 2010 amsr e karthikeyan et al 2019 and smap mao et al 2020 however this dataset is discontinuous and incomplete for dense vegetation coverage seneviratne et al 2010 over the past decades numerous studies have investigated how to use remote sensing data in the field to estimate smc unfortunately the coarse pixel resolution of satellite remote sensing e g landsat 30 m sentinel 10 60 m and modis 250 1000 m may be inappropriate for small area applications such as evaluating field smc and irrigation management in vineyards moreover satellites cannot provide sufficient optical and thermal images because of weather conditions and fixed revisit times wang et al 2018a the development of advanced unmanned aerial vehicle uav technology which offers higher resolution imagery presents unprecedented potential for estimating field smc and thereby improving our understanding of field scaling li et al 2013 moreover the flight patterns and schedules of uav flight campaigns can be fine tuned for specific fields as can the sensor s carry by uavs several studies have already demonstrated the feasibility of smc estimation by uav remote sensing such as luo et al 2019 who combined landsat 8 optical and infrared bands and uav based digital elevation model dem to estimate the smc of a karst mountainous catchment in southwest china via a linear regression method and obtained results with 7 6 root mean square error rmse ge et al 2019 combined uav based hyperspectral imagery and machine learning to estimate the field smc in xinjiang china and obtained results with r 2 0 91 in general uav based optical sensing rgb multispectral hyperspectral has become the primary method for current research into smc monitoring hassan esfahani et al 2015 2014 lu et al 2020 sona et al 2016 uav based microwave sensors have also been used for smc monitoring acevo herrera et al 2009 2010 however because microwaves penetrate little into vegetation the use of microwave remote sensing to monitor soil information may provide results inferior to those of optical sensors or thermal infrared sensors which can provide indirect measurements of vegetation status even for dense vegetation wigneron et al 2007 for example in a dense maize field with tall plants 3 m although the thermodynamic characteristics of soil depend strongly on moisture sohrabinia et al 2014 few studies have investigated uav based thermal infrared remote or direct sensing of surface temperature or indirect sensing through the canopy temperature in particular although satellite remote sensing of vegetation characteristics in both the thermal infrared and optical bands has been demonstrated this approach has not been widely studied for uavs amani et al 2017 dong and crow 2018 moreover the amount of remote sensing data collected depends on the vegetation coverage and plant height and few studies have evaluated the performance of remote sensing under different environmental conditions finally previous studies have used single sensors to estimate smc whereas the use of multiple sensors for smc estimation has not been investigated due to poor penetrability into soil optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not be able to capture the soil status in conditions of dense vegetation coverage therefore the smc has generally been estimated based on the vegetation status e g leaves curl in conditions of low soil moisture chandel et al 2020 although vegetation status correlates somewhat with smc these correlations may be nonlinear a situation that lends itself to the use of machine learning algorithms which are well suited for dealing with nonlinear heteroscedasticity problems and can be used for intelligent data processing and complete mining of data value jacinta and kerrie 2018 jin et al 2017 machine learning algorithms are already widely used to analyze agricultural remote sensing data with excellent results for example maimaitijiang et al 2020 used a machine learning algorithm to predict soybean yield based on remote sensing data jin et al 2020 applied a deep neural network to estimate maize biomass and ge et al 2019 used a machine learning algorithm to monitor smc and all obtained accurate results however although several studies estimated smc using machine learning ge et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the ways in which canopy coverage soil depth and crop cultivars affect smc monitoring remain unclear the present study uses uav remote sensing to acquire rgb multispectral and thermal data of the smc of a maize field and applies four machine learning algorithms to estimate smc at different soil depths the main goals of this study are to 1 compare the accuracy of smc estimates obtained from multimodal data analyzed by machine learning algorithms 2 explore how smc estimation varies with soil depth and 3 analyze how canopy coverage and crop cultivars affect the accuracy of smc estimates 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and setup the experimental site is located at the xinxiang experimental base of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences in henan province xeb caas china with latitude 35 10 n

is 2398 8 h the experimental site was planted with maize and divided into 25 plots varying in size from 9 6 m 9 6 to 9 6 m 26 6 m as shown in fig 1 fifteen nitrogen treatments denoted n1 n15 were applied to the 25 plots to produce variations in maize growth status two maize cultivars jnk728 and zd958 were planted with a sowing date in june 2020 and a harvest date in november 2020 the row and plant spacings were 60 and 23 cm respectively the soil texture is loam with a field capacity of 35 volumetric water content drip irrigation with fertilization was applied uniformly over the 25 plots 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 uav data collection concurrent acquisition of remote sensing data from multiple uav based sensors allows the fusion of data to improve the monitoring of field crops maimaitijiang et al 2020 for this study an integrated thermal rgb camera flir duo pro r 640 flir systems inc boston massachusetts usa and a multispectral camera micasense rededge mx leptron unmanned aircraft systems inc denver colorado usa were mounted on an uav dji m600 pro dji technology co shenzhen guangdong china as shown in fig 2a and b the multispectral camera could capture five spectral bands blue green red red edge and near infrared the details of each camera lens are given in table 1 a total of five uav flight campaigns were conducted over the maize field on 17 23 and 29 august and 21and 26 september 2020 for the five campaigns the flight height and speed were 30 m and 2 1 m s with a side overlap of 80 and a front overlap of 90 the details of the flight campaign are given in table 2 for each flight to calibrate the multispectral camera we used the asd fieldspec handheld 2 analytical spectral devices inc boulder usa to measure the reflectance from six tarpaulins of various colors green blue red black white and gray laying on the field surface fig 2c to calibrate the thermal camera we imaged four blackboards whose temperature was measured by using a wireless temperature sensor wg78 rfinchina inc shenyang liaoning china ten ground control points were fixed on the field surface to geo reference the remote sensing images acquired by the multiple uav based sensors 2 2 2 collection of field data a portable tdr probe fieldscout tdr 350 soil moisture meter spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa was used to measure the smc in terms of volumetric water content at soil depths of 10 and 20 cm fig 3a a total of 25 measurements was acquired one in each plot at the points shown in fig 1 to ensure accurate measurements eight measurements were made around a given plant as shown in fig 3b and c the mean of the eight measurements gives the in situ measured smc for the given plot the in situ smc measurements were made after the uav flight campaign for the given plot table 2 gives the in situ measured smc for each uav flight campaign the correlation coefficient r 0 49 was obtained between smc measurements at 10 and 20 cm depth see fig 4 which indicates no significant correlation p 0 01 3 methods 3 1 image preprocessing we used agisoft photoscan software version 1 5 5 agisoft llc st petersburg russia to mosaic and orthorectify the uav based rgb thermal and multispectral images and arcgis software version 10 4 environmental systems research institute inc redlands ca usa for the geographic calibration of the images based on the 10 ground control points the multispectral images were radiometrically calibrated based on the reflectance of the six colored tarpaulins captured by asd fig 2c during the uav flight wang et al 2019 exponential logarithmic quadratic and power functions were used to fit the relation between tarpaulin reflectance and tarpaulin digital number dn extracted from the multispectral images by envi software version 5 5 exelis visual information solutions inc usa the optimal function was then used to calibrate the five band multispectral images fig 5 maimaitijiang et al 2017 the exponential function fit best in bands 1 blue and 5 near infrared with r 2 varying from 0 890 to 0 945 and from 0 971 to 0 992 respectively the quadratic function fits best in band 2 green with r 2 varying from 0 959 to 0 995 the power law function fits best in bands 3 red and 4 red edge with r 2 varying from 0 918 to 0 957 and from 0 970 to 0 999 respectively during each flight campaign the wireless temperature sensors recorded the actual temperature of the blackboards every 30 s before the thermal images were mosaiced the blackboard dns were extracted from each image by envi and the actual temperature versus dn was fit to a linear function as shown in fig 6 maimaitijiang et al 2020 which gives r 2 0 94 indicating a strong correlation the fit was then used to calibrate the temperature of the thermal images 3 2 multimodal data extraction 3 2 1 rgb image data canopy coverage cc which is calculated as the percent of vegetation area per ground surface area was extracted from the rgb images to serve as an indicator of maize growth status we used the threshold segmentation method to exclude background soil and weeds from rgb images and extract maize canopy please refer to castillo martínez et al 2020 for details of this method classified maize pixels in each plot sampled were divided by the total number of pixels to calculate the cc 1 c c p m a i z e p t o t a l where p maize is the number of maize canopy pixels in the sampled plot and p total is the total number of pixels in the sampled plot in addition maize canopy texture features were extracted from rgb blue green and red bands and served as input for estimating smc to estimate smc we used the gray level co occurrence matrix glcm which is commonly used to extract texture feature information from uav based images haralick et al 1973 eight features containing glcm based texture information were extracted including variance va contrast co entropy en correlation cor mean me homogeneity ho dissimilarity ds and second moment sm the envi software was used for glcm processing for details of this procedure please refer to the study of nichol and sarker 2011 3 2 2 multispectral image data the radiometrically calibrated multispectral images were used to calculate a set of vegetation indices to estimate smc according to the studies listed in table 3 moreover texture features from multispectral based red edge and near infrared bands were extracted by using the same methods as used for extracting rgb based texture data in section 3 2 1 3 2 3 thermal image data the normalized relative canopy temperature nrct was calculated from calibrated uav based thermal images schmidhalter et al 2015 the nrct is widely used to evaluate crop water status elsayed et al 2017 rischbeck et al 2016 the formula for nrct is 2 n r c t t i t min t max t min where t i is the remotely sensed temperature of pixel i t min t max is the lowest highest remotely sensed temperature in the whole field sandholt et al 2002 proposed the water stress indicator which uses the simplified surface temperature vegetation index ts ndvi space method called the temperature vegetation drought index or tvdi this method uses the maximum surface temperature to fit the ndvi at the dry edge eq 3 and the minimum surface temperature to fit the ndvi at the wet edge eq 4 as shown in fig 7 the wet edge dry edge and vertical axis ndvi 0 form a triangle that defines the ts ndvi space theoretically the wet edge is horizontal and parallel to the ndvi axis and the dry edge which represents zero evapotranspiration in the field intersects the ndvi axis and the t s axis finally the tvdi is calculated as per eq 5 3 t s max a n d v i b 4 t s min c n d v i d 5 t v d i t s i t s min t s max t s min where a d are the estimated parameters of the wet and dry edges the tvdi is widely used to characterize the crop water status and smc bai et al 2017 du et al 2017 additionally the texture features of thermal based nrct were extracted by using the same method as used for extracting rgb and multispectral based texture features see sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 table 3 shows the input variables 3 3 calibration and validation of soil moisture estimates 3 3 1 modeling methods all input variables in table 3 were extracted from the 25 experimental plots figs 1 and 3c as a mask layer and then matched to the in situ measured smc of each plot altogether 125 samples were collected during the five days of uav flight campaigns these are used for training and verification of the model developed herein smc was estimated by using four machine learning algorithms partial least squares regression plsr krishna et al 2019 k nearest neighbor knn mcroberts and tomppo 2007 random forest regression rfr maimaitijiang et al 2020 and backpropagation neural network bpnn wang et al 2018b these machine learning algorithms have been widely used for inverting remote sensing data feng et al 2020 lu et al 2020 maimaitijiang et al 2020 moreover to ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison of these four machine learning methods with their given input variables we used 80 of the samples and in situ smc measurements selected at random for training the machine learning methods and the remaining 20 to determine the accuracy of the smc estimates produced by these methods 3 3 2 validation methods a fivefold cross validation was used to verify the accuracy of the smc estimation algorithms it means that the 125 samples were divided into five parts e g n1 n5 and n1 n4 were used for training model and n5 was used for model validation in first time n1 n3 and n5 were used for training model and n4 was used for model validation in second time and the process was repeated for five times so there were 125 samples independently used for model validation and the final average accuracy was obtained additionally three indicators root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 were computed to quantify the model performance these three indicators are calculated as follows jin et al 2020 6 r 2 1 1 i 1 n s m c m i s m c m 2 i 1 n s m c o b i s m c o b 2 n 1 n m 1 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s m c m i s m c o b i 2 8 r r m s e r m s e s m c o b 100 where smc mi and smc obi are the estimated smc and in situ measured smc respectively n 125 is the number of samples and m 1 is the number of variables fig 8 shows the overall workflow of the preprocessing feature extraction and model building with multimodal data the key of the model is the extraction of the input features and the use of machine learning algorithms as shown in the red dashed box of the fig 8 the different features were extracted from the three types of sensors e g canopy coverage glcm and spectral indices then a total of four machine learning methods with the above features as input were given in the green dash box finally the 125 measured smc samples was used for model training and validation with a fivefold cross validation 4 results and discussion 4 1 modeling and validation of soil moisture content the four machine learning algorithms plsr knn rfr and bpnn were used to estimate smc based on the features extracted from multimodal uav remote sensing data rgb multispectral and thermal in addition different combinations of sensors were tested as listed in table 4 in general of the four machine learning methods rfr provides the most accurate estimates additionally of the seven combinations of multimodal data the joint use of rgb multispectral and thermal data provides the most accurate estimates of smc 4 1 1 contributions of different sensor data independent of modeling algorithm expect for knn remotely sensed data from the multispectral sensor provide the most accurate estimates of smc with r 2 0 17 0 69 for 10 cm soil depth and 0 10 0 68 for 20 cm soil depth the next best results were obtained from the thermal sensor which gives r 2 0 11 0 61 for 10 cm soil depth and 0 07 0 68 for 20 cm soil depth table 4 as shown in numerous studies vegetation indices computed from data acquired with uav based multispectral or hyperspectral sensors have become the most popular indicators for estimating smc casamitjana et al 2020 ge et al 2019 lu et al 2020 thermal sensors and multi sensor combinations have seen slightly less use yet provide comparable accuracy for smc estimates in addition multispectral data may prove to be complementary to thermal and rgb data for estimating smc for example temperature data from thermal imagery may be used to overcome the asymptotic saturation of multispectral or hyperspectral data maimaitijiang et al 2017 2020 fig 9 shows r 2 and the rrmse of smc estimated based on various multimodal data combinations these estimates are more accurate than those obtained using data from a single sensor for example for 10 cm deep smc estimated from thermal and multispectral data via the plsr algorithm r 2 0 55 which is the lowest r 2 except for multispectral data r 2 0 38 in other algorithms the joint use of thermal data provides smc estimates that are more accurate than when using only multispectral data however compared with smc estimates from thermal and multispectral data the smc estimation accuracy increases very little when combining rgb data for example for single sensor multispectral and thermal 10 cm deep smc estimation using the rfr algorithm r 2 increases only by 0 06 and 0 07 respectively upon combining rgb data this result may be due to information redundancy and homogeneity between multispectral and rgb data maimaitijiang et al 2017 pelizari et al 2018 in general the combined use of the three sensors rgb multispectral and thermal produces more accurate smc estimates than any other combination of sensors however the improvement in accuracy is minimal compared with the estimation accuracy obtained using just the multispectral and thermal sensors figs 10 and 11 shows smc estimates obtained by applying the rfr algorithm to various combinations of remote sensing data as expected from the comparable rrmse and r 2 we obtain similar scatterplots of modeled smc versus in situ measured smc moreover the smc is overestimated in the low smc region and underestimated in the high smc region if we consider the points encircled in red in figs 10 and 11 i e 10 cm deep smc estimates the underestimation is more obvious in fig 10a d which use rgb and or multispectral data this result is attributed to saturation of the optical sensor which has been reported in studies of leaf area index crop yield etc becker reshef et al 2010 maimaitijiang et al 2020 omar et al 2016 thus this issue remains a problem however in this study the use of thermal data leads to better 10 cm deep smc estimates than the rgb and or multispectral data i e less underestimation see fig 10b additionally multi sensors that combine the thermal sensor with other sensors fig 10e g are also outperformed to some extent by the thermal sensor alone the temperature recorded by the thermal sensor is not affected by the high density vegetation canopy coverage which causes saturation of the optical sensor baluja et al 2012 hoffmann et al 2016 to overcome this saturation problem several studies have proposed using canopy texture features e g glcm data as unique and complementary data maimaitijiang et al 2020 rischbeck et al 2016 however as shown in fig 10a b and d any such gains are limited in the present study the crop growth is affected by soil moisture cheng et al 2021 thus the remote sensing model of smc estimation is indirectly estimate smc through the crop status such as texture temperature and spectral information cheng et al 2022 however most machine learning based remote sensing model generally lack a certain theoretical mechanism maimaitijiang et al 2020 it should be noted that not only smc can affect the crop status the other factors such as nitrogen also affect the crop canopy coverage thus more features were necessary to effectively eliminate the influence of other factors cheng et al 2022 in this study multiple water related features 70 at most extracted from the three sensors were used for smc estimation such as canopy coverage temperature which finally resulted in a good performance however the model still had certain errors with rrmse reached 11 2 9 6 for 10 cm deep 20 cm deep smc moreover figs 10 and 11 showed that overestimation for dry conditions low smc and underestimation for wet conditions high smc of this model which may be contributed by lack of some features moreover spectral saturation issue may also cause the overestimation for dry conditions the results in this study showed that with input features increased this issue has been alleviated figs 10 and 11 in general higher accuracy requirements need more information extracted from more sensors e g plant height from lidar ten harkel et al 2020 chlorophyll fluorescence from fluorometer wang et al 2021 zarco tejada et al 2012 4 1 2 performance of different regression models as stated above rfr provides more accurate smc estimates than the three other machine learning methods in both single sensor and multi sensor situations and for both 10 and 20 cm deep smc estimates table 4 and fig 9 for the former r 2 varies from 0 59 to 0 78 and rrmse varies from 11 15 to 15 37 whereas for the latter r2 varies from 0 59 to 0 78 and rrmse varies from 9 63 to 13 29 the next best estimates of smc are provided by the bpnn algorithm r 2 0 12 0 72 and rrmse 12 06 22 49 for 10 cm deep smc estimation and r2 0 30 0 70 and rrmse 11 29 17 24 for 20 cm deep smc estimation the knn algorithm produces the least accurate smc estimates in both 10 and 20 cm deep cases which is likely because the knn algorithm depends strongly on training data and the in situ smc data were not sufficiently accurate given the uncertainty in field measurements moreover the knn algorithm is more suitable for classification applications than for regression applications nugrahaeni and mutijarsa 2017 the plsr algorithm provides slightly more accurate estimates than the knn algorithm fig 9 shows that the accuracy of smc estimates by the plsr algorithm clearly improves as the number of input data sources increases as indicated in previous studies the plsr algorithm can solve the problem of multiple linear regression with multiple independent variables because the principal component analysis during the preprocessing stage of plsr reduces the correlation between input variables kim et al 2020 however the plsr algorithm cannot characterize the nonlinear relationship between multi variables nawar et al 2014 although the rfr algorithm provides more accurate smc estimates than the bpnn algorithm the difference in accuracy is not significant when using multi sensor data as shown in fig 9 in general the number of variables input into the bpnn algorithm affects its estimation accuracy which explains why smc estimates by the bpnn algorithm were significantly less accurate when using as input sensor data with fewer variables or less explanatory variables he et al 2020 in contrast smc estimates by the rfr algorithm remain accurate even as the number of input variables varies as indicated in previous studies the rfr algorithm is robust against noise in training data belgiu and dragut 2016 hu et al 2018 additionally fewer samples have the smc underestimated by the rfr algorithm than by the other algorithms fig 12 these results suggest that the rfr algorithm provides more stable and accurate smc estimates when fed multimodal data although machine learning algorithms directly embody the relationship between variables in the algorithm they cannot generate analytical formulas which may make it more difficult to interpret the model cheng and titterington 1994 4 2 accuracy of estimates of soil moisture content as a function of soil depth the smc must be estimated at different soil depths to understand how the root water uptake layer varies with the growth stage as shown in fig 4 the smc measured in situ in the field at 10 and 20 cm depth are insignificantly correlated p 0 01 which indicates that the 10 and 20 cm deep smc estimates are relatively independent fig 13 shows the accuracy of the algorithms for different soil depths at 10 cm the smc estimates have r 2 0 03 0 78 with a mean value of 0 44 for 20 cm depth r 2 0 05 0 78 with a mean value of 0 44 and the difference is not significant p 0 01 thus the uav based smc estimates have similar accuracy at the different depths the rmse rrmse for the 20 cm deep smc estimates has a mean value of 3 4 15 1 which is less greater than the corresponding value of 3 2 17 4 for 10 cm deep smc estimates the difference in rmse is again not significant p 0 01 but the rrmse for 10 cm deep smc estimates is significantly greater than that at 20 cm depth p 0 01 this result is attributed to the greater smc at 20 cm depth measured in the field table 2 and fig 4 as noted in table 4 the rfr algorithm with input from the three sensors rgb multispectral and thermal produces the most accurate smc estimates at both 10 and 20 cm depth with r 2 0 78 in both cases in contrast the plsr knn algorithm produces the least accurate 10 cm deep 20 cm deep smc estimates when fed rgb data with r 2 0 03 0 05 this shows that smc estimation methods based on uav remote sensing data can produce significantly different relative errors compared with optical detection the microwave band is less used for smc estimation because it penetrates the vegetation its penetration depth is generally tens of centimeters which exceeds that of an optical sensor otosaka et al 2020 in addition the smc estimation accuracy is greater in the microwave band acevo herrera et al 2009 2010 be that as it may the accuracy may be limited when faced with high vegetation coverage such as maize which can reach 3 m in height therefore optical sensors may provide better results by estimating smc indirectly furthermore the maize root depth varies with growth stage and can reach approximately 90 cm cucci et al 2019 thus estimating smc at greater depths is necessary the methods proposed herein may be used for deeper smc estimation which should be a topic of future study 4 3 comparison of smc estimation accuracy for different canopy coverage because microwaves directly detect soil characteristics the cc could affect smc estimates based on microwave radiation acevo herrera et al 2010 in this study the maize cc varies from 0 1 to 0 5 which we divide into four levels as shown in table 5 the rfr algorithm produces the most accurate smc estimates for all four levels of cc with r 2 0 73 0 86 0 73 0 82 for 10 20 cm depth in contrast knn produces the least accurate smc estimates for all cc levels these results further testify to the robustness of the rfr algorithm for smc estimation moreover all machine learning algorithms produce relatively accurate smc estimates for intermediate cc levels cc from 0 2 to 0 4 and relatively inaccurate smc estimates for higher cc levels cc over 0 4 or lower cc levels cc less than 0 2 in the study of smc estimation using optical sensor based methods the canopy status including vegetation index and canopy temperature were used to indirectly obtain information on smc however this information comes mostly from soil under low cc which may increase the estimation error of the model in contrast a higher cc may result in saturation of the optical sensors hoffmann et al 2016 rischbeck et al 2016 and thereby produce smc estimates of relatively low accuracy note however that the rfr algorithm still produces high accuracy smc estimates with r 2 0 73 even with excessive or insufficient cc in conclusion optical sensor based methods of smc estimation are reliable under various levels of cc 4 4 comparison of smc estimation accuracy for the two cultivars we now discuss the smc estimation accuracy for the two different maize cultivars as shown in table 6 the rfr produces the most accurate smc estimates for both maize cultivars with r 2 0 78 with insignificant difference appearing between the two depths 10 and 20 cm p 0 01 as reported in previous studies although the phenotyping of various maize cultivars differs uav based high throughput plant phenotyping produces accurate and repeatable measurements of crop yield leaf area index etc li et al 2014 maimaitijiang et al 2020 the present results indicate that the same holds true for smc estimates 4 5 spatial distribution of soil moisture content in the field fig 14 shows the smc distribution in the experimental field computed using the rfr algorithm with combined rgb thermal and multispectral data as input the smc patterns for the two cultivars are similar for example from 17 august to 23 august the 10 cm deep 20 cm deep smc for jnk728 decreases increases by 1 1 1 6 and the 10 cm deep 20 cm deep smc of zd958 decreases increases by 1 0 1 9 however there were greater smc difference among the various nitrogen levels sections 4 2 4 4 show that the smc estimation model may be used with different ccs and cultivars so this model based smc map can be used to design irrigation regimes compared with the original irrigation regime this method showed is more reasonable and adaptable because it calculates irrigation amount based on the smc of each plot cheng et al 2020 moreover the proposed rfr plus multi sensor input method was used to detect crop water consumption by monitoring variations in smc in general the method can be used to characterize the spatial distribution of the smc which provides a reference for precision irrigation and precision agriculture wang et al 2019 5 conclusions this study investigates the combined use of rgb multispectral and thermal infrared remote sensing data as input for various machine learning algorithms to estimate smc the four main conclusions are as follows 1 multispectral remote sensing data produce more accurate smc estimates than rgb or thermal remote sensing data however combining thermal remote sensing data with multispectral data improves the smc estimation accuracy in contrast the addition of rgb remote sensing data produces minimal further improvement in smc estimation accuracy 2 fused multimodal data produce more accurate smc estimates than is possible with single sensor data regardless of which machine learning algorithm is used in general the joint use of the three types of sensors produces the most accurate smc estimates followed by the combined use of multispectral and thermal data 3 the rfr algorithm produces the most accurate smc estimates of the four machine learning algorithms followed by the bpnn algorithm the difference in accuracy between the two algorithms is greater when using single sensor data than when using multimodal data i e data from the three sensors moreover when given various input variables the rfr algorithm produces more repeatable results than do the other three algorithms in contrast the knn algorithm produces the least accurate smc estimates 4 the proposed method to estimate smc produces similar results at the two soil depths tested 10 and 20 cm the relative root mean square error of the estimated smc is even lower at greater soil depth which indicates that this approach may potentially be used for deeper estimates of smc furthermore the four machine learning algorithms plsr knn rfr and bpnn both perform well for modest cc 0 2 0 4 however they produce less accurate although still acceptable for rfr smc estimates under higher 0 4 and lower 0 2 cc no significant difference appears in smc estimation accuracy between the two maize cultivars jnk728 and zd958 we thus conclude that using uav based remote sensing data as input for machine learning algorithms is a promising approach to obtain accurate estimates of smc the results reported herein reflect the significant potential of uav remote sensing based smc estimation when machine learning algorithms are combined with fused multimodal data the smc estimation method proposed herein provides the foundation of an efficient approach for monitoring soil moisture and designing precision irrigation regimes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9628,an accurate in field estimate of soil moisture content smc is critical for precision irrigation management current ground methods to measure smc were limited by the disadvantages of small scale monitoring and high cost the development of unmanned aerial vehicle uav platforms now provides a cost effective means for measuring smc on a large scale however previous studies have considered only single sensor estimates of smc so the combination of multiple sensors has yet to be thoroughly discussed additionally the way in which soil depth canopy coverage and crop cultivars affect the smc estimation accuracy remains unclear therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the smc estimation accuracy provided by multimodal data fusion and four machine learning algorithms partial least squares regression k nearest neighbor random forest regression rfr and backpropagation neural network bpnn 2 discuss the accuracy of the remote sensing approach for estimating smc at different soil depths and 3 explore how canopy coverage and crop cultivars affect the accuracy of smc estimation the following results were obtained 1 data from multispectral sensors provided the most accurate smc estimates regardless of which of the four machine learning algorithms was used 2 multimodal data fusion improved the smc estimation accuracy especially when combining multispectral and thermal data 3 the rfr algorithm provided more accurate smc estimates than the other three algorithms with the highest accuracy obtained by combining data from rgb multispectral and thermal sensors with an r 2 0 78 0 78 and a relative root mean square error of 11 2 9 6 for 10 cm deep 20 cm deep soil 4 uav based smc estimation methods provided similar stable performance for smc estimates at various depths and even yielded smaller relative error for deeper estimates 20 cm 5 the rfr and bpnn machine learning algorithms both provided relatively accurate smc estimates for modest canopy coverage 0 2 0 4 but relatively poor estimates for higher 0 4 or lower 0 2 canopy coverage 6 the smc estimation accuracy for different maize cultivars jnk728 and zd958 did not differ significantly p 0 01 these results indicate that uav based multimodal data fusion combined with machine learning algorithms can provide relatively accurate and repeatable smc estimates this approach can thus be used to monitor smc and design precision irrigation systems keywords remote sensing soil moisture multimodality data fusion uav based 1 introduction soil moisture content smc is a critical indicator of the surface water cycle seneviratne et al 2010 and is the key factor for determining crop growth because it provides information on the water available to crop roots luo et al 2019 mccoll et al 2017 accurate smc estimation can provide a reliable reference for precision irrigation management cheng et al 2020 gago et al 2015 current ground methods to measure smc e g gravimetric measurements involving weighing soil samples before and after drying robinson et al 2008 time domain reflectometry tdr which is an indirect measurement method that exploits the dependence of soil dielectric permittivity on smc robinson et al 2003 neutron measurements that use radioactive elements as neutron sources hollinger and isard 1994 active heated distributed temperature sensing dts agliata et al 2019 gps interferometric reflectometry larson 2016 and cosmic ray soil moisture sensors cosmos evans et al 2016 are limited by the disadvantages of small scale monitoring and high cost therefore developing a more efficient and scalable smc measurement method is highly desirable for in field monitoring of smc currently remote sensing technology is used for in field smc estimates with high temporal and spatial resolutions blatchford et al 2019 the use of remote sensing for large scale estimates of smc is increasing because it provides a more cost effective method than ground measurements sadras et al 2015 the smc retrieval model is based on remote sensing smc estimates produced by fitting the linear or nonlinear relationship between in situ measured smc and smc determined from remote sensing data mulder et al 2011 or by using physical model such as radiative transfer models sadeghi 2018 remote sensing data can be divided into three types optical thermal i e infrared and microwave optical remote sensing mainly includes the visible and near infrared bands which contain reflectance data from the land surface as well as solar short wave radiation which reveals the spectral properties of soil as a function of smc serrano et al 2019 several vegetation indices e g the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the anomalous vegetation index avi and the vegetation condition index vci have been widely used to estimate smc kogan 1990 remote sensing in the thermal range detects the various thermodynamic characteristics of soil with different water content sohrabinia et al 2014 to estimate smc optical and thermal remote sensing data have been increasingly fused for example to characterized soil moisture status toby et al 1994 proposed the vegetation supply water index vswi which is calculated based on the ndvi and surface temperature moreover sandholt et al 2002 proposed the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi which fits the dry edge and wet edge of the ndvi and surface temperature and is now widely used to estimate smc microwave remote sensing has also been increasingly applied to estimate smc because microwaves can penetrate deeply into the soil so that this technique can probe the dielectric properties of the soil dong et al 2020 several smc data products are generated via microwave remote sensing and are widely used such as smos kerr et al 2010 amsr e karthikeyan et al 2019 and smap mao et al 2020 however this dataset is discontinuous and incomplete for dense vegetation coverage seneviratne et al 2010 over the past decades numerous studies have investigated how to use remote sensing data in the field to estimate smc unfortunately the coarse pixel resolution of satellite remote sensing e g landsat 30 m sentinel 10 60 m and modis 250 1000 m may be inappropriate for small area applications such as evaluating field smc and irrigation management in vineyards moreover satellites cannot provide sufficient optical and thermal images because of weather conditions and fixed revisit times wang et al 2018a the development of advanced unmanned aerial vehicle uav technology which offers higher resolution imagery presents unprecedented potential for estimating field smc and thereby improving our understanding of field scaling li et al 2013 moreover the flight patterns and schedules of uav flight campaigns can be fine tuned for specific fields as can the sensor s carry by uavs several studies have already demonstrated the feasibility of smc estimation by uav remote sensing such as luo et al 2019 who combined landsat 8 optical and infrared bands and uav based digital elevation model dem to estimate the smc of a karst mountainous catchment in southwest china via a linear regression method and obtained results with 7 6 root mean square error rmse ge et al 2019 combined uav based hyperspectral imagery and machine learning to estimate the field smc in xinjiang china and obtained results with r 2 0 91 in general uav based optical sensing rgb multispectral hyperspectral has become the primary method for current research into smc monitoring hassan esfahani et al 2015 2014 lu et al 2020 sona et al 2016 uav based microwave sensors have also been used for smc monitoring acevo herrera et al 2009 2010 however because microwaves penetrate little into vegetation the use of microwave remote sensing to monitor soil information may provide results inferior to those of optical sensors or thermal infrared sensors which can provide indirect measurements of vegetation status even for dense vegetation wigneron et al 2007 for example in a dense maize field with tall plants 3 m although the thermodynamic characteristics of soil depend strongly on moisture sohrabinia et al 2014 few studies have investigated uav based thermal infrared remote or direct sensing of surface temperature or indirect sensing through the canopy temperature in particular although satellite remote sensing of vegetation characteristics in both the thermal infrared and optical bands has been demonstrated this approach has not been widely studied for uavs amani et al 2017 dong and crow 2018 moreover the amount of remote sensing data collected depends on the vegetation coverage and plant height and few studies have evaluated the performance of remote sensing under different environmental conditions finally previous studies have used single sensors to estimate smc whereas the use of multiple sensors for smc estimation has not been investigated due to poor penetrability into soil optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not be able to capture the soil status in conditions of dense vegetation coverage therefore the smc has generally been estimated based on the vegetation status e g leaves curl in conditions of low soil moisture chandel et al 2020 although vegetation status correlates somewhat with smc these correlations may be nonlinear a situation that lends itself to the use of machine learning algorithms which are well suited for dealing with nonlinear heteroscedasticity problems and can be used for intelligent data processing and complete mining of data value jacinta and kerrie 2018 jin et al 2017 machine learning algorithms are already widely used to analyze agricultural remote sensing data with excellent results for example maimaitijiang et al 2020 used a machine learning algorithm to predict soybean yield based on remote sensing data jin et al 2020 applied a deep neural network to estimate maize biomass and ge et al 2019 used a machine learning algorithm to monitor smc and all obtained accurate results however although several studies estimated smc using machine learning ge et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the ways in which canopy coverage soil depth and crop cultivars affect smc monitoring remain unclear the present study uses uav remote sensing to acquire rgb multispectral and thermal data of the smc of a maize field and applies four machine learning algorithms to estimate smc at different soil depths the main goals of this study are to 1 compare the accuracy of smc estimates obtained from multimodal data analyzed by machine learning algorithms 2 explore how smc estimation varies with soil depth and 3 analyze how canopy coverage and crop cultivars affect the accuracy of smc estimates 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and setup the experimental site is located at the xinxiang experimental base of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences in henan province xeb caas china with latitude 35 10 n

is 2398 8 h the experimental site was planted with maize and divided into 25 plots varying in size from 9 6 m 9 6 to 9 6 m 26 6 m as shown in fig 1 fifteen nitrogen treatments denoted n1 n15 were applied to the 25 plots to produce variations in maize growth status two maize cultivars jnk728 and zd958 were planted with a sowing date in june 2020 and a harvest date in november 2020 the row and plant spacings were 60 and 23 cm respectively the soil texture is loam with a field capacity of 35 volumetric water content drip irrigation with fertilization was applied uniformly over the 25 plots 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 uav data collection concurrent acquisition of remote sensing data from multiple uav based sensors allows the fusion of data to improve the monitoring of field crops maimaitijiang et al 2020 for this study an integrated thermal rgb camera flir duo pro r 640 flir systems inc boston massachusetts usa and a multispectral camera micasense rededge mx leptron unmanned aircraft systems inc denver colorado usa were mounted on an uav dji m600 pro dji technology co shenzhen guangdong china as shown in fig 2a and b the multispectral camera could capture five spectral bands blue green red red edge and near infrared the details of each camera lens are given in table 1 a total of five uav flight campaigns were conducted over the maize field on 17 23 and 29 august and 21and 26 september 2020 for the five campaigns the flight height and speed were 30 m and 2 1 m s with a side overlap of 80 and a front overlap of 90 the details of the flight campaign are given in table 2 for each flight to calibrate the multispectral camera we used the asd fieldspec handheld 2 analytical spectral devices inc boulder usa to measure the reflectance from six tarpaulins of various colors green blue red black white and gray laying on the field surface fig 2c to calibrate the thermal camera we imaged four blackboards whose temperature was measured by using a wireless temperature sensor wg78 rfinchina inc shenyang liaoning china ten ground control points were fixed on the field surface to geo reference the remote sensing images acquired by the multiple uav based sensors 2 2 2 collection of field data a portable tdr probe fieldscout tdr 350 soil moisture meter spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa was used to measure the smc in terms of volumetric water content at soil depths of 10 and 20 cm fig 3a a total of 25 measurements was acquired one in each plot at the points shown in fig 1 to ensure accurate measurements eight measurements were made around a given plant as shown in fig 3b and c the mean of the eight measurements gives the in situ measured smc for the given plot the in situ smc measurements were made after the uav flight campaign for the given plot table 2 gives the in situ measured smc for each uav flight campaign the correlation coefficient r 0 49 was obtained between smc measurements at 10 and 20 cm depth see fig 4 which indicates no significant correlation p 0 01 3 methods 3 1 image preprocessing we used agisoft photoscan software version 1 5 5 agisoft llc st petersburg russia to mosaic and orthorectify the uav based rgb thermal and multispectral images and arcgis software version 10 4 environmental systems research institute inc redlands ca usa for the geographic calibration of the images based on the 10 ground control points the multispectral images were radiometrically calibrated based on the reflectance of the six colored tarpaulins captured by asd fig 2c during the uav flight wang et al 2019 exponential logarithmic quadratic and power functions were used to fit the relation between tarpaulin reflectance and tarpaulin digital number dn extracted from the multispectral images by envi software version 5 5 exelis visual information solutions inc usa the optimal function was then used to calibrate the five band multispectral images fig 5 maimaitijiang et al 2017 the exponential function fit best in bands 1 blue and 5 near infrared with r 2 varying from 0 890 to 0 945 and from 0 971 to 0 992 respectively the quadratic function fits best in band 2 green with r 2 varying from 0 959 to 0 995 the power law function fits best in bands 3 red and 4 red edge with r 2 varying from 0 918 to 0 957 and from 0 970 to 0 999 respectively during each flight campaign the wireless temperature sensors recorded the actual temperature of the blackboards every 30 s before the thermal images were mosaiced the blackboard dns were extracted from each image by envi and the actual temperature versus dn was fit to a linear function as shown in fig 6 maimaitijiang et al 2020 which gives r 2 0 94 indicating a strong correlation the fit was then used to calibrate the temperature of the thermal images 3 2 multimodal data extraction 3 2 1 rgb image data canopy coverage cc which is calculated as the percent of vegetation area per ground surface area was extracted from the rgb images to serve as an indicator of maize growth status we used the threshold segmentation method to exclude background soil and weeds from rgb images and extract maize canopy please refer to castillo martínez et al 2020 for details of this method classified maize pixels in each plot sampled were divided by the total number of pixels to calculate the cc 1 c c p m a i z e p t o t a l where p maize is the number of maize canopy pixels in the sampled plot and p total is the total number of pixels in the sampled plot in addition maize canopy texture features were extracted from rgb blue green and red bands and served as input for estimating smc to estimate smc we used the gray level co occurrence matrix glcm which is commonly used to extract texture feature information from uav based images haralick et al 1973 eight features containing glcm based texture information were extracted including variance va contrast co entropy en correlation cor mean me homogeneity ho dissimilarity ds and second moment sm the envi software was used for glcm processing for details of this procedure please refer to the study of nichol and sarker 2011 3 2 2 multispectral image data the radiometrically calibrated multispectral images were used to calculate a set of vegetation indices to estimate smc according to the studies listed in table 3 moreover texture features from multispectral based red edge and near infrared bands were extracted by using the same methods as used for extracting rgb based texture data in section 3 2 1 3 2 3 thermal image data the normalized relative canopy temperature nrct was calculated from calibrated uav based thermal images schmidhalter et al 2015 the nrct is widely used to evaluate crop water status elsayed et al 2017 rischbeck et al 2016 the formula for nrct is 2 n r c t t i t min t max t min where t i is the remotely sensed temperature of pixel i t min t max is the lowest highest remotely sensed temperature in the whole field sandholt et al 2002 proposed the water stress indicator which uses the simplified surface temperature vegetation index ts ndvi space method called the temperature vegetation drought index or tvdi this method uses the maximum surface temperature to fit the ndvi at the dry edge eq 3 and the minimum surface temperature to fit the ndvi at the wet edge eq 4 as shown in fig 7 the wet edge dry edge and vertical axis ndvi 0 form a triangle that defines the ts ndvi space theoretically the wet edge is horizontal and parallel to the ndvi axis and the dry edge which represents zero evapotranspiration in the field intersects the ndvi axis and the t s axis finally the tvdi is calculated as per eq 5 3 t s max a n d v i b 4 t s min c n d v i d 5 t v d i t s i t s min t s max t s min where a d are the estimated parameters of the wet and dry edges the tvdi is widely used to characterize the crop water status and smc bai et al 2017 du et al 2017 additionally the texture features of thermal based nrct were extracted by using the same method as used for extracting rgb and multispectral based texture features see sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 table 3 shows the input variables 3 3 calibration and validation of soil moisture estimates 3 3 1 modeling methods all input variables in table 3 were extracted from the 25 experimental plots figs 1 and 3c as a mask layer and then matched to the in situ measured smc of each plot altogether 125 samples were collected during the five days of uav flight campaigns these are used for training and verification of the model developed herein smc was estimated by using four machine learning algorithms partial least squares regression plsr krishna et al 2019 k nearest neighbor knn mcroberts and tomppo 2007 random forest regression rfr maimaitijiang et al 2020 and backpropagation neural network bpnn wang et al 2018b these machine learning algorithms have been widely used for inverting remote sensing data feng et al 2020 lu et al 2020 maimaitijiang et al 2020 moreover to ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison of these four machine learning methods with their given input variables we used 80 of the samples and in situ smc measurements selected at random for training the machine learning methods and the remaining 20 to determine the accuracy of the smc estimates produced by these methods 3 3 2 validation methods a fivefold cross validation was used to verify the accuracy of the smc estimation algorithms it means that the 125 samples were divided into five parts e g n1 n5 and n1 n4 were used for training model and n5 was used for model validation in first time n1 n3 and n5 were used for training model and n4 was used for model validation in second time and the process was repeated for five times so there were 125 samples independently used for model validation and the final average accuracy was obtained additionally three indicators root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 were computed to quantify the model performance these three indicators are calculated as follows jin et al 2020 6 r 2 1 1 i 1 n s m c m i s m c m 2 i 1 n s m c o b i s m c o b 2 n 1 n m 1 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s m c m i s m c o b i 2 8 r r m s e r m s e s m c o b 100 where smc mi and smc obi are the estimated smc and in situ measured smc respectively n 125 is the number of samples and m 1 is the number of variables fig 8 shows the overall workflow of the preprocessing feature extraction and model building with multimodal data the key of the model is the extraction of the input features and the use of machine learning algorithms as shown in the red dashed box of the fig 8 the different features were extracted from the three types of sensors e g canopy coverage glcm and spectral indices then a total of four machine learning methods with the above features as input were given in the green dash box finally the 125 measured smc samples was used for model training and validation with a fivefold cross validation 4 results and discussion 4 1 modeling and validation of soil moisture content the four machine learning algorithms plsr knn rfr and bpnn were used to estimate smc based on the features extracted from multimodal uav remote sensing data rgb multispectral and thermal in addition different combinations of sensors were tested as listed in table 4 in general of the four machine learning methods rfr provides the most accurate estimates additionally of the seven combinations of multimodal data the joint use of rgb multispectral and thermal data provides the most accurate estimates of smc 4 1 1 contributions of different sensor data independent of modeling algorithm expect for knn remotely sensed data from the multispectral sensor provide the most accurate estimates of smc with r 2 0 17 0 69 for 10 cm soil depth and 0 10 0 68 for 20 cm soil depth the next best results were obtained from the thermal sensor which gives r 2 0 11 0 61 for 10 cm soil depth and 0 07 0 68 for 20 cm soil depth table 4 as shown in numerous studies vegetation indices computed from data acquired with uav based multispectral or hyperspectral sensors have become the most popular indicators for estimating smc casamitjana et al 2020 ge et al 2019 lu et al 2020 thermal sensors and multi sensor combinations have seen slightly less use yet provide comparable accuracy for smc estimates in addition multispectral data may prove to be complementary to thermal and rgb data for estimating smc for example temperature data from thermal imagery may be used to overcome the asymptotic saturation of multispectral or hyperspectral data maimaitijiang et al 2017 2020 fig 9 shows r 2 and the rrmse of smc estimated based on various multimodal data combinations these estimates are more accurate than those obtained using data from a single sensor for example for 10 cm deep smc estimated from thermal and multispectral data via the plsr algorithm r 2 0 55 which is the lowest r 2 except for multispectral data r 2 0 38 in other algorithms the joint use of thermal data provides smc estimates that are more accurate than when using only multispectral data however compared with smc estimates from thermal and multispectral data the smc estimation accuracy increases very little when combining rgb data for example for single sensor multispectral and thermal 10 cm deep smc estimation using the rfr algorithm r 2 increases only by 0 06 and 0 07 respectively upon combining rgb data this result may be due to information redundancy and homogeneity between multispectral and rgb data maimaitijiang et al 2017 pelizari et al 2018 in general the combined use of the three sensors rgb multispectral and thermal produces more accurate smc estimates than any other combination of sensors however the improvement in accuracy is minimal compared with the estimation accuracy obtained using just the multispectral and thermal sensors figs 10 and 11 shows smc estimates obtained by applying the rfr algorithm to various combinations of remote sensing data as expected from the comparable rrmse and r 2 we obtain similar scatterplots of modeled smc versus in situ measured smc moreover the smc is overestimated in the low smc region and underestimated in the high smc region if we consider the points encircled in red in figs 10 and 11 i e 10 cm deep smc estimates the underestimation is more obvious in fig 10a d which use rgb and or multispectral data this result is attributed to saturation of the optical sensor which has been reported in studies of leaf area index crop yield etc becker reshef et al 2010 maimaitijiang et al 2020 omar et al 2016 thus this issue remains a problem however in this study the use of thermal data leads to better 10 cm deep smc estimates than the rgb and or multispectral data i e less underestimation see fig 10b additionally multi sensors that combine the thermal sensor with other sensors fig 10e g are also outperformed to some extent by the thermal sensor alone the temperature recorded by the thermal sensor is not affected by the high density vegetation canopy coverage which causes saturation of the optical sensor baluja et al 2012 hoffmann et al 2016 to overcome this saturation problem several studies have proposed using canopy texture features e g glcm data as unique and complementary data maimaitijiang et al 2020 rischbeck et al 2016 however as shown in fig 10a b and d any such gains are limited in the present study the crop growth is affected by soil moisture cheng et al 2021 thus the remote sensing model of smc estimation is indirectly estimate smc through the crop status such as texture temperature and spectral information cheng et al 2022 however most machine learning based remote sensing model generally lack a certain theoretical mechanism maimaitijiang et al 2020 it should be noted that not only smc can affect the crop status the other factors such as nitrogen also affect the crop canopy coverage thus more features were necessary to effectively eliminate the influence of other factors cheng et al 2022 in this study multiple water related features 70 at most extracted from the three sensors were used for smc estimation such as canopy coverage temperature which finally resulted in a good performance however the model still had certain errors with rrmse reached 11 2 9 6 for 10 cm deep 20 cm deep smc moreover figs 10 and 11 showed that overestimation for dry conditions low smc and underestimation for wet conditions high smc of this model which may be contributed by lack of some features moreover spectral saturation issue may also cause the overestimation for dry conditions the results in this study showed that with input features increased this issue has been alleviated figs 10 and 11 in general higher accuracy requirements need more information extracted from more sensors e g plant height from lidar ten harkel et al 2020 chlorophyll fluorescence from fluorometer wang et al 2021 zarco tejada et al 2012 4 1 2 performance of different regression models as stated above rfr provides more accurate smc estimates than the three other machine learning methods in both single sensor and multi sensor situations and for both 10 and 20 cm deep smc estimates table 4 and fig 9 for the former r 2 varies from 0 59 to 0 78 and rrmse varies from 11 15 to 15 37 whereas for the latter r2 varies from 0 59 to 0 78 and rrmse varies from 9 63 to 13 29 the next best estimates of smc are provided by the bpnn algorithm r 2 0 12 0 72 and rrmse 12 06 22 49 for 10 cm deep smc estimation and r2 0 30 0 70 and rrmse 11 29 17 24 for 20 cm deep smc estimation the knn algorithm produces the least accurate smc estimates in both 10 and 20 cm deep cases which is likely because the knn algorithm depends strongly on training data and the in situ smc data were not sufficiently accurate given the uncertainty in field measurements moreover the knn algorithm is more suitable for classification applications than for regression applications nugrahaeni and mutijarsa 2017 the plsr algorithm provides slightly more accurate estimates than the knn algorithm fig 9 shows that the accuracy of smc estimates by the plsr algorithm clearly improves as the number of input data sources increases as indicated in previous studies the plsr algorithm can solve the problem of multiple linear regression with multiple independent variables because the principal component analysis during the preprocessing stage of plsr reduces the correlation between input variables kim et al 2020 however the plsr algorithm cannot characterize the nonlinear relationship between multi variables nawar et al 2014 although the rfr algorithm provides more accurate smc estimates than the bpnn algorithm the difference in accuracy is not significant when using multi sensor data as shown in fig 9 in general the number of variables input into the bpnn algorithm affects its estimation accuracy which explains why smc estimates by the bpnn algorithm were significantly less accurate when using as input sensor data with fewer variables or less explanatory variables he et al 2020 in contrast smc estimates by the rfr algorithm remain accurate even as the number of input variables varies as indicated in previous studies the rfr algorithm is robust against noise in training data belgiu and dragut 2016 hu et al 2018 additionally fewer samples have the smc underestimated by the rfr algorithm than by the other algorithms fig 12 these results suggest that the rfr algorithm provides more stable and accurate smc estimates when fed multimodal data although machine learning algorithms directly embody the relationship between variables in the algorithm they cannot generate analytical formulas which may make it more difficult to interpret the model cheng and titterington 1994 4 2 accuracy of estimates of soil moisture content as a function of soil depth the smc must be estimated at different soil depths to understand how the root water uptake layer varies with the growth stage as shown in fig 4 the smc measured in situ in the field at 10 and 20 cm depth are insignificantly correlated p 0 01 which indicates that the 10 and 20 cm deep smc estimates are relatively independent fig 13 shows the accuracy of the algorithms for different soil depths at 10 cm the smc estimates have r 2 0 03 0 78 with a mean value of 0 44 for 20 cm depth r 2 0 05 0 78 with a mean value of 0 44 and the difference is not significant p 0 01 thus the uav based smc estimates have similar accuracy at the different depths the rmse rrmse for the 20 cm deep smc estimates has a mean value of 3 4 15 1 which is less greater than the corresponding value of 3 2 17 4 for 10 cm deep smc estimates the difference in rmse is again not significant p 0 01 but the rrmse for 10 cm deep smc estimates is significantly greater than that at 20 cm depth p 0 01 this result is attributed to the greater smc at 20 cm depth measured in the field table 2 and fig 4 as noted in table 4 the rfr algorithm with input from the three sensors rgb multispectral and thermal produces the most accurate smc estimates at both 10 and 20 cm depth with r 2 0 78 in both cases in contrast the plsr knn algorithm produces the least accurate 10 cm deep 20 cm deep smc estimates when fed rgb data with r 2 0 03 0 05 this shows that smc estimation methods based on uav remote sensing data can produce significantly different relative errors compared with optical detection the microwave band is less used for smc estimation because it penetrates the vegetation its penetration depth is generally tens of centimeters which exceeds that of an optical sensor otosaka et al 2020 in addition the smc estimation accuracy is greater in the microwave band acevo herrera et al 2009 2010 be that as it may the accuracy may be limited when faced with high vegetation coverage such as maize which can reach 3 m in height therefore optical sensors may provide better results by estimating smc indirectly furthermore the maize root depth varies with growth stage and can reach approximately 90 cm cucci et al 2019 thus estimating smc at greater depths is necessary the methods proposed herein may be used for deeper smc estimation which should be a topic of future study 4 3 comparison of smc estimation accuracy for different canopy coverage because microwaves directly detect soil characteristics the cc could affect smc estimates based on microwave radiation acevo herrera et al 2010 in this study the maize cc varies from 0 1 to 0 5 which we divide into four levels as shown in table 5 the rfr algorithm produces the most accurate smc estimates for all four levels of cc with r 2 0 73 0 86 0 73 0 82 for 10 20 cm depth in contrast knn produces the least accurate smc estimates for all cc levels these results further testify to the robustness of the rfr algorithm for smc estimation moreover all machine learning algorithms produce relatively accurate smc estimates for intermediate cc levels cc from 0 2 to 0 4 and relatively inaccurate smc estimates for higher cc levels cc over 0 4 or lower cc levels cc less than 0 2 in the study of smc estimation using optical sensor based methods the canopy status including vegetation index and canopy temperature were used to indirectly obtain information on smc however this information comes mostly from soil under low cc which may increase the estimation error of the model in contrast a higher cc may result in saturation of the optical sensors hoffmann et al 2016 rischbeck et al 2016 and thereby produce smc estimates of relatively low accuracy note however that the rfr algorithm still produces high accuracy smc estimates with r 2 0 73 even with excessive or insufficient cc in conclusion optical sensor based methods of smc estimation are reliable under various levels of cc 4 4 comparison of smc estimation accuracy for the two cultivars we now discuss the smc estimation accuracy for the two different maize cultivars as shown in table 6 the rfr produces the most accurate smc estimates for both maize cultivars with r 2 0 78 with insignificant difference appearing between the two depths 10 and 20 cm p 0 01 as reported in previous studies although the phenotyping of various maize cultivars differs uav based high throughput plant phenotyping produces accurate and repeatable measurements of crop yield leaf area index etc li et al 2014 maimaitijiang et al 2020 the present results indicate that the same holds true for smc estimates 4 5 spatial distribution of soil moisture content in the field fig 14 shows the smc distribution in the experimental field computed using the rfr algorithm with combined rgb thermal and multispectral data as input the smc patterns for the two cultivars are similar for example from 17 august to 23 august the 10 cm deep 20 cm deep smc for jnk728 decreases increases by 1 1 1 6 and the 10 cm deep 20 cm deep smc of zd958 decreases increases by 1 0 1 9 however there were greater smc difference among the various nitrogen levels sections 4 2 4 4 show that the smc estimation model may be used with different ccs and cultivars so this model based smc map can be used to design irrigation regimes compared with the original irrigation regime this method showed is more reasonable and adaptable because it calculates irrigation amount based on the smc of each plot cheng et al 2020 moreover the proposed rfr plus multi sensor input method was used to detect crop water consumption by monitoring variations in smc in general the method can be used to characterize the spatial distribution of the smc which provides a reference for precision irrigation and precision agriculture wang et al 2019 5 conclusions this study investigates the combined use of rgb multispectral and thermal infrared remote sensing data as input for various machine learning algorithms to estimate smc the four main conclusions are as follows 1 multispectral remote sensing data produce more accurate smc estimates than rgb or thermal remote sensing data however combining thermal remote sensing data with multispectral data improves the smc estimation accuracy in contrast the addition of rgb remote sensing data produces minimal further improvement in smc estimation accuracy 2 fused multimodal data produce more accurate smc estimates than is possible with single sensor data regardless of which machine learning algorithm is used in general the joint use of the three types of sensors produces the most accurate smc estimates followed by the combined use of multispectral and thermal data 3 the rfr algorithm produces the most accurate smc estimates of the four machine learning algorithms followed by the bpnn algorithm the difference in accuracy between the two algorithms is greater when using single sensor data than when using multimodal data i e data from the three sensors moreover when given various input variables the rfr algorithm produces more repeatable results than do the other three algorithms in contrast the knn algorithm produces the least accurate smc estimates 4 the proposed method to estimate smc produces similar results at the two soil depths tested 10 and 20 cm the relative root mean square error of the estimated smc is even lower at greater soil depth which indicates that this approach may potentially be used for deeper estimates of smc furthermore the four machine learning algorithms plsr knn rfr and bpnn both perform well for modest cc 0 2 0 4 however they produce less accurate although still acceptable for rfr smc estimates under higher 0 4 and lower 0 2 cc no significant difference appears in smc estimation accuracy between the two maize cultivars jnk728 and zd958 we thus conclude that using uav based remote sensing data as input for machine learning algorithms is a promising approach to obtain accurate estimates of smc the results reported herein reflect the significant potential of uav remote sensing based smc estimation when machine learning algorithms are combined with fused multimodal data the smc estimation method proposed herein provides the foundation of an efficient approach for monitoring soil moisture and designing precision irrigation regimes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9629,to support effective adaptation in the agriculture sector through policy and practice it is essential to know how farmers as the primary decision makers regarding land use understand and respond to water scarcity using the model of private proactive adaptation to climate change mppacc as a basic framework for the study the research investigated the effects of cognitive factors on maladaptation in farmers incremental adaptation to water scarcity as a climate risk data were collected during face to face interviews with 250 farmers of irrigated lands in khuzestan province iran the structural equation modeling results showed that the research model predicted 49 of the variance in adaptive behavior and 24 of the variance in maladaptation these results provide strong empirical evidence for the hypothesis that maladaptation has an important and negative effect on determining adaptive behaviors β 33 moreover perceived susceptibility β 42 β 38 perceived cost β 21 β 32 and perceived self efficacy β 31 β 29 directly affected both adaptive behavior and maladaptation this study contributes to the literature by i adding to the limited number of studies on the mppacc ii confirming the efficiency of this model in the water scarcity context as the mppacc can be used to understand behavior of people faced with an environmental threat and iii improving knowledge regarding the impact of belief in climate change on the constructs of the mppacc graphical abstract ga1 keywords water scarcity risk appraisal maladaptation adaptive capacity self efficacy 1 introduction the global climate change crisis is inextricably linked to water increased greenhouse gas emissions and consequently global warming have led to change and disturbance in the natural hydrological cycle mehrazar et al 2020 paudel et al 2020 examples of this imbalance are variations in the quantity and seasonal distribution of precipitation increasingly intense precipitation increased fluctuations in temperature and severe weather events rising sea levels in coastal communities increased evapotranspiration and decreased soil moisture these conditions threaten water security in many parts of the world especially at lower latitudes and in subtropical regions denicola et al 2015 it is predicted for example that by 2070 water resources will decrease by 20 and that the amount of surface land under water stress will increase from 19 to 35 because of climate change pakmehr et al 2020 moreover disturbances in the hydrological cycle significantly affect water quality and the availability or scarcity of water denicola et al 2015 shadkam et al 2016 water scarcity has many negative consequences for various socioecological systems including agriculture mehrazar et al 2020 savari et al 2022 porter et al 2014 pointed out that in the past 30 years climate change has reduced the world s agricultural production by 1 5 per decade water crises are significant threats to sustainable living systems environmental economic political or technological and require an immediate response taylor and sonnenfeld 2017 the reality of climate change and water scarcity cannot be overlooked in the middle east especially in iran daneshvar et al 2019 rouzaneh et al 2021 there have been 27 droughts in iran in the past 40 years madani et al 2016 about 37 million iranians were affected by a drought that lasted from 1980 to 2014 and was estimated to have resulted in losses amounting to usd 3 3 billion hesam et al 2021 people s response to climate uncertainty and the complexity of socioecological systems is very much dependent on their ability to learn about resources and crises in the environment and how to adapt to them galaz 2005 effective adaptation in the agricultural sector is important in terms of reducing vulnerability and adverse climate effects bandyopadhyay et al 2011 savari and amghani 2022 chenani et al 2021 zobeidi et al 2021a smit et al 2000 defined adaptation as the adjustment that takes place within socioeconomic and ecological systems in response to real or expected variability in climate and its effects researchers distinguish between two types of adaptation incremental and transformational smit and skinner 2002 park et al 2012 shikuku et al 2017 in the context of climate change incremental adaptation involves the development of actions and behaviors that reduce the harm or increase the benefits of natural changes in climate and severe events kates et al 2012 and is characterized by a continuous response to climate hazards in an existing system in contrast transformational adaptation is a process that leads to changes in the biophysical social or economic components of a system park et al 2012 and involves making changes to a set of variables that control the performance of the system this differs from incremental change in which adjustments are made to allow current goals to be achieved under changed conditions robertson and murray prior 2016 the present study focuses on incremental adaptation which is of fundamental importance in agriculture feng et al 2017 when farmers use incremental decision making they reduce risk by making smaller gradual changes instead of taking on complex decisions nielsen 2009 examples of incremental adaptation läderach et al 2017 are the cultivation of new varieties chhetri et al 2012 alam 2015 changes to the timing of cultivation deressa et al 2009 finger et al 2011 gandure et al 2013 shaffril et al 2018 diversification of production which includes the diversification of species and the cultivation of various types of crops intercropping the simultaneous cultivation of several plants see deressa et al 2009 alauddin and sarker 2014 and changes to the type of crop cultivated chhetri et al 2012 shaffril et al 2018 as farmers are the implementation agents of adaptation policies and programs their behavior affects the ways in which these programs are implemented and whether they are successful home et al 2014 understanding farmers behavior and the factors that affect their adaptation is key to strengthening adaptive capacity and improving sustainable agriculture it helps local agricultural systems produce sustainable food or design and implement appropriate adaptive measures such as incentives laws or institutional reforms feola et al 2015 in order to achieve agricultural security and food security home et al 2014 feola et al 2015 belay et al 2017 fadina and barjolle 2018 thereby improving the socioeconomic resilience of agricultural communities amir et al 2020 shikuku et al 2017 believe that farmers differ in their ability to adapt and that different factors in particular financial and nonfinancial costs can influence adaptation strategies this study seeks to answer the question what factors influence farmers adoption of adaptive behaviors to water scarcity before identifying those factors it is important to determine whether farmers are prepared to adopt specific adaptive measures awareness of climate change is a prerequisite for engaging in adaptive behaviors mahmood et al 2020 although some farmers believe that climate change is occurring they are not yet ready to adapt a spiritual way of thinking on the part of these farmers must be considered when accounting for their maladaptation although farmers who engage in spiritual thinking accept the concept of adaptive behaviors they also believe that all events including climate change are predetermined and inevitable mahmood et al 2020 thus maladaptation in this context can involve an optimistic bias or the postponing of decisions to act or not to act in favor of a wait and see approach westcott et al 2017 it can thus be a barrier to adaptation le dang et al 2014 westcott et al 2017 this study pursues two main objectives first identification of farmers beliefs with regard to climate change and the factors that determine their adaptation to water scarcity and second consideration of the effects of maladaptation and other cognitive factors on their adaptive behaviors different theories have been deployed to identify the psychological and cognitive factors that influence adaptive behaviors behavioral theories identify the determinants of behavior through socio cognitive and perceptual processes theories related to agricultural adaptation include ajzen s 1985 theory of planned behavior derived from the theory of reasoned action ajzen and fishbein 1975 protection motivation theory pmt rogers 1975 and the theory of values beliefs norms stern et al 1999 these theories have been empirically tested modified and redefined to explain agricultural adaptation in different regions bagagnan et al 2019 luu et al 2019 for example studies have used the theory of planned behavior masud et al 2016 arunrat et al 2017 and pmt kuruppu and liverman 2011 gebrehiwot and van der veen 2015 bagagnan et al 2019 luu et al 2019 mitter et al 2019 delfiyan et al 2020 pakmehr et al 2020 in the fields of adaptation to climate change and water management few studies however have specifically addressed subjective adaptive capacity although methodological approaches are evolving simultaneously with new empirical studies one comprehensive and effective approach to recognizing adaptive capacity involves the model of private proactive adaptation to climate change mppacc this framework was proposed by grothmann and patt in 2005 the mppacc is important for two reasons first it can provide insights into people s perceptions of climate impacts and second it can broaden analyses to understand individuals capacity to adapt to climate change which is often ignored in traditional studies on adaptation kuruppu and liverman 2011 it is only the mppacc that takes into account maladaptation based on how spiritual thinking can reduce an individual s intention to engage in adaptive behavior grothmann and patt 2005 farmers spiritual beliefs have been paid very little attention in the literature grothmann and patt 2005 this is why this theory is well suited in this research to analyzing adaptation and maladaptation in empirical research on water scarcity 2 theoretical framework the mppacc is based on protection motivation theory pmt developed by r w rogers in 1975 pmt was initially proposed as a theory mainly in health risk studies before being extended to studies of environmental disasters and climate change bockarjova and steg 2014 the mppacc adds the following elements to pmt social discourse risk experience reliance on public infrastructure cognitive biases and heuristics adaptation incentives and objective adaptive capacity actual barriers of these the present study focuses on social discourse and risk experience according to pmt individuals making decisions to protect themselves through adaptation go through two cognitive appraisal processes risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal risk appraisal involves understanding the probability of being threatened perceived susceptibility and the seriousness of that threat perceived severity perceived susceptibility refers to people s expectations of being exposed to a threat whereas perceived severity refers to their assessment of the harmfulness magnitude of that threat grothmann and patt 2003 tessema et al 2019 boazar et al 2020 adaptation appraisal refers to the ability to avoid damage from threats while assessing the costs of performing avoidant actions which leads to an awareness of perceived adaptive capacity kuruppu and liverman 2011 adaptation appraisal has three subcomponents perceived response efficacy perceived self efficacy and perceived cost perceived response efficacy what bandura 1977 called outcome expectancy is the belief that adaptive measures or responses are effective at protecting individuals from threats frank et al 2011 perceived self efficacy refers to individuals perceived ability to perform an action or execute adaptive responses grothmann and patt 2003 yazdanpanah et al 2021 mortreux and barnett 2017 pointed out that if people hold distorted beliefs about their ability to manage climate stress and impacts this can prevent them from adapting ung et al 2016 emphasized that self efficacy predicts both anticipatory and reactive adaptation to climate change a meta analysis by van valkengoed and steg 2019 also showed that both perceived response efficacy and perceived self efficacy directly affect adaptive behavior finally perceived cost refers to the cost of implementing adaptive responses grothmann and patt 2003 2005 bozorgparvar et al 2018 grothmann and patt 2005 pointed out that this can include any financial personal time or even effort costs associated with implementing an adaptive response to risk reduction people s cognitions always depend on social contexts especially social discourses for example people s perceptions of the risk of climate change or their capacity to adapt to it are shaped and influenced by what they hear about climate change from the media friends colleagues neighbors or government agencies grothmann and patt 2003 according to grothmann and patt 2005 social discourse can predict risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal in other words having had temporary or incidental training may contribute to an individual s general awareness of climate risks and adaptation mitter et al 2019 according to the mppacc depending on the results of risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal an individual can respond with two distinct behaviors adaptation or maladaptation these are also known as protective and non protective reactions adaptive or protective behaviors which occur when risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal are high prevent physical and financial harm non protective behaviors include maladaptive responses involving coping reactions based on avoidance e g denial optimism wishful thinking fatalism see westcott et al 2017 maladaptive responses prevent only the negative feelings such as fear that a person has as a result of perceiving danger they do not prevent physical or financial harm to the person grothmann and patt 2005 grothmann and reusswig 2006 maladaptation itself is defined as avoidance reactions denial wishful thinking fatalism or wrong adaptation that inadvertently increases harm le dang 2014 the original definition of maladaptation is considered in this study this focuses on psychological perspectives it is known as avoidant coping and is based on cognitive biases mortreux and barnett 2017 livneh 2019a b defined avoidance coping as a behavioral or cognitive effort to ignore or avoid a problem or illness a fatalist for example believes that everything is preordained and their belief framework is related to a belief in god akter et al 2017 mahmood et al 2020 feng et al 2017 noted that fatalism wishful thinking and denial of the risk of climate change all hinder farmers intention to adapt experiencing an environmental problem such as drought can play an important role in shaping environmental perceptions because experience is the basis for cognition zamasiya et al 2017 previous experience or personal experience direct experience can be associated with increased risk perception although the nature of this impact is contested van der linden 2015 mortreux and barnett 2017 the current study examines the direct impact of maladaptation on behavior there is strong evidence that maladaptation influences adaptive behavior akter et al 2017 mahmood et al 2020 finally the belief in climate change as a determinant of risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal is also considered in the model in depth studies have confirmed the impact on risk perception of the belief that climate change is real hyland et al 2016 zobeidi et al 2020 talanow et al 2021 this study focuses specifically on a belief in water scarcity fig 1 shows the study framework based on the mppacc 3 methodology 3 1 sample and study area the current study used a cross sectional design the target population was farmers in the hot and dry climate of khuzestan province iran because of the high potential for adaptation in irrigated agricultural lands the target group was farmers of irrigated lands n 45 000 the statistical sample size was determined using cochran s formula equal to 250 farmers who were selected using multistage stratified random sampling five counties behbahan dasht e azadegan hamidiyeh hoveyzeh and bavi were randomly selected first one or two districts from each county were randomly selected then one village was randomly selected from each section and finally several farmers were randomly selected from each village data collection was performed through face to face interviews using a questionnaire in august and september 2020 the questionnaire was then distributed in the selected areas via meetings with farmers at their farms completion of the questionnaire was entirely voluntary each interview lasted between 20 and 40 min the descriptive analysis showed that all farmers were male aged between 19 and 75 the mean age of the respondents was 44 8 years 11 98 the average family size was about 6 2 94 the average number of years of agricultural work experience or agricultural experience was about 20 12 03 with a range from 1 to 50 years the average size of the agricultural land whether rented or owned was 15 16 ha 20 59 the average distances from farm to market and agricultural extension center were 25 63 km 16 18 and 21 72 km 15 97 respectively finally 108 farmers 44 6 had a second job the remaining 55 4 had no other job 3 2 survey instrument a survey was created to assess the application of the mppacc to predict farmers adaptive behavior the structured perception based questionnaire consisted of mppacc constructs belief in climate change and socioeconomic variables survey questions were based on the literature on farmers behaviors in iran maleksaeidi et al 2016 delfiyan et al 2020 pakmehr et al 2020 2021 as well as on reviews of cognitive factors influencing farmers decisions in general rainear and christensen 2017 tajeri moghadam et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and climate adaptation in particular grothmann and patt 2005 le dang et al 2014 2018 feng et al 2017 akhtar et al 2018 luu et al 2019 table 1 shows the items in the questionnaire along with their sources farmers were asked to agree or disagree with all items using a 5 point likert scale from 1 very low to 5 very high the content validity of the questionnaire was assessed using the opinions of a panel of experts in various fields of agricultural and water sciences the results showed that the items represented the corresponding constructs the reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire were evaluated with cronbach s alphas obtained from a pilot study of 30 farmers in behbahan khuzestan province as shown in table 1 cronbach s alpha for all constructs indicated good to excellent reliability αs 0 780 0 936 3 3 data analysis to investigate the factors affecting adaptive behaviors structural equation modeling sem in amos was conducted equation modeling can calculate measurement error and also simultaneously estimate path coefficients of the model chen et al 2016 sem is commonly used to validate hypothetical or theoretical models ho et al 2016 the two steps of sem include confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the appropriateness of the measurement model and then sem itself anderson and gerbing 1988 confirmatory factor analysis was applied to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of the measurement model by checking reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity cronbach s alpha t statistics composite reliability cr and average variance extracted ave were used to confirm the validity and reliability of the research model the internal consistency of a model is confirmed when cronbach s alpha is above the threshold of 0 5 moreover t statistics are used to check convergent validity if t statistic is above the threshold of 1 96 5 level it is confirmed cr and ave are two other indicators of convergent validity to confirm convergent validity the ave and cr of each construct should be greater than 0 5 and 0 7 respectively the measurement model should show the appropriateness of the empirical data and meet the specific criteria shown in table 2 for a measurement model to be considered valid the relative chi square χ2 df should be less than 5 the acceptable threshold for the adjusted goodness of fit index agfi goodness of fit index gfi normed fit index and comparative fit index is 0 9 although hair et al 2010 noted that values for agfi and the comparative fit index from 0 8 to 0 9 are considered marginal the acceptable threshold for the root mean square error of approximation is 0 08 3 4 verification of measurement model several items with factor loadings of less than 0 5 were removed from the measurement model the ave for all constructs was greater than 0 5 moreover the calculated cr for all constructs was greater than 0 7 table 3 t was higher than 1 96 for all items and cronbach s alpha was higher than 0 7 for all constructs table 1 according to these results the research model had good convergent validity the square root of each construct was also higher than the correlation of that construct with other constructs accordingly discriminant validity was confirmed table 3 the fit indices of the measurement model are shown in table 2 a comparison of the findings to the recommended indicators showed that the model had relatively good fit although some indicators including gfi agfi and the normed fit index were below the recommended values they were within marginal levels see hair et al 2010 4 results 4 1 description and relationship between constructs descriptive results table 1 showed that the mean scores of perception of climate change risk experience and social discourse were 4 09 3 78 and 2 95 out of 5 respectively farmers have a high belief in climate change and experience of risk in a context where there is moderate social discourse the mean scores of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of water scarcity were 3 66 and 3 81 out of 5 respectively indicating that the perceived threat was relatively high the mean scores of perceived response efficacy perceived cost and self efficacy were 3 78 3 44 and 2 75 out of 5 respectively indicating that the perceived adaptation capacity was from a moderate to high level in the study of maladaptation of farmers the results showed the farmers to have relatively high maladaptation with a mean of 3 03 out of 5 although their adaptation behaviors were moderate with a mean score of 2 39 out of 5 4 2 belief in water scarcity the farmers in the study were well aware of water scarcity with about 80 perceiving that rainfall had decreased compared to the past m 3 97 sd 1 01 levels of water in rivers springs and wells had decreased m 4 06 sd 0 89 the amount of agricultural and drinking water had decreased m 4 10 sd 0 90 drought was occurring m 4 10 sd 0 77 and agriculture was affected by water scarcity m 4 19 sd 0 70 see fig 2 on the whole it was clear that the farmers saw major signs of water scarcity most of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that there were signs of water scarcity in terms of reduced rainfall reduced river and well levels lack of water for agriculture and drinking drought occurrence and the effects of water shortages on agriculture 4 3 structural model after confirming the suitability of the measurement model sem was performed with the maximum likelihood estimation the results showed

had a negative effect on adaptive behavior β 0 33 t 4 42 p 0 0001 the research model was able to predict 24 of the variance in maladaptation and 49 of the variance in adaptation the proposed model was able to predict 36 of the variance in perceived susceptibility 30 in perceived severity 28 in perceived response efficacy and 13 in perceived self efficacy however this model was not able to predict perceived cost 5 discussion social discourse was directly related to perceived response efficacy and perceived self efficacy social discourse refers to information received from or within a community grothmann and patt 2005 here it refers to information related to water scarcity and adaptation heard or received from friends and neighbors government or nongovernmental organizations or the media the more people more hear and talk about water scarcity or adaptation strategies or the more information they receive from local television and radio or agricultural extension experts the more perceived effectiveness and self efficacy they will have this finding is consistent with the literature on the mppacc many studies confirm that information abid et al 2017 wolf 2011 social networks phuong et al 2018 and cues to action tajeri moghadam et al 2020 all influence adaptation agricultural policymakers and organizations need to raise the discourses on water scarcity and adaptation through the media associations and rural groups to increase the level of social discourse regarding farmers and villagers belief in climate change also affected threat appraisal including both perceived susceptibility and perceived severity studies have shown that a belief in the occurrence of climate change can affect perceptions of risk reser et al 2012 and arbuckle et al 2013 le dang et al 2014 lee et al 2015 mitter et al 2019 to improve adaptation in agriculture special focus should be placed on perceptions of drought and climate change providing meteorological statistics and charts on changing trends especially in terms of declining rainfall in recent years and rising temperatures will help improve understanding of climate change risk experience affected both subcomponents of threat appraisal according to carlton and jacobson 2013 the experience of climate related risk is one of the dimensions of risk salience and directly affects perceptions of environmental risk le dang 2014 showed that risk experience affects the perceived risks of climate change in one or more aspects of farmers lives such as physical financial production social or psychological relationships as well as overall perceived risk contrary to expectations perceived susceptibility negatively influenced maladaptation namely the reactions of people who feel more threatened by the effects of water scarcity will be more avoidant this is probably because farmers think that there is nothing they can do to combat the widespread harm of water scarcity and as a result feel powerless and consider water scarcity to be a phenomenon that human beings cannot control although this finding is inconsistent with the mppacc there are studies to confirm it for example researchers have found that threat assessment negatively affects maladaptation le dang et al 2014 talanow et al 2021 talanow et al 2021 pointed out that this may be due to farmers who understand the dangers of climate change to their livelihood and crops tending to adopt adaptive behaviors which makes them less likely to choose maladaptive options to increase risk perception education should focus on the harms and adverse consequences of climate change and water scarcity indirect training such as putting up notices and posters in rural areas containing photos of damage to agriculture can also increase the perception of risk among farmers perceived response efficacy negatively affected maladaptation those who believe that adaptation can prevent the loss of products and revenue will have a greater intention to adapt and as a result will be less likely to be maladaptive these findings are consistent with grothmann and patt 2005 who showed that adaptation assessments are negatively related to adaptation training is given on the applicability of adaptation methods in harm reduction to improve adaptation more importantly however it is suggested that farmers who have successfully implemented adaptation strategies can be brought forward to demonstrate increases in the perceived effectiveness of the response holding meetings within agricultural service centers and agricultural extension centers among farmers who have successfully made adaptations and other farmers is suggested the cost of adaptation perceived cost had a negative influence on maladaptation when farmers believe that implementing adaptive behaviors comes at a high cost their adaptive behavior decreases three items were used to measure perceived cost 1 adaptive measures are very expensive 2 adaptive measures are time consuming and 3 it takes a lot of effort to adapt my farm to water scarcity a high perceived cost of adaptation in terms of time money and effort leads farmers to ignore a threat and take no action these findings generally confirm the previous research on the cognitive dimensions of climate change as they relate to farmers adaptation in particular they provide strong empirical evidence for the hypothesis that maladaptation or avoidant reactions wishful thinking denial and fatalism play an important role in determining adaptive behaviors a study by akter et al 2017 focusing on fatalism showed that farmers with fatalistic views of the consequences of climate change were significantly less likely to choose an adaptation strategy such as insurance fatalism is characterized by the perception that the person has no control over events or ability to change them fatalistic farmers would rather not make any response to deal with water scarcity and climate change and they do not perceive climate change or water scarcity as threats that are big enough to make them change their agricultural methods zobeidi et al 2016 other studies have found that maladaptation is a barrier to adaptation management grothmann and patt 2005 le dang et al 2014 2018 feng et al 2017 luu et al 2019 mahmood et al 2020 talanow et al 2021 in general people who are more fatalistic who deny the impact of water scarcity and who are wishful thinkers are less likely to engage in adaptive behaviors some actors who engage in maladaptive behaviors feel that there is no need to change and prefer to maintain the status quo they feel that maintaining the status quo has many benefits and believe that if a change is difficult or may not lead to improvement why bother le dang et al 2014 maladaptive behaviors can be rooted in religion or culture le dang et al 2014 pointed out that while it is very risky to state that maladaptation is all due to religious beliefs this aspect should in any case be considered in adaptation programs in the iranian farming community because of farmers lower literacy and their faith in god it is necessary to focus on reducing maladaptation as the mean of the maladaptation variable shows the rate of maladaptation in this community is relatively high higher than 2 5 out of 5 to reduce maladaptation some basic measures can be suggested the use of films and stories to depict the crisis of climate change and show what agricultural activities were particularly affected by the crisis this can help people move away from superstition and other misconceptions people also need to be taught that humans are more responsible for environmental crises than natural causes and that farmers must be aware of their own responsibilities in the climate crisis there is a relationship between higher perceived susceptibility and higher adaptive behavior because unless people believe that they are in danger or harm they will probably not do anything adaptations to water scarcity included changing planting dates conservation tillage no tillage mulching crop diversification and not cultivating crops with high water requirements changing to crops with low water requirements if farmers feel that the consequences of water scarcity are likely to make their farms crops and assets vulnerable to harm they will implement more adaptive behaviors this finding is consistent with the results of other research keshavarz and karami 2016 perceived adaptation cost was negatively correlated with adaptive behavior which is consistent with pmt the mppacc and other research that has drawn on these theories gebrehiwot and van der veen 2015 keshavarz and karami 2016 delfiyan et al 2020 contrary to expectations self efficacy had a significant negative effect on adaptive behavior many studies however have confirmed the positive influence of self efficacy on diverse environmental behavior ung et al 2016 van valkengoed and steg 2019 zobeidi et al 2021b savari et al 2021 shahangian et al 2021 several studies have found a negative relationship between self efficacy and behavior for example in an interpersonal and cross sectional analysis vancouver et al 2001 2002 found that whereas a person s performance is positively related to the next self efficacy self efficacy is negatively related to the next performance the data suggest that the positive relationship between self efficacy and performance commonly found in correlation analyses may partly be a function of the effect of performance on self efficacy not the other way around vancouver and kendall 2006 also noted that the effect of self efficacy is positive in processes of change at the target level modification or selection behavior because the fact that few resources are required is associated with greater self efficacy self efficacy is directly related to the target level in cases with fewer resource requirements these estimates actually lead to the allocation of fewer resources and as a result performance decreases a meta analysis by boyer et al 2000 showed that under certain circumstances a negative impact of self efficacy on behavior or performance may be expected stone 1994 found that high self efficacy leads to overconfidence in one s abilities people with high self efficacy pay less attention and expend less effort than their counterparts with low self efficacy bandura and jourden 1991 found similar results in this regard they argued that complacent self assurance provides little incentive to work harder to achieve higher levels of performance in the iranian farming community self efficacy has been associated with increased belief in destiny because of the inverse relationship between maladaptation and adaptation the negative effect of self efficacy on adaptation behaviors is logical the reason why perceived self efficacy has led to increased maladaptation is attributable to several issues for example farmers who have high skills and knowledge regarding adaptation methods believe that god has greater knowledge and see the atmospheric conditions of the past and future as destiny and as lying in the hands of god this is one of the limitations of the study and needs to be addressed in future research in addition these special conditions can be explained by the fact that water scarcity is an old problem in this region and farmers have been trying to adapt to it for many years these adaptive methods are often simple and farmers have learned them from others this makes them overconfident in their ability so that they pay little attention to adaptation and expend less effort on it 6 conclusion to control the adverse effects of water scarcity and climate change farmers must adapt to encourage this the factors influencing their adaptive behaviors need to be known can perceptions and a spiritual way of thinking can influence adaptive behaviors in the current study a model was established based on the mppacc to predict the effect of cognitive factors on adaptation several findings can be deduced from the research first cognitive factors including two main components of perceived risk and perceived adaptive capacity not including perceived severity and perceived response efficacy affect maladaptation and adaptive behaviors perceived susceptibility perceived self efficacy and perceived cost affect the constructs of maladaptation and adaptation behaviors perceived severity did not affect any of the maladaptation and adaptive behaviors perceived response efficacy only affected maladaptation in addition maladaptation is a negative predictor of adaptive behavior indeed the relationship between these components and adaptive behavior is mediated by the maladaptation this study contributes to the literature in different ways first it adds to the limited number of studies that have used the mppacc and demonstrates the applicability of this model in the context of water scarcity second the findings confirm that the mppacc is an effective model for understanding the behavior of people faced with a threat it also provides strong evidence for adding perceptions of a phenomenon s occurrence to the mppacc given that perceptions of water scarcity were in this study a positive predictor of risk perception 7 policy implication and limitations the research findings support government actors including food and agriculture organizations agricultural extension centers and water resources department along with other official and non official organizations and associations related to natural resource conservation whose goal is to encourage farmers to conduct adaptation understanding the impact of cognitive constructs on adaptive behaviors helps policymakers to improve people s understanding and their economic situations by creating social discourses and demonstrating the effects of water scarcity and adaptation the results emphasize the fact that factors such as social discourses can play a role in increasing perceived risk and perceived adaptive capacity educational programs that involve posters social networks radio television or the creation of an environment with high value information with regard to farmers will thus help improve the social discourse regarding the risks of water scarcity and appropriate adaptive measures a major source of social discourse are the agriculture experts and extension agents who can increase understanding of risk and capacity for adaptation by providing education about adaptive methods and water scarcity risks policy development should be aimed at expanding the dissemination of information in farmers communities agricultural service centers and environmental associations should regularly invite farmers to virtual groups or face to face meetings where water scarcity and adaptation issues are discussed to increase adaptation capacity this study has emphasized the cognitive effects of economic factors on adaptation behaviors policymakers need to come up with plans to reduce adaptation costs both financially and in terms of time and effort for instance by reducing administrative bureaucracy to receive basic services and special agricultural loans although this study performed a valuable analysis of cognitive factors influencing adaptive behaviors to water scarcity it has several limitations first adaptive behaviors have been assessed based on self reported responses as such responses are probably biased and as self reported behavior may not correspond to actual behavior it is suggested that future studies examine farmers actual behaviors second the possibility of a generalization of the findings is limited the research results are obtained from a sample of farmers in khuzestan and are probably not valid for the entire population of farmers in iran third this study is also based on survey research and examines farmers perceptions maladaptation and behaviors at a point in time which means that causal inferences cannot be made about it fourth the inability to adapt or take adaptive measures can be due to socioeconomic or other non cognitive constraints frank et al 2011 something that must be considered in future work finally the proposed model predicted 49 of the variance in behavior which indicates that 51 of behavior is driven by other factors such as objective barriers to adjustment grothmann and patt 2005 trust and social capital paul et al 2016 political support chen et al 2014 or access to extension services alam 2015 these factors can be added to the conceptual model in this research to increase its predictive power declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9629,to support effective adaptation in the agriculture sector through policy and practice it is essential to know how farmers as the primary decision makers regarding land use understand and respond to water scarcity using the model of private proactive adaptation to climate change mppacc as a basic framework for the study the research investigated the effects of cognitive factors on maladaptation in farmers incremental adaptation to water scarcity as a climate risk data were collected during face to face interviews with 250 farmers of irrigated lands in khuzestan province iran the structural equation modeling results showed that the research model predicted 49 of the variance in adaptive behavior and 24 of the variance in maladaptation these results provide strong empirical evidence for the hypothesis that maladaptation has an important and negative effect on determining adaptive behaviors β 33 moreover perceived susceptibility β 42 β 38 perceived cost β 21 β 32 and perceived self efficacy β 31 β 29 directly affected both adaptive behavior and maladaptation this study contributes to the literature by i adding to the limited number of studies on the mppacc ii confirming the efficiency of this model in the water scarcity context as the mppacc can be used to understand behavior of people faced with an environmental threat and iii improving knowledge regarding the impact of belief in climate change on the constructs of the mppacc graphical abstract ga1 keywords water scarcity risk appraisal maladaptation adaptive capacity self efficacy 1 introduction the global climate change crisis is inextricably linked to water increased greenhouse gas emissions and consequently global warming have led to change and disturbance in the natural hydrological cycle mehrazar et al 2020 paudel et al 2020 examples of this imbalance are variations in the quantity and seasonal distribution of precipitation increasingly intense precipitation increased fluctuations in temperature and severe weather events rising sea levels in coastal communities increased evapotranspiration and decreased soil moisture these conditions threaten water security in many parts of the world especially at lower latitudes and in subtropical regions denicola et al 2015 it is predicted for example that by 2070 water resources will decrease by 20 and that the amount of surface land under water stress will increase from 19 to 35 because of climate change pakmehr et al 2020 moreover disturbances in the hydrological cycle significantly affect water quality and the availability or scarcity of water denicola et al 2015 shadkam et al 2016 water scarcity has many negative consequences for various socioecological systems including agriculture mehrazar et al 2020 savari et al 2022 porter et al 2014 pointed out that in the past 30 years climate change has reduced the world s agricultural production by 1 5 per decade water crises are significant threats to sustainable living systems environmental economic political or technological and require an immediate response taylor and sonnenfeld 2017 the reality of climate change and water scarcity cannot be overlooked in the middle east especially in iran daneshvar et al 2019 rouzaneh et al 2021 there have been 27 droughts in iran in the past 40 years madani et al 2016 about 37 million iranians were affected by a drought that lasted from 1980 to 2014 and was estimated to have resulted in losses amounting to usd 3 3 billion hesam et al 2021 people s response to climate uncertainty and the complexity of socioecological systems is very much dependent on their ability to learn about resources and crises in the environment and how to adapt to them galaz 2005 effective adaptation in the agricultural sector is important in terms of reducing vulnerability and adverse climate effects bandyopadhyay et al 2011 savari and amghani 2022 chenani et al 2021 zobeidi et al 2021a smit et al 2000 defined adaptation as the adjustment that takes place within socioeconomic and ecological systems in response to real or expected variability in climate and its effects researchers distinguish between two types of adaptation incremental and transformational smit and skinner 2002 park et al 2012 shikuku et al 2017 in the context of climate change incremental adaptation involves the development of actions and behaviors that reduce the harm or increase the benefits of natural changes in climate and severe events kates et al 2012 and is characterized by a continuous response to climate hazards in an existing system in contrast transformational adaptation is a process that leads to changes in the biophysical social or economic components of a system park et al 2012 and involves making changes to a set of variables that control the performance of the system this differs from incremental change in which adjustments are made to allow current goals to be achieved under changed conditions robertson and murray prior 2016 the present study focuses on incremental adaptation which is of fundamental importance in agriculture feng et al 2017 when farmers use incremental decision making they reduce risk by making smaller gradual changes instead of taking on complex decisions nielsen 2009 examples of incremental adaptation läderach et al 2017 are the cultivation of new varieties chhetri et al 2012 alam 2015 changes to the timing of cultivation deressa et al 2009 finger et al 2011 gandure et al 2013 shaffril et al 2018 diversification of production which includes the diversification of species and the cultivation of various types of crops intercropping the simultaneous cultivation of several plants see deressa et al 2009 alauddin and sarker 2014 and changes to the type of crop cultivated chhetri et al 2012 shaffril et al 2018 as farmers are the implementation agents of adaptation policies and programs their behavior affects the ways in which these programs are implemented and whether they are successful home et al 2014 understanding farmers behavior and the factors that affect their adaptation is key to strengthening adaptive capacity and improving sustainable agriculture it helps local agricultural systems produce sustainable food or design and implement appropriate adaptive measures such as incentives laws or institutional reforms feola et al 2015 in order to achieve agricultural security and food security home et al 2014 feola et al 2015 belay et al 2017 fadina and barjolle 2018 thereby improving the socioeconomic resilience of agricultural communities amir et al 2020 shikuku et al 2017 believe that farmers differ in their ability to adapt and that different factors in particular financial and nonfinancial costs can influence adaptation strategies this study seeks to answer the question what factors influence farmers adoption of adaptive behaviors to water scarcity before identifying those factors it is important to determine whether farmers are prepared to adopt specific adaptive measures awareness of climate change is a prerequisite for engaging in adaptive behaviors mahmood et al 2020 although some farmers believe that climate change is occurring they are not yet ready to adapt a spiritual way of thinking on the part of these farmers must be considered when accounting for their maladaptation although farmers who engage in spiritual thinking accept the concept of adaptive behaviors they also believe that all events including climate change are predetermined and inevitable mahmood et al 2020 thus maladaptation in this context can involve an optimistic bias or the postponing of decisions to act or not to act in favor of a wait and see approach westcott et al 2017 it can thus be a barrier to adaptation le dang et al 2014 westcott et al 2017 this study pursues two main objectives first identification of farmers beliefs with regard to climate change and the factors that determine their adaptation to water scarcity and second consideration of the effects of maladaptation and other cognitive factors on their adaptive behaviors different theories have been deployed to identify the psychological and cognitive factors that influence adaptive behaviors behavioral theories identify the determinants of behavior through socio cognitive and perceptual processes theories related to agricultural adaptation include ajzen s 1985 theory of planned behavior derived from the theory of reasoned action ajzen and fishbein 1975 protection motivation theory pmt rogers 1975 and the theory of values beliefs norms stern et al 1999 these theories have been empirically tested modified and redefined to explain agricultural adaptation in different regions bagagnan et al 2019 luu et al 2019 for example studies have used the theory of planned behavior masud et al 2016 arunrat et al 2017 and pmt kuruppu and liverman 2011 gebrehiwot and van der veen 2015 bagagnan et al 2019 luu et al 2019 mitter et al 2019 delfiyan et al 2020 pakmehr et al 2020 in the fields of adaptation to climate change and water management few studies however have specifically addressed subjective adaptive capacity although methodological approaches are evolving simultaneously with new empirical studies one comprehensive and effective approach to recognizing adaptive capacity involves the model of private proactive adaptation to climate change mppacc this framework was proposed by grothmann and patt in 2005 the mppacc is important for two reasons first it can provide insights into people s perceptions of climate impacts and second it can broaden analyses to understand individuals capacity to adapt to climate change which is often ignored in traditional studies on adaptation kuruppu and liverman 2011 it is only the mppacc that takes into account maladaptation based on how spiritual thinking can reduce an individual s intention to engage in adaptive behavior grothmann and patt 2005 farmers spiritual beliefs have been paid very little attention in the literature grothmann and patt 2005 this is why this theory is well suited in this research to analyzing adaptation and maladaptation in empirical research on water scarcity 2 theoretical framework the mppacc is based on protection motivation theory pmt developed by r w rogers in 1975 pmt was initially proposed as a theory mainly in health risk studies before being extended to studies of environmental disasters and climate change bockarjova and steg 2014 the mppacc adds the following elements to pmt social discourse risk experience reliance on public infrastructure cognitive biases and heuristics adaptation incentives and objective adaptive capacity actual barriers of these the present study focuses on social discourse and risk experience according to pmt individuals making decisions to protect themselves through adaptation go through two cognitive appraisal processes risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal risk appraisal involves understanding the probability of being threatened perceived susceptibility and the seriousness of that threat perceived severity perceived susceptibility refers to people s expectations of being exposed to a threat whereas perceived severity refers to their assessment of the harmfulness magnitude of that threat grothmann and patt 2003 tessema et al 2019 boazar et al 2020 adaptation appraisal refers to the ability to avoid damage from threats while assessing the costs of performing avoidant actions which leads to an awareness of perceived adaptive capacity kuruppu and liverman 2011 adaptation appraisal has three subcomponents perceived response efficacy perceived self efficacy and perceived cost perceived response efficacy what bandura 1977 called outcome expectancy is the belief that adaptive measures or responses are effective at protecting individuals from threats frank et al 2011 perceived self efficacy refers to individuals perceived ability to perform an action or execute adaptive responses grothmann and patt 2003 yazdanpanah et al 2021 mortreux and barnett 2017 pointed out that if people hold distorted beliefs about their ability to manage climate stress and impacts this can prevent them from adapting ung et al 2016 emphasized that self efficacy predicts both anticipatory and reactive adaptation to climate change a meta analysis by van valkengoed and steg 2019 also showed that both perceived response efficacy and perceived self efficacy directly affect adaptive behavior finally perceived cost refers to the cost of implementing adaptive responses grothmann and patt 2003 2005 bozorgparvar et al 2018 grothmann and patt 2005 pointed out that this can include any financial personal time or even effort costs associated with implementing an adaptive response to risk reduction people s cognitions always depend on social contexts especially social discourses for example people s perceptions of the risk of climate change or their capacity to adapt to it are shaped and influenced by what they hear about climate change from the media friends colleagues neighbors or government agencies grothmann and patt 2003 according to grothmann and patt 2005 social discourse can predict risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal in other words having had temporary or incidental training may contribute to an individual s general awareness of climate risks and adaptation mitter et al 2019 according to the mppacc depending on the results of risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal an individual can respond with two distinct behaviors adaptation or maladaptation these are also known as protective and non protective reactions adaptive or protective behaviors which occur when risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal are high prevent physical and financial harm non protective behaviors include maladaptive responses involving coping reactions based on avoidance e g denial optimism wishful thinking fatalism see westcott et al 2017 maladaptive responses prevent only the negative feelings such as fear that a person has as a result of perceiving danger they do not prevent physical or financial harm to the person grothmann and patt 2005 grothmann and reusswig 2006 maladaptation itself is defined as avoidance reactions denial wishful thinking fatalism or wrong adaptation that inadvertently increases harm le dang 2014 the original definition of maladaptation is considered in this study this focuses on psychological perspectives it is known as avoidant coping and is based on cognitive biases mortreux and barnett 2017 livneh 2019a b defined avoidance coping as a behavioral or cognitive effort to ignore or avoid a problem or illness a fatalist for example believes that everything is preordained and their belief framework is related to a belief in god akter et al 2017 mahmood et al 2020 feng et al 2017 noted that fatalism wishful thinking and denial of the risk of climate change all hinder farmers intention to adapt experiencing an environmental problem such as drought can play an important role in shaping environmental perceptions because experience is the basis for cognition zamasiya et al 2017 previous experience or personal experience direct experience can be associated with increased risk perception although the nature of this impact is contested van der linden 2015 mortreux and barnett 2017 the current study examines the direct impact of maladaptation on behavior there is strong evidence that maladaptation influences adaptive behavior akter et al 2017 mahmood et al 2020 finally the belief in climate change as a determinant of risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal is also considered in the model in depth studies have confirmed the impact on risk perception of the belief that climate change is real hyland et al 2016 zobeidi et al 2020 talanow et al 2021 this study focuses specifically on a belief in water scarcity fig 1 shows the study framework based on the mppacc 3 methodology 3 1 sample and study area the current study used a cross sectional design the target population was farmers in the hot and dry climate of khuzestan province iran because of the high potential for adaptation in irrigated agricultural lands the target group was farmers of irrigated lands n 45 000 the statistical sample size was determined using cochran s formula equal to 250 farmers who were selected using multistage stratified random sampling five counties behbahan dasht e azadegan hamidiyeh hoveyzeh and bavi were randomly selected first one or two districts from each county were randomly selected then one village was randomly selected from each section and finally several farmers were randomly selected from each village data collection was performed through face to face interviews using a questionnaire in august and september 2020 the questionnaire was then distributed in the selected areas via meetings with farmers at their farms completion of the questionnaire was entirely voluntary each interview lasted between 20 and 40 min the descriptive analysis showed that all farmers were male aged between 19 and 75 the mean age of the respondents was 44 8 years 11 98 the average family size was about 6 2 94 the average number of years of agricultural work experience or agricultural experience was about 20 12 03 with a range from 1 to 50 years the average size of the agricultural land whether rented or owned was 15 16 ha 20 59 the average distances from farm to market and agricultural extension center were 25 63 km 16 18 and 21 72 km 15 97 respectively finally 108 farmers 44 6 had a second job the remaining 55 4 had no other job 3 2 survey instrument a survey was created to assess the application of the mppacc to predict farmers adaptive behavior the structured perception based questionnaire consisted of mppacc constructs belief in climate change and socioeconomic variables survey questions were based on the literature on farmers behaviors in iran maleksaeidi et al 2016 delfiyan et al 2020 pakmehr et al 2020 2021 as well as on reviews of cognitive factors influencing farmers decisions in general rainear and christensen 2017 tajeri moghadam et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and climate adaptation in particular grothmann and patt 2005 le dang et al 2014 2018 feng et al 2017 akhtar et al 2018 luu et al 2019 table 1 shows the items in the questionnaire along with their sources farmers were asked to agree or disagree with all items using a 5 point likert scale from 1 very low to 5 very high the content validity of the questionnaire was assessed using the opinions of a panel of experts in various fields of agricultural and water sciences the results showed that the items represented the corresponding constructs the reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire were evaluated with cronbach s alphas obtained from a pilot study of 30 farmers in behbahan khuzestan province as shown in table 1 cronbach s alpha for all constructs indicated good to excellent reliability αs 0 780 0 936 3 3 data analysis to investigate the factors affecting adaptive behaviors structural equation modeling sem in amos was conducted equation modeling can calculate measurement error and also simultaneously estimate path coefficients of the model chen et al 2016 sem is commonly used to validate hypothetical or theoretical models ho et al 2016 the two steps of sem include confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the appropriateness of the measurement model and then sem itself anderson and gerbing 1988 confirmatory factor analysis was applied to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of the measurement model by checking reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity cronbach s alpha t statistics composite reliability cr and average variance extracted ave were used to confirm the validity and reliability of the research model the internal consistency of a model is confirmed when cronbach s alpha is above the threshold of 0 5 moreover t statistics are used to check convergent validity if t statistic is above the threshold of 1 96 5 level it is confirmed cr and ave are two other indicators of convergent validity to confirm convergent validity the ave and cr of each construct should be greater than 0 5 and 0 7 respectively the measurement model should show the appropriateness of the empirical data and meet the specific criteria shown in table 2 for a measurement model to be considered valid the relative chi square χ2 df should be less than 5 the acceptable threshold for the adjusted goodness of fit index agfi goodness of fit index gfi normed fit index and comparative fit index is 0 9 although hair et al 2010 noted that values for agfi and the comparative fit index from 0 8 to 0 9 are considered marginal the acceptable threshold for the root mean square error of approximation is 0 08 3 4 verification of measurement model several items with factor loadings of less than 0 5 were removed from the measurement model the ave for all constructs was greater than 0 5 moreover the calculated cr for all constructs was greater than 0 7 table 3 t was higher than 1 96 for all items and cronbach s alpha was higher than 0 7 for all constructs table 1 according to these results the research model had good convergent validity the square root of each construct was also higher than the correlation of that construct with other constructs accordingly discriminant validity was confirmed table 3 the fit indices of the measurement model are shown in table 2 a comparison of the findings to the recommended indicators showed that the model had relatively good fit although some indicators including gfi agfi and the normed fit index were below the recommended values they were within marginal levels see hair et al 2010 4 results 4 1 description and relationship between constructs descriptive results table 1 showed that the mean scores of perception of climate change risk experience and social discourse were 4 09 3 78 and 2 95 out of 5 respectively farmers have a high belief in climate change and experience of risk in a context where there is moderate social discourse the mean scores of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of water scarcity were 3 66 and 3 81 out of 5 respectively indicating that the perceived threat was relatively high the mean scores of perceived response efficacy perceived cost and self efficacy were 3 78 3 44 and 2 75 out of 5 respectively indicating that the perceived adaptation capacity was from a moderate to high level in the study of maladaptation of farmers the results showed the farmers to have relatively high maladaptation with a mean of 3 03 out of 5 although their adaptation behaviors were moderate with a mean score of 2 39 out of 5 4 2 belief in water scarcity the farmers in the study were well aware of water scarcity with about 80 perceiving that rainfall had decreased compared to the past m 3 97 sd 1 01 levels of water in rivers springs and wells had decreased m 4 06 sd 0 89 the amount of agricultural and drinking water had decreased m 4 10 sd 0 90 drought was occurring m 4 10 sd 0 77 and agriculture was affected by water scarcity m 4 19 sd 0 70 see fig 2 on the whole it was clear that the farmers saw major signs of water scarcity most of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that there were signs of water scarcity in terms of reduced rainfall reduced river and well levels lack of water for agriculture and drinking drought occurrence and the effects of water shortages on agriculture 4 3 structural model after confirming the suitability of the measurement model sem was performed with the maximum likelihood estimation the results showed

had a negative effect on adaptive behavior β 0 33 t 4 42 p 0 0001 the research model was able to predict 24 of the variance in maladaptation and 49 of the variance in adaptation the proposed model was able to predict 36 of the variance in perceived susceptibility 30 in perceived severity 28 in perceived response efficacy and 13 in perceived self efficacy however this model was not able to predict perceived cost 5 discussion social discourse was directly related to perceived response efficacy and perceived self efficacy social discourse refers to information received from or within a community grothmann and patt 2005 here it refers to information related to water scarcity and adaptation heard or received from friends and neighbors government or nongovernmental organizations or the media the more people more hear and talk about water scarcity or adaptation strategies or the more information they receive from local television and radio or agricultural extension experts the more perceived effectiveness and self efficacy they will have this finding is consistent with the literature on the mppacc many studies confirm that information abid et al 2017 wolf 2011 social networks phuong et al 2018 and cues to action tajeri moghadam et al 2020 all influence adaptation agricultural policymakers and organizations need to raise the discourses on water scarcity and adaptation through the media associations and rural groups to increase the level of social discourse regarding farmers and villagers belief in climate change also affected threat appraisal including both perceived susceptibility and perceived severity studies have shown that a belief in the occurrence of climate change can affect perceptions of risk reser et al 2012 and arbuckle et al 2013 le dang et al 2014 lee et al 2015 mitter et al 2019 to improve adaptation in agriculture special focus should be placed on perceptions of drought and climate change providing meteorological statistics and charts on changing trends especially in terms of declining rainfall in recent years and rising temperatures will help improve understanding of climate change risk experience affected both subcomponents of threat appraisal according to carlton and jacobson 2013 the experience of climate related risk is one of the dimensions of risk salience and directly affects perceptions of environmental risk le dang 2014 showed that risk experience affects the perceived risks of climate change in one or more aspects of farmers lives such as physical financial production social or psychological relationships as well as overall perceived risk contrary to expectations perceived susceptibility negatively influenced maladaptation namely the reactions of people who feel more threatened by the effects of water scarcity will be more avoidant this is probably because farmers think that there is nothing they can do to combat the widespread harm of water scarcity and as a result feel powerless and consider water scarcity to be a phenomenon that human beings cannot control although this finding is inconsistent with the mppacc there are studies to confirm it for example researchers have found that threat assessment negatively affects maladaptation le dang et al 2014 talanow et al 2021 talanow et al 2021 pointed out that this may be due to farmers who understand the dangers of climate change to their livelihood and crops tending to adopt adaptive behaviors which makes them less likely to choose maladaptive options to increase risk perception education should focus on the harms and adverse consequences of climate change and water scarcity indirect training such as putting up notices and posters in rural areas containing photos of damage to agriculture can also increase the perception of risk among farmers perceived response efficacy negatively affected maladaptation those who believe that adaptation can prevent the loss of products and revenue will have a greater intention to adapt and as a result will be less likely to be maladaptive these findings are consistent with grothmann and patt 2005 who showed that adaptation assessments are negatively related to adaptation training is given on the applicability of adaptation methods in harm reduction to improve adaptation more importantly however it is suggested that farmers who have successfully implemented adaptation strategies can be brought forward to demonstrate increases in the perceived effectiveness of the response holding meetings within agricultural service centers and agricultural extension centers among farmers who have successfully made adaptations and other farmers is suggested the cost of adaptation perceived cost had a negative influence on maladaptation when farmers believe that implementing adaptive behaviors comes at a high cost their adaptive behavior decreases three items were used to measure perceived cost 1 adaptive measures are very expensive 2 adaptive measures are time consuming and 3 it takes a lot of effort to adapt my farm to water scarcity a high perceived cost of adaptation in terms of time money and effort leads farmers to ignore a threat and take no action these findings generally confirm the previous research on the cognitive dimensions of climate change as they relate to farmers adaptation in particular they provide strong empirical evidence for the hypothesis that maladaptation or avoidant reactions wishful thinking denial and fatalism play an important role in determining adaptive behaviors a study by akter et al 2017 focusing on fatalism showed that farmers with fatalistic views of the consequences of climate change were significantly less likely to choose an adaptation strategy such as insurance fatalism is characterized by the perception that the person has no control over events or ability to change them fatalistic farmers would rather not make any response to deal with water scarcity and climate change and they do not perceive climate change or water scarcity as threats that are big enough to make them change their agricultural methods zobeidi et al 2016 other studies have found that maladaptation is a barrier to adaptation management grothmann and patt 2005 le dang et al 2014 2018 feng et al 2017 luu et al 2019 mahmood et al 2020 talanow et al 2021 in general people who are more fatalistic who deny the impact of water scarcity and who are wishful thinkers are less likely to engage in adaptive behaviors some actors who engage in maladaptive behaviors feel that there is no need to change and prefer to maintain the status quo they feel that maintaining the status quo has many benefits and believe that if a change is difficult or may not lead to improvement why bother le dang et al 2014 maladaptive behaviors can be rooted in religion or culture le dang et al 2014 pointed out that while it is very risky to state that maladaptation is all due to religious beliefs this aspect should in any case be considered in adaptation programs in the iranian farming community because of farmers lower literacy and their faith in god it is necessary to focus on reducing maladaptation as the mean of the maladaptation variable shows the rate of maladaptation in this community is relatively high higher than 2 5 out of 5 to reduce maladaptation some basic measures can be suggested the use of films and stories to depict the crisis of climate change and show what agricultural activities were particularly affected by the crisis this can help people move away from superstition and other misconceptions people also need to be taught that humans are more responsible for environmental crises than natural causes and that farmers must be aware of their own responsibilities in the climate crisis there is a relationship between higher perceived susceptibility and higher adaptive behavior because unless people believe that they are in danger or harm they will probably not do anything adaptations to water scarcity included changing planting dates conservation tillage no tillage mulching crop diversification and not cultivating crops with high water requirements changing to crops with low water requirements if farmers feel that the consequences of water scarcity are likely to make their farms crops and assets vulnerable to harm they will implement more adaptive behaviors this finding is consistent with the results of other research keshavarz and karami 2016 perceived adaptation cost was negatively correlated with adaptive behavior which is consistent with pmt the mppacc and other research that has drawn on these theories gebrehiwot and van der veen 2015 keshavarz and karami 2016 delfiyan et al 2020 contrary to expectations self efficacy had a significant negative effect on adaptive behavior many studies however have confirmed the positive influence of self efficacy on diverse environmental behavior ung et al 2016 van valkengoed and steg 2019 zobeidi et al 2021b savari et al 2021 shahangian et al 2021 several studies have found a negative relationship between self efficacy and behavior for example in an interpersonal and cross sectional analysis vancouver et al 2001 2002 found that whereas a person s performance is positively related to the next self efficacy self efficacy is negatively related to the next performance the data suggest that the positive relationship between self efficacy and performance commonly found in correlation analyses may partly be a function of the effect of performance on self efficacy not the other way around vancouver and kendall 2006 also noted that the effect of self efficacy is positive in processes of change at the target level modification or selection behavior because the fact that few resources are required is associated with greater self efficacy self efficacy is directly related to the target level in cases with fewer resource requirements these estimates actually lead to the allocation of fewer resources and as a result performance decreases a meta analysis by boyer et al 2000 showed that under certain circumstances a negative impact of self efficacy on behavior or performance may be expected stone 1994 found that high self efficacy leads to overconfidence in one s abilities people with high self efficacy pay less attention and expend less effort than their counterparts with low self efficacy bandura and jourden 1991 found similar results in this regard they argued that complacent self assurance provides little incentive to work harder to achieve higher levels of performance in the iranian farming community self efficacy has been associated with increased belief in destiny because of the inverse relationship between maladaptation and adaptation the negative effect of self efficacy on adaptation behaviors is logical the reason why perceived self efficacy has led to increased maladaptation is attributable to several issues for example farmers who have high skills and knowledge regarding adaptation methods believe that god has greater knowledge and see the atmospheric conditions of the past and future as destiny and as lying in the hands of god this is one of the limitations of the study and needs to be addressed in future research in addition these special conditions can be explained by the fact that water scarcity is an old problem in this region and farmers have been trying to adapt to it for many years these adaptive methods are often simple and farmers have learned them from others this makes them overconfident in their ability so that they pay little attention to adaptation and expend less effort on it 6 conclusion to control the adverse effects of water scarcity and climate change farmers must adapt to encourage this the factors influencing their adaptive behaviors need to be known can perceptions and a spiritual way of thinking can influence adaptive behaviors in the current study a model was established based on the mppacc to predict the effect of cognitive factors on adaptation several findings can be deduced from the research first cognitive factors including two main components of perceived risk and perceived adaptive capacity not including perceived severity and perceived response efficacy affect maladaptation and adaptive behaviors perceived susceptibility perceived self efficacy and perceived cost affect the constructs of maladaptation and adaptation behaviors perceived severity did not affect any of the maladaptation and adaptive behaviors perceived response efficacy only affected maladaptation in addition maladaptation is a negative predictor of adaptive behavior indeed the relationship between these components and adaptive behavior is mediated by the maladaptation this study contributes to the literature in different ways first it adds to the limited number of studies that have used the mppacc and demonstrates the applicability of this model in the context of water scarcity second the findings confirm that the mppacc is an effective model for understanding the behavior of people faced with a threat it also provides strong evidence for adding perceptions of a phenomenon s occurrence to the mppacc given that perceptions of water scarcity were in this study a positive predictor of risk perception 7 policy implication and limitations the research findings support government actors including food and agriculture organizations agricultural extension centers and water resources department along with other official and non official organizations and associations related to natural resource conservation whose goal is to encourage farmers to conduct adaptation understanding the impact of cognitive constructs on adaptive behaviors helps policymakers to improve people s understanding and their economic situations by creating social discourses and demonstrating the effects of water scarcity and adaptation the results emphasize the fact that factors such as social discourses can play a role in increasing perceived risk and perceived adaptive capacity educational programs that involve posters social networks radio television or the creation of an environment with high value information with regard to farmers will thus help improve the social discourse regarding the risks of water scarcity and appropriate adaptive measures a major source of social discourse are the agriculture experts and extension agents who can increase understanding of risk and capacity for adaptation by providing education about adaptive methods and water scarcity risks policy development should be aimed at expanding the dissemination of information in farmers communities agricultural service centers and environmental associations should regularly invite farmers to virtual groups or face to face meetings where water scarcity and adaptation issues are discussed to increase adaptation capacity this study has emphasized the cognitive effects of economic factors on adaptation behaviors policymakers need to come up with plans to reduce adaptation costs both financially and in terms of time and effort for instance by reducing administrative bureaucracy to receive basic services and special agricultural loans although this study performed a valuable analysis of cognitive factors influencing adaptive behaviors to water scarcity it has several limitations first adaptive behaviors have been assessed based on self reported responses as such responses are probably biased and as self reported behavior may not correspond to actual behavior it is suggested that future studies examine farmers actual behaviors second the possibility of a generalization of the findings is limited the research results are obtained from a sample of farmers in khuzestan and are probably not valid for the entire population of farmers in iran third this study is also based on survey research and examines farmers perceptions maladaptation and behaviors at a point in time which means that causal inferences cannot be made about it fourth the inability to adapt or take adaptive measures can be due to socioeconomic or other non cognitive constraints frank et al 2011 something that must be considered in future work finally the proposed model predicted 49 of the variance in behavior which indicates that 51 of behavior is driven by other factors such as objective barriers to adjustment grothmann and patt 2005 trust and social capital paul et al 2016 political support chen et al 2014 or access to extension services alam 2015 these factors can be added to the conceptual model in this research to increase its predictive power declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
