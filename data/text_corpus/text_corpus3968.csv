19840,it is possible to distribute drinking water without a disinfectant residual when the treated water is biologically stable the objective of this study was to determine the impact of easily and slowly biodegradable compounds on the biostability of the drinking water at three full scale production plants which use the same surface water and on the regrowth conditions in the related distribution systems easily biodegradable compounds in the drinking water were determined with aoc p17 nox during 2012 2015 slowly biodegradable organic compounds measured as particulate and or high molecular organic carbon phmoc were monitored at the inlet and after the different treatment stages of the three treatments during the same period the results show that phmoc 300 470 μg c l 1 was approximately 10 of the toc in the surface water and was removed to 50 100 μg c l 1 the phmoc in the water consisted of 40 60 of carbohydrates and 10 of proteins a significant and strong positive correlation was observed for phmoc concentrations and two recently introduced bioassay methods for slowly biodegradable compounds aoc a3 and biomass production potential bpc14 moreover these three parameters in the biological active carbon effluent bacf of the three plants showed a positive correlation with regrowth in the drinking water distribution system which was assessed with aeromonas heterotrophic plate counts coliforms and large invertebrates in contrast the aoc p17 nox concentrations did not correlate with these regrowth parameters we therefore conclude that slowly biodegradable compounds in the treated water from these treatment plants seem to have a greater impact on regrowth in the distribution system than easily biodegradable compounds graphical abstract image 1 keywords

annual geometric mean and for bacteria belonging to the genus aeromonas the value of traditional hpc22 however has been in debate for decades who 2003 van nevel et al 2017 the latter suggesting two alternative regrowth indicators atp and total cell counts van der wielen et al 2016 however demonstrated that in non chlorinated drinking water distribution systems both alternative parameters showed no significant increase in the water whereas hpc22 and aeromonas colony counts were significantly elevated during distribution the value of both parameters was not the objective of our study but our data showed increased hpc22 and aeromonas colony counts during distribution in combination with undesirable regrowth conditions coliform regrowth and esthetical aspects supporting the use of these two

residual chlorine to the finished drinking water at the treatment plants was stopped in 2005 after which the yearly average aeromonas colony counts in the distributed drinking water and the percentages of samples exceeding the aeromonas standard increased at three of the four plants besides the legislative standards the biostability of drinking water in the netherlands is assessed with

particulate and polymeric biodegradable compounds in water several bio chemical parameters have been proposed over the years particulate organic carbon poc is a filtration method developed for seawater menzel and vaccaro 1964 gardner et al 2003 for particulate 0 20 μm carbon transparent exopolymer particles tep alldredge et al 1993 is also a filtration 0 2 0 4 μm method which quantifies specific polysaccharide carbohydrates particles the recently introduced method of liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd huber et al 2011 determines biopolymers as a fraction of nom particulates larger than 0 45 μm excluded the poc method described by van der kooij et al 2015 uses cross flow hemoflow filtration with a much lower pore size of 30 kda 0 01 μm to concentrate the particulate organic and high molecular weight organic carbon compounds mainly biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins furthermore an additional aoc method aoc a3 to quantify biopolymers in water using a flavobacterium johnsoniae strain that is specialized in utilizing polysaccharides and proteins has also recently been developed sack et al 2011 van der kooij et al 2015 suggested that poc might enhance multiplication of aeromonas and other micro organisms in drinking water distribution systems the poc and aoc a3 methods were applied in the current study and poc was renamed to particulate and or high molecular organic carbon phmoc to better describe the organic carbon fraction measured the phmoc method yields a concentrate which can be further characterised as is done in the current study the overall objective of our four year study at three surface water treatment plants operated by evides water company was to monitor and investigate the role of slowly biodegradable organic matter in the biological stability of drinking water our study specifically addresses the following aspects i assess the influence of the source water quality and full scale treatment efficiency with ozone or uv disinfection on phmoc in the drinking water ii characterise phmoc by analysing the concentrate and to determine the role of these compounds in the microbial growth potential of the drinking water and iii correlate these data with regrowth indicators hpc22 aeromonas coliforms and invertebrates in the distribution system 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment plants and distribution systems drinking water company evides produces drinking water from river meuse which is impounded in brabantse biesbosch reservoirs with a retention time of 5 months at the confluence of the rivers rhine and meuse and then transported to four different treatment plants three of these four drinking water production plants were analysed in our study the biesbosch reservoir water is transported to plant 1 and plant 3 in 18 h and to plant 2 in 48 h table 1 during march november the reservoir source water is chlorinated 0 4 0 6 mg l 1 to control mussel growth an important difference in the inlet of the source water at the three plants is the mixing percentage with local reservoir water which potentially changes the water quality during the multi year study this mixing percentage was diminished at plant 1 and plant 2 table 1 the treatment trains of the plants are similar in their use of coagulation separation dual media filtration main disinfection with uv or ozone followed by biologically activated carbon filtration bacf and post disinfection with clo2 prior to the treated water reservoirs at low doses 0 08 mg l 1 to ensure disinfectant concentrations of 0 005 mg l 1 in the distributed drinking water the coagulant dosage and primary floc removal at plant 1 and plant 3 are fecl3 plus starch based coagulant aid wisprofloc addition during the winter period and primary separation by sludge blanket filtration and lamellae separation respectively at plant 2 polyaluminum chloride pac dosing and flotation were used plant 1 applied uv during the total period and a transition from ozone to uv disinfection was part of the study at plant 2 and plant 3 operational differences in bacf were a longer empty bed contact time and lower filtration rate at plant 2 table 1 each plant supplied drinking water to a separate distribution system 2 2 overall set up of the study the multi year study at the three plants was performed between 2012 and 2015 data of the legislative monitoring programme were evaluated to describe the regrowth conditions in each distribution system several distinct temporal periods of relevant changes in conditions with respect to mixing with local reservoir water and the transition from ozone to uv disinfection are described in the following sections data of uv extinction doc and aoc p17 nox were used from the routine water quality monitoring programme 2 2 1 period 1 2012 2013 at plant 1 the biesbosch water passed 100 through the local reservoir water the main disinfection was uv before bacf at plant 1 and ozone before dual media filtration followed by bacf at plant 2 and plant 3 phmoc and the biostability parameters biomass production potential bpp and aoc a3 concentration were monitored in april july september and november at the inlets and at selected locations during treatment at all plants to monitor the effect of coagulation floc removal dual media filtration ozone or uv disinfection and bacf 2 2 2 period 2 2014 a transition period was started at plant 2 where ozone disinfection was replaced by uv disinfection after dual media filtration the uv disinfection was started stepwise in november december 2013 and ozone disinfection was stopped in march 2014 the mixing of the inlet water with local reservoir water was increased from 12 to 25 at the start of this period january march phmoc bpp and aoc a3 concentration were monitored monthly during the period february november 2014 period 2 at the inlet after uv disinfection and bacf at this plant 2 2 3 period 3 2015 the effect of the mixing with local reservoir water at the three plants was studied while mixing with local reservoir water was constant at plant 3 throughout all periods the mixing was reduced from 100 to 6 at plant 1 at plant 2 the mixing was completely stopped table 1 at plant 3 ozone dosage was decreased from 1 2 to 0 6 mg l 1 and uv disinfection was added as the main disinfection process phmoc bpp and aoc a3 concentration were monitored monthly at the inlet water and in the bacf effluent except for april and august 2 3 particulate and or high molecular organic carbon the phmoc concentration in water was measured as described by van der kooij et al 2015 in short 100 l of water were concentrated to 500 ml using cross flow ultrafiltration hemoflow membrane hf80s fresenius medical care with a molecular weigth cut off mwco of nominal 30 kda blocking colloids and particulates 0 01 μm subsequently the total organic carbon toc concentration was determined using a shimadzu toc v analyser the phmoc concentration was calculated from the toc in the concentrate including correcting for the doc concentration in the original water and the concentration factor of the ultrafiltration step in addition to phmoc particulate and or high molecular carbohydrate carbon phmchc was quantified in the concentrate dubois et al 1956 μg c eq l 1 with a glucose c calibration curve in the last stage of the study particulate and or high molecular protein carbon phmpc was quantified μg c l 1 using the coomassie protein assay kit a method described by bradford 1976 and a calibration curve for bovine serum albumine carbon content of bsa of 0 51 chevallier et al 2003 2 4 microbial growth potential mgp of the water the microbial growth potential of the drinking water of the three plants during the study period was assessed using several methods aoc p17 nox aoc a3 and the biomass production potential bpp test in the different water types were determined according to van der kooij and veenendaal 2014 the bpp test in short includes water sampling in aoc free glass stoppered erlenmeyer flasks the addition of phosphate 0 33 mg p l 1 and nitrate 0 8 mg n l 1 and inoculation with one ml of pre filtered 1 2 μm to remove protozoa river water broad range of bacteria bpp samples were incubated at 25 c for 14 days and the growth of the autochthonous microbial community in the water samples was monitored by periodic atp analysis van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 the bpp was expressed as the maximum atp concentration during the first seven days of incubation bp7 ng atp l 1 and the cumulative atp production from day 0 14 bpc14 d ng atp l 1 biodegradable biopolymers in the water were monitored using an adapted aoc method using flavobacterium johnsoniae strain a3 as described by sack et al 2010 2011 2 5 microbiological water quality during distribution data from the legislative microbial monitoring programme and hydrobiological monitoring programme were used to assess the micro biological water quality in the distribution systems of the three plants the microbiological water quality was determined by heterotrophic plate counts hpc22 nen en iso 6222 aeromonas colony count using membrane filtration 0 45 μm of 100 ml and incubation of the filter on ampicillin dextrin agar havelaar et al 1987 for 24 2 h at 30 1 c coliforms were monitored using membrane filtration 0 45 μm of 100 ml nen en iso 9308 1 and identification using a maldi biotyper system bruker daltonics gmbh bremen germany software maldi biotyper 3 1 hydrobiological water quality monitoring for invertebrates was performed at a number of randomly selected hydrants in the distribution system using the method presented by van lieverloo et al 2004 the total invertebrate concentration mg m 3 was calculated from the number of microscopically counted invertebrates and their individual conversion factor mg per organism assessed as described by carpentier et al 1999 2 6 statistics the datasets were first statistically tested for normality with the shapiro wilk test using spss 16 0 differences in the general water quality parameters in the drinking water table 2 was tested by the one way anova analysis and bonferoni test p 0 05 differences in hpc22 aeromonas and invertebrate data from the distribution system table 2 fig 1 were tested with the non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test for independent samples p 0 05 and presented in the figure directly the paired samples t test paired by the month of sampling to account for the seasonal effects was used to test for differences between the phmoc and aoc concentrations bp7 and bpc14 values of the inlet water and the bacf effluent of the three plants for all presented parameters in tables 2 4 differences between the plants are indicated as superscript per plant at the p 0 05 significance level log linear and linear regression analysis was carried out using excel software a significance level of p 0 05 was applied for all difference and regression analyses 3 results 3 1 microbiological drinking water quality during distribution the colony counts for hpc22 and aeromonas median values were low 1 cfu per ml and 1 cfu per 100 ml respectively in the drinking water after reservoir storage and before distribution table 2 the hpc22 aeromonas and invertebrate biomass data of samples from the distribution system of the three plants over the period 2012 2015 are summarized in fig 1 the results clearly show that the hpc22 and the aeromonas colony counts after treatment were elevated in the samples from the distribution network but were significantly higher in number at plant 1 and plant 3 than at plant 2 there were no significant differences in the number of small invertebrates 500 μm in the distribution samples between the plants but large invertebrates 500 μm were significantly higher in number at plant 1 and plant 3 compared to plant 2 no coliforms were detected in the randomly collected legislative distribution samples of plant 2 whereas at plant 1 and plant 3 coliform spp enterobacter citrobacter klebsiella and escherichia spp were occasionally observed at selected distribution locations e coli and other coliform species in the legislative samples were observed in respectively 0 03 and 0 03 of the total samples from the distribution system of plant 1 and in respectively 0 03 and 0 14 of the total samples from the distribution system of plant 3 supplementary information table s2 at plant 1 the highest number of coliforms was 180 cfu 100 ml 1 klebsiella oxytoca and at plant 3 the highest number was 400 cfu 100 ml 1 lelliottia amnigena enterobacter amnigenes 3 2 organic carbon fractions in the source water and the bacf effluent 3 2 1 doc and uv extinction fe and al the average doc concentration and uv extinction uve in the inlet waters at plant 1 plant 2 and plant 3 were not significantly different supplementary information table s2 no difference between the plants was observed for doc in the treated water during 2012 2015 but uve at plant 1 was significantly higher compared to the uve at plant 2 and plant 3 due to the use of ozone at the latter two plants during part of the study period table 2 after establishing uv disinfection at plant 2 in 2014 and 2015 respectively table 1 the uve of the drinking water after these plants increased significantly table 2 thus showing the effect of ozone versus uv disinfection on uve fe concentrations in the drinking water at plant 1 was significantly higher than at plant 2 and plant 3 table 2 and at plant 2 aluminium concentration was higher due to the application of poly aluminium coagulant table 1 3 2 2 phmoc concentrations in inlet water and bacf effluent phmoc concentrations were assessed from single samples the reproducibility of the phmoc concentrations in the drinking water was determined twice by analysing two water samples at the same date which revealed an average relative sd of 17 6 8 5 phmoc concentrations in the inlet waters and the bacf effluent monitored four to seven times per year in 2012 2013 and 2015 at plant 1 and plant 2 are presented in fig 2 and table 3 phmoc concentrations in the inlet waters showed a seasonal variation with the highest concentrations in the first half period of the year at plant 1 the phmoc concentration increased in april 2012 and 2013 which coincided with the rise in water temperature in spring fig 2 in these years the biesbosch water was 100 mixed with local reservoir water at this plant when this mixing percentage was lowered to 6 at the end of 2014 in may and june of 2015 phmoc values in the inlet water at plant 1 were reduced phmoc concentrations in the inlet water of plant 2 were significantly lower and showed less variation than in the inlet water of plant 1 table 3 and fig 2 the highest phmoc concentrations in the inlet water of plant 2 were observed in the early period of february march 2014 where temporarily the mixing percentage with local reservoir had been increased from 12 to 25 table 1 after this mixing percentage had returned to the usual 12 in april 2014 phmoc concentrations dropped and they tended to decline and they were variable throughout the rest of the year the phmoc of the inlet water at plant 3 was between that of the inlet waters at plant 1 and plant 2 table 3 phmoc was reduced during treatment at all plants as shown by the lower phmoc concentrations in the bacf effluent table 3 and fig 2 data of plant 3 is not included in fig 2 due to the lower number of observations for this plant which showed a similar but less variable trend as in the inlet waters throughout the year the phmoc concentration of 57 6 24 8 μg c l 1 in the bacf effluent at plant 2 was significantly lower than the phmoc concentrations of 103 41 5 and 102 26 7 μg c l 1 in the bacf effluents at plant 1 and plant 3 respectively the effect of mixing with local reservoir water on the phmoc in bacf effluent was clearly demonstrated at plant 2 in 2014 with mixing with the local reservoir phmoc concentrations in the inlet water and bacf effluent were 765 921 n 7 and 80 8 32 9 n 6 respectively and after the mixing stopped in 2015 the concentrations fell to 323 119 n 7 and 47 7 11 5 n 7 μg c l 1 respectively based on the average doc concentrations in the drinking water and the inlet water table 3 and s2 and the average phmoc concentrations in these waters table 3 phmoc in the inlet water was on an average 10 of the toc doc phmoc a percentage which decreased with approximately 50 to 3 3 5 3 in the bacf effluent after treatment 3 2 3 biopolymer fractions of phmoc and their correlations the hemoflow concentrates of the samples were analysed for the concentration of carbohydrates and in 2015 also for protein concentrations table 3 the average percentage of carbohydrates chc of phmoc in the inlet waters of the plants was 58 26 n 51 with no significant mutual differences the average chc percentage in the bacf effluent was 49 7 3 n 54 which was significantly lower than in the inlet water this indicates that the relative removal in treatment of carbohydrates was more efficient than the removal of the other phmoc components protein turned out to be a smaller fraction of the phmoc than carbohydrates table 3 the average protein fraction in the phmoc of the inlet waters was 13 5 7 n 17 also for protein this percentage was significantly lower after bacf 9 7 4 1 n 17 than in the inlet waters there was a significant and strong linear correlation between the phmoc and both phmchc and phmpc in the paired samples p 0 05 r2 0 62 and 0 72 respectively as well as for the linear correlation between phmchc and phmpc p 0 05 r2 0 82 3 3 microbial growth potential in the inlet water and bacf effluent 3 3 1 aoc p17 nox and aoc a3 aoc p17 nox in the drinking water of plant 1 was significantly lower than the aoc concentration at plant 2 and plant 3 for the total period table 2 comparison of aoc p17 nox in the drinking waters of plant 2 and plant 3 during the separate periods with ozone or uv revealed that aoc p17 nox of 24 6 9 4 n 24 and 27 6 12 1 n 78 during ozone use at plant 2 and plant 3 decreased to 16 7 2 8 n 20 and 22 6 10 4 n 21 μg acet c eq l 1 respectively after transition to uv these aoc p17 nox data from the three plants including plant 2 with no aeromonas regrowth were higher than the recommended value for biostability of 10 μg c l 1 van der kooij and hijnen 1993 this supports the extended search for additional parameters as presented by van der kooij et al 2015 and applied in the current study relatively high aoc a3 concentrations were observed in the inlet waters of the plants table 4 ranging from 69 9 to 199 7 biopolymer c eq l 1 treatments reduced these concentrations to 4 6 15 3 μg c l 1 in the bacf effluent average aoc a3 concentrations at the inlet and bacf effluent for plant 2 were the lowest table 4 however the differences for this parameter between the plants were not significant which is probably due to the high seasonal variance for aoc a3 concentrations at the three plants 3 3 2 biomass production potential the trends of the bpc14 values in inlet water and bacf effluent of plant 1 and plant 2 showed similar trends throughout the year as observed for phmoc fig 2 with higher values during the beginning of the year with rising temperature and decreasing values in late summer and autumn the relative sd of bp7 and bpc14 was 7 3 6 2 range of 0 27 n 172 the average bp7 and bpc14 values of the inlet water and the bacf effluent are presented in table 4 the bp7 in the inlet water at plant 2 during the total study period was significantly lower than the bp7 in the inlet water of plant 1 and plant 3 the bpc14 in the inlet water of plant 1 was 1590 1710 d ng l 1 which was significantly higher than the bpc14 at plant 2 711 474 d ng l 1 and plant 3 686 369 d ng l 1 in the bacf effluent the bp7 at plant 1 was higher than the bp7 values at plant 2 and plant 3 table 4 but these differences were not significant the atp production curves of the bpp test in the bacf effluent of these plants fig 3 showed no rapid growth during the first days and the maximum value bp7 occurred around five to seven days the bpc14 in the bacf effluent at plant 2 was significantly lower than in the bacf effluent at plant 1 and plant 3 table 4 atp production over the total period of 14 days showed a slow and variable increase without a maximum value between day 7 and day 14 at plant 1 and plant 3 whereas atp concentrations remained constant in most samples of plant 2 fig 3 such a trend in atp concentrations in the bpp test slow growth after 7 days in the bacf effluents is clearly an indication of growth on slowly biodegradable compounds the average bp7 and bpc14 in the bacf effluent of plant 1 and plant 3 were in the same order of magnitude the transition from ozone to uv at plant 2 and plant 3 had no effect on the bpc14 of the bacf effluent data not shown stopping the mixing with local reservoir water in 2015 at plant 2 coincided with a decrease in the bpc14 of the inlet water and bacf effluent samples in 2014 bpc14 of the inlet water and bacf effluent was 1100 555 n 7 and 136 21 9 n 6 respectively whereas in 2015 the bpc14 values of these samples were significantly lower 489 164 n 7 and 75 2 23 1 n 7 respectively 3 4 correlation of phmoc with regrowth indicators and biostability parameters as described in section 3 1 the microbiological water quality of the drinking water during distribution was determined by two regrowth indicators hpc22 and aeromonas this multi year study at three full scale drinking water production plants presented in section 3 2 and 3 3 revealed a positive correlation of the phmoc concentration in the drinking water and the indicated level of regrowth by both regrowth indicators fig 4 the lowest values for hpc22 and aeromonas at plant 2 coincided with the lowest phmoc bp7 and bpc14 values in the drinking water of this plant and also with two other regrowth indicators coliforms section 3 1 and large invertebrates fig 4 the log linear correlation between phmoc and the microbial growth potential bpc14 and aoc a3 was significant p 0 05 and strong r2 0 71 table 5 and fig 4 and this was also true for the log linear between phmchc and both microbial growth potential parameters r2 0 77 the linear and log linear correlation between bpc14 and aoc a3 were both significant p 0 05 and strong r2 0 85 3 5 treatment effects reduction of phmoc and the growth potential the change in phmoc and bpc14 by the overall treatment was calculated from the paired data of the inlet waters and the bacf effluents the highest average phmoc removal 81 9 7 was observed at plant 2 table 3 which was slightly but significantly higher than at plant 1 74 13 and plant 3 71 9 2 despite the lower phmoc concentration in the inlet water of plant 2 table 3 the average reduction in bpc14 by the treatment trains of the three plants was in the same order of magnitude as phmoc removal and ranged from 79 to 83 table 4 data collected after the individual treatment steps in 2013 shows that highest phmoc removal occurred in the dual media filters dmf at plant 1 and plant 3 table 6 whereas the highest amount of phmoc removal at plant 2 was by the coagulation separation process table 6 the effect of coagulation separation on phmoc at plant 1 and plant 3 was highly variable with sometimes an increase as observed at plant 3 during the low temperature period 12 c where phmoc increased 16 this is probably caused by the use of a coagulant aid based on biodegradable starch wisprofloc not applied at plant 2 a small phmoc decrease was observed 16 32 during the ozone process at plant 2 and plant 3 since the ozonation was operated between coagulation sedimentation and the secondary floc removal by dmf processes coagulation and floc settlement in the ozone contactors may have contributed to this small phmoc reduction the contribution to the overall phmoc reduction by bac filtration was 8 9 17 4 indicating that bacf played a modest role in phmoc removal the contribution of the individual processes to bcp14 reduction was quite different from phmoc reduction a high bpc14 reduction was observed for the coagulation process at plant 2 93 compared to the coagulation processes at plant 1 22 and plant 3 where there was an average bpc14 increase of 42 presented as 42 the addition of wisprofloc biodegradable starch at the latter two plants is the most likely cause of this large difference in reduction of the growth potential at plant 2 and plant 3 bpc14 clearly increased due to ozonation this bpc14 increase relates to the increase in easily degradable compounds produced during ozonation during dmf positioned after ozone treatment these easily degradable compounds are removed resulting in lower bpc14 values in the dmf effluent the contribution of bacf to the overall bpc14 reduction at all plants was again modest 14 21 4 discussion 4 1 phmoc in surface water treatment 4 1 1 phmoc concentrations and characterisation this study aimed at quantifying the phmoc concentration during surface water treatment at three plants and to characterise the components in the concentrate with respect to biostability the phmoc concentrations in the inlet water of the plants ranged from 300 to 500 μg c l 1 which was approximately 10 of toc the three treatments reduced phmoc by 70 80 to 50 100 μg c l 1 in the finished water which was 3 5 of toc the phmoc concentrations of the current study were in the same order of magnitude as the poc concentrations in drinking water 71 106 μg c l 1 produced from eutrophic lake water as presented by van der kooij et al 2015 others have determined biopolymers in pre filtered 0 45 μm water using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd chen et al 2016 demonstrated biopolymer concentrations of 400 μg c l 1 in river water using lc ocd which was 7 of doc whereas siembida lösch et al 2015 measured variable biopolymer lc ocd concentrations in lake ontario of 25 400 μg c l 1 10 20 of doc with rising concentrations in spring high concentrations in summer decreasing concentrations in autumn and low concentrations in winter another author park et al 2016 showed biopolymer concentrations of 130 and 20 μg c l 1 using lc ocd in the source and drinking water of a treatment plant respectively these values were lower than the phmoc values of the current study but the biopolymer fraction of doc derived from their published data of 15 2 and 5 respectively corresponds to the phmoc fractions observed in our study section 3 2 2 by further analysing the concentrates of the phmoc analysis the biological origin of a large part of the phmoc compounds was demonstrated 50 60 of the phmoc consisted of carbohydrates and a lower fraction of 10 consisted of proteins similar high carbohydrate fractions of the poc are presented in literature by using additional analytical procedures engel et al 2012 van der kooij et al 2015 villacorte et al 2015a b the transparent exopolymer particles method tep determines transparent polysaccharide carbohydrates particles in water retained on poly carbonate filters 0 2 0 4 μm visualised by alcian blue alldredge et al 1993 passow and alldredge 1995 analytical procedures for poc and tep in water determine particulates of 0 2 μm and phmoc also includes high molecular weight organic compounds 0 01 μm mwco of 30 kda villacorte et al 2015a b adapted the tep method using ultrafiltration mwcp 10 kda tep10kda and showed that the majority of the acid polysaccharides were found in the colloidal size range 0 4 μm they applied tep10kda and lc ocd in a treatment plant with similar processes as in the current study coagulation separation filtration bacf and showed biopolymer concentrations higher than the traditional tep method which were in the same order of magnitude as the biopolymer concentrations assessed with lc ocd moreover the biopolymer concentrations of 600 μg c l 1 and 150 200 μg c l 1 in the surface water and the bacf effluent respectively reported by villacorte et al 2015a were in the same order of magnitude as the phmoc concentrations presented in the current study table 3 in conclusion with the different described methods poc phmoc lc ocd and tep concentrations of particulate and high molecular organic carbon compounds in the same order of magnitude were observed at different surface water treatment facilities this strongly suggests that the same organic fraction of nom is assessed with these methods which most likely consists of biomass and biopolymers comparative studies under the same conditions are required to establish the correlation between these parameters the current study characterised 60 70 of phmoc as carbohydrates and a minor fraction of proteins thus there is still an unidentified fraction of 30 40 which potentially consists of high molecular humic acids long chain fatty acids or other biopolymers 4 1 2 source water and mixing with local reservoir water the results presented for the inlet waters of the three plants in this study showed that mixing the biesbosch water with local reservoir water at the inlet caused elevated phmoc concentrations in the inlet waters at plant 1 and plant 2 phmoc concentrations in the inlet water of plant 2 were significantly lower than phmoc at plant 1 where mixing with local reservoir water during the total period was much higher than at plant 2 table 1 algal growth and zooplankton grazing in these local reservoirs may have resulted in increasing biopolymer concentrations the effect of spring algal blooms on carbohydrate concentrations in seawater was demonstrated in a two year marine environmental study engel et al 2012 at the lab scale villacorte et al 2015b clearly demonstrated polysaccharide and protein production during bloom forming marine and freshwater algae in addition the results presented in section 3 2 2 of the current study clearly show a positive correlation between phmoc concentration in the inlet water of plant 1 and plant 2 with the phmoc in the bacf effluent therefore controlling biological water quality in local reservoirs is an important first step in the production of biologically stable drinking water with low biopolymer concentrations 4 1 3 removal of phmoc by water treatment processes removal of phmoc in the treatment plants was 70 80 and slightly but significantly higher at plant 2 than plant 1 and plant 3 this difference was mainly caused by the higher removal by coagulation sedimentation with aluminium and flotation at plant 2 54 of the overall removal compared to the removal by iron and sludge blanket filtration 38 or lamellae separation 16 8 at plant 1 and plant 3 respectively the lower phmoc removal by iron coagulation processes at plant 1 and plant 3 was observed especially at low temperatures when an additional polysaccharide based coagulant aid a phmoc increasing compound was required most of the phmoc data were monitored in the period without the coagulant aid addition and furthermore in separate monitoring data this coagulant aid could not be identified as a potential cause of the differences in the phmoc concentrations in the treated waters data not shown besides this difference in coagulant aid dosage both aluminium based coagulant and separation by flotation may have contributed to the higher phmoc removal the high removal of biopolymers determined using lc ocd in the coagulation process with aluminium coagulant followed by sedimentation of 74 presented by park et al 2016 suggests that the aluminium coagulant was the major cause and not the flotation separation but this needs further verification data of this study show that oxidation by ozone had no important effect on the phmoc an observation also reported by siembida lösch et al 2015 for biopolymer reduction determined with lc ocd by ozonation and by van der kooij et al 2015 for oxidation by uv peroxide oxidation the relatively small phmoc reduction due to ozonation table 6 was probably caused by an extended coagulation effect in the ozone contactors prior to the dual media filters the low effect of ozone on phmoc was also deduced from the transition to uv disinfection in 2014 at plant 2 table 1 the observed phmoc increase observed during this period was not due to this ozone uv transition but coincided with a temporarily increase in mixing with the local reservoir water when the mixing was lowered and completely stopped in 2015 phmoc in the bacf effluent decreased to the level in the period 2012 2013 when ozone was still being used section 3 2 2 in addition also at plant 3 the transition from ozone to uv had no decreasing effect on phmoc in the bacf effluent data not presented the effect of the transition from ozone to uv on nom in the water at plant 2 and plant 3 was measured with uv extinction and aoc p17 nox uv extinction of the drinking water increased after transition and aoc p17 nox concentrations were reduced sections 3 2 1 and 3 3 1 aoc p17 nox quantifies low molecular organic compounds formed by the reduction of uve absorbing organic carbon compounds by ozone van der kooij et al 1989 consequently ozone oxidation primarily affects the humic fraction of the nom and has a low impact on the biopolymer fraction the contribution of bacf to the overall phmoc reduction at all three plants table 6 was low and demonstrated no positive effect of a higher contact time at plant 2 the average removal rate of the individual bacf process in the current study was 28 18 and in the same order of magnitude observed in the study of van der kooij et al 2015 siembida lösch et al 2015 determined a variable and low 15 biopolymer reduction by bacf using lc ocd more interesting is that though a reduction in these biological filters was expected these authors showed an increase in biopolymer concentration in a large part of the data furthermore the highest removal rate of 28 they measured was when there was no pre treatment with ozone and biological activity in the filters was low these findings suggest that biopolymer reduction in these biologically active filters i is affected by physical adsorption and or ii is negatively influenced by biopolymer production in these biological active filter beds by bacteria and invertebrates a hypothesis which will have to be investigated in further studies in addition the findings of our study suggest that biomass and biopolymer removal in water treatment processes as applied in the studied plants is ruled by physical processes such as coagulation filtration and adsorption rather than biological processes the low phmoc concentrations 10 μg c l 1 after slow sand filtration observed by van der kooij et al 2017 suggest that this depends on the specific filtration conditions i e contact time 4 2 importance of phmoc for the biostability of drinking water 4 2 1 phmoc microbial growth potential and regrowth the results described in sections 3 3 and 3 4 clearly demonstrate that the compounds measured with phmoc in water are not correlated with the traditional biostability parameter for drinking water aoc p17 nox the good correlation between phmoc and the recently introduced biostability parameters aoc a3 for biopolymers and bpc14 for the both easily and slowly biodegradable compounds clearly shows the importance of biopolymers for the growth potential of drinking water furthermore for these surface water treatment plants the regrowth conditions during distribution assessed with hpc22 aeromonas coliforms and large invertebrates fig 4 were positively correlated with phmoc and bpc14 thus the data of the current study strongly support the suggestion of van der kooij et al 2015 that phmoc i e biopolymers and biomass and the biodegradable components determined with aoc a3 and bpc14 are important fractions for microbial growth in the drinking water distribution system the biological nature of the phmoc is demonstrated by additional characterisation for carbohydrates and proteins utilisation of these compounds by bacteria from the drinking water environment at low concentrations has been demonstrated by others van der kooij and hijnen 1993 sack et al 2010 2011 the f johnsoniae strain a3 used in the aoc a3 assay is specialized in growth on oligo and polysaccharides and oligopeptides and proteins in water at microgram per litre levels sack et al 2010 2011 from the aoc a3 concentrations and phmchc and phmpc values presented in tables 3 and 4 it was calculated that only 6 26 of the phmchc and phmpc could be used by strain a3 in the bioassays typical strain a3 growth curves in these water types supplementary materials fig s1 demonstrated that after the rapid exponential growth the maximum colony count did not decrease and remained stable during a prolonged period of more than 25 days this additional maintenance growth is based on the slow utilisation of the remaining biodegradable organic carbon such prolonged utilisation of slowly biodegradable organic compounds for growth and maintenance of biomass was also observed in the bpp test results of our study beyond the 14 days of incubation section 3 3 2 fig 2 and also by van der kooij et al 2015 2017 these observations raise the question how these slowly biodegradable compounds may cause biofouling and regrowth when the actual residence time of the drinking water in de the distribution system of several days is lower than applied in these growth potential tests 14 days or more 4 2 2 phmoc and biofilm formation microbial activity in distribution systems dominantly occurs in biofilms in loose deposits and on pipe walls liu et al 2014 van der wielen and lut 2016 easily assimilable organic carbon assessed with aoc p17 nox is correlated with the biofilm formation rate of drinking water which is positively correlated with aeromonas and invertebrates in distribution systems van der kooij et al 1999 van lieverloo et al 2012 however our observation that for drinking water produced from surface water slowly biodegradable compounds impacted microbial growth in drinking water more than easily biodegradable compounds was unexpected this highlights that monitoring for the more rapid and easily biodegradable compounds alone as propagated in literature van der kooij et al 1999 volk and lechevallier 2000 hammes and egli 2005 elhadidy et al 2016 is not always reliable to predict regrowth in the drinking water distribution system as introduced in the former section this leads to the question of how slowly biodegradable compounds in the drinking water may lead to biofilm formation and loose deposits production in full scale distribution systems where the residence time of the drinking water are much lower than applied in the growth potential tests others have observed that biomass and biopolymer can adsorb to surfaces for biofilm formation under laboratory conditions bar zeev et al 2012 demonstrating that biopolymers can be immobilized in full scale distribution systems moreover sack et al 2014 studied the influence of biopolymers on biofilm formation in a biofilm monitor under laboratory conditions by adding biopolymers separately or together with easily degradable organic compounds to drinking water the results from that study demonstrated that some smaller biopolymers laminarin casein gelatin were utilised directly by the biofilm whereas a longer biopolymer amylopectin could only be utilised by the biofilm when an easily degraded organic carbohydrate maltose was present immobilisation of natural organic matter nom can also be stimulated in the presence of fe gu et al 1995 the role of fe in biostability of drinking water is acknowledged by camper 1996 an example of a positive correlation of fe and carbohydrate accumulation as exo polymeric substances of biofilms carbohydrates are 50 of phmoc in the current study at low fe concentrations 8 μg l 1 was demonstrated by hijnen et al 2011 in a laboratory membrane biofouling study these results demonstrate that slowly biodegradable compounds e g biopolymers can be immobilized and subsequently utilised by drinking water biofilms consequently the presence of slowly biodegradable compounds in treated and distributed drinking water and the positive correlation with regrowth parameters as observed in our study can thus likely be explained by immobilisation and utilisation of these compounds by the biofilm that is present on sediment and pipe wall in the full scale distribution systems studied it has to be emphasised though that the conclusions on the correlation between phmoc data and the data of both bioassay methods are based on one surface water source biesbosch water supported by the data of van der kooij et al 2015 2017 at other surface water locations further studies are required to determine whether these correlations can be translated to drinking waters produced from other surface water and groundwater sources 5 conclusions aoc p17 nox in the drinking water of the three full scale plants was not correlated with the regrowth conditions in the distribution systems determined with hpc22 aeromonas coliforms and larger invertebrates phmoc concentrations in the water showed a significantly positive and strong correlation with two new microbial growth parameters bpc14 and aoc a3 moreover biopolymers and phmoc in the bacf effluent were positively correlated with the regrowth conditions during distribution of the three plants this strongly suggests the importance of these biopolymers for the biostability of drinking water produced from surface water phmoc is a significant fraction 10 of toc in the surface water used for drinking water production at three treatment plants and is composed of carbohydrates 40 60 proteins 10 and an unidentified fraction 30 40 the observed phmoc concentrations were in the same order of magnitude as biopolymer concentrations presented in literature for comparable surface water plants assessed with other analytical methods tep and lc ocd phmoc concentrations were reduced by 70 80 to 5 of the toc by the treatment trains coagulation separation rapid filtration disinfection and activated carbon filtration at the three plants coagulation separation with aluminium flotation at plant 2 53 5 and dual media filtration at plant 1 48 8 had the highest contribution to phmoc removal in treatment whereas the contribution of bacf to overall phmoc reduction 8 9 17 4 was low transition from ozonation to uv disinfection at plant 2 and plant 3 caused an increase in the humic acid fraction of the nom and decreased aoc p17 nox concentrations in the drinking water but had no important effect on phmoc further studies are required to verify whether our conclusions are generally valid and to understand the role of biopolymers in drinking water from surface waters in enhancing microbial activity and growth of invertebrates in distribution systems acknowledgements this study

19840,it is possible to distribute drinking water without a disinfectant residual when the treated water is biologically stable the objective of this study was to determine the impact of easily and slowly biodegradable compounds on the biostability of the drinking water at three full scale production plants which use the same surface water and on the regrowth conditions in the related distribution systems easily biodegradable compounds in the drinking water were determined with aoc p17 nox during 2012 2015 slowly biodegradable organic compounds measured as particulate and or high molecular organic carbon phmoc were monitored at the inlet and after the different treatment stages of the three treatments during the same period the results show that phmoc 300 470 μg c l 1 was approximately 10 of the toc in the surface water and was removed to 50 100 μg c l 1 the phmoc in the water consisted of 40 60 of carbohydrates and 10 of proteins a significant and strong positive correlation was observed for phmoc concentrations and two recently introduced bioassay methods for slowly biodegradable compounds aoc a3 and biomass production potential bpc14 moreover these three parameters in the biological active carbon effluent bacf of the three plants showed a positive correlation with regrowth in the drinking water distribution system which was assessed with aeromonas heterotrophic plate counts coliforms and large invertebrates in contrast the aoc p17 nox concentrations did not correlate with these regrowth parameters we therefore conclude that slowly biodegradable compounds in the treated water from these treatment plants seem to have a greater impact on regrowth in the distribution system than easily biodegradable compounds graphical abstract image 1 keywords

seawater menzel and vaccaro 1964 gardner et al 2003 for particulate 0 20 μm carbon transparent exopolymer particles tep alldredge et al 1993 is also a filtration 0 2 0 4 μm method which quantifies specific polysaccharide carbohydrates particles the recently introduced method of liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd huber et al 2011 determines biopolymers as a fraction of nom particulates larger than 0 45 μm excluded the poc method described by van der kooij et al 2015 uses cross flow hemoflow filtration with a much lower pore size of 30 kda 0 01 μm to concentrate the particulate organic and high molecular weight organic carbon compounds mainly biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins furthermore an additional aoc method aoc a3 to quantify biopolymers in water using a flavobacterium johnsoniae strain that is specialized in utilizing polysaccharides and proteins has also recently been developed sack et al 2011 van der kooij et al 2015 suggested that poc might enhance multiplication of aeromonas and other micro organisms in drinking water distribution systems the poc and aoc a3 methods were applied in the current study and poc was renamed to particulate and or high molecular organic carbon phmoc to better describe the organic carbon fraction measured the phmoc method yields a concentrate which can be further characterised as is done in the current study the overall objective of our four year study at three surface water treatment plants operated by evides water company was to monitor and investigate the role of slowly biodegradable organic matter in the biological stability of drinking water our study specifically addresses the following aspects i assess the influence of the source water quality and full scale treatment efficiency with ozone or uv disinfection on phmoc in the drinking water ii characterise phmoc by analysing the concentrate and to determine the role of these compounds in the microbial growth potential of the drinking water and iii correlate these data with regrowth indicators hpc22 aeromonas coliforms and invertebrates in the distribution system 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment plants and distribution systems drinking water company evides produces drinking water from river meuse which is impounded in brabantse biesbosch reservoirs with a retention time of 5 months at the confluence of the rivers rhine and meuse and then transported to four different treatment plants three of these four drinking water production plants were analysed in our study the biesbosch reservoir water is transported to plant 1 and plant 3 in 18 h and to plant 2 in 48 h table 1 during march november the reservoir source water is chlorinated 0 4 0 6 mg l 1 to control mussel growth an important difference in the inlet of the source water at the three plants is the mixing percentage with local reservoir water which potentially changes the water quality during the multi year study this mixing percentage was diminished at plant 1 and plant 2 table 1 the treatment trains of the plants are similar in their use of coagulation separation dual media filtration main disinfection with uv or ozone followed by biologically activated carbon filtration bacf and post disinfection with clo2 prior to the treated water reservoirs at low doses 0 08 mg l 1 to ensure disinfectant concentrations of 0 005 mg l 1 in the distributed drinking water the coagulant dosage and primary floc removal at plant 1 and plant 3 are fecl3 plus starch based coagulant aid wisprofloc addition during the winter period and primary separation by sludge blanket filtration and lamellae separation respectively at plant 2 polyaluminum chloride pac dosing and flotation were used plant 1 applied uv during the total period and a transition from ozone to uv disinfection was part of the study at plant 2 and plant 3 operational differences in bacf were a longer empty bed contact time and lower filtration rate at plant 2 table 1 each plant supplied drinking water to a separate distribution system 2 2 overall set up of the study the multi year study at the three plants was performed between 2012 and 2015 data of the legislative monitoring programme were evaluated to describe the regrowth conditions in each distribution system several distinct temporal periods of relevant changes in conditions with respect to mixing with local reservoir water and the transition from ozone to uv disinfection are described in the following sections data of uv extinction doc and aoc p17 nox were used from the routine water quality monitoring programme 2 2 1 period 1 2012 2013 at plant 1 the biesbosch water passed 100 through the local reservoir water the main disinfection was uv before bacf at plant 1 and ozone before dual media filtration followed by bacf at plant 2 and plant 3 phmoc and the biostability parameters biomass production potential bpp and aoc a3 concentration were monitored in april july september and november at the inlets and at selected locations during treatment at all plants to monitor the effect of coagulation floc removal dual media filtration ozone or uv disinfection and bacf 2 2 2 period 2 2014 a transition period was started at plant 2 where ozone disinfection was replaced by uv disinfection after dual media filtration the uv disinfection was started stepwise in november december 2013 and ozone disinfection was stopped in march 2014 the mixing of the inlet water with local reservoir water was increased from 12 to 25 at the start of this period january march phmoc bpp and aoc a3 concentration were monitored monthly during the period february november 2014 period 2 at the inlet after uv disinfection and bacf at this plant 2 2 3 period 3 2015 the effect of the mixing with local reservoir water at the three plants was studied while mixing with local reservoir water was constant at plant 3 throughout all periods the mixing was reduced from 100 to 6 at plant 1 at plant 2 the mixing was completely stopped table 1 at plant 3 ozone dosage was decreased from 1 2 to 0 6 mg l 1 and uv disinfection was added as the main disinfection process phmoc bpp and aoc a3 concentration were monitored monthly at the inlet water and in the bacf effluent except for april and august 2 3 particulate and or high molecular organic carbon the phmoc concentration in water was measured as described by van der kooij et al 2015 in short 100 l of water were concentrated to 500 ml using cross flow ultrafiltration hemoflow membrane hf80s fresenius medical care with a molecular weigth cut off mwco of nominal 30 kda blocking colloids and particulates 0 01 μm subsequently the total organic carbon toc concentration was determined using a shimadzu toc v analyser the phmoc concentration was calculated from the toc in the concentrate including correcting for the doc concentration in the original water and the concentration factor of the ultrafiltration step in addition to phmoc particulate and or high molecular carbohydrate carbon phmchc was quantified in the concentrate dubois et al 1956 μg c eq l 1 with a glucose c calibration curve in the last stage of the study particulate and or high molecular protein carbon phmpc was quantified μg c l 1 using the coomassie protein assay kit a method described by bradford 1976 and a calibration curve for bovine serum

period was assessed using several methods aoc p17 nox aoc a3 and the biomass production potential bpp test in the different water types were determined according to van der kooij and veenendaal 2014 the bpp test in short includes water sampling in aoc free glass stoppered erlenmeyer flasks the addition of phosphate 0 33 mg p l 1 and nitrate 0 8 mg n l 1 and inoculation with one ml of pre filtered

filtration 0 45 μm of 100 ml and incubation of the filter on ampicillin dextrin agar havelaar et al 1987 for 24 2 h at 30 1 c coliforms were monitored using membrane filtration 0 45 μm of 100 ml nen en iso 9308 1 and identification using a maldi biotyper system bruker daltonics gmbh bremen germany software maldi biotyper 3 1 hydrobiological water quality monitoring for invertebrates was performed at a number of randomly selected hydrants in the distribution system using the method presented by van lieverloo et al 2004 the total invertebrate concentration mg m 3 was calculated from the number of microscopically counted invertebrates and their individual conversion factor mg per organism assessed as described by carpentier et al 1999 2 6 statistics the datasets were first statistically tested for normality with the shapiro wilk test using spss 16 0 differences in the general water quality parameters in the drinking water table 2 was tested by the one way anova analysis and bonferoni test p 0 05 differences in hpc22 aeromonas and invertebrate data from the distribution system table 2 fig 1 were tested with the non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test for independent samples p 0 05 and presented in the figure directly the paired samples t test paired by the month of sampling to account for the seasonal effects was used to test for differences between the phmoc and aoc concentrations bp7 and bpc14 values of the inlet water and the bacf effluent of the three plants for all presented parameters in tables 2 4 differences between the plants are indicated as superscript per plant at the p 0 05 significance level log linear and linear regression analysis was carried out using excel software a significance level of p 0 05 was applied for all difference and regression analyses 3 results 3 1 microbiological drinking water quality during distribution the colony counts for hpc22 and aeromonas median values were low 1 cfu per ml and 1 cfu per 100 ml respectively in the drinking water after reservoir storage and before distribution table 2 the hpc22 aeromonas and invertebrate biomass data of samples from the distribution system of the three plants over the period 2012 2015 are summarized in fig 1 the results clearly show that the hpc22 and the aeromonas colony counts after treatment were elevated in the samples from the distribution network but were significantly higher in number at plant 1 and plant 3 than at plant 2 there were no significant differences in the number of small invertebrates 500 μm in the distribution samples between the plants but large invertebrates 500 μm were significantly higher in number at plant 1 and plant 3 compared to plant 2 no coliforms were detected in the randomly collected legislative distribution samples of plant 2 whereas at plant 1 and plant 3 coliform spp enterobacter citrobacter klebsiella and escherichia spp were occasionally observed at selected distribution locations e coli and other coliform species in the legislative samples were observed in respectively 0 03 and 0 03 of the total samples from the distribution system of plant 1 and in respectively 0 03 and 0 14 of the total samples from the distribution system of plant 3 supplementary information table s2 at plant 1 the highest number of coliforms was 180 cfu 100 ml 1 klebsiella oxytoca and at plant 3 the highest number was 400 cfu

extinction uve in the inlet waters at plant 1 plant 2 and plant 3 were not significantly different supplementary information table s2 no difference between the plants was observed for doc in the treated water during 2012 2015 but uve at plant 1 was significantly higher compared to the uve at plant 2 and plant 3 due to the use of ozone at the latter two plants during part of the study period table 2 after establishing uv disinfection at plant 2 in 2014 and 2015 respectively table 1 the uve of the drinking water after these plants increased significantly table 2 thus showing the effect of ozone versus uv disinfection on uve fe concentrations in the drinking water at plant 1 was significantly higher than at plant 2 and plant 3 table 2 and at plant 2 aluminium concentration was higher due to the application of poly aluminium coagulant table 1 3 2 2 phmoc concentrations in inlet water and bacf effluent phmoc concentrations were assessed from single samples the reproducibility of the phmoc concentrations in the drinking water was determined twice by analysing two water samples at the same date which revealed an average relative sd of 17 6 8 5 phmoc concentrations in the inlet waters and the bacf effluent monitored four to seven times per year in 2012 2013 and 2015 at plant 1 and plant 2 are presented in fig 2 and table 3 phmoc concentrations in the inlet waters showed a seasonal variation with the highest concentrations in the first half period of the year at plant 1 the phmoc concentration increased in april 2012 and 2013 which coincided with the rise in water temperature in spring fig 2 in these years the biesbosch water was 100 mixed with local reservoir water at this plant when this mixing percentage was lowered to 6 at the end of 2014 in may and june of 2015 phmoc values in the inlet water at plant 1 were reduced phmoc concentrations in the inlet water of plant 2 were significantly lower and showed less variation than in the inlet water of plant 1 table 3 and fig 2 the highest phmoc concentrations in the inlet water of plant 2 were observed in the early period of february march 2014 where temporarily the mixing percentage with local reservoir had been increased from 12 to 25 table 1 after this mixing percentage had returned to the usual 12 in april 2014 phmoc concentrations dropped and they tended to decline and they were variable throughout the rest of the year the phmoc of the inlet water at plant 3 was between that of the inlet waters at plant 1 and plant 2 table 3 phmoc was reduced during treatment at all plants as shown by the lower phmoc concentrations in the bacf effluent table 3 and fig 2 data of plant 3 is not included in fig 2 due to the lower number of observations for this plant which showed a similar but less variable trend as in the inlet waters throughout the year the phmoc concentration of 57 6 24 8 μg c l 1 in the bacf effluent at plant 2 was significantly lower than the phmoc concentrations of 103 41 5 and 102 26 7 μg c l 1 in the bacf effluents at plant 1 and plant 3 respectively the effect of mixing with local reservoir water on the phmoc in bacf effluent was clearly demonstrated at plant 2 in 2014 with mixing with the local reservoir phmoc concentrations in the inlet water and bacf effluent were 765 921 n 7 and 80 8 32 9 n 6 respectively and after the mixing stopped in 2015 the concentrations fell to 323 119 n 7 and 47 7 11 5 n 7 μg c l 1 respectively based on the average doc concentrations in the drinking water and the inlet water table 3 and s2 and the average phmoc concentrations in these waters table 3 phmoc in the inlet water was on an average 10 of the toc doc phmoc a percentage which decreased with approximately 50 to 3 3 5 3 in the bacf effluent after treatment 3 2 3 biopolymer fractions of phmoc and their correlations the hemoflow concentrates of the samples were analysed for the concentration of carbohydrates and in 2015 also for protein concentrations table 3 the average percentage of carbohydrates chc of phmoc in the inlet waters of the plants was 58 26 n 51 with no significant mutual differences the average chc percentage in the bacf effluent was 49 7 3 n 54 which was significantly lower than in the inlet water this indicates that the relative removal in treatment of carbohydrates was more efficient than the removal of the other phmoc components protein turned out to be a smaller fraction of the phmoc than carbohydrates table 3 the average protein fraction in the phmoc of the inlet waters was 13 5 7 n 17 also for protein this percentage was significantly lower after bacf 9 7 4 1 n 17 than in the inlet waters there was a significant and strong linear correlation between the phmoc and both phmchc and phmpc in the paired samples p 0 05 r2 0 62 and 0 72 respectively as well as for the linear correlation between phmchc and phmpc p 0 05 r2 0 82 3 3 microbial growth potential in the inlet water and bacf effluent 3 3 1 aoc p17 nox and aoc a3 aoc p17 nox in the drinking water of plant 1 was significantly lower than the aoc concentration at plant 2 and plant 3 for the total period table 2 comparison of aoc p17 nox in the drinking waters of plant 2 and plant 3 during the separate periods with ozone or uv revealed that aoc p17 nox of 24 6 9 4 n 24 and 27 6 12 1 n 78 during ozone use at plant 2 and plant 3 decreased to 16 7 2 8 n 20 and 22 6 10 4 n 21 μg acet c eq l 1 respectively after transition to uv these aoc p17 nox data from the three plants including plant 2 with no aeromonas regrowth were higher than the recommended value for biostability of 10 μg c l 1 van der kooij and hijnen 1993 this supports the extended search for additional parameters as presented by van der kooij et al 2015 and applied in the current study relatively high aoc a3 concentrations were observed in the inlet waters of the plants table 4 ranging from 69 9 to 199 7 biopolymer c eq l 1 treatments reduced these concentrations to 4 6 15 3 μg c l 1 in the bacf effluent average aoc a3 concentrations at the inlet and bacf effluent for plant 2 were the lowest table 4 however the differences for this parameter between the plants were not significant which is probably due to the high seasonal variance for aoc a3 concentrations at the three plants 3 3 2 biomass production potential the trends of the bpc14 values in inlet water and bacf effluent of plant 1 and plant 2 showed similar trends throughout the year as observed for phmoc fig 2 with higher values during the beginning of the year with rising temperature and decreasing values in late summer and autumn the relative sd of bp7 and bpc14 was 7 3 6 2 range of 0 27 n 172 the average bp7 and bpc14 values of the inlet water and the bacf effluent are presented in table 4 the bp7 in the inlet water at plant 2 during the total study period was significantly lower than the bp7 in the inlet water of plant 1 and plant 3 the bpc14 in the inlet water of plant 1 was 1590 1710 d ng l 1 which was significantly higher than the bpc14 at plant 2 711 474 d ng l 1 and plant 3 686 369 d ng l 1 in the bacf effluent the bp7 at plant 1 was higher than the bp7 values at plant 2 and plant 3 table 4 but these differences were not significant the atp production curves of the bpp test in the bacf effluent of these plants fig 3 showed no rapid growth during the first days and the maximum value bp7 occurred around five to seven days the bpc14 in the bacf effluent at plant 2 was significantly lower than in the bacf effluent at plant 1 and plant 3 table 4 atp production over the total period of 14 days showed a slow and variable increase without a maximum value between day 7 and day 14 at plant 1 and plant 3 whereas atp concentrations remained constant in most samples of plant 2 fig 3 such a trend in atp concentrations in the bpp test slow growth after 7 days in the bacf effluents is clearly an indication of growth on slowly biodegradable compounds the average bp7 and bpc14 in the bacf effluent of plant 1 and plant 3 were in the same order of magnitude the transition from ozone to uv at plant 2 and plant 3 had no effect on the bpc14 of the bacf effluent data not shown stopping the mixing with local reservoir water in 2015 at plant 2 coincided with a decrease in the bpc14 of the inlet water and bacf effluent samples in 2014 bpc14 of the inlet water and bacf effluent was 1100 555 n 7 and 136 21 9 n 6 respectively whereas in 2015 the bpc14 values of these samples were significantly lower 489 164 n 7 and 75 2 23 1 n 7 respectively 3 4 correlation of phmoc with regrowth indicators and biostability parameters as described in section 3 1 the microbiological water quality of the drinking water during distribution was determined by two regrowth indicators hpc22 and aeromonas this multi year study at three full scale drinking water production plants presented in section 3 2 and 3 3 revealed a positive correlation of the phmoc concentration in the drinking water and the indicated level of regrowth by both regrowth indicators fig 4 the lowest values for hpc22 and aeromonas at plant 2 coincided with the lowest phmoc bp7 and bpc14 values in the drinking water of this plant and also with two other regrowth indicators coliforms section 3 1 and large invertebrates fig 4 the log linear correlation between phmoc and the microbial growth potential bpc14 and aoc a3 was significant p 0 05 and strong r2 0 71 table 5 and fig 4 and this was also true for the log linear between phmchc and both microbial growth potential parameters r2 0 77 the linear and log linear correlation between bpc14 and aoc a3 were both significant p 0 05 and strong r2 0 85 3 5 treatment effects reduction of phmoc and the growth potential the change in phmoc and bpc14 by the overall treatment was calculated from the paired data of the inlet waters and the bacf effluents the highest average phmoc removal 81 9 7 was observed at plant 2 table 3 which was slightly but significantly higher than at plant 1 74 13 and plant 3 71 9 2 despite the lower phmoc concentration in the inlet water of plant 2 table 3 the average reduction in bpc14 by the treatment trains of the three plants was in the same order of magnitude as phmoc removal and ranged from 79 to 83 table 4 data collected after the individual treatment steps in 2013 shows that highest phmoc removal occurred in the dual media filters dmf at plant 1 and plant 3 table 6 whereas the highest amount of phmoc removal at plant 2 was by the coagulation separation process table 6 the effect of coagulation separation on phmoc at plant 1 and plant 3 was highly variable with sometimes an increase as observed at plant 3 during the low temperature period 12 c where phmoc increased 16 this is probably caused by the use of a coagulant aid based on biodegradable starch wisprofloc not applied at plant 2 a small phmoc decrease was observed 16 32 during the ozone process at plant 2 and plant 3 since the ozonation was operated between coagulation sedimentation and the secondary floc removal by dmf processes coagulation and floc settlement in the ozone contactors may have contributed to this small phmoc reduction the contribution to the overall phmoc reduction by bac filtration was 8 9 17 4 indicating that bacf played a modest role in phmoc removal the contribution of the individual processes to bcp14 reduction was quite different from phmoc reduction a high bpc14 reduction was observed for the coagulation process at plant 2 93 compared to the coagulation processes at plant 1 22 and plant 3 where there was an average bpc14 increase of 42 presented as 42 the addition of wisprofloc biodegradable starch at the latter two plants is the most likely cause of this large difference in reduction of the growth potential at plant 2 and plant 3 bpc14 clearly increased due to ozonation this bpc14 increase relates to the increase in easily degradable compounds produced during ozonation during dmf positioned after ozone treatment these easily degradable compounds are removed resulting in lower bpc14 values in the dmf effluent the contribution of bacf to the overall bpc14 reduction at all plants was again modest 14 21 4 discussion 4 1 phmoc in surface water treatment 4 1 1 phmoc concentrations and characterisation this study aimed at quantifying the phmoc concentration during surface water treatment at three plants and to characterise the components in the concentrate with respect to biostability the phmoc concentrations in the inlet water of the plants ranged from 300 to 500 μg c l 1 which was approximately 10 of toc the three treatments reduced phmoc by 70 80 to 50 100 μg c l 1 in the finished water which was 3 5 of toc the phmoc concentrations of the current study were in the same order of magnitude as the poc concentrations in drinking water 71 106 μg c l 1 produced from eutrophic lake water as presented by van der kooij et al 2015 others have determined biopolymers in pre filtered 0 45 μm water using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd chen et al 2016 demonstrated biopolymer concentrations of 400 μg c l 1 in river water using lc ocd which was 7 of doc whereas siembida lösch et al 2015 measured variable biopolymer lc ocd concentrations in lake ontario of 25 400 μg c l 1 10 20 of doc with rising concentrations in spring high concentrations in summer decreasing concentrations in autumn and low concentrations in winter another author park et al 2016 showed biopolymer concentrations of 130 and 20 μg c l 1 using lc ocd in the source and drinking water of a treatment plant respectively these values were lower than the phmoc values of the current study but the biopolymer fraction of doc derived from their published data of 15 2 and 5 respectively corresponds to the phmoc fractions observed in our study section 3 2 2 by further analysing the concentrates of the phmoc analysis the biological origin of a large part of the phmoc compounds was demonstrated 50 60 of the phmoc consisted of carbohydrates and a lower fraction of 10 consisted of proteins similar high carbohydrate fractions of the poc are presented in literature by using additional analytical procedures engel et al 2012 van der kooij et al 2015 villacorte et al 2015a b the transparent exopolymer particles method tep determines transparent polysaccharide carbohydrates particles in water retained on poly carbonate filters 0 2 0 4 μm visualised by alcian blue alldredge et al 1993 passow and alldredge 1995 analytical procedures for poc and tep in water determine particulates of 0 2 μm and phmoc also includes high molecular weight organic compounds 0 01 μm mwco of 30 kda villacorte et al 2015a b adapted the tep method using ultrafiltration mwcp 10 kda tep10kda and showed that the majority of the acid polysaccharides were found in the colloidal size range 0 4 μm they applied tep10kda and lc ocd in a treatment plant with similar processes as in the current study coagulation separation filtration bacf and showed biopolymer concentrations higher than the traditional tep method which were in the same order of magnitude as the biopolymer concentrations assessed with lc ocd moreover the biopolymer concentrations of 600 μg c l 1 and 150 200 μg c l 1 in the surface water and the bacf effluent respectively reported by villacorte et al 2015a were in the same order of magnitude as the phmoc concentrations presented in the current study table 3 in conclusion with the different described methods poc phmoc lc ocd and tep concentrations of particulate and high molecular organic carbon compounds in the same order of magnitude were observed at different surface water treatment facilities this strongly suggests that the same organic fraction of nom is assessed with these methods which most likely consists of biomass and biopolymers comparative studies under the same conditions are required to establish the correlation between these parameters the current study characterised 60 70 of phmoc as carbohydrates and a minor fraction of proteins thus there is still an unidentified fraction of 30 40 which potentially consists of high molecular humic acids long chain fatty acids or other biopolymers 4 1 2 source water and mixing with local reservoir water the results presented for the inlet waters of the three plants in this study showed that mixing the biesbosch water with local reservoir water at the inlet caused elevated phmoc concentrations in the inlet waters at plant 1 and plant 2 phmoc concentrations in the inlet water of plant 2 were significantly lower than phmoc at plant 1 where mixing with local reservoir water during the total period was much higher than at plant 2 table 1 algal growth and zooplankton grazing in these local reservoirs may have resulted in increasing biopolymer concentrations the effect of spring algal blooms on carbohydrate concentrations in seawater was demonstrated in a two year marine environmental study engel et al 2012 at the lab scale villacorte et al 2015b clearly demonstrated polysaccharide and protein production during bloom forming marine and freshwater algae in addition the results presented in section 3 2 2 of the current study clearly show a positive correlation between phmoc concentration in the inlet water of plant 1 and plant 2 with the phmoc in the bacf effluent therefore controlling biological water quality in local reservoirs is an important first step in the production of biologically stable drinking water with low biopolymer concentrations 4 1 3 removal of phmoc by water treatment processes removal of phmoc in the treatment plants was 70 80 and slightly but significantly higher at plant 2 than plant 1 and plant 3 this difference was mainly caused by the higher removal by coagulation sedimentation with aluminium and flotation at plant 2 54 of the overall removal compared to the removal by iron and sludge blanket filtration 38 or lamellae separation 16 8 at plant 1 and plant 3 respectively the lower phmoc removal by iron coagulation processes at plant 1 and plant 3 was observed especially at low temperatures when an additional polysaccharide based coagulant aid a phmoc increasing compound was required most of the phmoc data were monitored in the period without the coagulant aid addition and furthermore in separate monitoring data this coagulant aid could not be identified as a potential cause of the differences in the phmoc concentrations in the treated waters data not shown besides this difference in coagulant aid dosage both aluminium based coagulant and separation by flotation may have contributed to the higher phmoc removal the high removal of biopolymers determined using lc ocd in the coagulation process with aluminium coagulant followed by sedimentation of 74 presented by park et al 2016 suggests that the aluminium coagulant was the major cause and not the flotation separation but this needs further verification data of this study show that oxidation by ozone had no important effect on the phmoc an observation also reported by siembida lösch et al 2015 for biopolymer reduction determined with lc ocd by ozonation and by van der kooij et al 2015 for oxidation by uv peroxide oxidation the relatively small phmoc reduction due to ozonation table 6 was probably caused by an extended coagulation effect in the ozone contactors prior to the dual media filters the low effect of ozone on phmoc was also deduced from the transition to uv disinfection in 2014 at plant 2 table 1 the observed phmoc increase observed during this period was not due to this ozone uv transition but coincided with a temporarily increase in mixing with the local reservoir water when the mixing was lowered and completely stopped in 2015 phmoc in the bacf effluent decreased to the level in the period 2012 2013 when ozone was still being used section 3 2 2 in addition also at plant 3 the transition from ozone to uv had no decreasing effect on phmoc in the bacf effluent data not presented the effect of the transition from ozone to uv on nom in the water at plant 2 and plant 3 was measured with uv extinction and aoc p17 nox uv extinction of the drinking water increased after transition and aoc p17 nox concentrations were reduced sections 3 2 1 and 3 3 1 aoc p17 nox quantifies low molecular organic compounds formed by the reduction of uve absorbing organic carbon compounds by ozone van der kooij et al 1989 consequently ozone oxidation primarily affects the humic fraction of the nom and has a low impact on the biopolymer fraction the contribution of bacf to the overall phmoc reduction at all three plants table 6 was low and demonstrated no positive effect of a higher contact time at plant 2 the average removal rate of the individual bacf process in the current study was 28 18 and in the same order of magnitude observed in the study of van der kooij et al 2015 siembida lösch et al 2015 determined a variable and low 15 biopolymer reduction by bacf using lc ocd more interesting is that though a reduction in these biological filters was expected these authors showed an increase in biopolymer concentration in a large part of the data furthermore the highest removal rate of 28 they measured was when there was no pre treatment with ozone and biological activity in the filters was low these findings suggest that biopolymer reduction in these biologically active filters i is affected by physical adsorption and or ii is negatively influenced by biopolymer production in these biological active filter beds by bacteria and invertebrates a hypothesis which will have to be investigated in further studies in addition the findings of our study suggest that biomass and biopolymer removal in water treatment processes as applied in the studied plants is ruled by physical processes such as coagulation filtration and adsorption rather than biological processes the low phmoc concentrations 10 μg c l 1 after slow sand filtration observed by van der kooij et al 2017 suggest that this depends on the specific filtration conditions i e contact time 4 2 importance of phmoc for the biostability of drinking water 4 2 1 phmoc microbial growth potential and regrowth the results described in sections 3 3 and 3 4 clearly demonstrate that the compounds measured with phmoc in water are not correlated with the traditional biostability parameter for drinking water aoc p17 nox the good correlation between phmoc and the recently introduced biostability parameters aoc a3 for biopolymers and bpc14 for the both easily and slowly biodegradable compounds clearly shows the importance of biopolymers for the growth potential of drinking water furthermore for these surface water treatment plants the regrowth conditions during distribution assessed with hpc22 aeromonas coliforms and large invertebrates fig 4 were positively correlated with phmoc and bpc14 thus the data of the current study strongly support the suggestion of van der kooij et al 2015 that phmoc i e biopolymers and biomass and the biodegradable components determined with aoc a3 and bpc14 are important fractions for microbial growth in the drinking water distribution system the biological nature of the phmoc is demonstrated by additional characterisation for carbohydrates and proteins utilisation of these compounds by bacteria from the drinking water environment at low concentrations has been demonstrated by others van der kooij and hijnen 1993 sack et al 2010 2011 the f johnsoniae strain a3 used in the aoc a3 assay is specialized in growth on oligo and polysaccharides and oligopeptides and proteins in water at microgram per litre levels sack et al 2010 2011 from the aoc a3 concentrations and phmchc and phmpc values presented in tables 3 and 4 it was calculated that only 6 26 of the phmchc and phmpc could be used by strain a3 in the bioassays typical strain a3 growth curves in these water types supplementary materials fig s1 demonstrated that after the rapid exponential growth the maximum colony count did not decrease and remained stable during a prolonged period of more than 25 days this additional maintenance growth is based on the slow utilisation of the remaining biodegradable organic carbon such prolonged utilisation of slowly biodegradable organic compounds for growth and maintenance of biomass was also observed in the bpp test results of our study beyond the 14 days of incubation section 3 3 2 fig 2 and also by van der kooij et al 2015 2017 these observations raise the question how these slowly biodegradable compounds may cause biofouling and regrowth when the actual residence time of the drinking water in de the distribution system of several days is lower than applied in these growth potential tests 14 days or more 4 2 2 phmoc and biofilm formation microbial activity in distribution systems dominantly occurs in biofilms in loose deposits and on pipe walls liu et al 2014 van der wielen and lut 2016 easily assimilable organic carbon assessed with aoc p17 nox is correlated with the biofilm formation rate of drinking water which is positively correlated with aeromonas and invertebrates in distribution systems van der kooij et al 1999 van lieverloo et al 2012 however our observation that for drinking water produced from surface water slowly biodegradable compounds impacted microbial growth in drinking water more than easily biodegradable compounds was unexpected this highlights that monitoring for the more rapid and easily biodegradable compounds alone as propagated in literature van der kooij et al 1999 volk and lechevallier 2000 hammes and egli 2005 elhadidy et al 2016 is not always reliable to predict regrowth in the drinking water distribution system as introduced in the former section this leads to the question of how slowly biodegradable compounds in the drinking water may lead to biofilm formation and loose deposits production in full scale distribution systems where the residence time of the drinking water are much lower than applied in the growth potential tests others have observed that biomass and biopolymer can adsorb to surfaces for biofilm formation under laboratory conditions bar zeev et al 2012 demonstrating that biopolymers can be immobilized in full scale distribution systems moreover sack et al 2014 studied the influence of biopolymers on biofilm formation in a biofilm monitor under laboratory conditions by adding biopolymers separately or together with easily degradable organic compounds to drinking water the results from that study demonstrated that some smaller biopolymers laminarin casein gelatin were utilised directly by the biofilm whereas a longer biopolymer amylopectin could only be utilised by the biofilm when an easily degraded organic carbohydrate maltose was present immobilisation of natural organic matter nom can also be stimulated in the presence of fe gu et al 1995 the role of fe in biostability of drinking water is acknowledged by camper 1996 an example of a positive correlation of fe and carbohydrate accumulation as exo polymeric substances of biofilms carbohydrates are 50 of phmoc in the current study at low fe concentrations 8 μg l 1 was demonstrated by hijnen et al 2011 in a laboratory membrane biofouling study these results demonstrate that slowly biodegradable compounds e g biopolymers can be immobilized and subsequently utilised by drinking water biofilms consequently the presence of slowly biodegradable compounds in treated and distributed drinking water and the positive correlation with regrowth parameters as observed in our study can thus likely be explained by immobilisation and utilisation of these compounds by the biofilm that is present on sediment and pipe wall in the full scale distribution systems studied it has to be emphasised though that the conclusions on the correlation between phmoc data and the data of both bioassay methods are based on one surface water source biesbosch water supported by the data of van der kooij et al 2015 2017 at other surface water locations further studies are required to determine whether these correlations can be translated to drinking waters produced from other surface water and groundwater sources 5 conclusions aoc p17 nox in the drinking water of the three full scale plants was not correlated with the regrowth conditions in the distribution systems determined with hpc22 aeromonas coliforms and larger invertebrates phmoc concentrations in the water showed a significantly positive and strong correlation with two new microbial growth parameters bpc14 and aoc a3 moreover biopolymers and phmoc in the bacf effluent were positively correlated with the regrowth conditions during distribution of the three plants this strongly suggests the importance of these biopolymers for the biostability of drinking water produced from surface water phmoc is a significant fraction 10 of toc in the surface water used for drinking water production at three treatment plants and is composed of carbohydrates 40 60 proteins 10 and an unidentified fraction 30 40 the observed phmoc concentrations were in the same order of magnitude as biopolymer concentrations presented in literature for comparable surface water plants assessed with other analytical methods tep and lc ocd phmoc concentrations were reduced by 70 80 to 5 of the toc by the treatment trains coagulation separation rapid filtration disinfection and activated carbon filtration at the three plants coagulation separation with aluminium flotation at plant 2 53 5 and dual media filtration at plant 1 48 8 had the highest contribution to phmoc removal in treatment whereas the contribution of bacf to overall phmoc reduction 8 9 17 4 was low transition from ozonation to uv disinfection at plant 2 and plant 3 caused an increase in the humic acid fraction of the nom and decreased aoc p17 nox concentrations in the drinking water but had no important effect on phmoc further studies are required to verify whether our conclusions are generally valid and to understand the role of biopolymers in drinking water from surface waters in enhancing microbial activity and growth of invertebrates in distribution systems acknowledgements this study

19841,this study provides an innovative application of virtual water trade in the traditional allocation of physical water resources in water scarce regions a multi objective optimization model was developed to optimize the allocation of physical water and virtual water resources to different water users in beijing china considering the trade offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water constituted the physical resource of water supply side while virtual water flow associated with the trade of five major crops barley corn rice soy and wheat and three livestock products beef pork and poultry in agricultural sector calculated by the trade quantities of products and their virtual water contents urban daily activities and public facilities industry environment and agriculture products growing were considered in water demand side as for the traditional allocation of physical water resources the results showed that agriculture and urban were the two predominant water users accounting 54 and 28 respectively while groundwater and surface water satisfied around 70 water demands of different users accounting 36 and 34 respectively when considered the virtual water trade of eight agricultural products in water allocation procedure the proportion of agricultural consumption decreased to 45 in total water demand while the groundwater consumption decreased to 24 in total water supply virtual water trade overturned the traditional components of water supplied from different sources for agricultural consumption and became the largest water source in beijing additionally it was also found that environmental demand took a similar percentage of water consumption in each water source reclaimed water was the main water source for industrial and environmental users the results suggest that physical water resources would mainly satisfy the consumption of urban and environment and the unbalance between water supply and demand could be filled by virtual water import in water scarce regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords virtual water trade water allocation multi objective optimization water management 1 introduction in the past decade cities around china and the rest of the world have been facing moderate to severe water scarcity in different sectors due to population growth food production climate change and limited water resources dalin et al 2014 unep 2011 it is reported that more than 4 0 billion people live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least one month of the year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 particularly agriculture as the most fundamental sector all over china irrigation covers 45 of the country s agricultural land and accounts for 65 of national water withdrawal fao 2012 a large number of investments have been made to seek methods for balancing considerations of increasing demands and sustainability to provide reliable water supplies to customers the combination of conventional and nonconventional water resources from a quantity and quality viewpoint forms a promising method to supply future water demands which has been widely implied around the world especially in china avni et al 2013 habibi davijani et al 2016 liu et al 2011a conventional water resources include surface water and underground water while nonconventional resources are dominantly desalinated water reclaimed water and transferred physical water in most arid and semi arid regions groundwater always transferred from agriculture to urban and industrial uses for a higher economic benefit rogers et al 2002 and reclaimed water distributed for agricultural demand with a positive environmental impact this change would allocate available water resources more rationally according to the quantity and quality required for each molinos senante et al 2014 apart from these major physical water resources there is another form of water resource flow to alleviate water stress so called virtual water allan 1998 zhao et al 2015 based on the concept of virtual water the idea of water footprint was introduced by hoekstra in 2002 hoekstra 2003 both of them were defined as the water required for the production of goods and services along their supply chains hoekstra 2009 with the broaden knowledge on considering both green and blue water in estimating water consumption by agriculture sector shiklomanov 2000 falkenmark and rockström 2004 virtual water can be classified into green water and blue water green water from direct rainfall for crops growing and blue water from surface water and groundwater hanasaki et al 2008a b konar et al 2011 the degree of green water utilization by crops depends on the growing season moreover blue water could be used directly by other economic sectors but green water cannot virtual water trade vwt is whereby water scarce regions through importing water intensive products instead of producing them locally to ensure local water security allan 1998 the trade volumes of products are then converted into virtual water volumes through virtual water content vwc estimations which quantify the amount of water embodied in the regional products trade the total volume of international virtual water trade in 2007 was 567 km3 which accounted for around 22 of global freshwater withdrawal for agriculture pacific institute 2008 thus virtual water trade expands the scope of regional water resources utilization it has become an important strategic choice for the sustainable use of water resources meanwhile a powerful factor for the rational allocation of regional water resources su et al 2014 hoekstra et al 2015 however one of the most important challenges is how to efficiently and sustainably allocate regional physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade in the face of mounting competition among different users i e urban for daily activities and public facilities industry environment and agriculture for products growing fao 2010 there are many studies using various mathematical techniques for optimal water allocation considering both conventional and nonconventional resources liu et al 2011a xi and poh 2014 al juaidi et al 2014 joustra and yeh 2015 liu et al 2011b proposed an optimization model approach through mixed integer linear programming techniques to optimize water resources management by minimizing the annual total cost including capital and operating costs for syros in greece molinos senante et al 2014 developed an optimization model for water allocation which involved multiple supply sources surface water groundwater reclaimed water and desalinated water and multiple uses urban agriculture industrial and environmental incorporating penalties into the objective function habibi davijani et al 2016 applied the particle swarm optimization algorithm to determine the optimum amount of water for industrial and agricultural sectors so as to maximize the number of jobs created lu et al 2016 presented a credibility based chance constrained optimization model for integrated agricultural irrigation and water resources management vanham et al 2016 quantified the water resources related to food consumption in thirteen cities located in mediterranean countries and analyzed the wf of three diet scenarios based upon a mediterranean dietary pattern chini et al 2017 comprehensively evaluated both direct and indirect water footprints across the united states and evaluated their spatial variability relative contributions to the total water footprint and statistical properties previous studies have made a great contribution for rational allocation of multiple water sources to multiple water demands for a certain objective although they considered the combination of physical nonconventional water resources with physical conventional resources few studies focused on integrating virtual water trade in water allocation procedures the only one undertaken by su et al 2014 subdivided the crop virtual water content into blue water and green water and developed a multi objective optimization model for agricultural water resources and applied the model to shiyang river basin to achieve a reasonable allocation of water resources however they only considered the water consumption in agricultural sector of different crops neglecting the competition of water demands among other sectors therefore it is critical to conduct such a study with focus on the optimal allocation of regional physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade to different users for the purpose of filling this research gap based on the references summarized above it could be deduced that optimization techniques have been widely applied in water resources allocation and water management strategic decision making cetinkaya et al 2008 li et al 2017 the limitation of these studies exists in the consideration of a single objective in their models such as the maximization of annual total cost in liu et al 2011b and the maximization of jobs created in habibi davijani et al 2016 besides the economic cost and benefit of water consumption how to quantify and minimize the environmental impacts is another critical factor of the allocation procedure thus a multi objective optimization model would be the more scientific method for water resource allocation in this context non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is one of the most efficient multi objective evolutionary algorithms using the elitist approach deb et al 2002 reed et al 2013 and has gained popularity in finding the near optimal solutions for optimization problems a vasan and simonovic 2010 zhang et al 2014 developed a systematic framework with a multi objective optimization model based on nsga ii considering the trade off among wastewater reuse supplies and demands costs and profits as well as pollutants reduction zatarain salazar et al 2016 used evolutionary multi objective direct policy search to understand the tradeoffs that emerge across the complex suite of multi sector demands in lower susquehanna river basin van meter et al 2014 recommended a holistic watershed scale approach that accounts for trade offs among water availability and socioeconomic wellbeing to explore the social economic and environmental dimensions of agricultural rwh ponds in india and evaluate the viability of these centuries old systems under current climate and population pressures therefore this study developed a multi objective optimization model to optimize the allocation of physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade to different water demanding users in beijing of china considering the trade offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption from the supply side physical water resources included surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water while virtual water trade associated with the trade of five major crops barley corn rice soy and wheat and three livestock products beef pork and poultry in agricultural sector from the demand side the idea of macro micro integration was applied in the model four users were considered i urban ii industry iii environment and iv agriculture the water demands of the first three users were quantified from a macro level i e the total amount of water consumption the water demand of agriculture in this study was subdivided into the water consumption of the five crops and three livestock products from a micro level on the one hand the green water blue water and total vwc of eight products were assessed in beijing on the other hand the optimal water allocation scheme from four physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade to four users was obtained through the optimization model the current study provided an innovative application of virtual water trade in the traditional allocation of physical water resources and thus the results would provide more scientific instructions for the management of regional water resources and support the establishment of a regional water virtual water trade network 2 method 2 1 study area beijing was selected as the study area fig 1 it locates at the edge of the north china plain ncp with latitude 39 4 41 6 north and longitude 115 7 117 4 east beijing has been faced with increasing water demand due to expanding population and rapid economic development which sources 70 of its water withdrawals i e 20 km3 y from the ncp aquifers foster et al 2004 wada et al 2010 in order to meet the water demand the government of beijing has paid great attention to wastewater reuse and water transfer projects it was reported that beijing had the highest wastewater reuse ratio 59 12 in china by the end of 2011 and the volume of reused wastewater was 702 78 million m3 in 2011 zhang et al 2014 moreover beijing is the main water receiving area of the world s largest water transfer project the south north water transfer project and has received a total of 1 23 billion m3 water in the past five years bwg 2016 as the largest urban region and economic center of northern china beijing has to feed 21 7 million residents and a large transient population bmbs 2016 due to limited arable land resources almost all the crop and livestock products produced in beijing are supplied to local consumers huang et al 2012 however the local products still could not meet the huge food demand for the population and only accounted for about 17 of total grain crop consumption and 23 of total livestock product consumption in 2014 fao 2014 bmbs 2015 thus beijing needs to import a great number of primary products from other regions to balance the local food demand which would involve the virtual water trade embedded in the products the virtual water import volume of beijing exceeded 7 26 million m3 in 2007 in particular around 90 of the virtual water import was from agricultural sectors dong et al 2014 therefore how to efficiently and fairly manage regional physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade for the demand of different sectors is a challenge for the government of beijing 2 2 the framework this study established a framework to optimize the allocation of physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade to different water users in beijing 2012 considering the trade offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption the flowchart of the calculation process was presented in fig 2 from the supply side physical water resources included surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water while virtual water trade associated with the trade of five major crops barley corn rice soy and wheat and three livestock products beef pork and poultry in agricultural sector from the demand side the idea of macro micro integration was applied in the model four users were considered i urban ii industry iii environment and iv agriculture the water demands of the first three users were quantified from a macro level i e the gross volume of water consumption as for the last user the water demand of agriculture in this study was subdivided into the water consumption of the five crops and three livestock products from a micro level agriculture the most freshwater consuming process by far 80 of total use rost et al 2008 has become the key sector to decrease water use especially for the increasing water demands of other sectors dalin et al 2012 the five crops selected in this study covered around 60 of the harvested crop area 2015 and more than 86 blue water consumption of crop production in beijing 1978 2012 while the three livestock products covered 90 of the amount of livestock on hand 2015 and were also selected in the study of dalin et al 2012 bmbs 2016 xu et al 2015 because water quantity and quality has been integrated into the model not all water resources could satisfy all types of demands in general surface water groundwater and transferred water could be allocated to all the four water users however the reclaimed water was not used for urban needs due to its water quality consideration and the absence of separate distribution systems molinos senante et al 2014 therefore it was assumed that the treatment level of reclaimed water was the same for the three reclaimed water users virtual water trade in present study was only involved with the trade of agricultural products due to the high proportion around 90 of agricultural sectors in virtual water import volume of beijing it was clear that the imported virtual water played a great role as an alternative water resource for agriculture and contributed to save a huge quantity of blue water which could be utilized by other sectors with a better economic output 2 3 objective functions the multi objective optimization of multiple water resources allocation consisted of two objectives maximization of economic benefit and minimization of environmental impacts of water consumption the calculation of economic benefit from different sectors could be expressed as 1 max ben total income total cost 2 total income i j u i i j q i j k u i k m k i 1 4 j 1 4 k 1 8 where u i i j rmb yuan m3 was the unit income gained from the use of water from source i to water demanding user j u i k rmb yuan ton was the unit income of the import product k q i j m3 was the volume of water from source i to water user j in particular q 41 0 m k tons was the quantity of the import product k from other regions 3 total cost i j u c i j q i j k u c k m k i 1 4 j 1 4 k 1 8 where u c i j rmb yuan m3 was the unit cost of supplying water from source i to water demanding user j u c k rmb yuan ton was the unit cost of the import product k the total cost comprised three components the first one was the cost of transporting water from the source i to water user j the second referred to the operation and maintenance o m cost including the o m cost of canals transferring pipelines and water reclamation plants the third was the initial capital investment of infrastructures which divided by the life span of the infrastructures and the designed water output volume per year the unit benefit and costs of water volume and products showed a temporal and spatial distribution due to hydrologic shocks or other external impacts and here average costs were used for model calculations the function of the second objective i e minimization of the environmental impacts of water consumption was referred from bayart et al 2014 to integrate the issues of volume scarcity and quality into a single indicator to assess the reduction of available water for the environment induced in water withdrawal areas by freshwater uses for human activities 4 m i n e i i 1 2 j 1 4 q i j w q i w s i i j 1 4 q 4 j w q e w s i 1 j 1 4 α d j w q e w s i 1 where w q i unitless was the water quality indices of the water from source i w q e was the water quality indices of secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant w s i i unitless was water scarcity indices of water source i α was the ratio of sewage generation to water use d j m3 was the water demand of water user j here the wsi of water received body was assumed the same as that of surface water for the calculation of w q i the main pollutants such as nitrogen n phosphorus p and chemical oxygen demand cod was comprehensively evaluated thus w q i could be calculated by 5 w q i min 1 c r e f p c i p where c r e f p mg l was the reference concentration for pollutant p corresponding to ambient water quality standards for surface water groundwater in china c i p mg l is the effective concentration of pollutant p in the water transported from source i the minimum value of c r e f p c i p was selected in this study instead of the sum of it since different pollutants could be diluted by water at the same time zeng et al 2013 the water consumption of agriculture in this study was subdivided into the water used to produce five crops and three livestock products d 4 was shown in formula 6 d 4 k v w b l u e k m l o c a l k where v w b l u e k m3 ton was the blue water consumption of product k the estimation of v w b l u e k was described in next section m l o c a l k ton was the quantity of product k produced locally 2 4 virtual water content estimation the vwc m3 ton of crops in beijing i e consumptive water footprint of producing the crops was calculated by dividing the total green and blue evapotranspiration et m3 ha over the crop growing period respectively by the crop yield y ton ha dalin et al 2014 hoekstra et al 2011 it thus accounted for crop water consumption 7 v w c k e t k y k k 1 5 daily et and y were simulated at a resolution level of 5 by 5 arc min with the fao crop water productivity model aquacrop steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 in aquacrop the daily crop transpiration tr mm was used to derive the daily gain in above ground biomass b via the normalized biomass water productive of the crop which was normalized for the co2 concentration of the bulk atmosphere the evaporative demand of the atmosphere et0 and crop classes the harvestable portion the crop yield of b at the end of the growing period was determined as product of b and the harvest index harvest index was adjusted to water stress depending on the timing and extent of the stress steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 the simulated y of each crop was consistent with that in beijing statistics the vwc of livestock products in beijing was defined as water consumption per head of livestock m3 head involving feed s vwc and drinking and cleaning water divided by the livestock production per head kg head dalin et al 2014 8 v w c k l a l v w c f e e d l w c o t h e r k p k k 6 8 l 1 5 where a l ton was the quantity of feed product l consumption for livestock product k v w c f e e d l was the vwc of feed product l the proportion of each feed product l was listed in table s2 referred form dalin et al 2014 w c o t h e r k was the water consumption other than feed p k kg head was the livestock production per head therefore the total virtual water trade volume to beijing vwt total 108 m3 was calculated by the trade quantities of products and their vwcs shown in formula 9 v w t t o t a l k v w a v e b l u e k m k where v w a v e b l u e k m3 ton was the national average blue water consumption of product k here the vwc of import products from other regions were assumed to be equal to the national average vwc for the calculation of this model meanwhile the virtual water trade embedded in import products from other countries was not considered in this study because of data available for unit cost and benefit of agricultural products from other countries and the fact that the import products were not all consumed in beijing local areas which could also be transferred to other provinces in china 2 5 physical constraints 2 5 1 water availability and demand constraints the sum of the water sent from each source to different water users cannot exceed the original resource availability in addition the sum of water supplied for each users from different sources should reach the minimal demanding volume of the user particularly the chinese government has set the three red lines policy on sustainable agricultural blue water use which sets target regarding total maximum national blue water consumption 670 billion m3 y until 2020 scprc 2010 for beijing city the maximum blue water consumption is 4 12 billion m3 y calculated by the ratio between the total blue water consumption of beijing and that of nation for past 10 years all the data were scaled to match that in beijing statistics 10 j q i j q t i i 1 4 j 1 4 11 i 1 γ q i j min d j i 1 4 j 1 4 12 i 1 2 j 1 4 q i j 4 12 10 9 where q t i m3 was the water availability in the source i γ was the leakage ration of water supply including water lost in waterworks and distribution pipelines 2 5 2 products import constraints beijing was one of main regions with net virtual water import to balance the huge water consumption for agriculture which involved more than 20 million tons crop trade bmbs 2016 dong et al 2014 however in order to protect regional food security and social stability at least 50 of regional food demands needed to be met by local production except barley due to its lack of cultivation in beijing su et al 2014 furthermore the quantity of crop and livestock products including local production and trade should exceed the total quantity of people consumption 13 m k 0 5 m k k 4 14 m k m l o c a l k m k where m k tons was the total quantity of product k for people consumption it was estimated by multiplying the quantity of product k consumption per capita by the total population in beijing the actual water consumption of agricultural product consumption d 4 m3 was shown 15 d 4 v w c k m k 2 6 data the main data sources for model calculation were statistical reports from ministry of water resources mwr ministry of environmental protection mep ministry of housing and urban rural development mhud economic and trade commission etc and national bureau of statistics nbs of beijing the parameters from statistical reports included d j m k q t i u c i j u c k u i i j u i k w q e w q i y k p k table 1 table s1 the climate data for aquacrop calculation such as monthly precipitation reference evapotranspiration maximum temperature and minimum temperature at a resolution of 30 by 30 arc min were taken from harris et al 2014 crop yield statistics and population of beijing were taken from beijing statistical yearbook bmbs 2013 soil texture data were obtained from isric soil and terrain database for china dijkshoorn et al 2008 data on total soil water capacity in vol at a spatial resolution of 5 by 5 arc min were obtained from the isric wise version 1 2 dataset batjes 2012 the livestock diets were collected from chinagro fischer et al 2007 the consumption of each product per capita were collected from fao 2012 the gis polygon data for beijing were obtained from nasmg 2010 3 results seventy pareto solutions were obtained for the multi objective model through nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii table s3 according to the severe situations of environment pollution on the contrary to the rapid economic growth in beijing the minimization of environmental impact of water consumption was considered as the external set of criteria therefore the solution no 26 with the minimal environmental impact 611 7 million m3 water eq year was selected as the control strategy the corresponding economic benefit was 208 5 billion rmb yuan year the specific values of q i j and m k were listed in table s3 3 1 virtual water content vwc of products in beijing the average green water blue water and total virtual water content of each product were estimated and showed in table 2 it could be found that soy had the largest total vwc among five crops due to the huge green water embedded in the grow period meanwhile the largest irrigational water demand of wheat was implied from its high blue water content 737 8 m3 t fig 3 illustrated the spatial distribution of green water blue water total virtual water content in beijing and the blue water trade of products to beijing the green water fig 3a and blue water fig 3b of products showed a similar spatial distribution the central area fig 2 had the lowest green water and blue water content of products while the regions surrounding the central area showed a high green water and blue water content it is because residential and commercial zones mainly situated in the central area of beijing and thus farmlands almost distributed around the central area for less cost of commodities transportation as for the distribution of blue water there were two regions with high blue water content of products i e the southwest and the north to the central area this phenomenon was in accordance with the existence of xijiao farmland in the northeast of haidian district and nanjiao farmland in the north of daxing district fig s1 moreover the virtual water of five crops and three livestock products flowed to beijing were 4 9 10 8 m3 and 2 0 10 8 m3 respectively fig 3b which resulted from the maximal volumes of import products table s3 the total vwc of products fig 3c concentrated in the southeast and northwest of beijing the north and southwest of beijing showed the generally small total vwc due to the mountainous land type 3 2 the unbalance between water supply and demand in beijing fig 4 a and b illustrated the volumes of water consumed from different water sources and for different purposes from 2004 to 2013 data from beijing statistical yearbooks respectively the total water supply volume decreased before 2006 and then tended to be stable after then although the groundwater availability continuously reduced in this period the nonconventional water resources i e transferred water and reclaimed water significantly replaced the demand of groundwater nevertheless the total water demand of different users presented an increasing trend from 2004 to 2013 which showed a high degree correlation with the increasing trend of actual water demand for agriculture blue water consumption for the production of total food demand by the population these situations eventually caused the rising unbalance between the water demand and water supply fig 4c in the meantime more severe water scarcity in beijing fortunately virtual water trade has been playing a significant role in filling this gap and alleviating the water scarce conditions the virtual water volume of agricultural products flowing to beijing augmented from 2 1 10 8 m3 in 2004 to 12 1 10 8 m3 in 2013 in this context the imported virtual water has become the largest supplement for water resources and the most effective method for water saving in beijing compared with transferred water and reclaimed water 3 3 the optimal allocation of water resources in beijing the results figs 5 and 6 showed that urban and agriculture were the two predominant users of surface water with 53 3 and 40 2 of surface water consumption respectively besides urban would also be the foremost consumption of transferred water 48 2 comparing with other three users 18 8 for industrial demand 18 1 for environmental demand and 14 9 for agricultural demand although agriculture had accounted for 40 2 of surface water consumption the essential role of agriculture played in groundwater and reclaimed water consumption were notable in this model which accounted for 56 3 and 51 6 of groundwater and reclaimed water consumption respectively in order to satisfy the considerable water consumption of agricultural irrigation groundwater was the most economic source while reclaimed water had the least environmental impacts in this model additionally industry was the secondary water user of reclaimed water 34 0 due to the short destinations between wastewater treatment plants and industrial areas of beijing to the beat of our knowledge environment was an indispensable water user of water allocation procedure it could be found that environmental water consumption showed an unobvious difference among each water source which were 0 7 108 m3 0 9 108 m3 0 5 108 m3 and 1 3 108 m3 fig 5 respectively due to the less water quality required of water sources when considered from the demand side the proportion of each water source in different water users distinctly varied figs 5 and 7 it was illustrated that the total urban water demand should be supplied from surface water followed by groundwater and transferred water the primary impact on this result was the higher environmental impact of groundwater than that of surface water environmental impact was determined by two parameters i e water scarcity index wsi i and water quality index wq i of water resource the higher value of the wsi i the more intense the water scarcity the higher value of the wq i the better the water quality although groundwater withdrawal decreased in the past two decades in beijing the groundwater extraction rates far exceeded its recharge rates leading to a high value of water scarcity zeng et al 2013 the wsi i value of 1 45 for groundwater was higher than that of 1 2 for surface water meanwhile the wq i value of 0 62 for groundwater was higher than that of 0 48 for surface water table s1 it was meant that 1 m3 of groundwater utilization provoked a greater potential environmental impact on the local water ecosystem than equivalent surface water extraction for industrial uses reclaimed water played a decisive role for water supply it was because that the cost of reclaimed water for industrial demand was the least compared with other water users that the benefit from this balance of supply and demand was relatively economic 82 3 rmb yuan m3 environmental water consumption was satisfied by each source without dominant water supplied type i e 39 2 for reclaimed water 26 4 for groundwater 19 8 for surface water and the last 14 6 for transferred water as for agricultural uses surface water groundwater and reclaimed water took almost the same proportion in this model while transferred water had only 2 9 for agricultural demand due to its high economic cost for local farmers however the imported virtual water here contributed significantly 31 7 of agricultural water consumption which was the largest among the five water resources this was the reason that virtual water trade should be considered in the allocation of water resource for its critical importance in local blue water savings 4 discussion 4 1 virtual water trade for regional water resources the results in this study are compared with the results from zhuo et al 2016 and dong et al 2014 the total vwc of five crops in this study are all smaller than the national average values as estimated by zhuo et al 2016 the differences are mainly because of the distinctions between green water content of crops due to the lower precipitation in beijing moreover the value of virtual water trade to beijing in dong s study 8 45 billion m3 is twice as much as that in this study 4 3 billion m3 it could be explained that dong considered the virtual water trade of six sectors besides agriculture while limited eight agricultural products are considered in this study the initial aim of virtual water trade is to alleviate the water stress in import regions beijing imports corn soy wheat and rice from other regions and all these four crops are produced out of beijing with less blue water than those produced locally except barley table 2 thus imports of corn soy wheat and rice to beijing contribute to saving blue water resources not only in beijing but nationally as for the livestock products the blue water consumption of poultry production in beijing is lower that than in other regions it implies that the import of poultry to beijing actually would cause a blue water resources loss in the national level beijing as one of the three megacities in china has the highest per capita vwc of products consumption but with the lowest per water resources besides due to the defect of arable lands beijing is required to import more than 70 food from other regions to meet the demand of the population foster et al 2004 wada et al 2010 which inflects in the model results that the optimal volumes of products import all reach their upper boundary of parameters tables s1 and s3 in order to protect the local food security one of the measurements carried out by beijing government is to cooperate with tianjin and hebei provinces to form a multi win win association for development together so called jing jin ji coordinated development they do not only establish a partnership in the fields of commerce and society but also in environment and resources despite the great contribution of virtual water trade on the blue water saving in water import regions the impact of water consumption in export regions may not be satisfactory indeed some top export provinces have relatively lower water use productions i e vwc higher than national average such as inner mongolia for corn and soy production heilongjiang and jilin provinces for rice and hebei provinces for pork this imbalance situation would exacerbate water stress for virtual water export regions and cause the local population continuously suffer from water scarcity problem another potential problem was how to ensure the adequate agricultural product export under a hydrologic shock such as drought or monsoon droughts could change the spatial water distribution and have a great influence of agricultural production yield while monsoon would cause water logging disasters in urban areas in a closed basin any variability in natural precipitation or increased consumptive use could lead to water shortages for some users especially during droughts it was reported that the drought happened in henan province in 2009 caused a 37 reduction of corn yield mbsh 2010 which impacted not only the corn export and corresponding economic benefits but also impaired the food security in local areas the virtual water import volume from these regions would reduce but increase from other regions to ensure the food security of virtual water import regions therefore in order to reduce the vulnerability of water and food security it is imperative for governments of regions and nation make significant investments into the construction of more water efficient irrigation infrastructures and the augmentation of unconventional water resource utilization 4 2 virtual water trade for water allocation it is clear that the integration of virtual water trade in water allocation rationalizes the traditional allocation of physical water resources it has a noticeable influence on the composition of each water supplied from physical resources in order to illustrate the influences graphically the comparison between the optimal water resources allocation from the supply side fig 8 a and the demand side fig 8b in present study and by the traditional allocation idea i e without the consideration of virtual water trade is demonstrated from the supply side fig 8a the proportion of agricultural water demand in surface water groundwater and reclaimed water decreases 23 5 8 9 and 7 6 respectively it is mentioned above that virtual water trade could decrease the local blue water consumption for agricultural irrigation when integrating the virtual water trade the initial water for agriculture supplied from physical water resources could be distributed to other sectors for the purpose of a higher economic output ben for 208 5 billion rmb yuan year with virtual water trade vs 169 7 billion rmb yuan year without virtual water trade table s4 however there is an increasing trend of agricultural consumption in transferred water from 9 5 to 14 9 the water volume from transferred water to agricultural uses is still the least among the four water sources which causes a poor stabilization of the results for q 34 the less water supplied from other three sources should be satisfied by transferred water in this model moreover the results instructed by a traditional idea imply that agricultural water consumption is the largest component in surface water ground water and reclaimed water however this situation changes into the largest proportion of urban water uses in the allocation of surface water when integrating virtual water trade due to the convenience of surface water withdrawal for urban activities from the demand side fig 8b the most notable change exists in the reclaimed water with the increasing water volume in industrial sector but a shrinking volume in environmental uses it could be explained that virtual water import become the largest water supplied component for agricultural consumption when integrating virtual water trade in water allocation which accompanied by the decreasing surface water and groundwater supply in agriculture while the increasing trend in urban and environment this contributes to the shrinking water volume of reclaimed water consumption in environmental uses and thus more and more reclaimed water could be distributed to satisfy industrial water demand although the results obtained from the proposed multi objective optimization model show many evident distinctions from that of the traditional allocation there are also some issues out of consideration in the present study such as the virtual water trade involved with the trade of industrial productions or public service previously reported findings that agriculture represented 92 of the worldwide water footprint mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 rushforth and ruddell 2016 found that agricultural contributed 76 of virtual water import considering commodity flows in flagstaff arizona usa but livestock was a small component of virtual water import 2 5 with a 26 percentage attributable to animal feed in this study livestock took a proportion of 29 of blue virtual water import in beijing more than ten fold of that in flagstaff which could be explained that the local production of livestock was the first choice in western usa while there were extremely limited farmlands for livestock growing and production in beijing ruddell et al 2014 demonstrated a 17 million gallons per year of blue water footprint embedded in electricity production trade and consumption in western u s states due to outsourcing from more water efficient states to less water efficient states which consistent with the results in kumar and singh 2005 novo et al 2009 and verma et al 2009 actually it was a more sustainable phenomenon that the virtual water flowed from water adequate regions to water scarce regions the virtual water import to beijing took a great proportion from water scarce northeastern china and western china and this imbalance situation would exacerbate water stress for virtual water export regions and cause the local population continuously suffer from water scarcity problem future researches about the water allocation and distribution are required to consider the virtual water trade in different sectors such as transportation energy generation environment flows and social service for a comprehensive water allocation system 4 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the robustness of the results in response to the variables of water supply sources availability and water demand volumes according to the annual variations of water supply sources availability and water demand volumes from 2006 to 2015 fig s2 six variances of water supply sources and four variances of water demand volumes are considered for sensitivity analysis i e 30 variance of surface water 30 variance of groundwater 30 variance of transferred water and 30 variance of reclaimed water for supply sources availability while 30 variance of urban user 20 variance of industrial user 30 variance of environmental user and 30 of agricultural user for water demand volumes the results table 3 show that m k of eight import products perform high robustness in the variances of different parameters less than 0 01 the fact that beijing required to import huge number of products for the consumption of population due to the low self sufficiency rates of products implies that the proportion of virtual water import in agricultural demand would amplify as long as the decrease of agricultural demand in the future the robustness of q i j is influenced relatively great by 30 variance of surface water 30 variance of groundwater and 30 variance of urban user particularly the impact of q 12 q 13 q 32 and q 33 are noticeable in response to these five variances furthermore the results of q 12 and q 13 show poor stability under all the variances it means that the water supplied to industry and environment from surface water source are subjected intensively to the changes of regional water resources available and water demand volumes the volumes of surface water groundwater and urban demand are regarded as the main factors for the performance of rational water allocation in this context therefore how to manage surface water groundwater and urban water demand sustainably is the critical point for regional water management in the future 5 conclusions this study developed a multi objective optimization model to optimize the allocation of physical water and virtual water resources to different water users in beijing of china considering the trade offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption from the supply side physical water resources included surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water while virtual water flow associated with the trade of five major crops barley corn rice soy and wheat and three livestock products beef pork and poultry in agricultural sector from the demand side four users were considered i urban ii industry iii environment and iv agriculture for the traditional allocation of physical water resources agriculture and urban were the two predominant water users accounting 54 and 28 of water consumption respectively surface water and groundwater satisfied around 70 water demands of different users 34 and 36 respectively which eventually caused the increasing unbalance between water demand and water supply due to the long time period for water renewability fortunately virtual water trade significantly alleviated this unbalance when considered the virtual water trade of the eight agricultural products in water allocation procedure the proportion of agricultural consumption decreased to 45 in total water demands while the groundwater consumption decreased to 24 in total water supply virtual water trade overturned the traditional components of water supplied from each source for agricultural consumption and became the largest water source in beijing in addition environmental demand took a same proportion of water consumption in each water source reclaimed water was the main water source for industrial and environmental users surface water met more than 60 water resource of urban demand acknowledgment this study is financially supported by the national key research and

19841,this study provides an innovative application of virtual water trade in the traditional allocation of physical water resources in water scarce regions a multi objective optimization model was developed to optimize the allocation of physical water and virtual water resources to different water users in beijing china considering the trade offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water constituted the physical resource of water supply side while virtual water flow associated with the trade of five major crops barley corn rice soy and wheat and three livestock products beef pork and poultry in agricultural sector calculated by the trade quantities of products and their virtual water contents urban daily activities and public facilities industry environment and agriculture products growing were considered in water demand side as for the traditional allocation of physical water resources the results showed that agriculture and urban were the two predominant water users accounting 54 and 28 respectively while groundwater and surface water satisfied around 70 water demands of different users accounting 36 and 34 respectively when considered the virtual water trade of eight agricultural products in water allocation procedure the proportion of agricultural consumption decreased to 45 in total water demand while the groundwater consumption decreased to 24 in total water supply virtual water trade overturned the traditional components of water supplied from different sources for agricultural consumption and became the largest water source in beijing additionally it was also found that environmental demand took a similar percentage of water consumption in each water source reclaimed water was the main water source for industrial and environmental users the results suggest that physical water resources would mainly satisfy the consumption of urban and environment and the unbalance between water supply and demand could be filled by virtual water import in water scarce regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords virtual water trade water allocation multi objective optimization water management 1 introduction in the past decade cities around china and the rest of the world have been facing moderate to severe water scarcity in different sectors due to population growth food production climate change and limited water resources dalin et al 2014 unep 2011 it is reported that more than 4 0 billion people live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least one month of the year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 particularly agriculture as the most fundamental sector all over china irrigation covers 45 of the country s agricultural land and accounts for 65 of national water withdrawal fao 2012 a large number of investments have been made to seek methods for balancing considerations of increasing demands and sustainability to provide reliable water supplies to customers the combination of conventional and nonconventional water resources from a quantity and quality viewpoint forms a promising method to supply future water demands which has been widely implied around the world especially in china avni et al 2013 habibi davijani et al 2016 liu et al 2011a conventional water resources include surface water and underground water while nonconventional resources are dominantly desalinated water reclaimed water and transferred physical water in most arid and semi arid regions groundwater always transferred from agriculture to urban and industrial uses for a higher economic benefit rogers et al 2002 and reclaimed water distributed for agricultural demand with a positive environmental impact this change would allocate available water resources more rationally according to the quantity and quality required for each molinos senante et al 2014 apart from these major physical water resources there is another form of water resource flow to alleviate water stress so called virtual water allan 1998 zhao et al 2015 based on the concept of virtual water the idea of water footprint was introduced by hoekstra in 2002 hoekstra 2003 both of them were defined as the water required for the production of goods and services along their supply chains hoekstra 2009 with the broaden knowledge on considering both green and blue water in estimating water consumption by agriculture sector shiklomanov 2000 falkenmark and rockström 2004 virtual water can be classified into green water and blue water green water from direct rainfall for crops growing and blue water from surface water and groundwater hanasaki et al 2008a b konar et al 2011 the degree of green water utilization by crops depends on the growing season moreover blue water could be used directly by other economic sectors but green water cannot virtual water trade vwt is whereby water scarce regions through importing water intensive products instead of producing them locally to ensure local water security allan 1998 the trade volumes of products are then converted into virtual water volumes through virtual water content vwc estimations which quantify the amount of water embodied in the regional products trade the total volume of international virtual water trade in 2007 was 567 km3 which accounted for around 22 of global freshwater withdrawal for agriculture pacific institute 2008 thus virtual water trade expands the scope of regional water resources utilization it has become an important strategic choice for the sustainable use of water resources meanwhile a powerful factor for the rational allocation of regional water resources su et al 2014 hoekstra et al 2015 however one of the most important challenges is how to efficiently and sustainably allocate regional physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade in the face of mounting competition among different users i e urban for daily activities and public facilities industry environment and agriculture for products growing fao 2010 there are many studies using various mathematical techniques for optimal water allocation considering both conventional and nonconventional resources liu et al 2011a xi and poh 2014 al juaidi et al 2014 joustra and yeh 2015 liu et al 2011b proposed an optimization model approach through mixed integer linear programming techniques to optimize water resources management by minimizing the annual total cost including capital and operating costs for syros in greece molinos senante et al 2014 developed an optimization model for water allocation which involved multiple supply sources surface water groundwater reclaimed water and desalinated water and multiple uses urban agriculture industrial and environmental incorporating penalties into the objective function habibi davijani et al 2016 applied the particle swarm optimization algorithm to determine the optimum amount of water for industrial and agricultural sectors so as to maximize the number of jobs created lu et al 2016 presented a credibility based chance constrained optimization model for integrated agricultural irrigation and water resources management vanham et al 2016 quantified the water resources related to food consumption in thirteen cities located in mediterranean countries and analyzed the wf of three diet scenarios based upon a mediterranean dietary pattern chini et al 2017 comprehensively evaluated both direct and indirect water footprints across the united states and evaluated their spatial variability relative contributions to the total water footprint and statistical properties previous studies have made a great contribution for rational allocation of multiple water sources to multiple water demands for a certain objective although they considered the combination of physical nonconventional water resources with physical conventional resources few studies focused on integrating virtual water trade in water allocation procedures the only one undertaken by su et al 2014 subdivided the crop virtual water content into blue water and green water and developed a multi objective optimization model for agricultural water resources and applied the model to shiyang river basin to achieve a reasonable allocation of water resources however they only considered the water consumption in agricultural sector of different crops neglecting the competition of water demands among other sectors therefore it is critical to conduct such a study with focus on the optimal allocation of regional physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade to different users for the purpose of filling this research gap based on the references summarized above it could be deduced that optimization techniques have been widely applied in water resources allocation and water management strategic decision making cetinkaya et al 2008 li et al 2017 the limitation of these studies exists in the consideration of a single objective in their models such as the maximization of annual total cost in liu et al 2011b and the maximization of jobs created in habibi davijani et al 2016 besides the economic cost and benefit of water consumption how to quantify and minimize the environmental impacts is another critical factor of the allocation procedure thus a multi objective optimization model would be the more scientific method for water resource allocation in this context non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is one of the most efficient multi objective evolutionary algorithms using the elitist approach deb et al 2002 reed et al 2013 and has gained popularity in finding the near optimal solutions for optimization problems a vasan and simonovic 2010 zhang et al 2014 developed a systematic framework with a multi objective optimization model based on nsga ii considering the trade off among wastewater reuse supplies and demands costs and profits as well as pollutants reduction zatarain salazar et al 2016 used evolutionary multi objective direct policy search to understand the tradeoffs that emerge across the complex suite of multi sector demands in lower susquehanna river basin van meter et al 2014 recommended a holistic watershed scale approach that accounts for trade offs among water availability and socioeconomic wellbeing to explore the social economic and environmental dimensions of agricultural rwh ponds in india and evaluate the viability of these centuries old systems under current climate and population pressures therefore this study developed a multi objective optimization model to optimize the allocation of physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade to different water demanding users in beijing of china considering the trade offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption from the supply side physical water resources included surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water while virtual water trade associated with the trade of five major crops barley corn rice soy and wheat and three livestock products beef pork and poultry in agricultural sector from the demand side the idea of macro micro integration was applied in the model four users were considered i urban ii industry iii environment and iv agriculture the water demands of the first three users were quantified from a macro level i e the total amount of water consumption the water demand of agriculture in this study was subdivided into the water consumption of the five crops and three livestock products from a micro level on the one hand the green water blue water and total vwc of eight products were assessed in beijing on the other hand the optimal water allocation scheme from four physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade to four users was obtained through the optimization model the current study provided an innovative application of virtual water trade in the traditional allocation of physical water resources and thus the results would provide more scientific instructions for the management of regional water resources and support the establishment of a regional water virtual water trade network 2 method 2 1 study area beijing was selected as the study area fig 1 it locates at the edge of the north china plain ncp with latitude 39 4 41 6 north and longitude 115 7 117 4 east beijing has been faced with increasing water demand due to expanding population and rapid economic development which sources 70 of its water withdrawals i e 20 km3 y from the ncp aquifers foster et al 2004 wada et al 2010 in order to meet the water demand the government of beijing has paid great attention to wastewater reuse and water transfer projects it was reported that beijing had the highest wastewater reuse ratio 59 12 in china by the end of 2011 and the volume of reused wastewater was 702 78 million m3 in 2011 zhang et al 2014 moreover beijing is the main water receiving area of the world s largest water transfer project the south north water transfer project and has received a total of 1 23 billion m3 water in the past five years bwg 2016 as the largest urban region and economic center of northern china beijing has to feed 21 7 million residents and a large transient population bmbs 2016 due to limited arable land resources almost all the crop and livestock products produced in beijing are supplied to local consumers huang et al 2012 however the local products still could not meet the huge food demand for the population and only accounted for about 17 of total grain crop consumption and 23 of total livestock product consumption in 2014 fao 2014 bmbs 2015 thus beijing needs to import a great number of primary products from other regions to balance the local food demand which would involve the virtual water trade embedded in the products the virtual water import volume of beijing exceeded 7 26 million m3 in 2007 in particular around 90 of the virtual water import was from agricultural sectors dong et al 2014 therefore how to efficiently and fairly manage regional physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade for the demand of different sectors is a challenge for the government of beijing 2 2 the framework this study established a framework to optimize the allocation of physical water resources integrated with virtual water trade to different water users in beijing 2012 considering the trade offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption the flowchart of the calculation process was presented in fig 2 from the supply side physical water resources included surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water while virtual water trade associated with the trade of five major crops barley corn rice soy and wheat and three livestock products beef pork and poultry in agricultural sector from the demand side the idea of macro micro integration was applied in the model four users were considered i urban ii industry iii environment and iv agriculture the water demands of the first three users were quantified from a macro level i e the gross volume of water consumption as for the last user the water demand of agriculture in this study was subdivided into the water consumption of the five crops and three livestock products from a micro level agriculture the most freshwater consuming process by far 80 of total use rost et al 2008 has become the key sector to decrease water use especially for the increasing water demands of other sectors dalin et al 2012 the five crops selected in this study covered around 60 of the harvested crop area 2015 and more than 86 blue water consumption of crop production in beijing 1978 2012 while the three livestock products covered 90 of the amount of livestock on hand 2015 and were also selected in the study of dalin et al 2012 bmbs 2016 xu et al 2015 because water quantity and quality has been integrated into the model not all water resources could satisfy all types of demands in general surface water groundwater and transferred water could be allocated to all the four water users however the reclaimed water was not used for urban needs due to its water quality consideration and the absence of separate distribution systems molinos senante et al 2014 therefore it was assumed that the treatment level of reclaimed water was the same for the three reclaimed water users virtual water trade in present study was only involved with the trade of agricultural products due to the high proportion around 90 of agricultural sectors in virtual water import volume of beijing it was clear that the imported virtual water played a great role as an alternative water resource for agriculture and contributed to save a huge quantity of blue water which could be utilized by other sectors with a better economic output 2 3 objective functions the multi objective optimization of multiple water resources allocation consisted of two objectives maximization of economic benefit and minimization of environmental impacts of water consumption the calculation of economic benefit from different sectors could be expressed as 1 max ben total income total cost 2 total income i j u i i j q i j k u i k m k i 1 4 j 1 4 k 1 8 where u i i j rmb yuan m3 was the unit income gained from the use of water from source i to water demanding user j u i k rmb yuan ton was the unit income of the import product k q i j m3 was the volume of water from source i to water user j in particular q 41 0 m k tons was the quantity of the import product k from other regions 3 total cost i j u c i j q i j k u c k m k i 1 4 j 1 4 k 1 8 where u c i j rmb yuan m3 was the unit cost of supplying water from source i to water demanding user j u c k rmb yuan ton was the unit cost of the import product k the total cost comprised three components the first one was the cost of transporting water from the source i to water user j the second referred to the operation and maintenance o m cost including the o m cost of canals transferring pipelines and water reclamation plants the third was the initial capital investment of infrastructures which divided by the life span of the infrastructures and the designed water output volume per year the unit benefit and costs of water volume and products showed a temporal and spatial distribution due to hydrologic shocks or other external impacts and here average costs were used for model calculations the function of the second objective i e minimization of the environmental impacts of water consumption was referred from bayart et al 2014 to integrate the issues of volume scarcity and quality into a single indicator to assess the reduction of available water for the environment induced in water withdrawal areas by freshwater uses for human activities 4 m i n e i i 1 2 j 1 4 q i j w q i w s i i j 1 4 q 4 j w q e w s i 1 j 1 4 α d j w q e w s i 1 where w q i unitless was the water quality indices of the water from source i w q e was the water quality indices of secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant w s i i unitless was water scarcity indices of water source i α was the ratio of sewage generation to water use d j m3 was the water demand of water user j here the wsi of water received body was assumed the same as that of surface water for the calculation of w q i the main pollutants such as nitrogen n phosphorus p and chemical oxygen demand cod was comprehensively evaluated thus w q i could be calculated by 5 w q i min 1 c r e f p c i p where c r e f p mg l was the reference concentration for pollutant p corresponding to ambient water quality standards for surface water groundwater in china c i p mg l is the effective concentration of pollutant p in the water transported from source i the minimum value of c r e f p c i p was selected in this study instead of the sum of it since different pollutants could be diluted by water at the same time zeng et al 2013 the water consumption of agriculture in this study was subdivided into the water used to produce five crops and three livestock products d 4 was shown in formula 6 d 4 k v w b l u e k m l o c a l k where v w b l u e k m3 ton was the blue water consumption of product k the estimation of v w b l u e k was described in next section m l o c a l k ton was the quantity of product k produced locally 2 4 virtual water content estimation the vwc m3 ton of crops in beijing i e consumptive water footprint of producing the crops was calculated by dividing the total green and blue evapotranspiration et m3 ha over the crop growing period respectively by the crop yield y ton ha dalin et al 2014 hoekstra et al 2011 it thus accounted for crop water consumption 7 v w c k e t k y k k 1 5 daily et and y were simulated at a resolution level of 5 by 5 arc min with the fao crop water productivity model aquacrop steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 in aquacrop the daily crop transpiration tr mm was used to derive the daily gain in above ground biomass b via the normalized biomass water productive of the crop which was normalized for the co2 concentration of the bulk atmosphere the evaporative demand of the atmosphere et0 and crop classes the harvestable portion the crop yield of b at the end of the growing period was determined as product of b and the harvest index harvest index was adjusted to water stress depending on the timing and extent of the stress steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 the simulated y of each crop was consistent with that in beijing statistics the vwc of livestock products in beijing was defined as water consumption per head of livestock m3 head involving feed s vwc and drinking and cleaning water divided by the livestock production per head kg head dalin et al 2014 8 v w c k l a l v w c f e e d l w c o t h e r k p k k 6 8 l 1 5 where a l ton was the quantity of feed product l consumption for livestock product k v w c f e e d l was the vwc of feed product l the proportion of each feed product l was listed in table s2 referred form dalin et al 2014 w c o t h e r k was the water consumption other than feed p k kg head was the livestock production per head therefore the total virtual water trade volume to beijing vwt total 108 m3 was calculated by the trade quantities of products and their vwcs shown in formula 9 v w t t o t a l k v w a v e b l u e k m k where v w a v e b l u e k m3 ton was the national average blue water consumption of product k here the vwc of import products from other regions were assumed to be equal to the national average vwc for the calculation of this model meanwhile the virtual water trade embedded in import products from other countries was not considered in this study because of data available for unit cost and benefit of agricultural products from other countries and the fact that the import products were not all consumed in beijing local areas which could also be transferred to other provinces in china 2 5 physical constraints 2 5 1 water availability and demand constraints the sum of the water sent from each source to different water users cannot exceed the original resource availability in addition the sum of water supplied for each users from different sources should reach the minimal demanding volume of the user particularly the chinese government has set the three red lines policy on sustainable agricultural blue water use which sets target regarding total maximum national blue water consumption 670 billion m3 y until 2020 scprc 2010 for beijing city the maximum blue water consumption is 4 12 billion m3 y calculated by the ratio between the total blue water consumption of beijing and that of nation for past 10 years all the data were scaled to match that in beijing statistics 10 j q i j q t i i 1 4 j 1 4 11 i 1 γ q i j min d j i 1 4 j 1 4 12 i 1 2 j 1 4 q i j 4 12 10 9 where q t i m3 was the water availability in the source i γ was the leakage ration of water supply including water lost in waterworks and distribution pipelines 2 5 2 products import constraints beijing was one of main regions with net virtual water import to balance the huge water consumption for agriculture which involved more than 20 million tons crop trade bmbs 2016 dong et al 2014 however in order to protect regional food security and social stability at least 50 of regional food demands needed to be met by local production except barley due to its lack of cultivation in beijing su et al 2014 furthermore the quantity of crop and livestock products including local production and trade should exceed the total quantity of people consumption 13 m k 0 5 m k k 4 14 m k m l o c a l k m k where m k tons was the total quantity of product k for people consumption it was estimated by multiplying the quantity of product k consumption per capita by the total population in beijing the actual water consumption of agricultural product consumption d 4 m3 was shown 15 d 4 v w c k m k 2 6 data the main data sources for model calculation were statistical reports from ministry of water resources mwr ministry of environmental protection mep ministry of housing and urban rural development mhud economic and trade commission etc and national bureau of statistics nbs of beijing the parameters from statistical reports included d j m k q t i u c i j u c k u i i j u i k w q e w q i y k p k table 1 table s1 the climate data for aquacrop calculation such as monthly precipitation reference evapotranspiration maximum temperature and minimum temperature at a resolution of 30 by 30 arc min were taken from harris et al 2014 crop yield statistics and population of beijing were taken from beijing statistical yearbook bmbs 2013 soil texture data were obtained from isric soil and terrain database for china dijkshoorn et al 2008 data on total soil water capacity in vol at a spatial resolution of 5 by 5 arc min were obtained from the isric wise version 1 2 dataset batjes 2012 the livestock diets were collected from chinagro fischer et al 2007 the consumption of each product per capita were collected from fao 2012 the gis polygon data for beijing were obtained from nasmg 2010 3 results seventy pareto solutions were obtained for the multi objective model through nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii table s3 according to the severe situations of environment pollution on the contrary to the rapid economic growth in beijing the minimization of environmental impact of water consumption was considered as the external set of criteria therefore the solution no 26 with the minimal environmental impact 611 7 million m3 water eq year was selected as the control strategy the corresponding economic benefit was 208 5 billion rmb yuan year the specific values of q i j and m k were listed in table s3 3 1 virtual water content vwc of products in beijing the average green water blue water and total virtual water content of each product were estimated and showed in table 2 it could be found that soy had the largest total vwc among five crops due to the huge green water embedded in the grow period meanwhile the largest irrigational water demand of wheat was implied from its high blue water content 737 8 m3 t fig 3 illustrated the spatial distribution of green water blue water total virtual water content in beijing and the blue water trade of products to beijing the green water fig 3a and blue water fig 3b of products showed a similar spatial distribution the central area fig 2 had the lowest green water and blue water content of products while the regions surrounding the central area showed a high green water and blue water content it is because residential and commercial zones mainly situated in the central area of beijing and thus farmlands almost distributed around the central area for less cost of commodities transportation as for the distribution of blue water there were two regions with high blue water content of products i e the southwest and the north to the central area this phenomenon was in accordance with the existence of xijiao farmland in the northeast of haidian district and nanjiao farmland in the north of daxing district fig s1 moreover the virtual water of five crops and three livestock products flowed to beijing were 4 9 10 8 m3 and 2 0 10 8 m3 respectively fig 3b which resulted from the maximal volumes of import products table s3 the total vwc of products fig 3c concentrated in the southeast and northwest of beijing the north and southwest of beijing showed the generally small total vwc due to the mountainous land type 3 2 the unbalance between water supply and demand in beijing fig 4 a and b illustrated the volumes of water consumed from different water sources and for different purposes from 2004 to 2013 data from beijing statistical yearbooks respectively the total water supply volume decreased before 2006 and then tended to be stable after then although the groundwater availability continuously reduced in this period the nonconventional water resources i e transferred water and reclaimed water significantly replaced the demand of groundwater nevertheless the total water demand of different users presented an increasing trend from 2004 to 2013 which showed a high degree correlation with the increasing trend of actual water demand for agriculture blue water consumption for the production of total food demand by the population these situations eventually caused the rising unbalance between the water demand and water supply fig 4c in the meantime more severe water scarcity in beijing fortunately virtual water trade has been playing a significant role in filling this gap and alleviating the water scarce conditions the virtual water volume of agricultural products flowing to beijing augmented from 2 1 10 8 m3 in 2004 to 12 1 10 8 m3 in 2013 in this context the imported virtual water has become the largest supplement for water resources and the most effective method for water saving in beijing compared with transferred water and reclaimed water 3 3 the optimal allocation of water resources in beijing the results figs 5 and 6 showed that urban and agriculture were the two predominant users of surface water with 53 3 and 40 2 of surface water consumption respectively besides urban would also be the foremost consumption of transferred water 48 2 comparing with other three users 18 8 for industrial demand 18 1 for environmental demand and 14 9 for agricultural demand although agriculture had accounted for 40 2 of surface water consumption the essential role of agriculture played in groundwater and reclaimed water consumption were notable in this model which accounted for 56 3 and 51 6 of groundwater and reclaimed water consumption respectively in order to satisfy the considerable water consumption of agricultural irrigation groundwater was the most economic source while reclaimed water had the least environmental impacts in this model additionally industry was the secondary water user of reclaimed water 34 0 due to the short destinations between wastewater treatment plants and industrial areas of beijing to the beat of our knowledge environment was an indispensable water user of water allocation procedure it could be found that environmental water consumption showed an unobvious difference among each water source which were 0 7 108 m3 0 9 108 m3 0 5 108 m3 and 1 3 108 m3 fig 5 respectively due to the less water quality required of water sources when considered from the demand side the proportion of each water source in different water users distinctly varied figs 5 and 7 it was illustrated that the total urban water demand should be supplied from surface water followed by groundwater and transferred water the primary impact on this result was the higher environmental impact of groundwater than that of surface water environmental impact was determined by two parameters i e water scarcity index wsi i and water quality index wq i of water resource the higher value of the wsi i the more intense the water scarcity the higher value of the wq i the better the water quality although groundwater withdrawal decreased in the past two decades in beijing the groundwater extraction rates far exceeded its recharge rates leading to a high value of water scarcity zeng et al 2013 the wsi i value of 1 45 for groundwater was higher than that of 1 2 for surface water meanwhile the wq i value of 0 62 for groundwater was higher than that of 0 48 for surface water table s1 it was meant that 1 m3 of groundwater utilization provoked a greater potential environmental impact on the local water ecosystem than equivalent surface water extraction for industrial uses reclaimed water played a decisive role for water supply it was because that the cost of reclaimed water for industrial demand was the least compared with other water users that the benefit from this balance of supply and demand was relatively economic 82 3 rmb yuan m3 environmental water consumption was satisfied by each source without dominant water supplied type i e 39 2 for reclaimed water 26 4 for groundwater 19 8 for surface water and the last 14 6 for transferred water as for agricultural uses surface water groundwater and reclaimed water took almost the same proportion in this model while transferred water had only 2 9 for agricultural demand due to its high economic cost for local farmers however the imported virtual water here contributed significantly 31 7 of agricultural water consumption which was the largest among the five water resources this was the reason that virtual water trade should be considered in the allocation of water resource for its critical importance in local blue water savings 4 discussion 4 1 virtual water trade for regional water resources the results in this study are compared with the results from zhuo et al 2016 and dong et al 2014 the total vwc of five crops in this study are all smaller than the national average values as estimated by zhuo et al 2016 the differences are mainly because of the distinctions between green water content of crops due to the lower precipitation in beijing moreover the value of virtual water trade to beijing in dong s study 8 45 billion m3 is twice as much as that in this study 4 3 billion m3 it could be explained that dong considered the virtual water trade of six sectors besides agriculture while limited eight agricultural products are considered in this study the initial aim of virtual water trade is to alleviate the water stress in import regions beijing imports corn soy wheat and rice from other regions and all these four crops are produced out of beijing with less blue water than those produced locally except barley table 2 thus imports of corn soy wheat and rice to beijing contribute to saving blue water resources not only in beijing but nationally as for the livestock products the blue water consumption of poultry production in beijing is lower that than in other regions it implies that the import of poultry to beijing actually would cause a blue water resources loss in the national level beijing as one of the three megacities in china has the highest per capita vwc of products consumption but with the lowest per water resources besides due to the defect of arable lands beijing is required to import more than 70 food from other regions to meet the demand of the population foster et al 2004 wada et al 2010 which inflects in the model results that the optimal volumes of products import all reach their upper boundary of parameters tables s1 and s3 in order to protect the local food security one of the measurements carried out by beijing government is to cooperate with tianjin and hebei provinces to form a multi win win association for development together so called jing jin ji coordinated development they do not only establish a partnership in the fields of commerce and society but also in environment and resources despite the great contribution of virtual water trade on the blue water saving in water import regions the impact of water consumption in export regions may not be satisfactory indeed some top export provinces have relatively lower water use productions i e vwc higher than national average such as inner mongolia for corn and soy production heilongjiang and jilin provinces for rice and hebei provinces for pork this imbalance situation would exacerbate water stress for virtual water export regions and cause the local population continuously suffer from water scarcity problem another potential problem was how to ensure the adequate agricultural product export under a hydrologic shock such as drought or monsoon droughts could change the spatial water distribution and have a great influence of agricultural production yield while monsoon would cause water logging disasters in urban areas in a closed basin any variability in natural precipitation or increased consumptive use could lead to water shortages for some users especially during droughts it was reported that the drought happened in henan province in 2009 caused a 37 reduction of corn yield mbsh 2010 which impacted not only the corn export and corresponding economic benefits but also impaired the food security in local areas the virtual water import volume from these regions would reduce but increase from other regions to ensure the food security of virtual water import regions therefore in order to reduce the vulnerability of water and food security it is imperative for governments of regions and nation make significant investments into the construction of more water efficient irrigation infrastructures and the augmentation of unconventional water resource utilization 4 2 virtual water trade for water allocation it is clear that the integration of virtual water trade in water allocation rationalizes the traditional allocation of physical water resources it has a noticeable influence on the composition of each water supplied from physical resources in order to illustrate the influences graphically the comparison between the optimal water resources allocation from the supply side fig 8 a and the demand side fig 8b in present study and by the traditional allocation idea i e without the consideration of virtual water trade is demonstrated from the supply side fig 8a the proportion of agricultural water demand in surface water groundwater and reclaimed water decreases 23 5 8 9 and 7 6 respectively it is mentioned above that virtual water trade could decrease the local blue water consumption for agricultural irrigation when integrating the virtual water trade the initial water for agriculture supplied from physical water resources could be distributed to other sectors for the purpose of a higher economic output ben for 208 5 billion rmb yuan year with virtual water trade vs 169 7 billion rmb yuan year without virtual water trade table s4 however there is an increasing trend of agricultural consumption in transferred water from 9 5 to 14 9 the water volume from transferred water to agricultural uses is still the least among the four water sources which causes a poor stabilization of the results for q 34 the less water supplied from other three sources should be satisfied by transferred water in this model moreover the results instructed by a traditional idea imply that agricultural water consumption is the largest component in surface water ground water and reclaimed water however this situation changes into the largest proportion of urban water uses in the allocation of surface water when integrating virtual water trade due to the convenience of surface water withdrawal for urban activities from the demand side fig 8b the most notable change exists in the reclaimed water with the increasing water volume in industrial sector but a shrinking volume in environmental uses it could be explained that virtual water import become the largest water supplied component for agricultural consumption when integrating virtual water trade in water allocation which accompanied by the decreasing surface water and groundwater supply in agriculture while the increasing trend in urban and environment this contributes to the shrinking water volume of reclaimed water consumption in environmental uses and thus more and more reclaimed water could be distributed to satisfy industrial water demand although the results obtained from the proposed multi objective optimization model show many evident distinctions from that of the traditional allocation there are also some issues out of consideration in the present study such as the virtual water trade involved with the trade of industrial productions or public service previously reported findings that agriculture represented 92 of the worldwide water footprint mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 rushforth and ruddell 2016 found that agricultural contributed 76 of virtual water import considering commodity flows in flagstaff arizona usa but livestock was a small component of virtual water import 2 5 with a 26 percentage attributable to animal feed in this study livestock took a proportion of 29 of blue virtual water import in beijing more than ten fold of that in flagstaff which could be explained that the local production of livestock was the first choice in western usa while there were extremely limited farmlands for livestock growing and production in beijing ruddell et al 2014 demonstrated a 17 million gallons per year of blue water footprint embedded in electricity production trade and consumption in western u s states due to outsourcing from more water efficient states to less water efficient states which consistent with the results in kumar and singh 2005 novo et al 2009 and verma et al 2009 actually it was a more sustainable phenomenon that the virtual water flowed from water adequate regions to water scarce regions the virtual water import to beijing took a great proportion from water scarce northeastern china and western china and this imbalance situation would exacerbate water stress for virtual water export regions and cause the local population continuously suffer from water scarcity problem future researches about the water allocation and distribution are required to consider the virtual water trade in different sectors such as transportation energy generation environment flows and social service for a comprehensive water allocation system 4 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the robustness of the results in response to the variables of water supply sources availability and water demand volumes according to the annual variations of water supply sources availability and water demand volumes from 2006 to 2015 fig s2 six variances of water supply sources and four variances of water demand volumes are considered for sensitivity analysis i e 30 variance of surface water 30 variance of groundwater 30 variance of transferred water and 30 variance of reclaimed water for supply sources availability while 30 variance of urban user 20 variance of industrial user 30 variance of environmental user and 30 of agricultural user for water demand volumes the results table 3 show that m k of eight import products perform high robustness in the variances of different parameters less than 0 01 the fact that beijing required to import huge number of products for the consumption of population due to the low self sufficiency rates of products implies that the proportion of virtual water import in agricultural demand would amplify as long as the decrease of agricultural demand in the future the robustness of q i j is influenced relatively great by 30 variance of surface water 30 variance of groundwater and 30 variance of urban user particularly the impact of q 12 q 13 q 32 and q 33 are noticeable in response to these five variances furthermore the results of q 12 and q 13 show poor stability under all the variances it means that the water supplied to industry and environment from surface water source are subjected intensively to the changes of regional water resources available and water demand volumes the volumes of surface water groundwater and urban demand are regarded as the main factors for the performance of rational water allocation in this context therefore how to manage surface water groundwater and urban water demand sustainably is the critical point for regional water management in the future 5 conclusions this study developed a multi objective optimization model to optimize the allocation of physical water and virtual water resources to different water users in beijing of china considering the trade offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption from the supply side physical water resources included surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water while virtual water flow associated with the trade of five major crops barley corn rice soy and wheat and three livestock products beef pork and poultry in agricultural sector from the demand side four users were considered i urban ii industry iii environment and iv agriculture for the traditional allocation of physical water resources agriculture and urban were the two predominant water users accounting 54 and 28 of water consumption respectively surface water and groundwater satisfied around 70 water demands of different users 34 and 36 respectively which eventually caused the increasing unbalance between water demand and water supply due to the long time period for water renewability fortunately virtual water trade significantly alleviated this unbalance when considered the virtual water trade of the eight agricultural products in water allocation procedure the proportion of agricultural consumption decreased to 45 in total water demands while the groundwater consumption decreased to 24 in total water supply virtual water trade overturned the traditional components of water supplied from each source for agricultural consumption and became the largest water source in beijing in addition environmental demand took a same proportion of water consumption in each water source reclaimed water was the main water source for industrial and environmental users surface water met more than 60 water resource of urban demand acknowledgment this study is financially supported by the national key research and

19842,biofilms are ubiquitous throughout aquatic environments and they are thought to promote the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes args this study focused on the occurrence and distribution of five types of arg in naturally occurring biofilms in comparison to associated sediment and water samples from the yangtze estuary which borders the meta city of shanghai china the detection frequency and abundances of most args showed the following order biofilm sediment water which can be attributed to a high level of antibiotics and metals that can accelerate the generation and propagation of args in biofilms most of arg abundances were contributed by extracellular dna edna in biofilm and sediment samples args sul1 sul2 teta and tetw in edna were significantly correlated with toc in both biofilm and sediment samples furthermore both intracellular dna associated args per gram of microbial biomass carbon mbc and edna associated args per gram of non mbc and were higher in biofilms than sediments and the partitioning coefficients of args in edna between biofilm and water were higher than those between sediment and water our results provide new insight for evaluating the occurrence and abundance of args in aquatic environments confirming that biofilms are a significant sink for args in the estuarine environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm antibiotic resistance genes yangtze estuary extracellular dna partitioning coefficients 1 introduction as an important group of pharmaceuticals antibiotics have revolutionized the treatment of infectious disease and increased agricultural productivity worldwide due to their extensive application continuous discharge and incomplete degradation in the environment these compounds are ubiquitous especially in the aquatic environment posing a risk to the aquatic ecosystem even at a very low concentration aydin et al 2015 one of the greatest concerns about the presence of antibiotics in the environment is the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes args recently untreatable pathogens are often reported in hospital and community settings with the rapid and increasing development of args args are now considered to be emerging environmental pollutants rysz and alvarez 2004 pruden et al 2006 they are found in various aquatic environmental matrices such as natural water and sediment luo et al 2010 lin et al 2015 sewage zhu et al 2013 hospital waste heuer et al 2002 aquaculture discharges neela et al 2015 agricultural runoff pruden et al 2006 and freshwater biofilms winkworth lawrence and lange 2016 args may be located on chromosomes and on some mobile genetic elements including plasmids transposons or integrons and present as intracellular dna idna and extracellular dna edna in the environment mao et al 2014 susceptible bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics via mutation wang et al 2015 or through acquisition of args from other cells or edna via horizontal gene transfer hgt mao et al 2014 marti et al 2014 hgt via conjugation transduction or transformation is largely responsible for the dissemination of args between bacteria johnsborg et al 2007 zeng et al 2015 args in idna may be spread through conjugation or transduction while args in edna may be transferred via natural transformation previous research has demonstrated that arg levels contributed by edna are generally higher than idna in sediment and water mao et al 2014 when associated with clay particles or organic matter edna may be more persistent and easier to propagate in the environment mao et al 2014 therefore it is particularly important to evaluate arg levels contributed by edna and idna in the environmental matrix biofilms are complex functional niches made up of microorganisms organic matter e g polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids edna lipids and some inorganic solids hans curt and jost 2010 they can protect bacteria from unsuitable environments e g contaminated by antibiotics heavy metals pesticides etc they are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and play an important role in various biological and ecological processes guo et al 2017 due to the high cell density in this cohesive three dimensional polymer network and therefore more likely interaction between cells as well as the accumulation of mobile genetic elements including args in edna the information exchange via quorum sensing and genetic transfer by hgt are more efficiently conducted sørensen et al 2005 gillings et al 2009 not surprisingly other previous studies have revealed that biofilms could promote the acquisition and dissemination of args li et al 2001 wang et al 2015 zeng et al 2015 such as providing binding sites for later colonizers including antibiotic resistance bacteria huang et al 2014 however most of the above mentioned studies on args associated with biofilm were based on laboratory experiments and there are few studies on the direct analysis of args in natural biofilm samples engemann et al 2008 proia et al 2016 coastal marine environments and especially estuarine systems are biologically productive and receive considerable pollutant inputs from land based sources via river runoff and sewage outfalls the yangtze river estuary is located at the mouth of the yangtze river as it flows into the east china sea past the city of shanghai one of the largest city proper in the world with a population in excess of 24 million people this vitally important estuary has great ecological and economic significance yet clearly it has been dramatically influenced by human activities as a result a range of pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs liu et al 2001 antibiotics shi et al 2014 and args lin et al 2015 have been reported in the yangtze estuary posing significant environmental risk to the ecosystem recent studies have reported that antibiotics are ubiquitous in the surface water and sediments of the yangtze estuary yan et al 2013 shi et al 2014 which will influence the community structure and function of indigenous bacteria and perhaps within the biofilms as well however to our knowledge no study has comprehensively investigated the occurrence of args in biofilms in the yangtze estuary and its coastal zone based on previous biofilm studies li et al 2001 wang et al 2015 proia et al 2016 winkworth lawrence and lange 2016 we suspected that biofilms could be a significant sink of args in the estuarine environment this study therefore focuses on the occurrence and distribution of five types of args in biofilm samples taken along the shores of the yangtze estuary with a comparison to sediment and water samples collected at the same sites the specific objectives of the present study were the following 1 to identify and quantify the args in biofilms sediment and water along the yangtze estuary 2 to investigate the major factors influencing the generation and propagation of args 3 to quantify the abundance and distribution of args contributed by idna and edna and 4 to evaluate the partitioning of args in edna between biofilms sediment and water in the estuarine environment 2

hypothesis that all the mbc was in bacteria the chlorophyll a concentrations and bacterial density in all the biofilm and sediment samples were measured according to previously published methods yang

and lgk oc log10 k f oc 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample properties metal and antibiotic contaminations concerning chlorophyll a bacterial densities mbc and toc in the biofilm and sediment samples taken along the yangtze estuary as described above chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher in biofilms than in sediments at all sampling sites p 0 05 with average concentrations of 2 37 μg g in biofilm and 0 45 μg g in sediments fig s1a bacterial densities in biofilms were significantly higher than those in sediments p 0 05 fig s1b similarly the mbc concentrations were all higher in biofilms than those in sediments with the highest concentration of 9 8 mg kg and 2 98 mg kg in biofilm and sediment samples taken at sdk respectively fig s1c and finally except for wsk toc concentrations in biofilms p 0 05 were all higher than those in sediments with the highest concentration of 67 08 mg kg in biofilm samples taken at sdk fig s1d distribution of five classes of antibiotics sas fqs tcs mls and cps defined above vs the measured args in biofilms sediments and surface water samples are shown in fig s2 and table s4 respectively up to eighteen of twenty antibiotics were detected in both biofilm samples and surface water samples whereas up to fourteen antibiotics were detected in sediment samples along the yangtze estuary in addition results showed that the concentration of each type of antibiotic varied greatly the antibiotic concentrations in water ranged from 35 2 ng l to 615 5 ng l these concentrations were in the range of 20 0 ng g to 94 5 ng g in sediments the dominant antibiotics were sas in water and fqs in sediment which are consistent with the results reported by previous studies in the yangtze estuary yan et al 2013 shi et al 2014 similar to sediments fqs were also the predominant antibiotics in biofilms total antibiotics concentrations in biofilms were 2 3 5 8 times higher than the corresponding sediments with the highest concentration of 362 4 ng g at lhk and the lowest of 51 7 ng g at sck therefore compared to sediments biofilms showed higher affinity for antibiotics and therefore bacteria in the biofilms are likely exposed to an elevated concentration of antibiotics in this estuarine system moreover the antibiotic concentrations were positively correlated with doc concentrations in the surface waters r 0 857 p 0 01 and positively correlated with toc concentrations in biofilms r 0 557 p 0 01 and sediments r 0 764 p 0 01 respectively ten metals including al mn fe co ni cu zn cr cd and pb were analyzed in all biofilm sediment and water samples table s5 al was the most abundant metal in both sediment and biofilm samples with an average concentration of 47338 8 μg g in biofilm and 36771 0 μg g in sediment mn and fe were the most abundant metals in water with an average concentration of 82 4 μg l and 81 5 μg l respectively noticeably except for cr cu and cd the average concentrations of all the analyzed metals in biofilms were all higher than those in sediments which suggested that biofilms could be a more significant sink of most metals than sediment table s5 in particular compared to metal concentrations in sediments of the yangtze estuary reported by a previous study li et al 2013 zn concentrations had increased by two times with an average concentration of 204 6 μg g and cr concentration 37 2 μg g had decreased by three times while the concentrations of other metals including cd cu ni and pb were in a comparable range in sediment samples correlation analysis showed that the concentrations of seven metals including mn co ni cu zn cd and pb were significantly correlated with toc concentrations in biofilms p 0 01 while in sediment samples positive correlations were only found between toc and two metals zn and cd table s6 in addition no significant correlations were found between doc concentrations and metal concentrations in water table s6 3 2 occurrence and abundance of args in biofilm sediment and water nineteen of the 24 target genes were detected in the yangtze estuary table s7 five args were not detected in any sample including three tetracycline resistance genes tetg tets and tett one chloramphenicol resistance gene chl and one sulfonamide resistance gene sula eight genes showed a detection frequency of 100 including 16s rrna inti1 sul1 sul2 aac 6 ib teta tetq and tetw in addition the detection frequencies of args in biofilm samples detection frequency of 75 for sas args 81 for fqs args 56 for tcs args and 71 for mls args were generally high as compared to those in sediment samples 75 for sas args 76 for fqs args 51 for tcs args and 29 for mls args and water samples 64 for sas args 67 for fqs args 40 for tcs args and 14 for mls args thirteen genes including 16s rrna inti1 sul1 sul2 sul3 aac 6 ib qnrs teta tetm teto tetq tetw and ermb with relatively high detection frequency were further quantified by qpcr and the results were shown in fig 2 in general the abundances of most args in all the samples showed the following order biofilm sediment water moreover the average concentration of args at different sampling sites followed the order of sdk lhk qyk wsk sck xp cy in biofilms sdk lhk qyk wsk sck cy xp in sediments and wsk sck lhk cy qyk sdk xp in water samples obviously args in biofilm and sediment samples showed an overall trend of higher concentrations at the sewage effluent influenced site sdk and at the confluence of inland rivers lhk wsk and qyk than those at other coastal sites cy sck and xp therefore we considered that the elevated concentrations of args in biofilm and sediment samples at these sampling sites could be attributed to the effluents from wwtps upstream and inland river discharge the 16s rrna gene was quantified to evaluate the bacterial abundance in samples and could be used to normalize the arg abundances in the environment luo et al 2010 lu et al 2015 the amount of 16s rrna gene copies ranged from 3 79 109 to 1 16 1013copies g in biofilms 1 23 108 to 1 01 109 copies g in sediments and 1 63 105 to 6 66 106 copies ml in water samples respectively the concentrations of the 16s rrna gene in sediments were comparable to those previously reported in sediments taken from the yangtze estuary for both biofilm and sediment samples the significantly high concentrations of the 16s rrna gene p 0 05 were found at sdk where a wwtp is nearby this section of the coastal area in water samples the highest 16s rrna gene abundance was found at wsk with 6 66 106 copies ml this value was comparable to those reported by the previous study in duluth superior harbor lapara et al 2011 and the daliaohe river and liaohe river estuaries lu et al 2015 while lower than that in the haihe river luo et al 2010 for sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 is the dominant gene in all the samples including biofilms sediments and waters with concentrations ranging from 3 20 107 to 2 50 1011 copies g 3 29 105 to 2 04 106 copies g 2 26 104 to 3 19 105 copies ml respectively fig 2 the highest abundance of sul1 was found at sdk for both biofilm and sediment samples while it was at wsk for water samples sul2 was the second most abundant sulfonamide arg of with an average abundance of 5 94 108 copies g in biofilm 2 32 105 copies g in sediment and 5 92 104 copies ml in water respectively by comparison sul1 and sul2 concentrations were comparable to those previously reported in sediments taken from the yangtze estuary lin et al 2015 and higher than those in waters collected from the daliaohe river and liaohe river estuaries lu et al 2015 except for cy sck and xp sites sul3 was not detected in water samples along the yangtze estuary as an important integron with the function to facilitate horizontal gene transfer of sul1 between microbes under environmental pressures gootz 2010 yin et al 2017 the class 1 integron inti1 was ubiquitous in this area and higher gene copies were detected in the biofilms 1 68 107 6 03 1011 copies g compared to sediments 8 69 104 5 57 105 copies g and their concentrations in water ranged from 5 13 103 to 1 21 105 copies ml fig 2 in addition significant correlations between the relative abundance of inti1 16s rrna and sul1 16s rrna were observed in sediment r 0 643 p 0 01 and water samples r 0 764 p 0 01 these results are consistent with previous studies examining the relationship between inti1 and sul1in sediment or water luo et al 2010 chen et al 2015 lu et al 2015 similar results were also observed in the biofilms r 0 502 p 0 034 the two quinolone resistance genes acc 6 ib and qnrs were also quantified in this study fig 2 the acc 6 ib gene was the most abundant quinolone arg in sediments with a concentration that ranged from 2 51 106 to 6 37 106 copies g which were relatively low as compared to those reported by a recent study in the haihe river dang et al 2016 as the second abundant gene in biofilms acc 6 ib concentrations were in the range of 7 28 106 to 2 52 109 copies g and their concentrations were significantly higher than those in sediments at all the sampling sites p 0 05 in water samples the concentrations of acc 6 ib ranged from 2 68 104 to 3 05 104 copies ml which were slightly high as compared to those in fresh water aquaculture environments xiong et al 2015 for qnrs gene their average abundance ranged from 9 75 104 to 7 44 107 copies g in biofilms which were higher than those in fresh water biofilms p 0 05 proia et al 2016 meanwhile compared to biofilms qnrs concentrations were lower in sediments 3 42 104 3 87 105 copies g and waters 0 1 38 104 copies ml p 0 05 which are comparable to those previous reported in a fresh water system xiong et al 2015 regarding tetracycline resistance the teta encoding the antibiotic efflux pumps and the tetm teto tetq and tetw encoding ribosomal protection proteins nguyen et al 2014 were more prevalent than other tetracycline resistance genes in biofilms sediments and water measured in this study table s7 fig 2 in the present study teta was found as the most abundant tetracycline resistance gene in the biofilms tested 2 68 105 4 29 109 copies g with the highest abundance found at sdk p 0 05 indicating that antibiotic efflux pumps may be the dominant mechanism for microbes in biofilms to resist tetracyclines for the other four tetracycline resistance genes their average concentrations in biofilms 1 74 106 copies g of tetm 1 44 106 copies g of teto 3 52 106 copies g of tetq and 3 22 105 copies g of tetw were also higher than those in sediments 2 87 104 copies g of tetm 1 36 105 copies g of teto 3 87 103 copies g of tetq and 5 47 104 copies g of tetw p 0 05 moreover the concentrations of teta and tetm in this study were similar to those of sediment samples in the yangtze estuary luo et al 2010 in addition it is worth noting that in water samples the average concentration of teta 8 48 102 copies ml was significantly lower than the concentration of the tetm 1 61 104 copies ml teto 2 23 104 copies ml tetq 1 06 104 copies ml and tetw 3 26 103 copies ml p 0 05 the macrolide resistance gene ermb tended to be more abundant in biofilms compared to sediments and water fig 2 both of the highest abundances of ermb in biofilms 1 50 107 copies g and sediments 4 80 104 copies g were found at sdk p 0 05 in addition ermb was only detected in water taken at sdk with a concentration of 8 83 104 copies ml therefore it is likely that the occurrence of ermb at sdk can also be attributed to the impact of wwtp effluents marti et al 2013 aydin et al 2015 3 3 correlation between arg abundances and sample properties when exposed to the environment with relatively high concentration of antibiotics microbes are known to generate antibiotic resistant variants via gene mutation and or hgt knapp et al 2008 moreover some arg abundances often positively correlate with the concentrations of antibiotics in the environment as shown in previous studies mckinney et al 2010 luo et al 2010 in this study significant correlations were found between sa concentrations and the abundance of sul1 r 0 773 p 0 01 and sul2 r 0 459 p 0 037 and between tc concentrations and the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes teta r 0 622 p 0 01 tetm r 0 538 p 0 012 tetw r 0 575 p 0 01 in biofilms respectively table s8 this demonstrates that antibiotics may be a major factor in regulating the proliferation of args in biofilms similar to those found in biofilms the abundance of most sas and tcs resistance genes were also significantly correlated to the total concentrations of sas and tcs in sediment samples respectively table s8 however no significant correlations between args and the corresponding antibiotics concentrations were found in water samples taken along the yangtze estuary this may be attributed to the hydrodynamics of flowing natural water environments lu et al 2015 moreover although the quinolones were the predominant type of antibiotics in biofilms and sediments in this study no significant correlations between the concentration of quinolones and the abundance of their resistance genes were observed table s8 a previous study reported a significant correlation between the fqs args and fqs residues near swine feedlots li et al 2012 however fqs args were generally plasmid mediated cummings et al 2011 and the occurrences of plasmid mediated args may not be directly related to antibiotic concentrations tamminen et al 2011 furthermore args could be co selected by some non antibiotic pollutants such as heavy metals and biocides czekalski et al 2015 which could also affect the occurrence of fqs args in biofilms and sediments in addition no significant correlation was found between ermb and ml concentrations for all samples table s8 correlation analysis between arg abundances and metal concentrations are shown in tables s9 s10 and s11 for the thirteen tested genes the abundance of most args are significantly correlated with the concentrations of mn zn and ni in biofilm samples table s9 while most arg abundances are significantly correlated to the concentrations of zn and cu in sediment samples table s10 metal and antibiotic resistant genes often located on the same mobile genetic elements baker austin et al 2006 wu et al 2015 and selection by metals could lead to co selection of args alonso et al 2001 nishino et al 2007 therefore the positive correlation between args and certain metals indicated that the antibiotics resistance of microbes may relate to their metal resistance ability or co resistance to metal pressures additionally the presence of metals has been shown to stimulate horizontal gene transfer among bacteria klümper et al 2016 however significant correlations were only found between very few args and cr cu in water samples table s11 zn concentrations showed significantly positive correlation to most of the args in sediments and biofilms and to elucidate the possible mechanism behind this zn resistance genes znta and zntb van et al 2009 were analyzed in all the biofilm and sediment samples it was shown that znta abundances were significantly higher in biofilms than those in sediments at all sampling sites p 0 05 while zntb abundances were in general slightly higher in biofilms than those in sediments and a significant difference p 0 05 was found in samples taken from xp and sdk fig s3 these results suggested that microbes in biofilms had greater resistance ability to zn than those in sediments furthermore as shown in table s12 although there was no significant correlation between znta abundances and args abundances significant positive correlation was found between zntb abundances and each arg abundance in biofilms respectively indicating that zn might increase the antibiotic resistance of bacteria vahjen et al 2015 in sediments the abundances of znta were positively correlated to sas resistance genes with two genes showing significant correlations including sul1 r 0 478 p 0 05 and sul3 r 0 596 p 0 05 these data confirmed that zn could show selection pressures on microbes and increase sas antibiotic resistance in both biofilm and sediment samples becerra castro et al 2015 in addition to antibiotics and metals correlation analysis showed that toc concentrations were significantly correlated to the concentration of most tested genes including 16s rrna inti1 sul1 sul3 ermb qnrs teta tetm tetq and tetw in biofilm samples table s13 and inti1 sul1 sul2 ermb teta tetm teto tetq and tetw in sediment samples table s14 meanwhile doc concentrations were significantly correlated to the abundances of 16s rrna sul1 sul3 ermb and teta in water samples table s15 these results revealed that organic carbon is one of the vital factors regulating the occurrence and dissemination of args as args could be associated with organic carbon and be further protected from nuclease degradation demanèche et al 2001 in addition up to nine genes were significantly correlated to bacterial density in biofilms table s13 indicating the abundance of antibiotic resistance bacteria in biofilms 3 4 contributions of args from edna and idna in biofilm and sediment samples four args including sul1 sul2 teta and tetw were further selected to investigate their distribution in edna and idna in biofilm and sediment due to their relatively high abundances and significant correlation with sample properties such as toc metal and antibiotics concentrations 16s rrna and inti1 were also quantified for comparison the extraction efficiency 63 93 72 75 of edna in this study was comparable to those by reference methods mao et al 2014 by comparing the sum of tested gene abundances in edna and idna to those extracted from total dna we were able to calculate the recoveries from 58 3 to 140 1 in biofilms and 56 8 136 9 in sediments respectively the distribution of args in edna and idna of biofilms and sediments taken along the yangtze estuary is shown in fig 3 in sediments almost all the tested gene abundances were higher in edna than in idna p 0 05 more than 60 of gene copies were contributed by edna in sediment samples except for inti1 at cy 46 7 sul1 at sdk 48 6 and teta at sdk 58 3 fig 3 this further confirmed that sediment associated edna is a vital sink for args which could enhance the propagation of args in the environment through hgt mao et al 2014 in addition for all the sampling sites almost all gene abundances were higher in edna than in idna in biofilm samples p 0 05 except for the samples taken from sdk and sck and the abundance of tetw at qyk these results suggest that biofilm associated edna could also be considered as an important reservoir for args however the abundances of the tested genes in idna accounted for the majority of the total abundance in the biofilm samples taken from sdk and sck p 0 05 fig 3 which may be associated with the higher bacterial density of biofilms at these two sampling sites fig s1b correlation analysis revealed that arg abundances contributed by edna were significantly correlated to toc concentrations both in biofilm and sediment samples table 1 furthermore the concentrations of non mbc were calculated by subtracting mbc from toc concentrations with a hypothesis that all the mbc was in bacteria as mbc concentrations were significantly correlated to bacterial density in biofilm samples r 0 805 p 0 05 correlation analysis showed that all arg abundances in edna including sul1 sul2 teta and tetw were significantly correlated to non mbc concentrations in both biofilm and sediment samples with generally higher r values and lower p values table 1 this correlation is considered as more significant than that with toc moreover no significant correlation was found between arg abundances in edna and mbc concentrations in biofilms table s16 these results indicated that when compared to mcb args in edna were mainly distributed in and further regulated by non mbc such as humus and other organic matter in the environmental matrix durenkamp et al 2010 mao et al 2014 therefore we normalized arg abundances in edna by non mbcs concentrations to evaluate affinity of args in edna to non mbcs in biofilm and sediment table s17 results showed that the average level of args including sul1 5 13 106 copies g sul2 1 58 106 copies g teta 2 03 106 copies g and tetw 5 55 103 copies g in biofilms were higher than those in sediments including sul1 2 9 104 copies g sul2 3 07 104 copies g teta 1 03 104 copies g and tetw 1 91 103 copies g respectively in another word non mbcs in biofilm showed elevated affinity of edna related args compared to sediment notably significant correlations between args concentrations contributed from idna and bacterial densities were found in biofilms while only sul2 abundances in idna were significantly correlated to bacterial densities in sediments table 1 the mbc concentrations were also significantly correlated to the args concentrations in idna in biofilm samples and the mbc concentrations were only significantly correlated to sul2 and teta concentrations in idna in sediment samples table 1 in addition significant correlations between 16s rrna and arg abundances contributed by idna were also found in biofilms except for teta table s18 as idna mostly exists in bacterial cells mao et al 2014 in the present study the abundances of args in idna were normalized by mbc concentrations and bacterial densities in biofilm and sediment samples respectively table s19 and s20 when normalized by mbc concentrations the average level of args including sul1 2 37 109 copies g sul2 4 32 107 copies g teta 2 35 107 copies g and tetw 1 11 105 copies g in biofilms were higher than those in sediments including sul1 2 07 105 copies g sul2 3 63 105 copies g teta 1 08 105 copies g and tetw 2 66 104 copies g respectively moreover as for biofilms the args in idna per gram of mbc were 17 9 223 6 times higher than those in edna normalized by non mbc and these values were 8 18 17 4 times in sediments suggesting the high abundance of args in antibiotic resistance bacteria when normalized by bacterial density four args in idna generally had higher abundance in biofilm compared to sediment samples taken from the yangtze estuary table s20 and it is especially true for sul1 which were 9 2 27347 6 times higher than those in the corresponding sediment enrichment of sul1 genes per cell in biofilm suggested that compared to sediments there were more sul1 related bacteria in biofilms furthermore results showed that the abundances of tested genes ranged from 0 21 to 1537844 copies cell at sdk which were significantly higher than those at other sampling sites p 0 05 indicating the enrichment of antibiotic resistance bacteria in biofilm at sdk where it was influenced by a wwtp effluent moreover as the most abundant arg per cell in biofilm sul1 abundances ranged from 1 8 to 34478 copies cell these values showed a more significant correlation r 0 703 p 0 01 to inti1 compared to those based on un normalized ones confirming that the sul1 tend to exist on the genome of microbes in biofilms 3 5 partition coefficients of args in edna between biofilm sediment and water most of the studies on args in water samples are based on a hypothesis that all args can be collected by filters e g 0 22 μm diameter luo et al 2010 lu et al 2015 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 in fact there are still edna exiting in the filtrates of water samples mao et al 2014 in the present study args including sul1 sul2 teta and tetw were further quantified as edna associated args relatively low concentrations of args sul1 14 8 84 6 copies ml sul2 47 5 98 0 copies ml teta 10 3 48 7 copies ml tetw 75 2 34 2 copies ml were found from edna in water samples fig s4 with the contribution less than 5 from edna to the total args in water fig s5 we believed that these contributions of args from edna were underestimated because we suspected that edna could be associated with particulate matter 0 22 μm in the water and by the filtration process breazel et al 2013 these edna were considered as idna according to this method mao et al 2014 given args as pollutants occurred in all the environmental marix rysz and alvarez 2004 pruden et al 2006 and they were generally abundant in edna in water sediments and biofilms in the present study we further calculate partition coefficients k of each arg in edna between biofilm sediment and water respectively as we have mentioned above edna in water can be underestimated and therefore the calculated k values can be overestimated still the partition coefficients can give us more insight on the partitioning behavior of edna in the biofilm sediment water matrix in the present study we found that there is significant correlation between non mbc concentration and args in edna for both sediments and in biofilms table 1 therefore non mbc could be a significant reservoir for args in edna when normalized by non mbc foc the average lgk oc values of sul1 sul2 teta and tetw were 5 13 2 82 2 82 and 1 91 in biofilms and 2 99 2 59 1 33 and 1 46 in sediments respectively table 2 indicating that args in edna especially sul1 show a higher affinity for non mbc in biofilms than sediment 4 conclusions our study confirmed that biofilms serve as a highly active sink for various contaminants including metals antibiotics and intracellular and extracellular args as compared to the sediments and waters at most sampling sites along the yangtze estuary the elevated concentrations of antibiotics and metals documented in this study in biofilms may serve to stimulate selection for biofilm args as well as stimulate horizontal gene transfer in addition we found that greater edna associated args were enriched in both sediments and biofilms than those of idna associated args suggesting that edna associated args may represent a largely underappreciated fraction of the total environmental resistome particularly in sediment and biofilms this work highlights the need to develop standardized methods for quantifying edna versus idna in environmental water sediment and biofilm samples additionally this work may inform future systematical study of args in multi phases of aquatic environment such as water sediment and biofilm as the sampling focused solely on water samples may underestimate the risks associated with the potentially arg rich sediment and biofilm our findings suggest the contribution of args from edna in aquatic environments should not be neglected toc was identified as an important parameter that may regulate the occurrence of args in both biofilm and sediment phases and especially non mbcs for those contributed from edna moreover as edna may be more stable and persistent in the environment when associated with organic matter it may be more likely to be utilized by organisms and this should facilitate their propagation throughout the aquatic system furthermore partitioning coefficients for args in edna between biofilm sediment and water were developed and estimated based on the present study providing a potential new avenue for evaluating the risk of args in aquatic environments overall this study provides insight into the mechanisms governing the dissemination of args via surface water and investigates several discrete compartments water sediment and biofilm as potential sinks for args in aquatic environments acknowledgments this study was funded by the national natural science foundation of china

19842,biofilms are ubiquitous throughout aquatic environments and they are thought to promote the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes args this study focused on the occurrence and distribution of five types of arg in naturally occurring biofilms in comparison to associated sediment and water samples from the yangtze estuary which borders the meta city of shanghai china the detection frequency and abundances of most args showed the following order biofilm sediment water which can be attributed to a high level of antibiotics and metals that can accelerate the generation and propagation of args in biofilms most of arg abundances were contributed by extracellular dna edna in biofilm and sediment samples args sul1 sul2 teta and tetw in edna were significantly correlated with toc in both biofilm and sediment samples furthermore both intracellular dna associated args per gram of microbial biomass carbon mbc and edna associated args per gram of non mbc and were higher in biofilms than sediments and the partitioning coefficients of args in edna between biofilm and water were higher than those between sediment and water our results provide new insight for evaluating the occurrence and abundance of args in aquatic environments confirming that biofilms are a significant sink for args in the estuarine environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm antibiotic resistance genes yangtze estuary extracellular dna partitioning coefficients 1 introduction as an important group of pharmaceuticals antibiotics have revolutionized the treatment of infectious disease and increased agricultural productivity worldwide due to their extensive application continuous discharge and incomplete degradation in the environment these compounds are ubiquitous especially in the aquatic environment posing a risk to the aquatic ecosystem even at a very low concentration aydin et al 2015 one of the greatest concerns about the presence of antibiotics in the environment is the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes args recently untreatable pathogens are often reported in hospital and community settings with the rapid and increasing development of args args are now considered to be emerging environmental pollutants rysz and alvarez 2004 pruden et al 2006 they are found in various aquatic environmental matrices such as natural water and sediment luo et al 2010 lin et al 2015 sewage zhu et al 2013 hospital waste heuer et al 2002 aquaculture discharges neela et al 2015 agricultural runoff pruden et al 2006 and freshwater biofilms winkworth lawrence and lange 2016 args may be located on chromosomes and on some mobile genetic elements including plasmids transposons or integrons and present as intracellular dna idna and extracellular dna edna in the environment mao et al 2014 susceptible bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics via mutation wang et al 2015 or through acquisition of args from other cells or edna via horizontal gene transfer hgt mao et al 2014 marti et al 2014 hgt via conjugation transduction or transformation is largely responsible for the dissemination of args between bacteria johnsborg et al 2007 zeng et al 2015 args in idna may be spread through conjugation or transduction while args in edna may be transferred via natural transformation previous research has demonstrated that arg levels contributed by edna are generally higher than idna in sediment and water mao et al 2014 when associated with clay particles or organic matter edna may be more persistent and easier to propagate in the environment mao et al 2014 therefore it is particularly important to evaluate arg levels contributed by edna and idna in the environmental matrix biofilms are complex functional niches made up of microorganisms organic matter e g polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids edna lipids and some inorganic solids hans curt and jost 2010 they can protect bacteria from unsuitable environments e g contaminated by antibiotics heavy metals pesticides etc they are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and play an important role in various biological and ecological processes guo et al 2017 due to the high cell density in this cohesive three dimensional polymer network and therefore more likely interaction between cells as well as the accumulation of mobile genetic elements including args in edna the information exchange via quorum sensing and genetic transfer by hgt are more efficiently conducted sørensen et al 2005 gillings et al 2009 not surprisingly other previous studies have revealed that biofilms could promote the acquisition and dissemination of args li et al 2001 wang et al 2015 zeng et al 2015 such as providing binding sites for later colonizers including antibiotic resistance bacteria huang et al 2014 however most of the above mentioned studies on args associated with biofilm were based on laboratory experiments and there are few studies on the direct analysis of args in natural biofilm samples engemann et al 2008 proia et al 2016 coastal marine environments and especially estuarine systems are biologically productive and receive considerable pollutant inputs from land based sources via river runoff and sewage outfalls the yangtze river estuary is located at the mouth of the yangtze river as it flows into the east china sea past the city of shanghai one of the largest city proper in the world with a population in excess of 24 million people this vitally important estuary has great ecological and economic significance yet clearly it has been dramatically influenced by human activities as a result a range of pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs liu et al 2001 antibiotics shi et al 2014 and args lin et al 2015 have been reported in the yangtze estuary posing significant environmental risk to the ecosystem recent studies have reported that antibiotics are ubiquitous in the surface water and sediments of the yangtze estuary yan et al 2013 shi et al 2014 which will influence the community structure and function of indigenous bacteria and perhaps within the biofilms as well however to our knowledge no study has comprehensively investigated the occurrence of args in biofilms in the yangtze estuary and its coastal zone based on previous biofilm studies li et al 2001 wang et al 2015 proia et al 2016 winkworth lawrence and lange 2016 we suspected that biofilms could be a significant sink of args in the estuarine environment this study therefore focuses on the occurrence and distribution of five types of args in biofilm samples taken along the shores of the yangtze estuary with a comparison to sediment and water samples collected at the same sites the specific objectives of the present study were the following 1 to identify and quantify the args in biofilms sediment and water along the yangtze estuary 2 to investigate the major factors influencing the generation and propagation of args 3 to quantify the abundance and distribution of args contributed by idna and edna and 4 to evaluate the partitioning of args in edna between biofilms sediment and water in the estuarine environment 2

hypothesis that all the mbc was in bacteria the chlorophyll a concentrations and bacterial density in all the biofilm and sediment samples were measured according to previously published methods yang

metals including al cr mn fe co ni cu zn cd and pb were analyzed in triplicates according to the method by yang et al 2016 as these metals are commonly related to human activities or linked with environmental args lu et al 2015 in brief 0 2 g freeze dried biofilm and sediment samples were digested using hno3 and perchloric acid and further analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass

listed in the si all the samples were conducted in triplicates 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 software spss chicago il usa comparisons of environmental parameters or gene abundances at different sampling sites were carried out using a one way analysis of variance anova followed by a least significant difference lsd test difference was considered significant at p 0 05 correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the abundance of tested genes and environmental parameters or different genes by a spearman s rank correlation test the partitioning coefficient k of certain arg was calculated according to the following equation k c i c w where c i is the concentration of certain arg in biofilm or sediment samples in the present study c w is the concentration of arg in water k can be further normalized by organic carbon fraction f oc in biofilm or sediment and organic carbon could be toc mbc or non mbc and lgk oc log10 k f oc 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample properties metal and antibiotic contaminations concerning chlorophyll a bacterial densities mbc and toc in the biofilm and sediment samples taken along the yangtze estuary as described above chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher in biofilms than in sediments at all sampling sites p 0 05 with average concentrations of 2 37 μg g in biofilm and 0 45 μg g in sediments fig s1a bacterial densities in biofilms were significantly higher than those in sediments p 0 05 fig s1b similarly the mbc concentrations were all higher in biofilms than those in sediments with the highest concentration of 9 8 mg kg and 2 98 mg kg in biofilm and sediment samples taken at sdk respectively fig s1c and finally except for wsk toc concentrations in biofilms p 0 05 were all higher than those in sediments with the highest concentration of 67 08 mg kg in biofilm samples taken at sdk fig s1d distribution of five classes of antibiotics sas fqs tcs mls and cps defined above vs the measured args in biofilms sediments and surface water samples are shown in fig s2 and table s4 respectively up to eighteen of twenty antibiotics were detected in both biofilm samples and surface water samples whereas up to fourteen antibiotics were detected in sediment samples along the yangtze estuary in addition results showed that the concentration of each type of antibiotic varied greatly the antibiotic concentrations in water ranged from 35 2 ng l to 615 5 ng l these concentrations were in the range of 20 0 ng g to 94 5 ng g in sediments the dominant antibiotics were sas in water and fqs in sediment which are consistent with the results reported by previous studies in the yangtze estuary yan et al 2013 shi et al 2014 similar to sediments fqs were also the predominant antibiotics in biofilms total antibiotics concentrations in biofilms were 2 3 5 8 times higher than the corresponding sediments with the highest concentration of 362 4 ng g at lhk and the lowest of 51 7 ng g at sck therefore compared to sediments biofilms showed higher affinity for antibiotics and therefore bacteria in the biofilms are likely exposed to an elevated concentration of antibiotics in this estuarine system moreover the antibiotic concentrations were positively correlated with doc concentrations in the surface waters r 0 857 p 0 01 and positively correlated with toc concentrations in biofilms r 0 557 p 0 01 and sediments r 0 764 p 0 01 respectively ten metals including al mn fe co ni cu zn cr cd and pb were analyzed in all biofilm sediment and water samples table s5 al was the most abundant metal in both sediment and biofilm samples with an average concentration of 47338 8 μg g in biofilm and 36771 0 μg g in sediment mn and fe were the most abundant metals in water with an average concentration of 82 4 μg l and 81 5 μg l respectively noticeably except for cr cu and cd the average concentrations of all the analyzed metals in biofilms were all higher than those in sediments which suggested that biofilms could be a more significant sink of most metals than sediment table s5 in particular compared to metal concentrations in sediments of the yangtze estuary reported by a previous study li et al 2013 zn concentrations had increased by two times with an average concentration of 204 6 μg g and cr concentration 37 2 μg g had decreased by three times while the concentrations of other metals including cd cu ni and pb were in a comparable range in sediment samples correlation analysis showed that the concentrations of seven metals including mn co ni cu zn cd and pb were significantly correlated with toc concentrations in biofilms p 0 01 while in sediment samples positive correlations were only found between toc and two metals zn and cd table s6 in addition no significant correlations were found between doc concentrations and metal concentrations in water table s6 3 2 occurrence and abundance of args in biofilm sediment and water nineteen of the 24 target genes were detected in the yangtze estuary table s7 five args were not detected in any sample including three tetracycline resistance genes tetg tets and tett one chloramphenicol resistance gene chl and one sulfonamide resistance gene sula eight genes showed a detection frequency of 100 including 16s rrna inti1 sul1 sul2 aac 6 ib teta tetq and tetw in addition the detection frequencies of args in biofilm samples detection frequency of 75 for sas args 81 for fqs args 56 for tcs args and 71 for mls args were generally high as compared to those in sediment samples 75 for sas args 76 for fqs args 51 for tcs args and 29 for mls args and water samples 64 for sas args 67 for fqs args 40 for tcs args and 14 for mls args thirteen genes including 16s rrna inti1 sul1 sul2 sul3 aac 6 ib qnrs teta tetm teto tetq tetw and ermb with relatively high detection frequency were further quantified by qpcr and the results were shown in fig 2 in general the abundances of most args in all the samples showed the following order biofilm sediment water moreover the average concentration of args at different sampling sites followed the order of sdk lhk qyk wsk sck xp cy in biofilms sdk lhk qyk wsk sck cy xp in sediments and wsk sck lhk cy qyk sdk xp in water samples obviously args in biofilm and sediment samples showed an overall trend of higher concentrations at the sewage effluent influenced site sdk and at the confluence of inland rivers lhk wsk and qyk than those at other coastal sites cy sck and xp therefore we considered that the elevated concentrations of args in biofilm and sediment samples at these sampling sites could be attributed to the effluents from wwtps upstream and inland river discharge the 16s rrna gene was quantified to evaluate the bacterial abundance in samples and could be used to normalize the arg abundances in the environment luo et al 2010 lu et al 2015 the amount of 16s rrna gene copies ranged from 3 79 109 to 1 16 1013copies g in biofilms 1 23 108 to 1 01 109 copies g in sediments and 1 63 105 to 6 66 106 copies ml in water samples respectively the concentrations of the 16s rrna gene in sediments were comparable to those previously reported in sediments taken from the yangtze estuary for both biofilm and sediment samples the significantly high concentrations of the 16s rrna gene p 0 05 were found at sdk where a wwtp is nearby this section of the coastal area in water samples the highest 16s rrna gene abundance was found at wsk with 6 66 106 copies ml this value was comparable to those reported by the previous study in duluth superior harbor lapara et al 2011 and the daliaohe river and liaohe river estuaries lu et al 2015 while lower than that in the haihe river luo et al 2010 for sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 is the dominant gene in all the samples including biofilms sediments and waters with concentrations ranging from 3 20 107 to 2 50 1011 copies g 3 29 105 to 2 04 106 copies g 2 26 104 to 3 19 105 copies ml respectively fig 2 the highest abundance of sul1 was found at sdk for both biofilm and sediment samples while it was at wsk for water samples sul2 was the second most abundant sulfonamide arg of with an average abundance of 5 94 108 copies g in biofilm 2 32 105 copies g in sediment and 5 92 104 copies ml in water respectively by comparison sul1 and sul2 concentrations were comparable to those previously reported in sediments taken from the yangtze estuary lin et al 2015 and higher than those in waters collected from the daliaohe river and liaohe river estuaries lu et al 2015 except for cy sck and xp sites sul3 was not detected in water samples along the yangtze estuary as an important integron with the function to facilitate horizontal gene transfer of sul1 between microbes under environmental pressures gootz 2010 yin et al 2017 the class 1 integron inti1 was ubiquitous in this area and higher gene copies were detected in the biofilms 1 68 107 6 03 1011 copies g compared to sediments 8 69 104 5 57 105 copies g and their concentrations in water ranged from 5 13 103 to 1 21 105 copies ml fig 2 in addition significant correlations between the relative abundance of inti1 16s rrna and sul1 16s rrna were observed in sediment r 0 643 p 0 01 and water samples r 0 764 p 0 01 these results are consistent with previous studies examining the relationship between inti1 and sul1in sediment or water luo et al 2010 chen et al 2015 lu et al 2015 similar results were also observed in the biofilms r 0 502 p 0 034 the two quinolone resistance genes acc 6 ib and qnrs were also quantified in this study fig 2 the acc 6 ib gene was the most abundant quinolone arg in sediments with a concentration that ranged from 2 51 106 to 6 37 106 copies g which were relatively low as compared to those reported by a recent study in the haihe river dang et al 2016 as the second abundant gene in biofilms acc 6 ib concentrations were in the range of 7 28 106 to 2 52 109 copies g and their concentrations were significantly higher than those in sediments at all the sampling sites p 0 05 in water samples the concentrations of acc 6 ib ranged from 2 68 104 to 3 05 104 copies ml which were slightly high as compared to those in fresh water aquaculture environments xiong et al 2015 for qnrs gene their average abundance ranged from 9 75 104 to 7 44 107 copies g in biofilms which were higher than those in fresh water biofilms p 0 05 proia et al 2016 meanwhile compared to biofilms qnrs concentrations were lower in sediments 3 42 104 3 87 105 copies g and waters 0 1 38 104 copies ml p 0 05 which are comparable to those previous reported in a fresh water system xiong et al 2015 regarding tetracycline resistance the teta encoding the antibiotic efflux pumps and the tetm teto tetq and tetw encoding ribosomal protection proteins nguyen et al 2014 were more prevalent than other tetracycline resistance genes in biofilms sediments and water measured in this study table s7 fig 2 in the present study teta was found as the most abundant tetracycline resistance gene in the biofilms tested 2 68 105 4 29 109 copies g with the highest abundance found at sdk p 0 05 indicating that antibiotic efflux pumps may be the dominant mechanism for microbes in biofilms to resist tetracyclines for the other four tetracycline resistance genes their average concentrations in biofilms 1 74 106 copies g of tetm 1 44 106 copies g of teto 3 52 106 copies g of tetq and 3 22 105 copies g of tetw were also higher than those in sediments 2 87 104 copies g of tetm 1 36 105 copies g of teto 3 87 103 copies g of tetq and 5 47 104 copies g of tetw p 0 05 moreover the concentrations of teta and tetm in this study were similar to those of sediment samples in the yangtze estuary luo et al 2010 in addition it is worth noting that in water samples the average concentration of teta 8 48 102 copies ml was significantly lower than the concentration of the tetm 1 61 104 copies ml teto 2 23 104 copies ml tetq 1 06 104 copies ml and tetw 3 26 103 copies ml p 0 05 the macrolide resistance gene ermb tended to be more abundant in biofilms compared to sediments and water fig 2 both of the highest abundances of ermb in biofilms 1 50 107 copies g and sediments 4 80 104 copies g were found at sdk p 0 05 in addition ermb was only detected in water taken at sdk with a concentration of 8 83 104 copies ml therefore it is likely that the occurrence of ermb at sdk can also be attributed to the impact of wwtp effluents marti et al 2013 aydin et al 2015 3 3 correlation between arg abundances and sample properties when exposed to the environment with relatively high concentration of antibiotics microbes are known to generate antibiotic resistant variants via gene mutation and or hgt knapp et al 2008 moreover some arg abundances often positively correlate with the concentrations of antibiotics in the environment as shown in previous studies mckinney et al 2010 luo et al 2010 in this study significant correlations were found between sa concentrations and the abundance of sul1 r 0 773 p 0 01 and sul2 r 0 459 p 0 037 and between tc concentrations and the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes teta r 0 622 p 0 01 tetm r 0 538 p 0 012 tetw r 0 575 p 0 01 in biofilms respectively table s8 this demonstrates that antibiotics may be a major factor in regulating the proliferation of args in biofilms similar to those found in biofilms the abundance of most sas and tcs resistance genes were also significantly correlated to the total concentrations of sas and tcs in sediment samples respectively table s8 however no significant correlations between args and the corresponding antibiotics concentrations were found in water samples taken along the yangtze estuary this may be attributed to the hydrodynamics of flowing natural water environments lu et al 2015 moreover although the quinolones were the predominant type of antibiotics in biofilms and sediments in this study no significant correlations between the concentration of quinolones and the abundance of their resistance genes were observed table s8 a previous study reported a significant correlation between the fqs args and fqs residues near swine feedlots li et al 2012 however fqs args were generally plasmid mediated cummings et al 2011 and the occurrences of plasmid mediated args may not be directly related to antibiotic concentrations tamminen et al 2011 furthermore args could be co selected by some non antibiotic pollutants such as heavy metals and biocides czekalski et al 2015 which could also affect the occurrence of fqs args in biofilms and sediments in addition no significant correlation was found between ermb and ml concentrations for all samples table s8 correlation analysis between arg abundances and metal concentrations are shown in tables s9 s10 and s11 for the thirteen tested genes the abundance of most args are significantly correlated with the concentrations of mn zn and ni in biofilm samples table s9 while most arg abundances are significantly correlated to the concentrations of zn and cu in sediment samples table s10 metal and antibiotic resistant genes often located on the same mobile genetic elements baker austin et al 2006 wu et al 2015 and selection by metals could lead to co selection of args alonso et al 2001 nishino et al 2007 therefore the positive correlation between args and certain metals indicated that the antibiotics resistance of microbes may relate to their metal resistance ability or co resistance to metal pressures additionally the presence of metals has been shown to stimulate horizontal gene transfer among bacteria klümper et al 2016 however significant correlations were only found between very few args and cr cu in water samples table s11 zn concentrations showed significantly positive correlation to most of the args in sediments and biofilms and to elucidate the possible mechanism behind this zn resistance genes znta and zntb van et al 2009 were analyzed in all the biofilm and sediment samples it was shown that znta abundances were significantly higher in biofilms than those in sediments at all sampling sites p 0 05 while zntb abundances were in general slightly higher in biofilms than those in sediments and a significant difference p 0 05 was found in samples taken from xp and sdk fig s3 these results suggested that microbes in biofilms had greater resistance ability to zn than those in sediments furthermore as shown in table s12 although there was no significant correlation between znta abundances and args abundances significant positive correlation was found between zntb abundances and each arg abundance in biofilms respectively indicating that zn might increase the antibiotic resistance of bacteria vahjen et al 2015 in sediments the abundances of znta were positively correlated to sas resistance genes with two genes showing significant correlations including sul1 r 0 478 p 0 05 and sul3 r 0 596 p 0 05 these data confirmed that zn could show selection pressures on microbes and increase sas antibiotic resistance in both biofilm and sediment samples becerra castro et al 2015 in addition to antibiotics and metals correlation analysis showed that toc concentrations were significantly correlated to the concentration of most tested genes including 16s rrna inti1 sul1 sul3 ermb qnrs teta tetm tetq and tetw in biofilm samples table s13 and inti1 sul1 sul2 ermb teta tetm teto tetq and tetw in sediment samples table s14 meanwhile doc concentrations were significantly correlated to the abundances of 16s rrna sul1 sul3 ermb and teta in water samples table s15 these results revealed that organic carbon is one of the vital factors regulating the occurrence and dissemination of args as args could be associated with organic carbon and be further protected from nuclease degradation demanèche et al 2001 in addition up to nine genes were significantly correlated to bacterial density in biofilms table s13 indicating the abundance of antibiotic resistance bacteria in biofilms 3 4 contributions of args from edna and idna in biofilm and sediment samples four args including sul1 sul2 teta and tetw were further selected to investigate their distribution in edna and idna in biofilm and sediment due to their relatively high abundances and significant correlation with sample properties such as toc metal and antibiotics concentrations 16s rrna and inti1 were also quantified for comparison the extraction efficiency 63 93 72 75 of edna in this study was comparable to those by reference methods mao et al 2014 by comparing the sum of tested gene abundances in edna and idna to those extracted from total dna we were able to calculate the recoveries from 58 3 to 140 1 in biofilms and 56 8 136 9 in sediments respectively the distribution of args in edna and idna of biofilms and sediments taken along the yangtze estuary is shown in fig 3 in sediments almost all the tested gene abundances were higher in edna than in idna p 0 05 more than 60 of gene copies were contributed by edna in sediment samples except for inti1 at cy 46 7 sul1 at sdk 48 6 and teta at sdk 58 3 fig 3 this further confirmed that sediment associated edna is a vital sink for args which could enhance the propagation of args in the environment through hgt mao et al 2014 in addition for all the sampling sites almost all gene abundances were higher in edna than in idna in biofilm samples p 0 05 except for the samples taken from sdk and sck and the abundance of tetw at qyk these results suggest that biofilm associated edna could also be considered as an important reservoir for args however the abundances of the tested genes in idna accounted for the majority of the total abundance in the biofilm samples taken from sdk and sck p 0 05 fig 3 which may be associated with the higher bacterial density of biofilms at these two sampling sites fig s1b correlation analysis revealed that arg abundances contributed by edna were significantly correlated to toc concentrations both in biofilm and sediment samples table 1 furthermore the concentrations of non mbc were calculated by subtracting mbc from toc concentrations with a hypothesis that all the mbc was in bacteria as mbc concentrations were significantly correlated to bacterial density in biofilm samples r 0 805 p 0 05 correlation analysis showed that all arg abundances in edna including sul1 sul2 teta and tetw were significantly correlated to non mbc concentrations in both biofilm and sediment samples with generally higher r values and lower p values table 1 this correlation is considered as more significant than that with toc moreover no significant correlation was found between arg abundances in edna and mbc concentrations in biofilms table s16 these results indicated that when compared to mcb args in edna were mainly distributed in and further regulated by non mbc such as humus and other organic matter in the environmental matrix durenkamp et al 2010 mao et al 2014 therefore we normalized arg abundances in edna by non mbcs concentrations to evaluate affinity of args in edna to non mbcs in biofilm and sediment table s17 results showed that the average level of args including sul1 5 13 106 copies g sul2 1 58 106 copies g teta 2 03 106 copies g and tetw 5 55 103 copies g in biofilms were higher than those in sediments including sul1 2 9 104 copies g sul2 3 07 104 copies g teta 1 03 104 copies g and tetw 1 91 103 copies g respectively in another word non mbcs in biofilm showed elevated affinity of edna related args compared to sediment notably significant correlations between args concentrations contributed from idna and bacterial densities were found in biofilms while only sul2 abundances in idna were significantly correlated to bacterial densities in sediments table 1 the mbc concentrations were also significantly correlated to the args concentrations in idna in biofilm samples and the mbc concentrations were only significantly correlated to sul2 and teta concentrations in idna in sediment samples table 1 in addition significant correlations between 16s rrna and arg abundances contributed by idna were also found in biofilms except for teta table s18 as idna mostly exists in bacterial cells mao et al 2014 in the present study the abundances of args in idna were normalized by mbc concentrations and bacterial densities in biofilm and sediment samples respectively table s19 and s20 when normalized by mbc concentrations the average level of args including sul1 2 37 109 copies g sul2 4 32 107 copies g teta 2 35 107 copies g and tetw 1 11 105 copies g in biofilms were higher than those in sediments including sul1 2 07 105 copies g sul2 3 63 105 copies g teta 1 08 105 copies g and tetw 2 66 104 copies g respectively moreover as for biofilms the args in idna per gram of mbc were 17 9 223 6 times higher than those in edna normalized by non mbc and these values were 8 18 17 4 times in sediments suggesting the high abundance of args in antibiotic resistance bacteria when normalized by bacterial density four args in idna generally had higher abundance in biofilm compared to sediment samples taken from the yangtze estuary table s20 and it is especially true for sul1 which were 9 2 27347 6 times higher than those in the corresponding sediment enrichment of sul1 genes per cell in biofilm suggested that compared to sediments there were more sul1 related bacteria in biofilms furthermore results showed that the abundances of tested genes ranged from 0 21 to 1537844 copies cell at sdk which were significantly higher than those at other sampling sites p 0 05 indicating the enrichment of antibiotic resistance bacteria in biofilm at sdk where it was influenced by a wwtp effluent moreover as the most abundant arg per cell in biofilm sul1 abundances ranged from 1 8 to 34478 copies cell these values showed a more significant correlation r 0 703 p 0 01 to inti1 compared to those based on un normalized ones confirming that the sul1 tend to exist on the genome of microbes in biofilms 3 5 partition coefficients of args in edna between biofilm sediment and water most of the studies on args in water samples are based on a hypothesis that all args can be collected by filters e g 0 22 μm diameter luo et al 2010 lu et al 2015 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 in fact there are still edna exiting in the filtrates of water samples mao et al 2014 in the present study args including sul1 sul2 teta and tetw were further quantified as edna associated args relatively low concentrations of args sul1 14 8 84 6 copies ml sul2 47 5 98 0 copies ml teta 10 3 48 7 copies ml tetw 75 2 34 2 copies ml were found from edna in water samples fig s4 with the contribution less than 5 from edna to the total args in water fig s5 we believed that these contributions of args from edna were underestimated because we suspected that edna could be associated with particulate matter 0 22 μm in the water and by the filtration process breazel et al 2013 these edna were considered as idna according to this method mao et al 2014 given args as pollutants occurred in all the environmental marix rysz and alvarez 2004 pruden et al 2006 and they were generally abundant in edna in water sediments and biofilms in the present study we further calculate partition coefficients k of each arg in edna between biofilm sediment and water respectively as we have mentioned above edna in water can be underestimated and therefore the calculated k values can be overestimated still the partition coefficients can give us more insight on the partitioning behavior of edna in the biofilm sediment water matrix in the present study we found that there is significant correlation between non mbc concentration and args in edna for both sediments and in biofilms table 1 therefore non mbc could be a significant reservoir for args in edna when normalized by non mbc foc the average lgk oc values of sul1 sul2 teta and tetw were 5 13 2 82 2 82 and 1 91 in biofilms and 2 99 2 59 1 33 and 1 46 in sediments respectively table 2 indicating that args in edna especially sul1 show a higher affinity for non mbc in biofilms than sediment 4 conclusions our study confirmed that biofilms serve as a highly active sink for various contaminants including metals antibiotics and intracellular and extracellular args as compared to the sediments and waters at most sampling sites along the yangtze estuary the elevated concentrations of antibiotics and metals documented in this study in biofilms may serve to stimulate selection for biofilm args as well as stimulate horizontal gene transfer in addition we found that greater edna associated args were enriched in both sediments and biofilms than those of idna associated args suggesting that edna associated args may represent a largely underappreciated fraction of the total environmental resistome particularly in sediment and biofilms this work highlights the need to develop standardized methods for quantifying edna versus idna in environmental water sediment and biofilm samples additionally this work may inform future systematical study of args in multi phases of aquatic environment such as water sediment and biofilm as the sampling focused solely on water samples may underestimate the risks associated with the potentially arg rich sediment and biofilm our findings suggest the contribution of args from edna in aquatic environments should not be neglected toc was identified as an important parameter that may regulate the occurrence of args in both biofilm and sediment phases and especially non mbcs for those contributed from edna moreover as edna may be more stable and persistent in the environment when associated with organic matter it may be more likely to be utilized by organisms and this should facilitate their propagation throughout the aquatic system furthermore partitioning coefficients for args in edna between biofilm sediment and water were developed and estimated based on the present study providing a potential new avenue for evaluating the risk of args in aquatic environments overall this study provides insight into the mechanisms governing the dissemination of args via surface water and investigates several discrete compartments water sediment and biofilm as potential sinks for args in aquatic environments acknowledgments this study was funded by the national natural science foundation of china

19843,environmental concerns regarding the potential ecological risks of metallic oxide nanoparticles mnps in aquatic ecosystems are increasing sediment is considered a sink for these mnps although several studies have studied the potential impact of mnps on microbial communities in freshwater and estuarine sediments limited information is available regarding the influence of mnps on the metabolic activity of surficial sediment microbial communities and related biogeochemical conditions to address these issues a microcosm approach was established to study the metabolic response of surficial sediment microbial communities to a single addition of tio2 or ceo2 nps 5 mg l using oxygen microelectrodes enzyme activity measurements and high throughput sequencing rapid sedimentation of mnps regardless of np type was observed in freshwater samples and most up to 85 accumulated in surface sediments 5 mm microelectrode profile measurements in pre incubated sediments treated with mnps showed that the oxygen concentration decreased at a slower rate with increasing sediment depth compared to that in untreated controls biological oxygen consumption in the uppermost sediment layer 0 1500 μm was significantly inhibited by mnps as calculated from steady state microprofiles with ceo2 nps resulting in enhanced acute toxicity than tio2 nps high throughput sequencing showed that mnp exposure increased the bacterial diversity and altered the bacterial community structure regardless of np type the abundance of three dominant bacterial genera methylotenera cytophagceae uncultured classified as an aerobic bacterium and cyanobacteria norank a facultative bacterium was markedly reduced by mnps which was primarily responsible for inhibiting microbial mediated oxygen consumption in surficial sediments in summary short term exposure to mnps negatively affected the metabolic activity of benthic microbial communities which could influence the biogeochemical functions along the sediment water interface graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial diversity metabolic activity metallic oxide nanoparticles oxygen consumption surficial sediments 1 introduction metallic oxide nanoparticles mnps are widely used in many applications including water treatment cosmetics photocatalysts pharmaceuticals and food colorants chen and mao 2007 joo and zhao 2017 mueller and nowack 2008 tio2 and ceo2 nps are two of the most widely used mnps having annual global production rates of 10 000 and 1000 tons respectively piccinno et al 2012 it is expected that mnps will be released into the environment through waste disposal and other routes klaine et al 2012 nowack et al 2014 and concerns have been raised about their environmental fate and potential ecological risks to aquatic ecosystems once introduced into the aquatic environment mnps can result in acute and chronic toxicity to bacteria plankton algae and microbial communities in natural water dale et al 2015 holden et al 2014 marie et al 2014 mohanty et al 2014 tang et al 2017 consequently the released mnps could aggregate and accumulate in benthic environments keller et al 2010 li et al 2014 tlili et al 2017 this might affect functional biodiversity and consequently ecosystem properties gao et al 2011 markus et al 2015 mohanty et al 2014 thus studies on the environmental behavior of mnps and their potential effects on sediment systems are warranted sediment microorganisms are key components of freshwater habitats and play an important role in many ecosystem processes including biogeochemical cycling organic matter degradation and bioremediation of pollutants battin et al 2008 hondzo and steinberger 2008 ozaki et al 2016 wu 2016 to date several studies have been performed to investigate the effects of mnps on microbial communities in estuarine or freshwater sediment beddow et al 2017 bradford et al 2009 colman et al 2012 marie et al 2014 moore et al 2016 ozaki et al 2016 however there is still controversy over the degree or even the presence of effects due to the different physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles and varied environmental factors i e ph organic matter redox state and sulfide bao et al 2016 joo and zhao 2017 miao et al 2016a nuzzo et al 2017 for example environmentally relevant concentrations of ceo2 nps 1 mg l were shown to alter bacterial community diversity and functions of freshwater ecosystems bour et al 2016 in contrast exposure to ag nps 1 mg l was found to have minor or no negative impacts on the metabolic function echavarri bravo et al 2015 or the microbial community structure of sediment systems bradford et al 2009 moore et al 2016 ozaki et al 2016 found that benthic bacterial abundance was decreased by ntio2 treatment 1 mg l within 1 day and returned to control levels within 3 weeks thus information is still needed regarding the response of benthic microbial communities to different mnps in realistic systems moreover the biogeochemical conditions in sediment controlled by benthic microbial communities exhibit high heterogeneity predominantly in a vertical direction with the most intense microbial activity centered around the sediment water interface jourabchi et al 2008 when introduced into natural water mnps tend to aggregate and form large sized nano aggregates the migration of these aggregates in sediment might be limited making it difficult for these particles to be transmitted into deep layer sediment through diffusion in interstitial water bradford et al 2009 echavarri bravo et al 2015 as a result microbial communities inhabiting the surficial sediment might be the first to be affected by settled mnps and thus might respond differently than the microbes living in deeper sediment layers therefore there is a need for high resolution and in situ investigations to better characterize the potential effects of surficial sediment on microbial communities microelectrodes are effective and promising research tools allowing for the high resolution determination at a scale of microns of the physico chemical parameters do ph h2s et of sediments from these measurements conclusions can be drawn regarding the zonation of processes and the metabolic activities within microbial communities krawczyk bärsch et al 2008 viret et al 2006 in this study freshwater sediments were collected from taihu lake china and a series of microcosm systems were established to model environmental conditions a single addition of mnps was used to model a exposure concentration of 5 mg l tio2 or ceo2 nps in addition the colloidal behavior of these substances in microcosms was determined the metabolic response of surficial sediment microbial communities was studied for the first time through oxygen microelectrodes enzyme activity measurements and high throughput sequencing analyses the results provide valuable insights into the effects of mnps and the associated mechanisms of action on benthic microbial metabolism 2 materials and methods 2 1 metallic oxide nanoparticle characterization two types of commercial metallic oxide nps tio2 and ceo2 were used in this study dry titanium oxide

particle size were characterized with a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 sem fig s1 the hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 and ceo2 nps in milli q water was determined at 153 24 nm and 92 14

overlying water were collected from the zhushan bay 31 3794 n 120 0249 e of lake taihu fig s2 the third largest freshwater lake in china with high amounts of industrial waste water and domestic sewage discharged into zhushan bay major pollution with heavy metal and organic contaminants has occurred in this area causing the water quality to severely deteriorate posing a large potential ecological risk to the aquatic environment tao et al 2012 due to the rapid development of nanotechnology an increasing quantity of nanoparticles could be released into this area and threaten the local ecological environment surface sediment samples 0 8 cm were collected using a gravity sediment corer and brought back to the lab on ice in ten sterile polyethylene bags wang et al 2016 the associated water was filtered through whatman gf c filter paper 0 22 μm and the physico chemical parameters are given in table s1 the natural sediment was wet sieved to 0 6 mm to homogenize the sample and remove gravel

the dry weight n 10 acid volatile sulfide avs in sediments was measured according to bao et al 2016 the concentrations of trace metals in the sediment were measured using inductively coupled plasma

oxygen o2 and cultured at 20 c the outer surface of each box was covered with black plastic to prevent growth of autotrophs on the inner wall viret et al 2006 after a 3 week stabilization period exposure experiments started and related physicochemical parameters were collected from the systems day 0 to day 5 which were then randomly divided into one of five treatment groups three replicates per treatment as follows 1 biotic controls no mnp addition to the sediment system 2 addition of ntio2 to the sediment system 3 addition of nceo2 to the sediment system 4 addition of ntio2 to the autoclaved sediment system 5 addition of nceo2 to the autoclaved sediment system autoclaved water and sediments were used as abiotic controls to study the potential effects of mnps on the chemical oxygen consumption in the sediment system without active biomass they were prepared by autoclaving three consecutive times at 120 c for 15 min followed by 24 h cooling periods at 20 1 c xu et al 2011 predetermined amounts of mnp suspensions were added into the overlying water to obtain a final exposure concentration of 5 mg l tio2 or ceo2 nps this magnitude of np concentration was chosen based on the fact that it had been widely used in previous similar studies bao et al 2016 bradford et al 2009 gottschalk et al 2013 moore et al 2016 after the addition of tio2 or ceo2 nps the experimental units were stirred slowly for 10 s to aid the aeration system disperse the mnps bradford et al 2009 biotic control tests were dosed with sterile milli q water instead of mnps abiotic controls were used to assess mnp mediated physicochemical changes in the system without active biomass each treatment was performed in triplicate exposure experiments were performed for 5 d and during the experimental period the microscale oxygen gradients in the sediment water interface swi were sequentially measured in situ in the microcosms surface sediment samples were taken using a 5 ml uncapped syringe depth of sampling estimated to be approximately 0 5 0 2 cm and the extracellular enzyme activities and bacterial community diversity were analyzed a plastic corer was then placed into the resulting hole in the sediment to avoid repeatedly sampling the same spot and to prevent subsidence triplicate samples consisted of one sample from each sampling point and three homogenized samples were collected per microcosm per sampling event 2 4 microelectrodes and data analysis the dissolved oxygen do profiles across the swi were established using an o2 microelectrode unisense a s denmark the sensor had a tip diameter of 100 μm calibration of the do sensor was performed as described previously miao et al 2017 during measurement the microelectrode was moved to the sediment by an increment of 100 μm oxygen profile measurements were implemented at 20 c and o2 concentrations in the overlying water column were maintained at a saturated level nine profiles per microcosm were randomly measured in the sediment samples to assess spatial heterogeneities the position of the sediment water interface was determined from the break in the o2 concentration gradient miao et al 2017 viret et al 2006 approximately 25 35 profiles were recorded at different locations within the sediment each day depth distribution of oxygen consumption was estimated using the numerical model

were collected and four enzymes activities fluorescein diacetate hydrolase fda dehydrogenase dha alkaline phosphatase apa and urease ue were measured bao et al 2016 details are provided in the supplementary information wet surficial sediments of approximately 5 g were collected for each sample and frozen with ethanol and dry ice and stored at 80 c until dna extraction lee et al 2015 genomic dna was extracted using the e z n a tissue dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration of extracted dna was measured using a nanodrop nanodrop technologies inc wilmington de usa and pico green assays subsequently quantitative real time pcr was used to determine the copy numbers of the 16s ribosomal rna gene of all bacteria in the sediment

community analysis the v4v5 region of the bacteria 16s rrna gene of the extracted dna was amplified using a pair of primers 515f 5 barcode gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 zhou et

fastq and raw fastq files were demultiplexed quality filtered using qiime version 1 17 http qiime org after removing the barcodes and primers the data were subsampled to 13876 sequences per sample to avoid biases related to unequal numbers of sequences zhang et al 2012 then the normalized samples were individually classified and analyzed by rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu the specific methods and data analysis are available in the supplementary information 2 6 colloidal behavior and distribution of mnps in microcosms before each experiment the aggregation kinetics of tio2 and ceo2 nps in the filtered lake water through 0 22 μm pores were measured to investigate the stability of mnps in natural water and the details of this are given in the supplementary information during the experimental period the metal concentrations of ti and ce in the water column in the microcosms were determined using an icp ms agilent 7700 usa water was sampled at a point 5 cm below the surface of the water two milliliters of sample were immediately acidified and analyzed for total ti and ce concentrations whereas 2 ml was ultra centrifuged 20000 g for 30 min to determine the fraction of dissolved ti and ce marie et al 2014 surface sediments were sampled using a 5 ml syringe casing dissected by depth 5 10 and 20 mm and then digested using a triacid mixture 5 ml hf 5 ml hno3 and 2 ml hclo4 tella et al 2015 each measurement was performed in triplicate and the analytical accuracy was controlled using standard reference materials stream sediment gbw07347 all ti and ce concentrations

deviation sd enzyme activities bacterial 16s rrna gene copies numbers of observed otus from mnp treated and control sediments were compared by performing a one way anova n 3 for independent samples a t test was performed to test differences in relative abundances of dominant lineages between the mnp treated and corresponding control sediments statistical significance was determined at a confidence

concentration distribution of mnps in microcosms the transport behaviors bioavailability and negative effects on aquatic organisms of mnps largely depend on their colloidal stability in aquatic environments bour et al 2015 miao et al 2016a xu et al 2016 in this study both tio2 and ceo2 nps aggregated significantly in the first 30 min fig s4 likely ascribed to the high ionic strength and dissolved organic matter present in the overlying water binh et al 2014 jomini et al 2015 significant aggregation led to significant sedimentation of nps in the water environment markus et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 a significant sedimentation of mnps at an introduced concentration of 5 mg l was observed in the overlying water samples within 10 h regardless of np type after 18 h most of the ti and ce initially introduced in the water column settled out for both treatments the fractions of dissolved ti and ce were below 24 and 15 μg l respectively throughout the experimental period concomitant to the decrease in mnps in the overlying water the nano aggregates accumulated at the surface sediment of water sediment systems the concentration distributions of ti and ce at different depth in sediments are shown in fig 1b after 5 d exposure of 5 mg l ntio2 or nceo2 resulted concentrations of 23 9 and 32 1 mg kg dry weight in sediment for ti and ce respectively up to 85 of the injected metal was found in the surficial sediment 5 mm regardless of mnp treatment similar partitioning was previously observed for ceo2 nps in an aquatic system marie et al 2014 as well as for ag nps bradford et al 2009 echavarri bravo et al 2015 3 2 microelectrode measurements of oxygen concentration in swi representative 2 d contour plots of o2 in the sediment before mnp exposure constructed from nine vertical o2 profiles are shown in fig s5 in the bulk aqueous phase do was maintained at 213 12 μmol l and decreased in the diffusive boundary layer above the surface sediment the oxygen penetration was measured up to a depth of 2500 μm for all measuring points the strong decrease in do in the surface sediment indicated that there was significant oxygen consumption within the sediment likely attributed to a combination of microbial aerobic respiration and the oxygen demand for reactive reduced elements and substances higashino et al 2004 hondzo and steinberger 2008 in addition as shown in the fig 2 a the oxygen concentrations across the swi in the biotic control tests without the addition of mnps in the fresh sediments were stable during the 5 d experimental period however the presence of mnps 5 mg l resulted in remarkable differences in the oxygen concentration profiles in fresh sediment systems fig 2b and c after the addition of ntio2 for 24 h the o2 concentration decreased slower with sediment depth and this trend continued subsequently the oxygen concentration distribution along the swi remained unchanged for 120 h as a result the oxygen penetration increased to 3300 μm which was much higher than the measured values 2500 μm before exposure concomitantly a decrease in the oxygen flux 22 7 at the swi was observed for ntio2 treatments table s3 p 0 05 which was estimated from the steady state oxygen profiles according to the first fick s law of diffusion regarding nceo2 treatments a deeper o2 penetration was also observed in the treated sediments compared to that in the control sediments increasing from 2000 μm to 2800 μm moreover the profiles measured after exposure for 24 and 120 h were almost identical clearly demonstrating that nceo2 inhibited oxygen flux across the swi within 24 h in addition no significant changes in oxygen profiles were observed for the abiotic np treatments fig 3 tio2 and ceo2 nps added to autoclaved sediment systems indicating that the addition of nps did not affect the chemical consumption of oxygen within the sediment combining the results from the biotic and abiotic tests we can conclude that the added mnps exhibit nano toxicity to the benthic microbial communities and significantly inhibit the microbial consumption of oxygen within the sediment moreover the acute toxicity on the sediment microbial communities resulting from exposure to nceo2 was stronger than that from ntio2 besides the oxygen flux at the swi significantly decreased by 32 2 after 5 day exposure to n ceo2 table s3 p 0 05 viret et al 2006 found that the oxygen distribution and flux across the swi were significantly affected by the high concentrations of zn and ni 20 and 60 mg l in this study the vertical distribution of oxygen consumption rates was calculated using the numerical procedure profile suggested by berg et al 1998 which has been used to interpret oxygen concentration measure in sediments nakamura et al 2004 viret et al 2006 in fig 4 the measured microprofiles of do are given together with the calculated oxygen profiles which fit the measured data points perfectly along with the corresponding consumption rates significant aerobic respiration was observed at all depths inside the surface sediments and there were three identified oxygen consumption zones with different oxygen consumption rates fig 4 oxygen consumption in the control sediments without mnp addition was stable during the experimental period however a relevant environmental concentration 5 mg l of mnps strongly influenced the oxygen consumption at all depths of the sediment after exposure to mnps significant decreases in total oxygen consumption were observed in the sediments regardless of np type in particular exposure to mnps led to an obvious reduction in oxygen consumption in the top zone 0 1500 μm and slight increases in oxygen consumption were observed in the lower zone 2000 3000 μm corresponding to an increase in oxygen penetration these results suggested that the addition of mnps is likely to significantly influence the oxygen respiratory activity of the surficial sediments 3 3 effects of nps on total bacterial abundance and enzyme activities quantitative pcr probing for the 16s rrna gene was applied to investigate changes in total bacterial abundance in sediment after tio2 and ceo2 np exposure gene copies were normalized to the mass of surficial sediment used for the extraction of dna as shown in the fig s6 after a 5 d incubation slight increases in bacterial community densities were observed for the control and mnp treated sediments and the total copy numbers of bacterial 16s rrna genes were consistent across all samples and ranged from 11 65 109 to 13 4 109 per gram pairwise comparisons showed that there were no significant differences in the total bacterial abundance between the mnp treated and control samples p 0 05 indicating that tio2 or ceo2 np exposure had limited effects on sediment microbial biomass extracellular enzyme activity can be considered an indicator of metabolism in sediment four enzyme activities fda dha apa and ue in the sediment were determined at the end of experiments and the results are shown in fig s7 no significant differences in fda and apa activities were observed for both tio2 and ceo2 np treatments when comparted to control levels p 0 05 meanwhile ceo2 np exposure resulted in slightly reduced dha activity after 5 d of treatment p 0 05 and significantly decreased ue activity in the sediment p 0 05 these results indicated that similar to that observed for sediment bacterial community density tio2 np treatment has finite effects on enzyme activities however exposure to ceo2 nps might affect the nitrogen cycles in the sediments 3 4 effects of mnps on bacterial community structure after a 5 d exposure sediment samples in all treatment groups were collected and subjected to illumina miseq high throughput sequencing after filtering 272764 quality sequences were obtained for the nine analyzed samples with a range of 22981 36472 sequences per community subsequently the data were subsampled to 13876 sequences per sample to avoid biases related to unequal numbers of sequences as shown in table s4 the excellent coverage of otus 94 from all sediment samples suggested that most microbial species were detected in all samples the simpson shannon diversity index was used as an estimator of alpha diversity as it is a robust metric for large 16s rrna gene data sets moore et al 2016 as shown in table s4 the presence of mnps significantly increased the alpha diversity of the microbial communities of the sediments after a 5 d exposure p 0 05 taxonomic classification revealed significant differences in community composition between the mnp treatment groups and controls as shown in fig 5 a the bacterial communities in all sediment samples were mainly assigned to 13 phyla abundance 1 the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria accounting for 43 2 55 4 of species followed by bacteroidetes and chloroflexi which comprised 10 0 14 8 and 5 5 11 3 respectively at the phylum level bacterial communities in the controls and mnp treated samples presented similar diversity but different abundances when the phylum abundance data set from all sediment samples was analyzed by pca ordination the bacterial communities in the mnp treatment groups were separated from control samples indicating that the addition of mnps altered the bacterial community fig 5b approximately 95 6 of the total variance was explained by the first two axes with pc1 and pc2 explaining 86 2 and 9 4 of the total variance respectively the abundance of proteobacteria was the main factor contributing to differences in the bacterial community structure between the mnp treated and control sediments t test p 0 05 table s5 the difference between the control and ntio2 treatment groups was mainly caused by the abundance of nitrospirae and that of chloroflexi accounted for differences between the controls and nceo2 treatment groups t test p 0 05 these results suggested that a 5 d exposure to mnps significantly changed the bacterial community structure which might negatively affect biogeochemical activities 4 discussion 4 1 fate of mnps in microcosms once released into the environment mnps can undergo distinct physicochemical transformations including aggregation disaggregation oxidation reduction reactions complexation and dissolution which will affect their fate and toxicity bour et al 2015 joo and zhao 2017 in this study most of the added mnps settled in the water column within 24 h through aggregation and sedimentation fig 1 realistically when released into the natural environment mnps tend to homo and hetero aggregate and accumulate on the sediment marie et al 2014 miao et al 2017 afterwards the migration of nanoparticles in the surface sediment might be limited thus it might difficult for transmission to occur into deep layer sediments through the diffusion in interstitial water due to mnp hetero aggregation with sediment particles bradford et al 2009 cross et al 2014 marie et al 2014 consequently most of the introduced mnps up to 85 were found in the surficial sediment 5 mm after 5 d of exposure therefore the limited penetration of mnps into sediments makes them bioaccessible to those microbial organisms living within the surface layer of sediments metabolically active layer colman et al 2012 cross et al 2014 ozaki et al 2016 in addition the bioavailability and potential toxicity of mnps are strongly related to the forms in which they exist and the type of chemical ligands with which they bind bao et al 2016 bour et al 2015 mnps are likely to transform their chemical speciation through both biotic and abiotic processes inside the surface sediment bao et al 2016 cross et al 2014 tangaa et al 2016 dissolution has been deemed an essential transformation process of mnps such as ag zno and cuo nps in aquatic environments joo and zhao 2017 and the dissolved metal ions are toxic to various freshwater organisms and contribute partially to the nanotoxicity of mnps cross et al 2014 hou et al 2014 besides sulfidation was found to be an important process for mnps occurring in the presence of sulfide avs particularly in the case of ag nps which potentially leads to a decreased dissolution rate and mobility and influences its nano toxicity to organisms khaksar et al 2014 tangaa et al 2016 in this study the fraction of dissolved tio2 and ceo2 nps in the interstitial water was below 5 throughout the experimental period in addition the avs concentrations were shown to be maintained at 5 36 1 03 μmol g dry weight for all np treatments as well as the control sediment during the 5 d exposure these results suggested that there was no significant dissolution or sulfidation of tio2 and ceo2 in sediments likely due to the inert surfaces of these nps gardea torresdey et al 2014 joo and zhao 2017 moreover previous studies have demonstrated that no reduction of ceiv to ceiii occurred in the surficial sediments tella et al 2015 and no significant transformation of tio2 in soils despite the complex systems pachapur et al 2016 however tio2 and ceo2 nps were shown to undergo surface transformations through oxidation under uv irradiation mitrano et al 2015 therefore further investigations should be performed to study the transformation mechanisms and kinetics of mnps in natural freshwater systems 4 2 effects of mnps on the metabolic activity of surficial sediment microbial communities systematic research on the potential impacts of mnps on benthic microbial communities is crucial to evaluate the negative effects and the fate of the mnps in aquatic environments recent studies have revealed that mnps such as ag tio2 and ceo2 nps can be toxic to benthic microbial communities bour et al 2015 joo and zhao 2017 for example exposure to ag nps was found to have minor or no negative impact on the metabolic function echavarri bravo et al 2015 enzymatic activity colman et al 2012 or the microbial community structure in sediment systems bao et al 2016 bradford et al 2009 moore et al 2016 in contrast environmentally relevant concentrations of ceo2 nps 1 mg l changed the bacterial community diversity and functions of freshwater ecosystems bour et al 2016 in the present study the effects of mnps on the metabolic activity of surficial sediment microbial communities were studied using oxygen microelectrodes enzyme activity measurements and high throughput sequencing analyses the gradient of oxygen concentrations within the swi changed significantly within the mnp tio2 and ceo2 treatment systems with a slow decrease in oxygen concentration with increasing sediment depths oxygen penetration in sediments was significantly increased fig 2 and a significant inhibition of oxygen consumption and oxygen flux in surface sediment 0 3 mm were observed in sediments oxygen consumption can be attributed to microbial aerobic respiration and chemical oxidization of reduced elements and substances e g nh4 fe2 mn2 and s2 bryant et al 2010 higashino et al 2004 herein mnps had no obvious effect on chemical oxygen consumption in the sediment fig 3 and the biological oxygen consumption was significantly influenced by the presence of mnps figs 2 and 4 as confirmed from biotic and abiotic np treatment tests therefore the presence of mnps might negatively affect the microbial structure and metabolic activity in surficial sediment and subsequently affect the oxygen consumption in surficial sediment discussed as follows due to the low solubility of molecular oxygen in water and the oxygen diffusion pattern in sediment three zones specifically an oxidized zone a redox potential discontinuity zone and an anoxic zone tend to develop with time in sediment brune et al 2000 according to the need of the bacteria for oxygen there is a spatial shift in the microbial community composition in the vicinity of the oxic anoxic interface with aerobic bacteria mainly occurring at the oxic zone and anaerobic bacteria and facultative bacteria gathering at the anoxic zone brune et al 2000 noll et al 2005 in this study a 5 d exposure to mnps increased the bacterial diversity and significant altered the bacterial community structure in sediments fig 5 and tables s4 and 6 more specifically the presence of mnps reduced largely the total relative abundance of aerobic bacteria at the genus level with the reduction of methylotenera and cytophagceae uncultured accounting for the greatest proportion fig 6 similar effects were also observed for facultative bacteria with the reduction of cyanobacteria norank accounting for a greater proportion in contrast anaerobic bacteria exhibited the opposite trend and the relative abundance of these bacteria increased significantly after exposure with anaerolineaceae uncultured occupying the large proportion as a result the reduced abundance of aerobic microorganisms led to decreased aerobic respiration which might be responsible for the inhibited microbial oxygen consumption in the sediments previous studies have demonstrated that aerobic microorganisms can rapidly respond to physico chemical changes in the environment by changing their metabolic activity or their community structure alexandre et al 2004 noll et al 2005 viret et al 2006 found that the benthic oxygen consumption at the sediment surface was significantly inhibited by high concentrations of zinc and nickel and they inferred that this was due to downward migration of aerobic microorganisms the presence of uranium at ecologically relevant concentrations stimulated the oxygen consumption of multispecies biofilms which was attributed to the activation of adaptation and detoxification mechanisms and not to changes in bacterial diversity in biofilms krawczyk bärsch et al 2008 in addition some motile bacteria such as cyanobacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfide oxidizing bacteria can respond to variations in environmental conditions by changing their distribution in sediments and mats alexandre et al 2004 haglund et al 2003 due to the complex environmental conditions the response mechanisms and the self adaption of benthic microbes should be further investigated to provide valuable information for understanding the negative effects of mnps on sediment systems 4 3 environmental implications in this study joint application of microelectrodes and high throughput sequencing was performed for the first time to assess the metabolic response of surficial sediment microbial communities to mnps in a controlled yet realistic system the composite observations show that the presence of mnps can influence the oxygen distribution across the swi by changing the benthic microbial community structure these results suggest the importance of microscale measurements for understanding the potential effects of mnps on microscale geochemical gradients such as do ph and orp moreover the biogeochemical cycling of many elements frequently occurs at the swi and is controlled by benthic microbial communities battin et al 2008 hondzo and steinberger 2008 the bactericidal effects of mnps might have negative consequences on ecosystem health impairing critical bacteria driven nutrient cycles e g nitrogen phosphorus or sulfur cycling and consequently the biodegradation of organic matter it has been reported that nzvi treatment affects the dissolved phosphorus exchange across the sediment water interface but does not influence the nitrate and nitrite concentration in the water column buchkowski et al 2016 the chronic agnp exposure influenced both the microbial functions and community structure in streams resulting in notable ecosystem consequences through impacts on litter decomposition and further biogeochemical processes tlili et al 2017 however the functions of the periphyton were able to acclimate to the fe2o3 nanoparticles exposure via self regulation of morphology species composition and diversity tang et al 2017 therefore further research is needed to study the effects of mnps on the biogeochemical functions along the sediment water interface in addition the long term response mechanism of benthic microbial communities should be addressed 5 conclusions combined use of do microelectrodes and high throughput sequencing analyses can provide comprehensive insights into the effects of mnps on the metabolic activity of microbial communities in freshwater sediment our conclusions include most of the introduced mnps up to 85 accumulated at the surficial sediment 5 mm after 5 d exposure regardless of np type the addition of 5 mg l mnps decreased the oxygen flux across the swi and inhibited the oxygen consumption of surficial sediment microbial communities mnp exposure increased the bacterial diversity and altered the bacterial community structure the suppressed abundance of aerobic bacteria methylotenera and cytophagceae uncultured and facultative bacteria cyanobacteria norank was responsible for the inhibition of

19843,environmental concerns regarding the potential ecological risks of metallic oxide nanoparticles mnps in aquatic ecosystems are increasing sediment is considered a sink for these mnps although several studies have studied the potential impact of mnps on microbial communities in freshwater and estuarine sediments limited information is available regarding the influence of mnps on the metabolic activity of surficial sediment microbial communities and related biogeochemical conditions to address these issues a microcosm approach was established to study the metabolic response of surficial sediment microbial communities to a single addition of tio2 or ceo2 nps 5 mg l using oxygen microelectrodes enzyme activity measurements and high throughput sequencing rapid sedimentation of mnps regardless of np type was observed in freshwater samples and most up to 85 accumulated in surface sediments 5 mm microelectrode profile measurements in pre incubated sediments treated with mnps showed that the oxygen concentration decreased at a slower rate with increasing sediment depth compared to that in untreated controls biological oxygen consumption in the uppermost sediment layer 0 1500 μm was significantly inhibited by mnps as calculated from steady state microprofiles with ceo2 nps resulting in enhanced acute toxicity than tio2 nps high throughput sequencing showed that mnp exposure increased the bacterial diversity and altered the bacterial community structure regardless of np type the abundance of three dominant bacterial genera methylotenera cytophagceae uncultured classified as an aerobic bacterium and cyanobacteria norank a facultative bacterium was markedly reduced by mnps which was primarily responsible for inhibiting microbial mediated oxygen consumption in surficial sediments in summary short term exposure to mnps negatively affected the metabolic activity of benthic microbial communities which could influence the biogeochemical functions along the sediment water interface graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial diversity metabolic activity metallic oxide nanoparticles oxygen consumption surficial sediments 1 introduction metallic oxide nanoparticles mnps are widely used in many applications including water treatment cosmetics photocatalysts pharmaceuticals and food colorants chen and mao 2007 joo and zhao 2017 mueller and nowack 2008 tio2 and ceo2 nps are two of the most widely used mnps having annual global production rates of 10 000 and 1000 tons respectively piccinno et al 2012 it is expected that mnps will be released into the environment through waste disposal and other routes klaine et al 2012 nowack et al 2014 and concerns have been raised about their environmental fate and potential ecological risks to aquatic ecosystems once introduced into the aquatic environment mnps can result in acute and chronic toxicity to bacteria plankton algae and microbial communities in natural water dale et al 2015 holden et al 2014 marie et al 2014 mohanty et al 2014 tang et al 2017 consequently the released mnps could aggregate and accumulate in benthic environments keller et al 2010 li et al 2014 tlili et al 2017 this might affect functional biodiversity and consequently ecosystem properties gao et al 2011 markus et al 2015 mohanty et al 2014 thus studies on the environmental behavior of mnps and their potential effects on sediment systems are warranted sediment microorganisms are key components of freshwater habitats and play an important role in many ecosystem processes including biogeochemical cycling organic matter degradation and bioremediation of pollutants battin et al 2008 hondzo and steinberger 2008 ozaki et al 2016 wu 2016 to date several studies have been performed to investigate the effects of mnps on microbial communities in estuarine or freshwater sediment beddow et al 2017 bradford et al 2009 colman et al 2012 marie et al 2014 moore et al 2016 ozaki et al 2016 however there is still controversy over the degree or even the presence of effects due to the different physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles and varied environmental factors i e ph organic matter redox state and sulfide bao et al 2016 joo and zhao 2017 miao et al 2016a nuzzo et al 2017 for example environmentally relevant concentrations of ceo2 nps 1 mg l were shown to alter bacterial community diversity and functions of freshwater ecosystems bour et al 2016 in contrast exposure to ag nps 1 mg l was found to have minor or no negative impacts on the metabolic function echavarri bravo et al 2015 or the microbial community structure of sediment systems bradford et al 2009 moore et al 2016 ozaki et al 2016 found that benthic bacterial abundance was decreased by ntio2 treatment 1 mg l within 1 day and returned to control levels within 3 weeks thus information is still needed regarding the response of benthic microbial communities to different mnps in realistic systems moreover the biogeochemical conditions in sediment controlled by benthic microbial communities exhibit high heterogeneity predominantly in a vertical direction with the most intense microbial activity centered around the sediment water interface jourabchi et al 2008 when introduced into natural water mnps tend to aggregate and form large sized nano aggregates the migration of these aggregates in sediment might be limited making it difficult for these particles to be transmitted into deep layer sediment through diffusion in interstitial water bradford et al 2009 echavarri bravo et al 2015 as a result microbial communities inhabiting the surficial sediment might be the first to be affected by settled mnps and thus might respond differently than the microbes living in deeper sediment layers therefore there is a need for high resolution and in situ investigations to better characterize the potential effects of surficial sediment on microbial communities microelectrodes are effective and promising research tools allowing for the high resolution determination at a scale of microns of the physico chemical parameters do ph h2s et of sediments from these measurements conclusions can be drawn regarding the zonation of processes and the metabolic activities within microbial communities krawczyk bärsch et al 2008 viret et al 2006 in this study freshwater sediments were collected from taihu lake china and a series of microcosm systems were established to model environmental conditions a single addition of mnps was used to model a exposure concentration of 5 mg l tio2 or ceo2 nps in addition the colloidal behavior of these substances in microcosms was determined the metabolic response of surficial sediment microbial communities was studied for the first time through oxygen microelectrodes enzyme activity measurements and high throughput sequencing analyses the results provide valuable insights into the effects of mnps and the associated mechanisms of action on benthic microbial metabolism 2 materials and methods 2 1 metallic oxide nanoparticle characterization two types of commercial metallic oxide nps tio2 and ceo2 were used in this study dry titanium oxide

particle size were characterized with a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 sem fig s1 the hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 and ceo2 nps in milli q water was determined at 153 24 nm and 92 14

overlying water were collected from the zhushan bay 31 3794 n 120 0249 e of lake taihu fig s2 the third largest freshwater lake in china with high amounts of industrial waste water and domestic sewage

environment surface sediment samples 0 8 cm were collected using a gravity sediment corer and brought back to the lab on ice in ten sterile polyethylene bags wang et al 2016 the associated water was filtered through whatman gf c filter paper 0 22 μm and the physico chemical parameters are given in table s1 the natural sediment was wet sieved to 0 6 mm to homogenize the sample and remove gravel

the dry weight n 10 acid volatile sulfide avs in sediments was measured according to bao et al 2016 the concentrations of trace metals in the sediment were measured using inductively coupled plasma

al 2017 briefly overlying water from the sampling site was added into the containers yielding a 10 cm layer of water overlying the sediment 5 cm depth microcosms were always kept covered bubbled with oxygen o2 and cultured at 20 c the outer surface of each box was covered with black plastic to prevent growth of autotrophs on the inner wall viret et al 2006 after a 3 week stabilization period exposure experiments started and related physicochemical parameters were collected from the systems day 0 to day 5 which were then randomly divided into one of five treatment groups three replicates per treatment as follows 1 biotic controls no mnp addition to the sediment system 2 addition of ntio2 to the sediment system 3 addition of nceo2 to the sediment system 4 addition of ntio2 to the autoclaved sediment system 5 addition of nceo2 to the autoclaved sediment system autoclaved water and sediments were used as abiotic controls to study the potential effects of mnps on the chemical oxygen consumption in the sediment system without active biomass they were prepared by autoclaving three consecutive times at 120 c for 15 min followed by 24 h cooling periods at 20 1 c xu et al 2011 predetermined amounts of mnp suspensions were added into the overlying water to obtain a final exposure concentration of 5 mg l tio2 or ceo2 nps this magnitude of np concentration was chosen based on the fact that it had been widely used in previous similar studies bao et al 2016 bradford et al 2009 gottschalk et al 2013 moore et al 2016 after the addition of tio2 or ceo2 nps the experimental units were stirred slowly for 10 s to aid the aeration system disperse the mnps bradford et al 2009 biotic control tests were dosed with sterile milli q water instead of mnps abiotic controls were used to assess mnp mediated physicochemical changes in the system without active biomass each treatment was performed in triplicate exposure experiments were performed for 5 d and during the experimental period the microscale oxygen gradients in the sediment water interface swi were sequentially measured in situ in the microcosms surface sediment samples were taken using a 5 ml uncapped syringe depth of sampling estimated to be approximately 0 5 0 2 cm and the extracellular enzyme activities and bacterial community diversity were analyzed a plastic corer was then placed into the resulting hole in the sediment to avoid repeatedly sampling the same spot and to prevent subsidence triplicate samples consisted of one sample from each sampling point and three homogenized samples were collected per microcosm per sampling event 2 4 microelectrodes and data analysis the dissolved oxygen do profiles across the swi were established using an o2 microelectrode unisense a s denmark the sensor had a tip diameter of 100 μm calibration of the do sensor was performed as described previously miao et al 2017 during measurement the microelectrode was moved to the sediment by an increment of 100 μm oxygen profile measurements were implemented at 20 c and o2 concentrations in the overlying water column were maintained at a saturated level nine profiles per microcosm were randomly measured in the sediment samples to assess spatial heterogeneities the position of the sediment water interface was determined from the break in the o2 concentration gradient miao et al 2017

and data analysis are available in the supplementary information 2 6 colloidal behavior and distribution of mnps in microcosms before each experiment the aggregation kinetics of tio2 and ceo2 nps in the filtered lake water through 0 22 μm pores were measured to investigate the stability of mnps in natural water and the details of this are given in the supplementary information during the experimental period the metal concentrations of ti and ce in the water column in the microcosms were determined using an icp ms agilent 7700 usa water was sampled at a point 5 cm below the surface of the water two milliliters of sample were immediately acidified and analyzed for total ti and ce concentrations whereas 2 ml was ultra centrifuged 20000 g for 30 min to determine the fraction of dissolved ti and ce marie et al 2014 surface sediments were sampled using a 5 ml syringe casing dissected by depth 5 10 and 20 mm and then digested using a triacid mixture 5 ml hf 5 ml hno3 and 2 ml

concentration distribution of mnps in microcosms the transport behaviors bioavailability and negative effects on aquatic organisms of mnps largely depend on their colloidal stability in aquatic environments bour et al 2015 miao et al 2016a xu et al 2016 in this study both tio2 and ceo2 nps aggregated significantly in the first 30 min fig s4 likely ascribed to the high ionic strength and dissolved organic matter present in the overlying water binh et al 2014 jomini et al 2015 significant aggregation led to significant sedimentation of nps in the water environment markus et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 a significant sedimentation of mnps at an introduced concentration of 5 mg l was observed in the overlying water samples within 10 h regardless of np type after 18 h most of the ti and ce initially introduced in the water column settled out for both treatments the fractions of dissolved ti and ce were below 24 and 15 μg l respectively throughout the experimental period concomitant to the decrease in mnps in the overlying water the nano aggregates accumulated at the surface sediment of water sediment systems the concentration distributions of ti and ce at different depth in sediments are shown in fig 1b after 5 d exposure of 5 mg l ntio2 or nceo2 resulted concentrations of 23 9 and 32 1 mg kg dry weight in sediment for ti and ce respectively up to 85 of the injected metal was found in the surficial sediment 5 mm regardless of mnp treatment similar partitioning was previously observed for ceo2 nps in an aquatic system marie et al 2014 as well as for ag nps bradford et al 2009 echavarri bravo et al 2015 3 2 microelectrode measurements of oxygen concentration in swi representative 2 d contour plots of o2 in the sediment before mnp exposure constructed from nine vertical o2 profiles are shown in fig s5 in the bulk aqueous phase do was maintained at 213 12 μmol l and decreased in the diffusive boundary layer above the surface sediment the oxygen penetration was measured up to a depth of 2500 μm for all measuring points the strong decrease in do in the surface sediment indicated that there was significant oxygen consumption within the sediment likely attributed to a combination of microbial aerobic respiration and the oxygen demand for reactive reduced elements and substances higashino et al 2004 hondzo and steinberger 2008 in addition as shown in the fig 2 a the oxygen concentrations across the swi in the biotic control tests without the addition of mnps in the fresh sediments were stable during the 5 d experimental period however the presence of mnps 5 mg l resulted in remarkable differences in the oxygen concentration profiles in fresh sediment systems fig 2b and c after the addition of ntio2 for 24 h the o2 concentration decreased slower with sediment depth and this trend continued subsequently the oxygen concentration distribution along the swi remained unchanged for 120 h as a result the oxygen penetration increased to 3300 μm which was much higher than the measured values 2500 μm before exposure concomitantly a decrease in the oxygen flux 22 7 at the swi was observed for ntio2 treatments table s3 p 0 05 which was estimated from the steady state oxygen profiles according to the first fick s law of diffusion regarding nceo2 treatments a deeper o2 penetration was also observed in the treated sediments compared to that in the control sediments increasing from 2000 μm to 2800 μm moreover the profiles measured after exposure for 24 and 120 h were almost identical clearly demonstrating that nceo2 inhibited oxygen flux across the swi within 24 h in addition no significant changes in oxygen profiles were observed for the abiotic np treatments fig 3 tio2 and ceo2 nps added to autoclaved sediment systems indicating that the addition of nps did not affect the chemical consumption of oxygen within the sediment combining the results from the biotic and abiotic tests we can conclude that the added mnps exhibit nano toxicity to the benthic microbial communities and significantly inhibit the microbial consumption of oxygen within the sediment moreover the acute toxicity on the sediment microbial communities resulting from exposure to nceo2 was stronger than that from ntio2 besides the oxygen flux at the swi significantly decreased by 32 2 after 5 day exposure to n ceo2 table s3 p 0 05 viret et al 2006 found that the oxygen distribution and flux across the swi were significantly affected by the high concentrations of zn and ni 20 and 60 mg l in this study the vertical distribution of oxygen consumption rates was calculated using the numerical procedure profile suggested by berg et al 1998 which has been used to interpret oxygen concentration measure in sediments nakamura et al 2004 viret et al 2006 in fig 4 the measured microprofiles of do are given together with the calculated oxygen profiles which fit the measured data points perfectly along with the corresponding consumption rates significant aerobic respiration was observed at all depths inside the surface sediments and there were three identified oxygen consumption zones with different oxygen consumption rates fig 4 oxygen consumption in the control sediments without mnp addition was stable during the experimental period however a relevant environmental concentration 5 mg l of mnps strongly influenced the oxygen consumption at all depths of the sediment after exposure to mnps significant decreases in total oxygen consumption were observed in the sediments regardless of np type in particular exposure to mnps led to an obvious reduction in oxygen consumption in the top zone 0 1500 μm and slight increases in oxygen consumption were observed in the lower zone 2000 3000 μm corresponding to an increase in oxygen penetration these results suggested that the addition of mnps is likely to significantly influence the oxygen respiratory activity of the surficial sediments 3 3 effects of nps on total bacterial abundance and enzyme activities quantitative pcr probing for the 16s rrna gene was applied to investigate changes in total bacterial abundance in sediment after tio2 and ceo2 np exposure gene copies were normalized to the mass of surficial sediment used for the extraction of dna as shown in the fig s6 after a 5 d incubation slight increases in bacterial community densities were observed for the control and mnp treated sediments and the total copy numbers of bacterial 16s rrna genes were consistent across all samples and ranged from 11 65 109 to 13 4 109 per gram pairwise comparisons showed that there were no significant differences in the total bacterial abundance between the mnp treated and control samples p 0 05 indicating that tio2 or ceo2 np exposure had limited effects on sediment microbial biomass extracellular enzyme activity can be considered an indicator of metabolism in sediment four enzyme activities fda dha apa and ue in the sediment were determined at the end of experiments and the results are shown in fig s7 no significant differences in fda and apa activities were observed for both tio2 and ceo2 np treatments when comparted to control levels p 0 05 meanwhile ceo2 np exposure resulted in slightly reduced dha activity after 5 d of treatment p 0 05 and significantly decreased ue activity in the sediment p 0 05 these results indicated that similar to that observed for sediment bacterial community density tio2 np treatment has finite effects on enzyme activities however exposure to ceo2 nps might affect the nitrogen cycles in the sediments 3 4 effects of mnps on bacterial community structure after a 5 d exposure sediment samples in all treatment groups were collected and subjected to illumina miseq high throughput sequencing after filtering 272764 quality sequences were obtained for the nine analyzed samples with a range of 22981 36472 sequences per community subsequently the data were subsampled to 13876 sequences per sample to avoid biases related to unequal numbers of sequences as shown in table s4 the excellent coverage of otus 94 from all sediment samples suggested that most microbial species were detected in all samples the simpson shannon diversity index was used as an estimator of alpha diversity as it is a robust metric for large 16s rrna gene data sets moore et al 2016 as shown in table s4 the presence of mnps significantly increased the alpha diversity of the microbial communities of the sediments after a 5 d exposure p 0 05 taxonomic classification revealed significant differences in community composition between the mnp treatment groups and controls as shown in fig 5 a the bacterial communities in all sediment samples were mainly assigned to 13 phyla abundance 1 the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria accounting for 43 2 55 4 of species followed by bacteroidetes and chloroflexi which comprised 10 0 14 8 and 5 5 11 3 respectively at the phylum level bacterial communities in the controls and mnp treated samples presented similar diversity but different abundances when the phylum abundance data set from all sediment samples was analyzed by pca ordination the bacterial communities in the mnp treatment groups were separated from control samples indicating that the addition of mnps altered the bacterial community fig 5b approximately 95 6 of the total variance was explained by the first two axes with pc1 and pc2 explaining 86 2 and 9 4 of the total variance respectively the abundance of proteobacteria was the main factor contributing to differences in the bacterial community structure between the mnp treated and control sediments t test p 0 05 table s5 the difference between the control and ntio2 treatment groups was mainly caused by the abundance of nitrospirae and that of chloroflexi accounted for differences between the controls and nceo2 treatment groups t test p 0 05 these results suggested that a 5 d exposure to mnps significantly changed the bacterial community structure which might negatively affect biogeochemical activities 4 discussion 4 1 fate of mnps in microcosms once released into the environment mnps can undergo distinct physicochemical transformations including aggregation disaggregation oxidation reduction reactions complexation and dissolution which will affect their fate and toxicity bour et al 2015 joo and zhao 2017 in this study most of the added mnps settled in the water column within 24 h through aggregation and sedimentation fig 1 realistically when released into the natural environment mnps tend to homo and hetero aggregate and accumulate on the sediment marie et al 2014 miao et al 2017 afterwards the migration of nanoparticles in the surface sediment might be limited thus it might difficult for transmission to occur into deep layer sediments through the diffusion in interstitial water due to mnp hetero aggregation with sediment particles bradford et al 2009 cross et al 2014 marie et al 2014 consequently most of the introduced mnps up to 85 were found in the surficial sediment 5 mm after 5 d of exposure therefore the limited penetration of mnps into sediments makes them bioaccessible to those microbial organisms living within the surface layer of sediments metabolically active layer colman et al 2012 cross et al 2014 ozaki et al 2016 in addition the bioavailability and potential toxicity of mnps are strongly related to the forms in which they exist and the type of chemical ligands with which they bind bao et al 2016 bour et al 2015 mnps are likely to transform their chemical speciation through both biotic and abiotic processes inside the surface sediment bao et al 2016 cross et al 2014 tangaa et al 2016 dissolution has been deemed an essential transformation process of mnps such as ag zno and cuo nps in aquatic environments joo and zhao 2017 and the dissolved metal ions are toxic to various freshwater organisms and contribute partially to the nanotoxicity of mnps cross et al 2014 hou et al 2014 besides sulfidation was found to be an important process for mnps occurring in the presence of sulfide avs particularly in the case of ag nps which potentially leads to a decreased dissolution rate and mobility and influences its nano toxicity to organisms khaksar et al 2014 tangaa et al 2016 in this study the fraction of dissolved tio2 and ceo2 nps in the interstitial water was below 5 throughout the experimental period in addition the avs concentrations were shown to be maintained at 5 36 1 03 μmol g dry weight for all np treatments as well as the control sediment during the 5 d exposure these results suggested that there was no significant dissolution or sulfidation of tio2 and ceo2 in sediments likely due to the inert surfaces of these nps gardea torresdey et al 2014 joo and zhao 2017 moreover previous studies have demonstrated that no reduction of ceiv to ceiii occurred in the surficial sediments tella et al 2015 and no significant transformation of tio2 in soils despite the complex systems pachapur et al 2016 however tio2 and ceo2 nps were shown to undergo surface transformations through oxidation under uv irradiation mitrano et al 2015 therefore further investigations should be performed to study the transformation mechanisms and kinetics of mnps in natural freshwater systems 4 2 effects of mnps on the metabolic activity of surficial sediment microbial communities systematic research on the potential impacts of mnps on benthic microbial communities is crucial to evaluate the negative effects and the fate of the mnps in aquatic environments recent studies have revealed that mnps such as ag tio2 and ceo2 nps can be toxic to benthic microbial communities bour et al 2015 joo and zhao 2017 for example exposure to ag nps was found to have minor or no negative impact on the metabolic function echavarri bravo et al 2015 enzymatic activity colman et al 2012 or the microbial community structure in sediment systems bao et al 2016 bradford et al 2009 moore et al 2016 in contrast environmentally relevant concentrations of ceo2 nps 1 mg l changed the bacterial community diversity and functions of freshwater ecosystems bour et al 2016 in the present study the effects of mnps on the metabolic activity of surficial sediment microbial communities were studied using oxygen microelectrodes enzyme activity measurements and high throughput sequencing analyses the gradient of oxygen concentrations within the swi changed significantly within the mnp tio2 and ceo2 treatment systems with a slow decrease in oxygen concentration with increasing sediment depths oxygen penetration in sediments was significantly increased fig 2 and a significant inhibition of oxygen consumption and oxygen flux in surface sediment 0 3 mm were observed in sediments oxygen consumption can be attributed to microbial aerobic respiration and chemical oxidization of reduced elements and substances e g nh4 fe2 mn2 and s2 bryant et al 2010 higashino et al 2004 herein mnps had no obvious effect on chemical oxygen consumption in the sediment fig 3 and the biological oxygen consumption was significantly influenced by the presence of mnps figs 2 and 4 as confirmed from biotic and abiotic np treatment tests therefore the presence of mnps might negatively affect the microbial structure and metabolic activity in surficial sediment and subsequently affect the oxygen consumption in surficial sediment discussed as follows due to the low solubility of molecular oxygen in water and the oxygen diffusion pattern in sediment three zones specifically an oxidized zone a redox potential discontinuity zone and an anoxic zone tend to develop with time in sediment brune et al 2000 according to the need of the bacteria for oxygen there is a spatial shift in the microbial community composition in the vicinity of the oxic anoxic interface with aerobic bacteria mainly occurring at the oxic zone and anaerobic bacteria and facultative bacteria gathering at the anoxic zone brune et al 2000 noll et al 2005 in this study a 5 d exposure to mnps increased the bacterial diversity and significant altered the bacterial community structure in sediments fig 5 and tables s4 and 6 more specifically the presence of mnps reduced largely the total relative abundance of aerobic bacteria at the genus level with the reduction of methylotenera and cytophagceae uncultured accounting for the greatest proportion fig 6 similar effects were also observed for facultative bacteria with the reduction of cyanobacteria norank accounting for a greater proportion in contrast anaerobic bacteria exhibited the opposite trend and the relative abundance of these bacteria increased significantly after exposure with anaerolineaceae uncultured occupying the large proportion as a result the reduced abundance of aerobic microorganisms led to decreased aerobic respiration which might be responsible for the inhibited microbial oxygen consumption in the sediments previous studies have demonstrated that aerobic microorganisms can rapidly respond to physico chemical changes in the environment by changing their metabolic activity or their community structure alexandre et al 2004 noll et al 2005 viret et al 2006 found that the benthic oxygen consumption at the sediment surface was significantly inhibited by high concentrations of zinc and nickel and they inferred that this was due to downward migration of aerobic microorganisms the presence of uranium at ecologically relevant concentrations stimulated the oxygen consumption of multispecies biofilms which was attributed to the activation of adaptation and detoxification mechanisms and not to changes in bacterial diversity in biofilms krawczyk bärsch et al 2008 in addition some motile bacteria such as cyanobacteria sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfide oxidizing bacteria can respond to variations in environmental conditions by changing their distribution in sediments and mats alexandre et al 2004 haglund et al 2003 due to the complex environmental conditions the response mechanisms and the self adaption of benthic microbes should be further investigated to provide valuable information for understanding the negative effects of mnps on sediment systems 4 3 environmental implications in this study joint application of microelectrodes and high throughput sequencing was performed for the first time to assess the metabolic response of surficial sediment microbial communities to mnps in a controlled yet realistic system the composite observations show that the presence of mnps can influence the oxygen distribution across the swi by changing the benthic microbial community structure these results suggest the importance of microscale measurements for understanding the potential effects of mnps on microscale geochemical gradients such as do ph and orp moreover the biogeochemical cycling of many elements frequently occurs at the swi and is controlled by benthic microbial communities battin et al 2008 hondzo and steinberger 2008 the bactericidal effects of mnps might have negative consequences on ecosystem health impairing critical bacteria driven nutrient cycles e g nitrogen phosphorus or sulfur cycling and consequently the biodegradation of organic matter it has been reported that nzvi treatment affects the dissolved phosphorus exchange across the sediment water interface but does not influence the nitrate and nitrite concentration in the water column buchkowski et al 2016 the chronic agnp exposure influenced both the microbial functions and community structure in streams resulting in notable ecosystem consequences through impacts on litter decomposition and further biogeochemical processes tlili et al 2017 however the functions of the periphyton were able to acclimate to the fe2o3 nanoparticles exposure via self regulation of morphology species composition and diversity tang et al 2017 therefore further research is needed to study the effects of mnps on the biogeochemical functions along the sediment water interface in addition the long term response mechanism of benthic microbial communities should be addressed 5 conclusions combined use of do microelectrodes and high throughput sequencing analyses can provide comprehensive insights into the effects of mnps on the metabolic activity of microbial communities in freshwater sediment our conclusions include most of the introduced mnps up to 85 accumulated at the surficial sediment 5 mm after 5 d exposure regardless of np type the addition of 5 mg l mnps decreased the oxygen flux across the swi and inhibited the oxygen consumption of surficial sediment microbial communities mnp exposure increased the bacterial diversity and altered the bacterial community structure the suppressed abundance of aerobic bacteria methylotenera and cytophagceae uncultured and facultative bacteria cyanobacteria norank was responsible for the inhibition of

19844,the estimation of stormwater pollutant concentrations is a primary requirement of integrated urban water management in order to determine effective sampling strategies for estimating pollutant concentrations data from extensive field measurements at seven different catchments was used at all sites 1 min resolution continuous flow measurements as well as flow weighted samples were taken and analysed for total suspend solids tss total nitrogen tn and escherichia coli e coli for each of these parameters the data was used to calculate the event mean concentrations emcs for each event the measured site mean concentrations smcs were taken as the volume weighted average of these emcs for each parameter at each site 17 different sampling strategies including random and fixed strategies were tested to estimate smcs which were compared with the measured smcs the ratios of estimated measured smcs were further analysed to determine the most effective sampling strategies results indicate that the random sampling strategies were the most promising method in reproducing smcs for tss and tn while some fixed sampling strategies were better for estimating the smc of e coli the differences in taking one two or three random samples were small up to 20 for tss and 10 for tn and e coli indicating that there is little benefit in investing in collection of more than one sample per event if attempting to estimate the smc through monitoring of multiple events it was estimated that an average of 27 events across the studied catchments are needed for characterising smcs of tss with a 90 confidence interval ci width of 1 0 followed by e coli average 12 events and tn average 11 events the coefficient of variation of pollutant concentrations was linearly and significantly correlated to the 90 confidence interval ratio of the estimated measured smcs r2 0 49 p 0 01 as well as the number of events required to achieve certain accuracy and hence could be a promising surrogate for determining the sampling frequency needed to accurately estimate smcs of pollutants keywords stormwater site mean concentrations monitoring sampling strategies 1 introduction since the 1970s many studies have demonstrated the environmental impacts caused by polluted stormwater runoff such as urban water quality degradation and large lake or costal eutrophication e g jeng et al 2005 lewitus et al 2008 the estimation of pollutant concentrations loads derived from urban stormwater systems is an important requirement for sound urban water management for example it is required for adequate design of urban stormwater treatment systems assessment of pollution impact on receiving water bodies or stormwater model development and assessment overton and meadows 2013 daly et al 2014 understanding of stormwater runoff pollutant levels is indeed very valuable for setting sound targets for environmental management in urban areas the event mean concentration emc and site mean concentration smc are two common approaches to reporting the concentration of pollutants in urban stormwater runoff emc is the total mass of the pollutant in a particular runoff event divided by the total volume of runoff during that event the smc is the total load of a pollutant divided by the total runoff volume for a given period of time e g one or more years and is calculated using emcs and event volumes recorded over a number of runoff events wef and asce 1998 if the smc is known for a pollutant the long term discharge load of the pollutant is simply estimated by multiplying it by the total runoff volume that can be often modelled or measured this approach is widely used in practice gromaire et al 2002 although it is still not clear how to accurately determine the smc mourad et al 2005 as discussed below to assess the emc two approaches are often used i random grab sampling during events often limited to one or only a few per event and 2 flow weighted or time weighted sampling resulting in creating a composite sample from sub samples schiff 1996 law et al 2008 random grab sampling is the easiest method usepa 2002 yet it can introduce high variability and bias e g samples taken at the start of an event or during very intense periods of the event are usually more polluted than samples taken towards the end of or during low intensity periods of the same event grab sampling requires a crew to be sent out for collecting samples and is feasible only if the crew is located near the monitoring area continuous auto sampling and sampling using flow weightings is often considered the most robust lee et al 2007 but comes with additional costs and can sometimes be problematic due to the complex installations that are inevitably associated with automatic sampling equipment automatic sampling is also considered unsuitable for some pollutants such as ph oil and grease due to the need to analyse samples within a short timeframe after collection khan et al 2006 gulliver and anderson 2007 in general automatic sampling is not widely practiced in industry and municipalities although it is very likely the best method available and the most frequently used by researchers nonetheless the extensive stormwater runoff monitoring campaigns carried out since the 1980s across the world usepa 1983 duncan 1999 zgheib et al 2012 have all used different methods and protocols offering very little consistency and comparability schiff 1996 leecaster et al 2002 this is mainly due to the lack of agreed protocols on how to monitor stormwater there are a limited number of studies on stormwater monitoring strategies kronvang and bruhn 1996 leecaster et al 2002 lee et al 2007 harmel et al 2010 madarang and kang 2013 leecaster et al 2002 recommended that sampling seven storms annually was the most efficient method for obtaining small confidence intervals amount of datable trend is 10 for annual average total suspended solids tss concentrations the same study also found that taking 12 flow weighted samples can most effectively characterize single storms while the simple random sampling of all storms or medium and large stormwater events resulted in the least bias in estimating annual tss mass emissions and concentrations leecaster et al 2002 madarang and kang 2013 found that 12 storms were required to estimate annual tss loads using random methods and monitoring with equal numbers of storms from the wet and dry seasons best estimated annual loads with median relative error being 0 22 1 42 both studies however used data sets collected at one or two catchments over relatively short periods 2 years and for tss only lee et al 2007 evaluated several stormwater monitoring programs to identify high discharges and total maximum daily loads tmdls of pollutants using monitoring data sets of six different catchments for some of which over 10 years period existed results show that the required number of samples is related to the coefficient of variation of sampled pollutant concentrations this study however did not assess specific sampling strategies such as the number of storms to sample or the number of samples to take per event also very few studies have ever evaluated the influence of pollutant type on sampling strategies the question should be asked whether recommendations made for tss also hold for nutrients and microorganisms the lack of relevant studies may be due to the fact that large data sets of good quality are required for a number of different pollutants and catchment types to draw reliable conclusions since stormwater quality is highly variable both temporary and spatially this study aims to fill this gap and develop sound sampling strategies for estimation of site mean concentrations a range of common and important stormwater pollutants which represent three different pollutant behaviour types tss which measures the presence of particles and often is used as a surrogate for attached pollutants such as some heavy metals herngren et al 2005 total nitrogen tn which is highly soluble and behaves differently to tss taylor et al 2005 and escherichia coli e coli which is a microorganism and inherently behaves differently than the more conservative traditional pollutants the study uses large data sets collected at seven different catchments in melbourne over six years the specific objectives were to assess a total of 17 different strategies including random sampling and fixed sampling strategies for assessing smcs of tss tn and e coli estimate the number of samples and the number of events needed to reasonably represent smc for different pollutants and catchments and understand the correlation between the variability of the pollutants concentrations and the number of events required to

for each site e g 30 for tss and 16 for tn and e coli with 50 of monitored events having more than 10 samples it should be noted that while tss was available for all seven catchments tn and e coli was available for only 4 catchments table 2 the histogram of all the measured pollutants concentrations for different sites are presented in figs s1 s3 of the supplementary document all the samples were collected between 2002 and 2007 which allowed good representation of stormwater pollution over a long period 2 3 measured site mean concentrations smcs for each catchment the measured event mean

tested as presented in table 3 two main strategies of sampling were adopted for estimation of the smcs i random sampling and ii fixed sampling random sampling strategies included testing the accuracy of using just one two or three randomly selected samples within one event to represent that event this method is regarded as the simplest and least costly sampling strategy and therefore widely used in stormwater monitoring programs schiff 1996 law et al 2008 fixed sampling strategies were also tested which involved taking samples at prescribed periods after the event started and when flows reached prescribed values these strategies may require auto sampling equipment but are easier and less expensive to implement than collection of large numbers of samples needed for measurement of emcs to determine the accuracy of the random and fixed sampling strategies we compared the smcs that were estimated using these sampling strategies to the measured true smcs that were calculated using the entire collected water quality and quantity dataset as per section 2 3 in particular we employed bootstrapping which is an approach that can be used to randomly sample a dataset with replacement to determine measures of accuracy the precise details of this approach are outlined below 2 4 1 random sampling strategies for the random sampling strategies the pollutant smcs were estimated by randomly sampling with replacement 10 000 times for n number of samples n 1 to 3 and p number of events p 1 2 3 n n total number of events initially p events were chosen from the n available and within each of these p events n water quality samples were randomly chosen these samples together with the measured flow data were used to calculate the p event mean concentrations the emcs and measured event volumes for the p events were then used to estimate a smc this process was repeated 10 000 times for each n and each p such that if the site and pollutant in question had 33 monitored events i e n 33 then 330 000 smc estimates would be produced it is important to note that the within event sampling for when n 2 or 3 was applied without replacement so that we did not take the same water quality sample from the same event twice however for the next time that event was randomly chosen the samples were replaced then the estimated smcs according the random sampling strategies were compared with the measured smcs calculated using all the observed data see section 2 3 2 4 2 fixed sampling strategies these sampling strategies are more systematic where samples are taken from an event at fixed times or after certain flows e g 1 month ari flow had been exceeded the first tested fixed sampling strategy table 3 was to take samples at 30 min after the storm started while the next was to take two samples at 30 and 60 min from the start three other strategies were then tested where one sample is taken at the exceedance of a certain flow rate 1 month ari 2 month ari and 3 months ari table 3 where ari stands for average recurrence interval sampling strategies were also simulated by taking a sample only after the flow exceeded the three flow rates plus a multiplier of the time of concentration tc three values of y were tested 0 5 1 and 2 table 3 similar to section 2 4 1 randomised sampling methods were also adopted for the fixed sampling strategies first p events p 1 2 3 n were randomly sampled from the n available for that site and pollutant within each of these p events the fixed samples were extracted e g the sample taken closest to 30 mins post event start and used to estimate the event mean concentration for that event the emc estimates and the measured event volumes of the p events were then used to estimate the smc this process was repeated 10 000 times or until all possible combinations were achieved then the estimated smcs were compared to the measured smcs which were based on all of the observed data see section 2 3 2 5 data analysis the strategies for random and fixed sampling were evaluated by calculating the ratio between the estimated by each of the 10 000 realisations of the 17 tested strategies and the measured smc calculated as per section 2 3 to compare the strategies the box plots of the estimated measured smc ratios were constructed for each of the 17 methods and each of the three pollutants using i results from all catchments i e 7 points for each box for tss 4 for tn and e coli and ii results from one catchment only points in each box plot equal to the total number of events in that site to examine the variability between the sites to explore the number of events needed for estimation of the smcs the 90th percentile confidence intervals ci i e from 5th percentile to 95th percentile of the sample distribution of the predicated measured smc ratios were plotted against the number of events for different strategies for all catchments separately as the number of events monitored across different sites and pollutants varied considerably from 16 to 51 events table 2 we also explored whether the total number of monitored events had an influence on the outcomes of the above analysis this was done by comparing the 90th percentile ci plots using the full number of monitored events and a sub set of these events e g 17 events were randomly selected from the 49 tss events monitored at narre warren and 17 of the 23 tn events monitored at monash roof these events were then used to repeat the above analyses the results presented in fig s4 of the supplementary document show that the differences of 90 cis estimated from reduced numbers of events and full number of events were small 6 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 random vs fixed sampling strategies among all the 17 sampling strategies the random sampling strategies were most effective fig 1 the ratio between estimated and measured true smcs had the smallest estimated ranges ratio 0 78 1 10 for these strategies meaning that no matter which samples were selected randomly results were similar further for tss and tn these median ratios were close to 1 meaning that they were close to the measured smcs while somewhat under predicting the measured values of e coli the reason of e coli being underestimated might be due to the fact that it is log normally distributed i e more skewed compared with tss and tn fig s3 of the supplementary document and that the measured smcs were calculated using all observed data including highly skewed values while this is not the case for the random sampling strategies where there is the opportunity that the skewed numbers are excluded from being used to estimate the smc and since fig 1 reports average estimated smc the average value will reflect the mean not the median estimates of central tendency further illustrating this is the fact that tn has the least skewed dataset and hence had average estimated smcs much more evenly distributed around the measured smcs the results here are in agreement with similar studies for tss e g leecaster et al 2002 observed that simple random sampling resulted in the least bias in estimating the annual tss concentrations for all stormwater or medium and large storms while fletcher and deletic 2007 argued that long term pollutant loads or site mean concentration can be adequately captured by random timing of grab samples in addition to tss this study also provides important new insights into the sampling requirements for tn and e coli that have different behaviour the differences in taking one two or three random samples were small fig 1 indeed the average differences of estimated measured smcs were only up to 20 for tss and 10 for tn and e coli meaning that additional one or two samples per event do not bring new information for the estimation of smc and it could be hypothesised that independent information is given from different events but not or to a much lower extend from different samples within each event this suggests that to better estimate smcs the between event variations is more important to capture rather than the within event variations this aligns well with the fact that the average coefficients of variation of within event concentrations for tss tn e coli were 41 37 and 53 lower than that of between event concentrations across all the catchment respectively for the fixed sampling regimes however the estimated measured smc ratios were highly variable ratio 0 52 2 70 fig 1 and often overestimating the smcs especially for tss and tn indeed first flush phenomenon were observed for tss and tn bach et al 2010 which means the concentrations at the start of the events are often higher and hence these sampling methods which focus on the start of the events may overestimate smcs this was not found for e coli as it usually had no first flush bach et al 2010 the exceedance flow 1 or 2 or 3 2 tc strategies were closer to true smcs e g for tn the average ratios were 0 90 1 25 compared to other strategies with average ratios of 1 3 1 75 fig 1 this could be because these methods are less focussed on sampling at the early stage of the event and hence are less biased by first flushing in terms of catchment variability fig 2 shows that the range of estimated measured smc ratio is much wider for certain sites compared to others e g for tss range of richmond 0 6 2 4 monash roof 0 6 1 5 also the tendencies of over and under estimation of the predicted smc are different at the different sites and for different pollutants the site variability might also be linked to the way the fixed sampling strategies focus on start samples and that sites and pollutants which do exhibit a first flush will have a wider spread around 1 or more systematically offset for example e coli which does not have first flush has narrower distribution 0 7 1 8 and centred around 1 whereas tss has much wider distributions 0 5 2 7 and sometimes not even near 1 for the estimated measured smc ratio e g richmond catchment fig 2 again shows that random sampling strategies has less variability ratio 0 8 1 1 than fixed sampling strategies 0 6 2 7 3 2 effect of number of samples per event and number of events the effect of the number of events and the number of samples taken per event one to three which were used to characterise smcs within random sampling is shown in fig 3 for gilby road gr as an example refer to figs s5 s10 of the supplementary document for all other catchments table 4 presents results for all sites and pollutants for the random sampling strategy that used only one sample per event these results present the information on the 90 confidence interval ci of the estimated measured smcs using the random sampling strategies it is not surprising that as the number of events increased the 90 ci range decreased fig 3 table 4 however there are differences in how the event numbers impacted different pollutants the largest number of events were needed for characterising tss concentrations e g to achieve 90 ci width of 1 0 this was taken as most of the measurement uncertainties of pollutants in stormwater could be 50 mccarthy et al 2008 17 events should be taken at the gr site 17 39 events for all sites with average of 27 events this was followed by e coli i e 9 events at gr 9 15 for all site and an average of 12 and tn i e 6 events at gr 6 17 for all sites with an average of 11 table 4 figs s5 s10 of the supplementary document some stormwater pollutants are inherently more variable than others potentially due to their sources and whether they are associated with particulate matter makepeace et al 1995 duncan 1999 göbel et al 2007 the differences observed between different catchments could also be linked to pollutant variability e g stormwater runoff from trafficked areas with high density generally have higher variability of tss concentrations 66 937 mg l than that from roofs 13 120 mg l due to the impact of traffic göbel et al 2007 thus influencing the number of samples required to achieve a given level of sampling precision for each site fig 3 also indicates that taking more than one sample randomly from each event did not significantly reduce the 90th percentile ci which further confirms the analysis in fig 1 to further explore the impact of pollutant concentration variability on the results fig 4 plots the relationship between the coefficient of variation cv of the pollutant concentrations and a 90 ci estimated measured smc ratio as well as the number of events needed to achieve a 90 ci width of 1 0 for tss tn and e coli for one random sampling strategy at all seven sites it can be seen that the cv was linearly and significantly correlated to 90 confidence interval ratio p 0 01 r2 0 59 as well as the number of events needed to achieve 90 ci width of 1 0 p 0 01 r2 0 64 this supports the notion that the variability of different pollutant concentrations correlates to the number of samples events needed for estimating smcs for tss as noted by lee et al 2007 who suggested that the required number of samples was positively related to the cv of the pollutants these results imply that the cv could be a useful surrogate for determining the number of events needed to estimate the pollutant concentrations for different sites indeed as the conclusion holds for three very different types of pollutants i e tss tn and e coli our finding fig 4 right can be further applied to other stormwater pollutants with known cv values for estimating the rough number of events to get smc concentrations with certain accuracy e g 90 ci width of 1 0 4 conclusions effective and cost efficient sampling methods are important for determining stormwater pollutant site mean concentrations smcs which in turn is a requirement for effective stormwater management this study evaluated various random and fixed sampling strategies for the smcs of tss tn and e coli for seven different catchments the main findings were random sampling strategies could reproduce smcs especially for tss and tn with the average of the estimated measured smcs ratio of the studied catchments being the range of 0 78 1 1 for random sampling strategies one random sample per event is enough instead of multiple samples per event as the advantage of taking more than one random sample was outweighed by the need for capturing between event variability rather than within event variations the average difference between one random sample per event and three random samples per event was up to 20 for tss and 10 for tn and e coli the largest number of events are needed for characterising smcs of tss 17 39 events to achieve 90 ci width of 1 0 average 27 followed by e coli 9 15 events average 12 with fewer events needed for tn 6 17 events average 11 the coefficient of variation cv of the pollutant concentrations were linearly and significantly correlated to the 90 confidence interval ratio of the estimated measured smcs as well as the number of events needed to get reasonable accuracy of pollutant concentrations indicating that pollutant variability measures such as cv could be a promising surrogate for estimating

19844,the estimation of stormwater pollutant concentrations is a primary requirement of integrated urban water management in order to determine effective sampling strategies for estimating pollutant concentrations data from extensive field measurements at seven different catchments was used at all sites 1 min resolution continuous flow measurements as well as flow weighted samples were taken and analysed for total suspend solids tss total nitrogen tn and escherichia coli e coli for each of these parameters the data was used to calculate the event mean concentrations emcs for each event the measured site mean concentrations smcs were taken as the volume weighted average of these emcs for each parameter at each site 17 different sampling strategies including random and fixed strategies were tested to estimate smcs which were compared with the measured smcs the ratios of estimated measured smcs were further analysed to determine the most effective sampling strategies results indicate that the random sampling strategies were the most promising method in reproducing smcs for tss and tn while some fixed sampling strategies were better for estimating the smc of e coli the differences in taking one two or three random samples were small up to 20 for tss and 10 for tn and e coli indicating that there is little benefit in investing in collection of more than one sample per event if attempting to estimate the smc through monitoring of multiple events it was estimated that an average of 27 events across the studied catchments are needed for characterising smcs of tss with a 90 confidence interval ci width of 1 0 followed by e coli average 12 events and tn average 11 events the coefficient of variation of pollutant concentrations was linearly and significantly correlated to the 90 confidence interval ratio of the estimated measured smcs r2 0 49 p 0 01 as well as the number of events required to achieve certain accuracy and hence could be a promising surrogate for determining the sampling frequency needed to accurately estimate smcs of pollutants keywords stormwater site mean concentrations monitoring sampling strategies 1 introduction since the 1970s many studies have demonstrated the environmental impacts caused by polluted stormwater runoff such as urban water quality degradation and large lake or costal eutrophication e g jeng et al 2005 lewitus et al 2008 the estimation of pollutant concentrations loads derived from urban stormwater systems is an important requirement for sound urban water management for example it is required for adequate design of urban stormwater treatment systems assessment of pollution impact on receiving water bodies or stormwater model development and assessment overton and meadows 2013 daly et al 2014 understanding of stormwater runoff pollutant levels is indeed very valuable for setting sound targets for environmental management in urban areas the event mean concentration emc and site mean concentration smc are two common approaches to reporting the concentration of pollutants in urban stormwater runoff emc is the total mass of the pollutant in a particular runoff event divided by the total volume of runoff during that event the smc is the total load of a pollutant divided by the total runoff volume for a given period of time e g one or more years and is calculated using emcs and event volumes recorded over a number of runoff events wef and asce 1998 if the smc is known for a pollutant the long term discharge load of the pollutant is simply estimated by multiplying it by the total runoff volume that can be often modelled or measured this approach is widely used in practice gromaire et al 2002 although it is still not clear how to accurately determine the smc mourad et al 2005 as discussed below to assess the emc two approaches are often used i random grab sampling during events often limited to one or only a few per event and 2 flow weighted or time weighted sampling resulting in creating a composite sample from sub samples schiff 1996 law et al 2008 random grab sampling is the easiest method usepa 2002 yet it can introduce high variability and bias e g samples taken at the start of an event or during very intense periods of the event are usually more polluted than samples taken towards the end of or during low intensity periods of the same event grab sampling requires a crew to be sent out for collecting samples and is feasible only if the crew is located near the monitoring area continuous auto sampling and sampling using flow weightings is often considered the most robust lee et al 2007 but comes with additional costs and can sometimes be problematic due to the complex installations that are inevitably associated with automatic sampling equipment automatic sampling is also considered unsuitable for some pollutants such as ph oil and grease due to the need to analyse samples within a short timeframe after collection khan et al 2006 gulliver and anderson 2007 in general automatic sampling is not widely practiced in industry and municipalities although it is very likely the best method available and the most frequently used by researchers nonetheless the extensive stormwater runoff monitoring campaigns carried out since the 1980s across the world usepa 1983 duncan 1999 zgheib et al 2012 have all used different methods and protocols offering very little consistency and comparability schiff 1996 leecaster et al 2002 this is mainly due to the lack of agreed protocols on how to monitor stormwater there are a limited number of studies on stormwater monitoring strategies kronvang and bruhn 1996 leecaster et al 2002 lee et al 2007 harmel et al 2010 madarang and kang 2013 leecaster et al 2002 recommended that sampling seven storms annually was the most efficient method for obtaining small confidence intervals amount of datable trend is 10 for annual average total suspended solids tss concentrations the same study also found that taking 12 flow weighted samples can most effectively characterize single storms while the simple random sampling of all storms or medium and large stormwater events resulted in the least bias in estimating annual tss mass emissions and concentrations leecaster et al 2002 madarang and kang 2013 found that 12 storms were required to estimate annual tss loads using random methods and monitoring with equal numbers of storms from the wet and dry seasons best estimated annual loads with median relative error being 0 22 1 42 both studies however used data sets collected at one or two catchments over relatively short periods 2 years and for tss only lee et al 2007 evaluated several stormwater monitoring programs to identify high discharges and total maximum daily loads tmdls of pollutants using monitoring data sets of six different catchments for some of which over 10 years period existed results show that the required number of samples is related to the coefficient of variation of sampled pollutant concentrations this study however did not assess specific sampling strategies such as the number of storms to sample or the number of samples to take per event also very few studies have ever evaluated the influence of pollutant type on sampling strategies the question should be asked whether recommendations made for tss also hold for nutrients and microorganisms the lack of relevant studies may be due to the fact that large data sets of good quality are required for a number of different pollutants and catchment types to draw reliable conclusions since stormwater

determine measures of accuracy the precise details of this approach are outlined below 2 4 1 random sampling strategies for the random sampling strategies the pollutant smcs were estimated by randomly

the measured values of e coli the reason of e coli being underestimated might be due to the fact that it is log normally distributed i e more skewed compared with tss and tn fig s3 of the supplementary document and that the measured smcs were calculated using all observed data including highly skewed values while this is not the case for the random sampling strategies where there is the opportunity that the skewed numbers are excluded from being used to estimate the smc and since fig 1 reports average estimated smc the average value will reflect the mean not the median estimates of central tendency further illustrating this is the fact that tn has the least skewed dataset and hence had average estimated smcs much more evenly distributed around the measured smcs the results here are in agreement with similar studies for tss e g leecaster et al 2002 observed that simple random sampling resulted in the least bias in estimating the annual tss concentrations for all stormwater or medium and large storms while fletcher and deletic 2007 argued that long term pollutant loads or site mean concentration can be adequately captured by random timing of grab samples in addition to tss this study also provides important new insights into the sampling requirements for tn and e coli that have different behaviour the differences in taking one two or three random samples were small fig 1 indeed the average differences of estimated measured smcs were only up to 20 for tss and 10 for tn and e coli meaning that additional one or two samples per event do not bring new information for the estimation of smc and it could be hypothesised that independent information is given from different events but not or to a much lower extend from different samples within each event this suggests that to better estimate smcs the between event variations is more important to capture rather than the within event variations this aligns well with the fact that the average coefficients of variation of within event concentrations for tss tn e coli were 41 37 and 53 lower than that of between event concentrations across all the catchment respectively for the fixed sampling regimes however the estimated measured smc ratios were highly variable ratio 0 52 2 70 fig 1 and often overestimating the smcs especially for tss and tn indeed first flush phenomenon were observed for tss and tn bach et al 2010 which means the concentrations at the start of the events are often higher and hence these sampling methods which focus on the start of the events may overestimate smcs this was not found for e coli as it usually had no first flush bach et al 2010 the exceedance flow 1 or 2 or 3 2 tc strategies were closer to true smcs e g for tn the average ratios were 0 90 1 25 compared to other strategies with average ratios of 1 3 1 75 fig 1 this could be because these methods are less focussed on sampling at the early stage of the event and hence are less biased by first flushing in terms of catchment variability fig 2 shows that the range of estimated measured smc ratio is much wider for certain sites compared to others e g for tss range of richmond 0 6 2 4 monash roof 0 6 1 5 also the tendencies of over and under estimation of the predicted smc are different at the different sites and for different pollutants the site variability might also be linked to the way the fixed sampling strategies focus on start samples and that sites and pollutants which do exhibit a first flush will have a wider spread around 1 or more systematically offset for example e coli which does not have first flush has narrower distribution 0 7 1 8 and centred around 1 whereas tss has much wider distributions 0 5 2 7 and sometimes not even near 1 for the estimated measured smc ratio e g richmond catchment fig 2 again shows that random sampling strategies has less variability ratio 0 8 1 1 than fixed sampling strategies 0 6 2 7 3 2 effect of number of samples per event and number of events the effect of the number of events and the number of samples taken per event one to three which were used to characterise smcs within random sampling is shown in fig 3 for gilby road gr as an example refer to figs s5 s10 of the supplementary document for all other catchments table 4 presents results for all sites and pollutants for the random sampling strategy that used only one sample per event these results present the information on the 90 confidence interval ci of the estimated measured smcs using the random sampling strategies it is not surprising that as the number of events increased the 90 ci range decreased fig 3 table 4 however there are differences in how the event numbers impacted different pollutants the largest number of events were needed for characterising tss concentrations e g to achieve 90 ci width of 1 0 this was taken as most of the measurement uncertainties of pollutants in stormwater could be 50 mccarthy et al 2008 17 events should be taken at the gr site 17 39 events for all sites with average of 27 events this was followed by e coli i e 9 events at gr 9 15 for all site and an average of 12 and tn i e 6 events at gr 6 17 for all sites with an average of 11 table 4 figs s5 s10 of the supplementary document some stormwater pollutants are inherently more variable than others potentially due to their sources and whether they are associated with particulate matter makepeace et al 1995 duncan 1999 göbel et al 2007 the differences observed between different catchments could also be linked to pollutant variability e g stormwater runoff from trafficked areas with high density generally have higher variability of tss concentrations 66 937 mg l than that from roofs 13 120 mg l due to the impact of traffic göbel et al 2007 thus influencing the number of samples required to achieve a given level of sampling precision for each site fig 3 also indicates that taking more than one sample randomly from each event did not significantly reduce the 90th percentile ci which further confirms the analysis in fig 1 to further explore the impact of pollutant concentration variability on the results fig 4 plots the relationship between the coefficient of variation cv of the pollutant concentrations and a 90 ci estimated measured smc ratio as well as the number of events needed to achieve a 90 ci width of 1 0 for tss tn and e coli for one random sampling strategy at all seven sites it can be seen that the cv was linearly and significantly correlated to 90 confidence interval ratio p 0 01 r2 0 59 as well as the number of events needed to achieve 90 ci width of 1 0 p 0 01 r2 0 64 this supports the notion that the variability of different pollutant concentrations correlates to the number of samples events needed for estimating smcs for tss as noted by lee et al 2007 who suggested that the required number of samples was positively related to the cv of the pollutants these results imply that the cv could be a useful surrogate for determining the number of events needed to estimate the pollutant concentrations for different sites indeed as the conclusion holds for three very different types of pollutants i e tss tn and e coli our finding fig 4 right can be further applied to other stormwater pollutants with known cv values for estimating the rough number of events to get smc concentrations with certain accuracy e g 90 ci width of 1 0 4 conclusions effective and cost efficient sampling methods are important for determining stormwater pollutant site mean concentrations smcs which in turn is a requirement for effective stormwater management this study evaluated various random and fixed sampling strategies for the smcs of tss tn and e coli for seven different catchments the main findings were random sampling strategies could reproduce smcs especially for tss and tn with the average of the estimated measured smcs ratio of the studied catchments being the range of 0 78 1 1 for random sampling strategies one random sample per event is enough instead of multiple samples per event as the advantage of taking more than one random sample was outweighed by the need for capturing between event variability rather than within event variations the average difference between one random sample per event and three random samples per event was up to 20 for tss and 10 for tn and e coli the largest number of events are needed for characterising smcs of tss 17 39 events to achieve 90 ci width of 1 0 average 27 followed by e coli 9 15 events average 12 with fewer events needed for tn 6 17 events average 11 the coefficient of variation cv of the pollutant concentrations were linearly and significantly correlated to the 90 confidence interval ratio of the estimated measured smcs as well as the number of events needed to get reasonable accuracy of pollutant concentrations indicating that pollutant variability measures such as cv could be a promising surrogate for estimating
