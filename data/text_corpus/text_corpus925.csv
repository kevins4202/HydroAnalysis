4625,when considering hydrological export pathways from drained pastoral fields the shallow groundwater underlying the artificial drainage system may fulfil an as important role as the artificial drainage system itself however the important split between artificial drainage and groundwater flows at a field site is usually unknown consequently the effects that the groundwater system s redox status may have on the forms and total amounts of nitrogen n exported from the site cannot be confidently assessed we addressed these deficiencies by investigating the export of various forms of n in the artificial drainage and the shallow groundwater beneath two dairy farming sites tatuanui waharoa within the piako river catchment in new zealand due to the very low hydraulic conductivity of the degraded peat in the saturated zone perched on a clay aquiclude no significant water or contaminants were exported at tatuanui via the unconfined shallow groundwater accordingly artificial drainage discharge into the receiving surface collector drain was the only export pathway for n at this site the sealed nature of the groundwater zone resulted in the accumulation of organic n and ammonium n in the peaty shallow saturated zone underlying the mineral soil in contrast the waharoa site featured a more mobile shallow groundwater system which on average conveyed approximately equal volumes of water offsite as the artificial drainage system nitrate no3 n was at both sites the predominant form of n 76 leached from the aerobic soil profile and discharged through the artificial drainage as the shallow groundwater was at both sites in a reduced redox state any no3 n leached from the rootzone into the saturated zone was consumed accordingly even the mobile shallow groundwater at waharoa did not convey significant no3 n the no3 n consumption in the reduced groundwater presumably occurred due to dissimilatory no3 n reduction concomitant increases in ammonium n concentrations with no organic material available for mineralisation in the saturated zone and microbial denitrification producing gaseous forms of n the no3 n reductions in the groundwater resulted in the average total n exports via the shallow groundwater pathway at the waharoa site being substantially lower 31 of the exported n than in the artificial drainage 69 this is despite both pathways exporting similar water volumes because of the no3 n consumption in the reduced shallow groundwater at waharoa over 98 of the n exported through this pathway was either as ammonium n or organic n keywords artificial

drainage system hansen et al 2013 2019a rozemeijer et al 2010a schilling and helmers 2008 skaggs and gilliam 1981 the contaminants exported through this groundwater pathway may discharge locally into the adjacent surface waterway bounding the drained area via lateral seepage rozemeijer et al 2010a skaggs and gilliam 1981 skaggs 1999 or move vertically deeper into a regional groundwater system and travel some distance away to the receiving surface water body of the groundwater system hansen et al 2019a ikenberry et al 2014 petersen et al 2020a skaggs et al 2010 surface runoff may be an important nitrogen n export pathway on poorly drained soils if artificial subsurface drainage is not present youssef et al 2010 however on flat sites with artificial subsurface drainage installed the importance of the surface runoff pathway will be substantially reduced armstrong and garwood 1991 contaminants with a high affinity for sorption onto soil particles e g ammonium nh4 n and organic n org n or those associated with particulates that are filterable by the soil matrix e g total phosphorus can be effectively held back by the soil matrix and are therefore less likely to be exported via leaching through the soil blann et al 2009 gramlich et al 2018 skaggs et al 2009 in contrast nitrate nitrogen no3 n is rapidly and conservatively transported under aerobic conditions and is a major n contaminant exported in aerobic subsurface pathways n discharges from artificially drained agricultural lands are well recognised as a major threat to freshwater quality for drinking recreational use

probability the annual average no3 n drainage concentration in a site year would exceed 10 mg no3 n l us environmental protection agency s maximum contaminant level for drinking water the average export of n to the mississippi river basin in the us from all agricultural land is estimated to be approximately 2 3 kg n ha yr however artificially subsurface drained land can contribute between 2 and 100 kg n ha yr blann et al 2009 nitrogen loads from artificially drained lands have also been identified as a significant contributor to the large eutrophication problems in many european waterways hansen et al 2019b withers et al 2014 when investigating contaminants in the shallow groundwater under agricultural land it is difficult to accurately ascertain their origin smith et al 2018

feasible that contaminants have been generated within the saturated zone e g through mineralisation of resident organic matter petersen et al 2020b pijlman et al 2020 therefore contaminants measured

1992 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 stenger et al 2018 the importance of the groundwater as a hydrological pathway from artificially drained land to streams has been comprehensively investigated at catchment scales using a wide range of numerical analytical and simulation models hansen et al 2011 hansen et al 2019a petersen et al 2020a rozemeijer et al 2010b schilling et al 2015 2019 schilling and helmers 2008 schilling and jones 2019 additionally numerous studies have investigated surface water n exports from artificially drained catchments to determine relevant flow paths and sources of the n loads arenas amado et al 2017 ikenberry et al 2014 kennedy et al 2012 lemke et al 2011 mellander et al 2012 tomer et al 2010 van der velde et al 2010 williams et al 2015 n exports through artificial subsurface drainage and or surface runoff have also been measured in many field scale studies however only few field scale studies have explicitly measured the groundwater exports concurrently with artificial drainage exports and included all relevant forms of n these studies directly relevant to our work include a 0 9 ha field study where artificial drainage flows were physically separated and captured in large tanks and the horizontal groundwater seepage collected into constructed reservoirs within the surface drain at the edge of the drained field rozemeijer et al 2010a this field experimental facility was later used to investigate the effects on n export flow paths when the water table was raised employing water table management rozemeijer et al 2016 schilling et al 2020 measured water table levels and fully mixed no3 n concentrations in the groundwater under artificially drained fields and used this data with the groundwater model modflow to estimate the steady state water exports in the groundwater to the receiving stream the groundwater flux estimates were combined with the measured no3 n concentrations and compared with n exports from the artificial drainage in iowa usa comprehensive n budgets for artificial drainage and groundwater n components were reported by sunohara et al 2014 when investigating the effects of raised water table with drainage management on the n exports in cropped fields of 2 to 7 ha in size in eastern canada groundwater n concentrations and levels measured in piezometers were used with the dupuit forcheimer and darcy equations to estimate horizontal and vertical groundwater exports respectively n loads in these components were then estimated using the fully mixed n concentrations measured in the groundwater piezometers to extend the level of understanding of the n dynamics in the shallow groundwater export pathway we investigated two contrasting field sites to address the following four objectives i to determine at the field scale the hydrological exports in subsurface artificial drainage and the shallow groundwater underneath ii to quantify the annual exports of various forms of n in these two pathways at the field scale and elucidate their drivers iii to ascertain how groundwater redox conditions affect concentrations of different forms of n in the shallow groundwater iv building on these results to identify mitigation options that can reduce nitrogen exports from artificially subsurface drained land 2 methods 2 1 field sites to investigate the hydrological and contaminant export pathways two artificially drained sites within the piako river catchment on the north island of new zealand were monitored over the 2016 and 2017 drainage seasons the piako river catchment forms a major component of the hauraki plains a fertile alluvial plain with large areas of peat and poorly drained soils the rivers crossing the plains discharge into the firth of thames the tatuanui site is located close to morrinsville and the waharoa site is close to matamata fig 1 the relevant characteristics of the artificial subsurface drainage systems and farm management at the two sites are summarised in table 1 the artificial subsurface drainage system at both sites discharges into a surface drain part of a larger drainage collector network discharging into the piako river the groundwater outflow at the coast into the firth of thames is estimated to be only 2 5 of the total hydrological discharge from the hauraki plains which is dominated by surface discharges white et al 2018 whey permeate used as a fertiliser at waharoa is a liquid by product of cheese manufacturing with a dry matter content of 14 to 16 and typically 75 to 85 of this is lactose a soluble disaccharide all n present is as org n with a concentration of approximately 1080 mg n l and a typical sodium concentration of 1130 mg l orion haulage pers comm dec 2016 2 2 subsoil coring and redox identification to gain a better understanding of the subsurface materials and the hydrological pathways operating intact cores 84 mm external dia 1 m long were collected using a track mounted geoprobe soil corer 540mt kansas usa at tatuanui this was done to a depth of 12 m and at waharoa to approximately 2 8 m depth as the saturated sandy subsurface materials caused the borehole to collapse at greater depth when the core was removed the childs test red colour change was used on cores retrieved during well installation to identify where fe ii was present indicating reduced conditions childs 1981 2 3 drainage flow and rainfall measurement at both sites the combined subsurface drainage flows from all tile lines were routed through flow measurement flumes installed in the receiving surface drains the stage height in the measurement flume was monitored using a counter weighted float within a stilling well using a daa h 331 water level encoder niwa national institute of water and atmospheric research christchurch nz stage readings were made on a 5 minute interval with a 1 mm accuracy and converted to an instantaneous flowrate m3 s using a stage discharge relationship the area normalized drainage discharge was determined by dividing the cumulative volume m3 of artificial drainage recorded through the flume over the period being considered by the assumed area m2 contributing drainage flow to the flume the contributing drainage area was estimated from the total length of each drainage line the spacing between the drainage lines and the number of lines reducing the inherent uncertainty of the size of the contributing drainage area by hydrologically isolating the investigated blocks was not achievable within the project constraints rainfall at both sites was measured with a 200 mm diameter 0 2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge the rain gauge was calibrated twice in each drainage season to eliminate stock interference the rain gauges were installed at 1 8 m height thus correction was necessary for under capture due to wind effects sevruk 1982 the correction method followed yang et al 1998 by determining catch ratio factors based on daily wind speed at the installed gauge height data for this correction process was sourced from the three closest metrological sites niwa network numbers and names b75152 thames2 b75752 toenepi ews and c75241 firth of thames resulting monthly catch ratio correction factors not reported ranged from 91 in april to 88 in november at waharoa the drainage outlet became flooded in mid august 2017 due to extremely wet conditions causing water to back up and the measurement flume becoming inoperative assuming that the 2017 drainage season at waharoa finished at a similar date as the close by tatuanui site as observed in 2016 allowed the length of the 2017 drainage season and the rainfall within the drainage season to be estimated at waharoa the artificial drainage discharge for the period after the flume failure in 2017 was estimated based on a site specific relationship determined between measured event rainfall and measured drainage not presented an event was described by the time period from the start of rainfall in the first event until significant rainfall occurred in the subsequent event the relationship between the event rainfall and event drainage was well described by a linear relationship r2 0 86 2 4 flow split between different export pathways surface runoff could be excluded as significant export pathway at both sites due to the flat topography high soil infiltration rates which typically average 170 mm hr joe 1984 and the effective subsurface drainage system combined with the lack of any empirical evidence for surface runoff during our study the fraction of percolating water that bypasses the artificial drainage and discharges vertically into the groundwater is often referred to as either recharge into shallow groundwater or deep drainage as this component is spatially and temporally highly variable and difficult to defensibly measure over a sufficiently large representative area it can be estimated from a water balance analysis petersen et al 2020a rozemeijer et al 2010a this method is based on subtracting from the rainfall the measured artificial drainage evapotranspiration losses and any change in soil storage occurring over the period of calculation as it is expected that soil water contents at the onset of drainage in the autumn are essentially the same as when drainage ceases in the spring the change in soil water storage over the computational period can be assumed to be negligible the resulting simplified water balance equation used to determine the recharge to the shallow groundwater is described in eq 1 1 recharge to shallow gw rainfall actual et artificial drainage all in mm as the water balance is applied only over the winter drainage period when temperatures are low and soil water contents high actual evapotranspiration is assumed to be equal to potential evapotranspiration evapotranspiration data for both sites was obtained from the closest meteorological station holding the data niwa toenepi ews b75752 which is 9 2 km from the tatuanui site and 18 2 km from the waharoa site 2 5 artificial drainage n concentrations and exports using isco auto samplers drainage samples were collected for laboratory analysis after flow increments of 50 m3 in 2016 and 100 m3 in 2017 the sampling intervals represented approximately 1 2 mm of drainage over contributing areas in 2016 and 2 5 mm in 2017 preservative was used to ensure drainage samples collected did not degrade during the on average 10 day collection interval the average artificial drainage flow rate m3 hr between samplings was determined by dividing the drainage volume m3 by the time taken hrs between consecutive sample collections drainage samples were analysed for total n tn total oxidised n nitrite no2 n and no3 n reported as no3 n and nh4 n by the methods described in table 2 org n was determined by difference between tn and the sum of no3 n and nh4 n concentrations it was prohibitively expensive to analyse all 1028 samples collected for the full suite of laboratory analytes therefore samples were selected for analysis based on their location on the flow hydrograph and estimated no3 n concentration the no3 n estimates were derived from correlation between electrical conductivity and laboratory measured no3 n concentrations for each site and season not reported in total 39 of the waharoa samples n 432 and 54 from tatuanui n 596 were laboratory analysed concentrations in unanalysed samples were estimated using flow based linear interpolation n exports were determined from the sum of the products of flow volumes and contaminant concentrations over the drainage season the average annual flow weighted n concentrations mg n l were determined by dividing the total annual export n by the volume of annual drainage non parametric best fit lines with 95 confidence intervals of concentrations of various n fractions with the artificial drainage flow rate were generated using the loess function in r r version 3 6 1 stats package version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 2 6 groundwater characterstics and contaminant exports via groundwater shallow groundwater quality and continuous water levels were monitored via 50 mm internal diameter pvc wells fully slotted up to 0 3 m depth below ground level bgl at tatuanui two of the three wells were installed to 5 5 m bgl and the third to 9 6 m bgl at waharoa two 50 mm monitoring wells were installed to 2 8 m bgl at each site a vented pressure transducer odyssey christchurch new zealand was installed in one of the groundwater quality monitoring wells to provide continuous water table data additionally 20 mm internal diameter continuously slotted pvc wells were installed and monitored monthly to obtain information on groundwater levels direction and hydraulic gradient information were obtained using a contour package in gis software manifold net nine of these water level wells were installed at waharoa in three transects across the site and six wells in two transects installed at the more uniform site at tatuanui groundwater quality was sampled in depth specific increments using inflatable pneumatic packers holloway and waddell 2008 ratnam et al 2005 to isolate 0 34 m long sections of well casing well casings were installed using an interference push fit method to avoid the creation of an annular gap between the well casing and the ambient saturated zone deposits this method ensured groundwater samples were collected from the targeted depth only and not affected by preferential groundwater flow from different layers with higher hydraulic conductivity monitoring wells were sampled twice during 2017 july and october a low flow mini bladder pump max flow rate 60 ml min was used and field parameters were monitored in a surface flow cell to ensure that stabilisation criteria were achieved prior to groundwater sampling daughney et al 2006 field measurements included temperature ph dissolved oxygen and conductivity using a multi parameter instrument aquaprobe ap 2000 england the probe was pre calibrated prior to being field deployed groundwater samples were chilled and analysed at hill laboratories hamilton using the laboratory methods described in table 3 groundwater samples were also assessed for redox conditions using the criteria reported by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 with minor modifications for nz conditions by close et al 2016 as reported in table 4 the ksat mm day of the shallow groundwater were measured using replicated hydraulic slug tests bouwer and rice 1976 on the installed monitoring wells analysed using the methods of halford and kuniansky 2002 specific discharges m day were subsequently estimated using these ksat and the groundwater gradients m m at each site determined from measured groundwater levels across the sites and gis software manifold net annual loads of the various forms of n exported via the shallow groundwater were estimated as the product of the estimated hydrological volumes recharged into the shallow groundwater and representative groundwater concentrations at the drainage depth over the season the representative groundwater concentrations were determined from measurements in the shallow groundwater sampled in 2017 where the flow weighted annual artificial drainage concentrations were different between 2016 and 2017 i e org n the ratio of the annual flow weighted n concentrations was used to estimate 2016 org n concentrations in shallow groundwater this procedure takes account of the difference in leaching behaviour between the two years 3 results and discussion as the field sites studied represent two commonly occurring drainage situations it is feasible to draw conclusions from this study that are applicable to many other locations with artificial drainage installed the tatuanui field site represents a situation where the need for artificial drainage arises from a shallow water table seasonally rising into the soil zone nzaei 1988 skaggs 1999 vlotman et al 2004 in this instance the soil zone itself does not have any restricted permeability but the underlying groundwater system has a very low specific discharge in contrast artificial drainage at waharoa is necessitated by the physical characteristics of the soil zone bowler 1980 vlotman et al 2004 without artificial drainage a perched saturated zone would develop during periods of excess rain on a poorly permeable soil layer to facilitate the transfer of our results to other locations and situations we have discussed them in the following sections against the backdrop of these two generalised drainage situations 3 1 hydrological split between export pathways the application of the water balance eq 1 confirmed the immobile nature of the shallow groundwater at tatuanui with the measured artificial drainage discharge representing 79 and 86 of the measured rainfall for the 2016 and 2017 drainage seasons respectively table 5 the remaining component of the rainfall in each drainage season was just less than the estimated evapotranspiration indicating that a small amount of upward flux from the shallow groundwater was required to meet the full evaporative demand schilling et al 2020 also reported an effectively sealed shallow groundwater hydraulic export at the field scale where the average daily groundwater export only represented 1 3 of that exported from their site sunohara et al 2014 measured the average vertical seepage loss to groundwater over four years under cropping to be 14 of that exported from the site under conventional drainage and increased only slightly to 15 with controlled water table management rozemeijer et al 2010a who physically separated artificial drainage flows from groundwater seepages using tanks and reservoirs measured 20 of the hydrological discharge from the site occurring from shallow groundwater flow paths the waharoa rainfall recorded in both years was higher than at tatuanui table 5 but the measured artificial drainage discharge was lower accordingly groundwater recharge accounted for 46 of the rainfall during the 2016 drainage season and 39 during the part 2017 drainage season until flume failure based on the site specific event rainfall vs drainage relationship developed an additional 146 mm of artificial drainage is estimated to have occurred due to the 347 mm of rain that fell after flume failure consequentially for the complete 2017 drainage season the resulting percentage of rainfall contribution to groundwater was slightly reduced from 39 to 32 table 5 when the warmer spring period with higher evapotranspiration requirement was included the average percentage of rainfall discharging via artificial drainage over the two years was 40 5 at waharoa which is only slightly higher than the average 39 exported via the shallow groundwater pathway rozemeijer et al 2016 found that the groundwater discharge from their field site increased from 20 contribution under normal drainage management to an average of 39 over two winters when controlled drainage was implemented in a modelling study by hansen et al 2019a the artificial drainage network discharge and the groundwater export to the receiving stream along the edge of a drained catchment were also reported to be similar 36 and 38 of the winter rainfall respectively the average saturated hydraulic conductivity of the groundwater measured using slug tests at tatuanui was 2 8 mm hr table 6 which is representative of a impervious type aquifer material bear 1972 and typical of strongly or excessively degraded peat lennartz and liu 2019 as found in the subsurface at this site the hydraulic conductivity at waharoa was 10 times greater 28 4 mm day reflecting the conductivity of an semi impervious material of very fine sand type materials bear 1972 again typical of the fine alluvial sediment materials present at the site using the conductivity data and measured hydraulic gradients at each site resulting specific discharges are presented in table 6 these specific groundwater discharges concur with the hydrological analysis that the groundwater pathway did not represent a significant export pathway for water and contaminants in either drainage season at tatuanui 3 2 annual exports of n via artificial drainage at tatuanui in 2016 the 344 mm of artificial drainage exported 9 2 kg n ha yr of tn table 7 with the annual drainage volume increasing to 816 mm in 2017 the tn export increased flow proportionally to 22 1 kg n ha yr the percentages of no3 n nh4 n and org n in tn were nearly identical in both years with no3 n dominating at 76 of tn annual exports kg n ha yr of all forms of n at tatuanui were linearly related to the annual artificial area normalised drainage fig 2 this linear response indicates that the n exports at tatuanui are transport rather than supply limited which is considered typical for n in managed catchments with a long history of intensive land use basu et al 2010 moatar et al 2017 after flume failure at waharoa in mid august 2017 no3 n concentrations in the artificial drainage were measured twice when backing up of drainage water was not occurring using these measurements and the relationship between no3 n concentration in the artificial drainage with flow and time obtained prior to failure fig 4 no3 n concentrations in the artificial drainage were estimated for the period after flume failure this resulted in the estimation of 1 3 kg of no3 n ha table 7 being exported via artificial drainage after flume failure as nh4 n and org n artificial drainage concentrations were not correlated to sampling date or flow fig 3 these exports were determined based on flow proportional increases after flume failure table 7 the volume of artificial drainage at waharoa increased by 142 during the complete 2017 season as compared to 2016 table 7 concomitantly the export of no3 n increased from 8 7 to only 12 1 kg n ha yr which represents a lower increase of 39 as compared to the hydrological increase with the lower no3 n export in 2017 the relationship between annual tn and no3 n exports with annual artificial drainage volume at waharoa was non linear fig 2 lower no3 n concentrations in 2017 are also evident in fig 3b where at comparable drainage flow rates no3 n concentrations were approximately 1 to 2 mg n l lower than in 2016 depletion of soil no3 n levels resulting from continued low fertiliser inputs 57 kg n ha yr in 2016 51 kg n ha yr in 2017 was considered responsible for the lower no3 n exports at waharoa in 2017 this decreasing response in the no3 n exports in the artificial drainage from tatuanui demonstrates supply limited conditions concerning the no3 n export basu et al 2010 moatar et al 2017 annual nh4 n exports at both sites were linearly correlated to annual drainage volumes fig 2 indicating that nh4 n export was transport limited the org n export at waharoa increased from 1 4 kg n ha in 2016 to 5 1 kg n ha in 2017 this was a disproportionally higher increase of 270 as compared to the hydrological increase of 142 this result could be attributable to the high sodium concentration whey products applied which can cause swelling of clay minerals and deflocculation of soil colloids under wet conditions as experienced in 2017 nzi of chemists 2017 the annual export of no3 n via the artificial drainage in 2016 was higher at waharoa than at tatuanui in spite of a lower fertiliser n input however in 2017 when the no3 n export at waharoa became supply limited the no3 n exported per mm of drainage at both sites were of a similar magnitude the tatuanui site had consistently higher nh4 n concentrations in the artificial drainage than waharoa this result was probably a consequence of the nh4 n diffusing upward from immobile groundwater with higher nh4 n concentrations seibert et al 2009 waharoa had a higher org n export per mm of drainage than tatuanui in both years reflecting the use of the whey permeate fertiliser the difference in org n exported between sites increased in the wetter 2017 season possibly reflecting the effects of the high sodium content of the whey permeate on topsoil structure 3 3 no3 n concentrations in artificial drainage in subsurface drained sites with flat topography the contributing area to the artificial drainage export is considered static therefore change in the drainage flows can be attributed to a change in water table height saadat et al 2018 this result is consistent with our data where strong relationships average r2 0 88 between daily average water table height and daily drainage flows were determined at both sites data not shown the strong effect of water table dynamics on stream nitrate concentrations has been documented in several previous studies changing spatial connectivity between the stream and source areas has been identified as a key driver at the catchment scale molenat et al 2008 wriedt et al 2007 however the vertical connection between the nitrate enriched upper part of the soil zone and the drainage network has been shown to be the critical process at the field scale in flat landscapes liu et al 2020 seibert et al 2009 to address the objective of elucidating the drivers in the dynamics of the n exports the concentrations of n in the artificial drainage were investigated intra annually with flow synonymously discharge and time of year basu et al 2010 hashemi et al 2020 moatar et al 2017 liu et al 2020 this resulted in two particularly notable characteristics in the concentration discharge relationships demonstrated at both sites and both years firstly no3 n concentrations in the artificial drainage increased concomitantly with flow as also reported by liu et al 2020 and williams et al 2015 secondly no3 n concentrations decreased over the drainage seasons across the entire flow range consistent with grassland n drainage dynamics as reported by houlbrooke et al 2003 and monaghan et al 2016 these two characteristics are well demonstrated in fig 4 where no3 n concentrations are plotted against drainage flow rate with concentrations being colour coded for the time of year when sampled the purple to green sequence covers no3 n concentrations measured from march to july autumn to mid winter while the green to brown sequence shows concentrations measured from july to november mid winter to spring the non parametric line of best fit between flow and concentration is shown as a black solid line with the grey shading indicating the 95 confidence interval at the tatuanui site no3 n concentrations in 2016 tended to increase nearly linearly r2 0 35 over the entire observed flow range of up to 40 m3 hr fig 4a there were two distinct deviations from this overall pattern early in the drainage season when markedly higher no3 n concentrations were observed as flow rates exceeded approx 20 m3 hr in 2017 when drainage at tatuanui started much earlier in the year no3 n concentrations again increased disproportionally with flow during two high flow events peak flows approx 40 m3 hr early in the season purple and blue colours while our experimental setup was not designed to specifically investigate hysteresis effects these four high flow events had sufficient data points and variation in measured no3 n concentrations to clearly detect event scale hysteresis no3 n concentrations during these events showed a clockwise pattern with concentrations rising quickly with increasing flow a concentration maximum prior to reaching peak flow and then concentrations first dropping quickly and later more gradually with receding flow a type 1 hysteresis pattern hashemi et al 2020 a substantial degree of noise evident particularly in april 2017 is deemed to reflect the very dynamic rainfall patterns during these multi day high flow events at waharoa no3 n concentrations increased very strongly with increasing flow in the early part of the 2016 drainage season however depletion of the no3 n stock accumulated in the soil in autumn moir et al 2016 meant that there were only very moderate increases later in the season fig 4b with a distinct difference between drainage events in the earlier and later part of the season the loess line of best fit fails to describe the data adequately r2 0 26 with the earlier onset and higher flowrates in the earlier part of the 2017 waharoa drainage season the relationship between no3 n concentrations and flow was nearly linear until flow exceeded approximately 15 m3 hr after this flow threshold no3 n concentrations continued to increase at a higher linear rate overall the relationship between flow and concentration was relatively strong with an r2 0 61 the no3 n concentrations at waharoa in 2017 tended to be lower than in 2016 across the entire flow range fig 4 reflecting the smaller soil n reservoir at waharoa in 2017 event scale hysteresis was also evident in the earliest flow event in 2016 teal colour but corresponding data for 2017 is missing due to the flume failure triggered by the august 2017 storms while the shape and strength of the positive relationships between no3 n concentrations and drainage flow rate differ between the sites and years the underlying mechanism remains the same when substantial rainfall occurs onto an already wetted profile saturated conditions are created temporarily in the upper part of the soil profile as a substantial no3 n stock typically exists in the upper zone of permanent pasture soil the temporary saturation flushes out significant no3 n loads into the artificial drainage system causing the no3 n concentrations in the drainage to increase concomitantly with the increasing flow rates liu et al 2020 seibert et al 2009 the second characteristic demonstrated in the no3 n concentration data at both sites is that no3 n concentrations generally decreased over the winter drainage seasons this is particularly evident at the higher flow rates when the concentrations earlier in the season are substantially higher than later in the season this behaviour is well demonstrated at tatuanui in 2017 where the highest no3 n concentrations 8 mg n l were measured at flowrates above 30 m3 hr in april and may purple and blue as compared to concentrations below 2 mg n l at similar flow rates later in the season in november brown coloured decreasing no3 n concentrations in artificial drainage through the season at similar flow rates can be attributed to a declining soil no3 n reservoir the reservoir builds up in late summer and autumn when mineralisation of soil organic nitrogen is occurring but uptake by pasture and leaching from the soil zone are restricted by dry soil water conditions moir et al 2016 subsequently with consecutive leaching events through the winter the reservoir becomes depleted and the no3 n concentrations in drainage waters decrease concomitantly houlbrooke et al 2003 monaghan et al 2016 while dairy cows were grazed on the pasture over the winter drainage season the soil no3 n reservoir was apparently not replenished to the higher autumn levels this may reflect the continual leaching during winter and cooler soil temperatures causing lower mineralisation and nitrification rates additionally dairy cows grazed over winter are not lactating so feed intake is reduced by approximately 70 this could lower urinary n deposits onto the soil which are the major source of no3 n leached from grazed pasture di and cameron 2007 in summary while no3 n concentrations typically increased with flow the trend of declining concentrations with time meant that these relationships were variable between sites and time fig 4 3 4 nh4 n and org n concentrations in artifical drainage the concentration discharge relationship for nh4 n in the artificial drainage at tatuanui is presented in fig 5 a decreasing nh4 n concentrations with increasing flow rate reflect the diminishing contribution of groundwater derived nh4 n to the drainage when soil zone leaching triggered by rainfall dominates drainage flow at waharoa the flow weighted average nh4 n concentration in the artificial drainage over the two years was 0 05 mg n l which was substantially lower than at tatuanui at 0 36 mg n l the nh4 n concentrations in the artificial drainage at waharoa demonstrated no significant relationship with flow rates or sampling date through the drainage season data not shown the flow weighted average concentration of org n in waharoa artificial drainage 0 56 mg n l in 2016 was 1 8 times higher than at tatuanui 0 32 mg n l with the artificial drainage org n concentrations being weakly positively correlated with flow r2 0 11 in 2016 and 0 27 in 2017 fig 5 the weakly positive relationship between org n concentration and flow at waharoa reflects a gradient of decreasing soil org n concentrations with depth this trend indicated that the source of org n was the upper part of the soil profile either from applied whey permeate and or release of soil derived org n related to the dispersive effect of high sodium concentration whey fertiliser in 2017 the flow weighted average org n concentration at waharoa increased to 0 84 mg n l which was 2 7 times greater than that of tatuanui which remained relatively unchanged between years 0 31 mg n l org n concentrations in the artificial drainage at tatuanui exhibited no trend with flow or date through either drainage season data not shown 4 shallow groundwater chemistry and export 4 1 redox conditions in the subsurface and shallow groundwater degrading and reduced peat with a very strong hydrogen sulphide odour was recovered in the retrieved cores at tatuanui from approximately 1 0 to 10 5 m depth the peat had accumulated on an impermeable silty clay aquitard located at a depth from 10 5 to 12 m at waharoa a 0 30 m thick strongly redox segregated horizon iron mottles was identified starting at a depth of 0 45 m bgl this pattern was attributed to a perched saturated zone episodically developing on a thin clay layer with a very low permeablility located between 0 75 and 0 80 m depth beneath this clay layer multiple layers of differing textured sandy alluival deposits of varying thickness reflecting their formation occured down to 2 8 m depth the childs test indicated that the subsoil materials from 1 45 to 2 8 m depth were in a reduced redox status the shallow groundwater results mimicked the previously determined redox stratification with dissolved oxygen concentrations in the shallow groundwaters at both sites being very low all means 1 5 mg o2 l fig 6 a the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations occurred at groundwater depths furthest from the water table concentrations of dissolved manganese and particularly dissolved iron fig 6b c the childs tests on the retrieved core materials and the hydrogen sulphide odour at tatuanui all confirmed that the shallow groundwater at both sites was in a reduced redox status reduced groundwater under artificially drained land has also been reported by hansen et al 2019a in their situation reducing conditions are attributed to the presence of an inorganic electron donor pyrite 4 2 concentrations of n fractions through the shallow groundwater differences in the subsurface hydrology sources of n n transformations and removal processes all manifest themselves in the shallow groundwater n concentrations shown in fig 7 a b to facilitate comparison between groundwater and artificial drainage chemistry artificial drainage data from june to november 2017 are also included in these figures at tatuanui the org n and nh4 n concentrations increased by at least two fold between the aerobic artificial drainage and the reduced shallow groundwater close to the water table fig 7a the concentrations of both forms of n continued to increase through the shallow groundwater to maximums of 19 9 mg n l of org n and 4 1 mg n l of nh4 n at 6 0 m depth with the subsurface environment at tatuanui consisting of decomposing peat under reduced redox status elevated org n and nh4 n concentrations through the shallow groundwater were consistent with n mineralisation occurring petersen et al 2020b pijlman et al 2020 the elevated org n and nh4 n concentrations occurring below the drain level were probably due to the water table dropping in the warmer months temporarily encouraging higher mineralisation rates under aerobic conditions the nh4 n formed in this process would have been nitrified to no3 n under the temporary aerobic conditions however subsequently the mineralised no3 n would have been consumed in the autumn once recharge caused the water table to rise and re establish reduced conditions in this fluctuating water table zone groundwater no3 n concentrations at tatuanui fig 7a were very low reflecting the reduced redox status mcmahon and chapelle 2008 the maximum no3 n concentration observed closest to the water table in june 2017 0 14 mg n l was approximately one order of magnitude lower than in the aerobic artificial drainage while no3 n concentrations were already low close to the water table they decreased further with depth and date to an average of 0 005 mg n l in october these very low residual no3 n concentrations in the reduced saturated zone may have been due to no3 n formed from the aerobic mineralisation of the peaty material during lowered water table conditions in summer or from episodic leaching events before the start of the main drainage season independent of its source any no3 n existing in the shallow groundwater before the onset of the drainage season was nearly entirely consumed presumably by dnra and or denitrification rutting et al 2011 the org n concentrations in groundwater at waharoa in june 2017 fig 7b were similar to the peak concentrations in the artificial drainage however by october they were lower and better matched the baseflow drainage org n concentrations observed during july and august the nh4 n concentrations in shallow groundwater at waharoa were an order of magnitude higher than in the artificial drainage fig 7b while org n and nh4 n are both products of organic matter mineralisation under reduced conditions petersen et al 2020b pijlman et al 2020 no resident source of organic material was identified in the silty sandy deposits found at waharoa in contrast to the peat materials at tatuanui therefore ammonification of resident organic materials was not considered a feasible explanation for increased nh4 n concentrations in the shallow groundwater at waharoa in the absence of resident organic matter and increased concentrations of nh4 n concomitant with decreased no3 n in a reduced environment this strongly indicated that dnra was occurring probably concurrently with denitrification rutting et al 2011 both processes require reduced conditions to proceed with the relative availability of the common electron acceptors no2 n and no3 n being the key factor determining the relative strength of the two competing processes kraft et al 2014 dnra is favoured when the rate of no3 n formation exceeded that of no2 n with denitrification being dominant when no2 n formation was higher tiedje et al 1982 reported dnra occurs when a higher ratio of liable carbon c to no3 n exists concurrent occurrence of denitrification and dnra was reported in shallow groundwater beneath a dairy farm on poorly drained clay loam with elevated groundwater concentrations of dissolved org n 74 of tn and nh4 n 12 of tn by necpalova et al 2012 jahangir et al 2017 also measured concomitant dnra and denitrification accounting for 54 79 of the no3 n removed in shallow groundwater beneath constructed wetlands of the no3 n consumed they attributed between 14 and 16 to denitrification and 40 63 to dnra they concurred with tiedje et al 1982 that higher dnra than denitrification rates were related to higher concentrations of liable c indicated by a higher c no3 n ratio they reported ratios of dissolved organic carbon doc to no3 n in the shallow groundwater from 40 to 183 reflecting loadings from the wetlands above in june 2017 the doc to no3 n ratio in groundwater at waharoa ranged from 127 to 168 with magnitudes being an order greater in october which reflected the decrease in groundwater no3 n concentrations the favourable doc to no3 n ratios concomitant with increased nh4 n concentrations between the drain level and the reduced groundwater strongly indicated that dnra was at least partly responsible for no3 n consumption in the shallow groundwater at waharoa the use of whey permeate as a fertiliser rich in organic c and n is considered at least partly responsible for the elevated org n concentrations in the artificial drainage therefore doc is also expected to be leached from the whey permeate which would potentially have provided ample liable c facilitating the dnra process as n measurements were made very close to the water table dilution by horizontal groundwater flow from upgradient locations was considered negligible this assumption allows changes in n concentrations between the artificial drainage and shallow groundwater to provide an indication of the relative contributions of the two no3 n consuming processes org n was assumed to be conservatively transported into the shallow groundwater as concentrations were similar in each zone fig 7b in contrast nh4 n increased from a typical concentration of 0 05 mg n l in the artificial drainage to 1 0 mg n l in the reduced groundwater fig 7b concurrently no3 n concentrations decreased from approximately 2 0 mg n l in the aerobic drainage to 0 02 mg n l in the shallow groundwater assuming no n mineralisation was occurring in the saturated zone and no3 n consumption resulted from these two processes only then dnra and denitrification are estimated to have consumed approximately equal amounts of no3 n as at tatuanui the groundwater no3 n concentrations at waharoa fig 7b were also extremely low the maximum no3 n groundwater concentration in june was approximately 25 times lower than in the aerobic artificial drainage groundwater no3 n concentrations showed little variation with depth at waharoa but concentrations at the october sampling were an order of magnitude lower than those measured in june this is presumably due to a combination of continuing no3 n consumption and reduced no3 n leaching over the winter drainage season 4 3 n exported through the shallow groundwater as the shallow unconfined groundwater at tatuanui was practically immobile the n exports from the site only occurred via the artificial drainage as presented in table 7 a similar result was reported by schilling et al 2020 where the oxic groundwater was responsible for 1 3 of the flow from the site and between 0 4 and 4 of the n export at waharoa the average org n concentration measured through the groundwater was 1 83 mg n l in june 2017 and 0 84 mg n l in october fig 7 the higher groundwater concentration early in the drainage season reflects a similarly higher org n concentration in the artificial drainage fluxes the lower october org n concentration was nearly identical to the annual flow weighted concentration in artificial drainage 0 85 mg n l accordingly this value was considered representative of the org n groundwater concentrations over the 2017 drainage season with org n leaching at waharoa being disproportionality higher in 2017 as compared to 2016 the lower flow weighted average drainage concentration of 0 55 mg n l measured in 2016 table 8 was used to represent the shallow groundwater concentration in 2016 resulting annual exports of org n from the waharoa site via the shallow groundwater were 1 8 kg n ha yr in 2016 and 3 5 kg n ha yr in 2017 total org n exported from waharoa site including the artificial drainage component are reported in table 8 the total org n exported from waharoa in 2016 was 3 2 kg n ha yr of which 56 was through the shallow groundwater pathway in the wetter 2017 year the total org n exported from the site increased to 8 5 kg n ha yr with 41 of this being exported via the shallow groundwater over the two years an average of 45 of the org n exported from the waharoa site was via the shallow groundwater which was relatively consistent with the approximately equal hydrological flow through each pathway consistent with no3 n consuming processes in the reduced waharoa groundwater the average groundwater no3 n concentration 0 03 mg n l was extremely low using this representative groundwater concentration resulted in only approximately 0 1 kg n ha yr table 8 as the annual estimated no3 n exported through the shallow groundwater this equates to at most 1 of the total annual no3 n exported from the site being via the shallow groundwater the measured average groundwater nh4 n concentration of 1 0 mg n l was used to estimate the nh4 n exported through the groundwater for both years which resulted in estimated exports of 3 4 kg n ha yr in 2016 and 4 6 kg n ha yr in 2017 combined this resolved that 92 of the nh4 n exported from the waharoa site was via the shallow groundwater fig 8 combined over the two years 40 9 kg n ha of tn was exported from the waharoa site of this 68 was via artificial drainage and 32 through the shallow groundwater fig 8 this indicates that n was being preferentially exported via artificial drainage with no3 n consumption processes diminishing the n export via the reduced groundwater pathway in comparison rozemeijer et al 2010a reported that the oxic groundwater which discharged 20 of the hydrological export contributed 9 of the no3 n and 18 of the nh4 n exported from their physically separated field site the average percentage of the inorganic n exported from the field sites via the mobile oxic groundwater under cropped drained fields reported by sunohara et al 2014 was 15 of the combined tile and groundwater export when measured under conventional drainage but this fraction increased to 40 when controlled water table management was investigated 5 mitigation options for n recognising that artificial drainage was the only significant contaminant export pathway at tatuanui edge of field drainage bioreactors christianson et al 2017 rivas et al 2020 could effectively reduce n exports from this site at waharoa where exports occur through the shallow groundwater as well as artificial drainage a decrease in no3 n exports could be achieved by employing water table management previously called controlled drainage this would increase flows through the reducing shallow groundwater beneath the artificial drainage however concomitant increases in nh4 n and org n loads would need to be carefully considered for n treatment of the artificial drainage exports an edge of field bioreactor could also be installed at waharoa 6 conclusions when total water flows and nutrient exports from an artificially drained site are to be quantified it is a crucial first step to consider how important the groundwater pathway might be concerning water flow the comparison of our sites suggests that vertical groundwater recharge may be insignificant where the need for artificial drainage arises from a groundwater table seasonally rising into the soil zone as at tatuanui due to impermeable conditions beneath the artificial drainage in contrast substantial recharge into the shallow groundwater may occur where artificial drainage is primarily installed to alleviate restricted percolation through the soil zone but the underlying groundwater is mobile as at waharoa however site specific investigations allowing the establishment of defensible water balances or detailed analysis and modelling of the groundwater flows will be required to obtain realistic estimates of the split between artificial drainage and groundwater flows secondly our results demonstrate that in order to accurately estimate total n exports at sites with significant groundwater recharge the redox status of the underlying groundwater system needs to be taken into account and all relevant forms of n measured for example the artificial drainage accounted for effectively all no3 n export from our waharoa site but only for 68 of the total n export from the site conversely no no3 n but approx 45 of the org n and 94 of the nh4 n were exported on the groundwater pathway it is noteworthy that dnra resulting in nh4 n generation may be an important nitrate reduction process additionally to denitrification in the saturated zone automated monitoring of the groundwater table proved very informative in our study as water table dynamics strongly affected not only drainage flow but also drainage chemistry daily average water table height and daily drainage flows were at both sites strongly linearly correlated average r2 0 88 importantly the change in the no3 n nh4 n and org n concentrations with changing drainage flow reflected the presumed vertical gradients of these n forms in the soil profile contributing to the drainage flow at the corresponding water table height these results confirmed that the vertical change in the water table height drives drainage flow and chemistry dynamics at drained sites with flat topography rather than spatial changes in the

4625,when considering hydrological export pathways from drained pastoral fields the shallow groundwater underlying the artificial drainage system may fulfil an as important role as the artificial drainage system itself however the important split between artificial drainage and groundwater flows at a field site is usually unknown consequently the effects that the groundwater system s redox status may have on the forms and total amounts of nitrogen n exported from the site cannot be confidently assessed we addressed these deficiencies by investigating the export of various forms of n in the artificial drainage and the shallow groundwater beneath two dairy farming sites tatuanui waharoa within the piako river catchment in new zealand due to the very low hydraulic conductivity of the degraded peat in the saturated zone perched on a clay aquiclude no significant water or contaminants were exported at tatuanui via the unconfined shallow groundwater accordingly artificial drainage discharge into the receiving surface collector drain was the only export pathway for n at this site the sealed nature of the groundwater zone resulted in the accumulation of organic n and ammonium n in the peaty shallow saturated zone underlying the mineral soil in contrast the waharoa site featured a more mobile shallow groundwater system which on average conveyed approximately equal volumes of water offsite as the artificial drainage system nitrate no3 n was at both sites the predominant form of n 76 leached from the aerobic soil profile and discharged through the artificial drainage as the shallow groundwater was at both sites in a reduced redox state any no3 n leached from the rootzone into the saturated zone was consumed accordingly even the mobile shallow groundwater at waharoa did not convey significant no3 n the no3 n consumption in the reduced groundwater presumably occurred due to dissimilatory no3 n reduction concomitant increases in ammonium n concentrations with no organic material available for mineralisation in the saturated zone and microbial denitrification producing gaseous forms of n the no3 n reductions in the groundwater resulted in the average total n exports via the shallow groundwater pathway at the waharoa site being substantially lower 31 of the exported n than in the artificial drainage 69 this is despite both pathways exporting similar water volumes because of the no3 n consumption in the reduced shallow groundwater at waharoa over 98 of the n exported through this pathway was either as ammonium n or organic n keywords artificial

important nitrogen n export pathway on poorly drained soils if artificial subsurface drainage is not present youssef et al 2010 however on flat sites with artificial subsurface drainage installed the

export of n to the mississippi river basin in the us from all agricultural land is estimated to be approximately 2 3 kg n ha yr however artificially subsurface drained land can contribute between 2

waterways hansen et al 2019b withers et al 2014 when investigating contaminants in the shallow groundwater under agricultural land it is difficult to accurately ascertain their origin smith et al 2018

artificial subsurface drainage and or surface runoff have also been measured in many field scale studies however only few field scale studies have explicitly measured the groundwater exports concurrently with artificial drainage exports and included all relevant forms of n these studies directly relevant to our work include a 0 9 ha field study where artificial drainage flows were physically separated and captured in large tanks and the horizontal groundwater seepage collected into constructed reservoirs within the surface drain at the edge of the drained field rozemeijer et al 2010a this field experimental facility was later used to investigate the effects on n export flow paths when the water table was raised employing water table management rozemeijer et al 2016 schilling et al 2020 measured water table levels and fully mixed no3 n concentrations in the groundwater under artificially drained fields and used this data with the groundwater model modflow to estimate the steady state water exports in the groundwater to the receiving stream the groundwater flux estimates were combined with the measured no3 n concentrations and compared with n exports from the artificial drainage in iowa usa comprehensive n budgets for artificial drainage and groundwater n components were reported by sunohara et al 2014 when investigating the effects of raised water table with drainage management on the n exports in cropped fields of 2 to 7 ha in size in eastern canada groundwater n concentrations and levels measured in piezometers were used with the dupuit forcheimer and darcy equations to estimate horizontal and vertical groundwater exports respectively n loads in these components were then estimated using the fully mixed n concentrations measured in the groundwater piezometers to extend the level of understanding of the n dynamics in the shallow groundwater export pathway we investigated two contrasting field sites to address the following four objectives i to determine at the field scale the hydrological exports in subsurface artificial drainage and the shallow groundwater underneath ii to quantify the annual exports of various forms of n in these two pathways at the field scale and elucidate their drivers iii to ascertain how groundwater redox conditions affect concentrations of different forms of n in the shallow groundwater iv building on these results to identify mitigation options that can reduce nitrogen exports from artificially subsurface drained land 2 methods 2 1 field sites to investigate the hydrological and contaminant export pathways two artificially drained sites within the piako river catchment on the north island of new zealand were monitored over the 2016 and 2017 drainage seasons the piako river catchment forms a major component of the hauraki plains a fertile alluvial plain with large areas of peat and poorly drained soils the rivers crossing the plains discharge into the firth of thames the tatuanui site is located close to morrinsville and the waharoa site is close to matamata fig 1 the relevant characteristics of the artificial subsurface drainage systems and farm management at the two sites are summarised in table 1 the artificial subsurface drainage system at both sites discharges into a surface drain part of a larger drainage collector network discharging into the piako river the groundwater outflow at the coast into the firth of thames is estimated to be only 2 5 of the total hydrological discharge from the hauraki plains which is dominated by surface discharges white et al

to gain a better understanding of the subsurface materials and the hydrological pathways operating intact cores 84 mm external dia 1 m long were collected using a track mounted geoprobe soil corer 540mt kansas usa at tatuanui this was done to a depth of 12 m and at waharoa to approximately 2 8 m depth as the saturated sandy subsurface materials caused the borehole to collapse at greater depth when the core was removed the childs test red colour change was used on cores retrieved during well installation to identify where fe ii was present indicating reduced conditions childs 1981 2 3 drainage flow and rainfall measurement at both sites the combined subsurface drainage flows from all tile lines were routed through flow measurement flumes installed in the receiving surface drains the stage height in the measurement flume was monitored using a counter weighted float within a stilling well using a daa h 331 water level encoder niwa national institute of water and atmospheric research christchurch nz stage readings were made on a 5 minute interval with a 1 mm accuracy and converted to an instantaneous flowrate m3 s using a stage discharge relationship the area normalized drainage discharge was determined by dividing the cumulative volume m3 of artificial drainage recorded through the flume over the period being considered by the assumed area m2 contributing drainage flow to the flume the contributing drainage area was estimated from the total length of each drainage line the spacing between the drainage lines and the number of lines reducing the inherent uncertainty of the size of the contributing drainage area by hydrologically isolating the investigated blocks was not achievable within the project constraints rainfall at both sites was measured with a 200 mm diameter 0 2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge the rain gauge was calibrated twice in each drainage season to eliminate stock interference the rain gauges were installed at 1 8 m height thus correction was necessary for under capture due to wind effects sevruk 1982 the correction method followed yang et al 1998 by determining catch ratio factors based on daily wind speed at the installed gauge height data for this correction process was sourced from the three closest metrological sites niwa network numbers and names b75152 thames2 b75752 toenepi ews and c75241 firth of thames resulting monthly catch ratio correction factors not reported ranged from 91 in april to 88 in november at waharoa the drainage outlet became flooded in mid august 2017 due to extremely wet conditions causing water to back up and the measurement flume becoming inoperative assuming that the 2017 drainage season at waharoa finished at a similar date as the close by tatuanui site as observed in 2016 allowed the length of the 2017 drainage season and the rainfall within the drainage season to be estimated at waharoa the artificial drainage discharge for the period after the flume failure in 2017 was estimated based on a site specific relationship determined between measured event rainfall and measured drainage not presented an event was described by the time period from the start of rainfall in the first event until significant rainfall occurred in the subsequent event the relationship between the event rainfall and event drainage was well described by a linear relationship r2 0 86 2 4 flow split between different export pathways surface runoff could be excluded as significant export pathway at both sites due to the flat topography high soil infiltration rates which typically average 170 mm hr joe 1984 and the effective subsurface drainage system combined with the lack of any empirical evidence for surface runoff during our study the fraction of percolating water that bypasses the artificial drainage and discharges vertically into the groundwater is often referred to as either recharge into shallow groundwater or deep drainage as this component is spatially and temporally highly variable and difficult to defensibly measure over a sufficiently large representative area it can be estimated from a water balance analysis petersen et al 2020a rozemeijer et al 2010a this method is based on subtracting from the rainfall the measured artificial drainage evapotranspiration losses and any change in soil storage occurring over the period of calculation as it is expected that soil water contents at the onset of drainage in the autumn are essentially the same as when drainage ceases in the spring the change in soil water storage over the computational period can be assumed to be negligible the resulting simplified water balance equation used to determine the recharge to the shallow groundwater is described in eq 1 1 recharge to shallow gw rainfall actual et artificial drainage all in mm as the water balance is applied only over the winter drainage period when temperatures are low and soil water contents high actual evapotranspiration is assumed to be equal to potential evapotranspiration evapotranspiration data for both sites was obtained from the closest meteorological station holding the data niwa toenepi ews b75752 which is 9 2 km from the tatuanui site and 18 2 km from the waharoa site 2 5 artificial drainage n concentrations and exports using isco auto samplers drainage samples were collected for laboratory analysis after flow increments of 50 m3 in 2016 and 100 m3 in 2017 the sampling intervals represented approximately 1 2 mm of drainage over contributing areas in 2016 and 2 5 mm in 2017 preservative was used to ensure drainage samples collected did not degrade during the on average 10 day collection interval the average artificial drainage flow rate m3 hr between samplings was determined by dividing the drainage volume m3 by the time taken hrs between consecutive sample collections drainage samples were analysed for total n tn total oxidised n nitrite no2 n and no3 n reported as no3 n and nh4 n by the methods described in table 2 org n was determined by difference between tn and the sum of no3 n and nh4 n concentrations it was prohibitively expensive to analyse all 1028 samples collected for the full suite of laboratory analytes therefore samples were selected for analysis based on their location on the flow hydrograph and estimated no3 n concentration the no3 n estimates were derived from correlation between electrical conductivity and laboratory measured no3 n concentrations for each site and season not reported in total 39 of the waharoa samples n 432 and 54 from tatuanui n 596 were laboratory analysed concentrations in unanalysed samples were estimated using flow based linear interpolation n exports were determined from the sum of the products of flow volumes and contaminant concentrations over the drainage season the average annual flow weighted n concentrations mg n l were determined by dividing the total annual export n by the volume of annual drainage non parametric best fit lines

slotted up to 0 3 m depth below ground level bgl at tatuanui two of the three wells were installed to 5 5 m bgl and the third to 9 6 m bgl at waharoa two 50 mm monitoring wells were installed to 2 8 m bgl at each site a vented pressure transducer odyssey christchurch new zealand was installed in one of the groundwater quality monitoring wells to provide continuous water table data additionally 20 mm internal diameter continuously slotted pvc wells were installed and monitored monthly to obtain information on groundwater levels direction and hydraulic gradient information were obtained using a contour package in gis software manifold net nine of these water level wells were installed at waharoa in three transects across the site and six wells in two transects installed at the more uniform site at tatuanui groundwater quality was sampled in depth specific increments using inflatable pneumatic packers holloway and waddell 2008 ratnam et al 2005 to isolate 0 34 m long sections of well casing well casings were installed using an interference push fit method to avoid the creation of an annular gap between the well casing and the ambient saturated zone deposits this method ensured groundwater samples were collected from the targeted depth only and not affected by preferential groundwater flow from different layers with higher hydraulic conductivity monitoring wells were sampled twice during 2017 july and october a low flow mini bladder pump max flow rate 60 ml min was used and field parameters were monitored in a surface flow cell to ensure that stabilisation criteria were achieved prior to groundwater sampling daughney et al 2006 field measurements included temperature ph dissolved oxygen and conductivity using a multi parameter instrument aquaprobe ap 2000 england the probe was pre calibrated prior to being field deployed groundwater samples were chilled and analysed at hill laboratories hamilton using the laboratory methods described in table 3 groundwater samples were also assessed for redox conditions using the criteria reported by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 with minor modifications for nz conditions by close et al 2016 as reported in table 4 the ksat mm day of the shallow groundwater were measured using replicated hydraulic slug tests bouwer and rice 1976 on the installed monitoring wells analysed using the methods of halford and kuniansky 2002 specific discharges m day were subsequently estimated using these ksat and the groundwater gradients m m at each site determined from measured groundwater levels across the sites and gis software manifold net annual loads of the various forms of n exported via the shallow groundwater were estimated as the product of the estimated hydrological volumes recharged into the shallow groundwater and representative groundwater concentrations at the drainage depth over the season the representative groundwater concentrations were determined from measurements in the shallow groundwater sampled in 2017 where the flow weighted annual artificial drainage concentrations were different between 2016 and 2017 i e org n the ratio of the annual flow weighted n concentrations was used to estimate 2016 org n concentrations in shallow groundwater this procedure takes account of the difference in leaching behaviour between the two years 3 results and discussion as the field sites studied represent two commonly occurring drainage situations it is feasible to draw conclusions from this study that are applicable to many other locations with artificial drainage installed the tatuanui field site represents a situation where the need for artificial drainage arises from a shallow water table seasonally rising into the soil zone nzaei 1988 skaggs 1999 vlotman et al 2004 in this instance the soil zone itself does not have any restricted permeability but the underlying groundwater system has a very low specific discharge in contrast artificial drainage at waharoa is necessitated by the physical characteristics of the soil zone bowler 1980 vlotman et al 2004 without artificial drainage a perched saturated zone would develop during periods of excess rain on a poorly permeable soil layer to facilitate the transfer of our results to other locations and situations we have discussed them in the following sections against the backdrop of these two generalised drainage situations 3 1 hydrological split between export pathways the application of the water balance eq 1 confirmed the immobile nature of the shallow groundwater at tatuanui with the measured artificial drainage discharge representing 79 and 86 of the measured rainfall for the 2016 and 2017 drainage seasons respectively table 5 the remaining component of the rainfall in each drainage season was just less than the estimated evapotranspiration indicating that a small amount of upward flux from the shallow groundwater was required to meet the full evaporative demand schilling et al 2020 also reported an effectively sealed shallow groundwater hydraulic export at the field scale where the average daily groundwater export only represented 1 3 of that exported from their site sunohara et al 2014 measured the average vertical seepage loss to groundwater over four years under cropping to be 14 of that exported from the site under conventional drainage and increased only slightly to 15 with controlled water table management rozemeijer et al 2010a who physically separated artificial drainage flows from groundwater seepages using tanks and reservoirs measured 20 of the hydrological discharge from the site occurring from shallow groundwater flow paths the waharoa rainfall recorded in both years was higher than at tatuanui table 5 but the measured artificial drainage discharge was lower accordingly groundwater recharge accounted for 46 of the rainfall during the 2016 drainage season and 39 during the part 2017 drainage season until flume failure based on the site specific event rainfall vs drainage relationship developed an additional 146 mm of artificial drainage is estimated to have occurred due to the 347 mm of rain that fell after flume failure consequentially for the complete 2017 drainage season the resulting percentage of rainfall contribution to groundwater was slightly reduced from 39 to 32 table 5 when the warmer spring period with higher evapotranspiration requirement was included the average percentage of rainfall discharging via artificial drainage over the two years was 40 5 at waharoa which is only slightly higher than the average 39 exported via the shallow groundwater pathway rozemeijer et al 2016 found that the groundwater discharge from their field site increased from 20 contribution under normal drainage management to an average of 39 over two winters when controlled drainage was implemented in a modelling study by hansen et al 2019a the artificial drainage network discharge and the groundwater export to the receiving stream along the edge of a drained catchment were also reported to be similar 36 and 38 of the winter rainfall respectively the average saturated hydraulic conductivity of the groundwater measured using slug tests at tatuanui was 2 8 mm hr table 6 which is representative of a impervious type aquifer material bear 1972 and typical of strongly or excessively degraded peat lennartz and liu 2019 as found in the subsurface at this site the hydraulic conductivity at waharoa was 10 times greater 28 4 mm day reflecting the conductivity of an semi impervious material of very fine sand type materials bear 1972 again typical of the fine alluvial sediment materials present at the site using the conductivity data and measured hydraulic gradients at each site resulting specific discharges are presented in table 6 these specific groundwater discharges concur with the hydrological analysis that the groundwater pathway did not represent a significant export pathway for water and contaminants in either drainage season at tatuanui 3 2 annual exports of n via artificial drainage at tatuanui in 2016 the 344 mm of artificial drainage exported 9 2 kg n ha yr of tn table 7 with the annual drainage volume increasing to 816 mm in 2017 the tn export increased flow proportionally to 22 1 kg n ha yr the percentages of no3 n nh4 n and org n in tn were nearly identical in both years with no3 n dominating at 76 of tn annual exports kg n ha yr of all forms of n at tatuanui were linearly related to the annual artificial area normalised drainage fig 2 this linear response indicates that the n exports at tatuanui are transport rather than supply limited which is considered typical for n in managed catchments with a long history of intensive land use basu et al 2010 moatar et al 2017 after flume failure at waharoa in mid august 2017 no3 n concentrations in the artificial drainage were measured twice when backing up of drainage water was not occurring using these measurements and the relationship between no3 n concentration in the artificial drainage with flow and time obtained prior to failure fig 4 no3 n concentrations in the artificial drainage were estimated for the period after flume failure this resulted in the estimation of 1 3 kg of no3 n ha table 7 being exported via artificial drainage after flume failure as nh4 n and org n artificial drainage concentrations were not correlated to sampling date or flow fig 3 these exports were determined based on flow proportional increases after flume failure table 7 the volume of artificial drainage at waharoa increased by 142 during the complete 2017 season as compared to 2016 table 7 concomitantly the export of no3 n increased from 8 7 to only 12 1 kg n ha yr which represents a lower increase of 39 as compared to the hydrological increase with the lower no3 n export in 2017 the relationship between annual tn and no3 n exports with annual artificial drainage volume at waharoa was non linear fig 2 lower no3 n concentrations in 2017 are also evident in fig 3b where at comparable drainage flow rates no3 n concentrations were approximately 1 to 2 mg n l lower than in 2016 depletion of soil no3 n levels resulting from continued low fertiliser inputs 57 kg n ha yr in 2016 51 kg n ha yr in 2017 was considered responsible for the lower no3 n exports at waharoa in 2017 this decreasing response in the no3 n exports in the artificial drainage from tatuanui demonstrates supply limited conditions concerning the no3 n export basu et al 2010 moatar et al 2017 annual nh4 n exports at both sites were linearly correlated to annual drainage volumes fig 2 indicating that nh4 n export was transport limited the org n export at waharoa increased from 1 4 kg n ha in 2016 to 5 1 kg n ha in 2017 this was a disproportionally higher increase of 270 as compared to the hydrological increase of 142 this result could be attributable to the high sodium concentration whey products applied which can cause swelling of clay minerals and deflocculation of soil colloids under wet conditions as experienced in 2017 nzi of chemists 2017 the annual export of no3 n via the artificial drainage in 2016 was higher at waharoa than at tatuanui in spite of a lower fertiliser n input however in 2017 when the no3 n export at waharoa became supply limited the no3 n exported per mm of drainage at both sites were of a similar magnitude the tatuanui site had consistently higher nh4 n concentrations in the artificial drainage than waharoa this result was probably a consequence of the nh4 n diffusing upward from immobile groundwater with higher nh4 n concentrations seibert et al 2009 waharoa had a higher org n export per mm of drainage than tatuanui in both years reflecting the use of the whey permeate fertiliser the difference in org n exported between sites increased in the wetter 2017 season possibly reflecting the effects of the high sodium content of the whey permeate on topsoil structure 3 3 no3 n concentrations in artificial drainage in subsurface drained sites with flat topography the contributing area to the artificial drainage export is considered static therefore change in the drainage flows can be attributed to a change in water table height saadat et al 2018 this result is consistent with our data where strong relationships average r2 0 88 between daily average water table height and daily drainage flows were determined at both sites data not shown the strong effect of water table dynamics on stream nitrate concentrations has been documented in several previous studies changing spatial connectivity between the stream and source areas has been identified as a key driver at the catchment scale molenat et al 2008 wriedt et al 2007 however the vertical connection between the nitrate enriched upper part of the soil zone and the drainage network has been shown to be the critical process at the field scale in flat landscapes liu et al 2020 seibert et al 2009 to address the objective of elucidating the drivers in the dynamics of the n exports the concentrations of n in the artificial drainage were investigated intra annually with flow synonymously discharge and time of year basu et al 2010 hashemi et al 2020 moatar et al 2017 liu et al 2020 this resulted in two particularly notable characteristics in the concentration discharge relationships demonstrated at both sites and both years firstly no3 n concentrations in the artificial drainage increased concomitantly with flow as also reported by liu et al 2020 and williams et al 2015 secondly no3 n concentrations decreased over the drainage seasons across the entire flow range consistent with grassland n drainage dynamics as reported by houlbrooke et al 2003 and monaghan et al 2016 these two characteristics are well demonstrated in fig 4 where no3 n concentrations are plotted against drainage flow rate with concentrations being colour coded for the time of year when sampled the purple to green sequence covers no3 n concentrations measured from march to july autumn to mid winter while the green to brown sequence shows concentrations measured from july to november mid winter to spring the non parametric line of best fit between flow and concentration is shown as a black solid line with the grey shading indicating the 95 confidence interval at the tatuanui site no3 n concentrations in 2016 tended to increase nearly linearly r2 0 35 over the entire observed flow range of up to 40 m3 hr fig 4a there were two distinct deviations from this overall pattern early in the drainage season when markedly higher no3 n concentrations were observed as flow rates exceeded approx 20 m3 hr in 2017 when drainage at tatuanui started much earlier in the year no3 n concentrations again increased disproportionally with flow during two high flow events peak flows approx 40 m3 hr early in the season purple and blue colours while our experimental setup was not designed to specifically investigate hysteresis effects these four high flow events had sufficient data points and variation in measured no3 n concentrations to clearly detect event scale hysteresis no3 n concentrations during these events showed a clockwise pattern with concentrations rising quickly with increasing flow a concentration maximum prior to reaching peak flow and then concentrations first dropping quickly and later more gradually with receding flow a type 1 hysteresis pattern hashemi et al 2020 a substantial degree of noise evident particularly in april 2017 is deemed to reflect the very dynamic rainfall patterns during these multi day high flow events at waharoa no3 n concentrations increased very strongly with increasing flow in the early part of the 2016 drainage season however depletion of the no3 n stock accumulated in the soil in autumn moir et al 2016 meant that there were only very moderate increases later in the season fig 4b with a distinct difference between drainage events in the earlier and later part of the season the loess line of best fit fails to describe the data adequately r2 0 26 with the earlier onset and higher flowrates in the earlier part of the 2017 waharoa drainage season the relationship between no3 n concentrations and flow was nearly linear until flow exceeded approximately 15 m3 hr after this flow threshold no3 n concentrations continued to increase at a higher linear rate overall the relationship between flow and concentration was relatively strong with an r2 0 61 the no3 n concentrations at waharoa in 2017 tended to be lower than in 2016 across the entire flow range fig 4 reflecting the smaller soil n reservoir at waharoa in 2017 event scale hysteresis was also evident in the earliest flow event in 2016 teal colour but corresponding data for 2017 is missing due to the flume failure triggered by the august 2017 storms while the shape and strength of the positive relationships between no3 n concentrations and drainage flow rate differ between the sites and years the underlying mechanism remains the same when substantial rainfall occurs onto an already wetted profile saturated conditions are created temporarily in the upper part of the soil profile as a substantial no3 n stock typically exists in the upper zone of permanent pasture soil the temporary saturation flushes out significant no3 n loads into the artificial drainage system causing the no3 n concentrations in the drainage to increase concomitantly with the increasing flow rates liu et al 2020 seibert et al 2009 the second characteristic demonstrated in the no3 n concentration data at both sites is that no3 n concentrations generally decreased over the winter drainage seasons this is particularly evident at the higher flow rates when the concentrations earlier in the season are substantially higher than later in the season this behaviour is well demonstrated at tatuanui in 2017 where the highest no3 n concentrations 8 mg n l were measured at flowrates above 30 m3 hr in april and may purple and blue as compared to concentrations below 2 mg n l at similar flow rates later in the season in november brown coloured decreasing no3 n concentrations in artificial drainage through the season at similar flow rates can be attributed to a declining soil no3 n reservoir the reservoir builds up in late summer and autumn when mineralisation of soil organic nitrogen is occurring but uptake by pasture and leaching from the soil zone are restricted by dry soil water conditions moir et al 2016 subsequently with consecutive leaching events through the winter the reservoir becomes depleted and the no3 n concentrations in drainage waters decrease concomitantly houlbrooke et al 2003 monaghan et al 2016 while dairy cows were grazed on the pasture over the winter drainage season the soil no3 n reservoir was apparently not replenished to the higher autumn levels this may reflect the continual leaching during winter and cooler soil temperatures causing lower mineralisation and nitrification rates additionally dairy cows grazed over winter are not lactating so feed intake is reduced by approximately 70 this could lower urinary n deposits onto the soil which are the major source of no3 n leached from grazed pasture di and cameron 2007 in summary while no3 n concentrations typically increased with flow the trend of declining concentrations with time meant that these relationships were variable between sites and time fig 4 3 4 nh4 n and org n concentrations in artifical drainage the concentration discharge relationship for nh4 n in the artificial drainage at tatuanui is presented in fig 5 a decreasing nh4 n concentrations with increasing flow rate reflect the diminishing contribution of groundwater derived nh4 n to the drainage when soil zone leaching triggered by rainfall dominates drainage flow at waharoa the flow weighted average nh4 n concentration in the artificial drainage over the two years was 0 05 mg n l which was substantially lower than at tatuanui at 0 36 mg n l the nh4 n concentrations in the artificial drainage at waharoa demonstrated no significant relationship with flow rates or sampling date through the drainage season data not shown the flow weighted average concentration of org n in waharoa artificial drainage 0 56 mg n l in 2016 was 1 8 times higher than at tatuanui 0 32 mg n l with the artificial drainage org n concentrations being weakly positively correlated with flow r2 0 11 in 2016 and 0 27 in 2017 fig 5 the weakly positive relationship between org n concentration and flow at waharoa reflects a gradient of decreasing soil org n concentrations with depth this trend indicated that the source of org n was the upper part of the soil profile either from applied whey permeate and or release of soil derived org n related to the dispersive effect of high sodium concentration whey fertiliser in 2017 the flow weighted average org n concentration at waharoa increased to 0 84 mg n l which was 2 7 times greater than that of tatuanui which remained relatively unchanged between years 0 31 mg n l org n concentrations in the artificial drainage at tatuanui exhibited no trend with flow or date through either drainage season data not shown 4 shallow groundwater chemistry and export 4 1 redox conditions in the subsurface and shallow groundwater degrading and reduced peat with a very strong hydrogen sulphide odour was recovered in the retrieved cores at tatuanui from approximately 1 0 to 10 5 m depth the peat had accumulated on an impermeable silty clay aquitard located at a depth from 10 5 to 12 m at waharoa a 0 30 m thick strongly redox segregated horizon iron mottles was identified starting at a depth of 0 45 m bgl this pattern was attributed to a perched saturated zone episodically developing on a thin clay layer with a very low permeablility located between 0 75 and 0 80 m depth beneath this clay layer multiple layers of differing textured sandy alluival deposits of varying thickness reflecting their formation occured down to 2 8 m depth the childs test indicated that the subsoil materials from 1 45 to 2 8 m depth were in a reduced redox status the shallow groundwater results mimicked the previously determined redox stratification with dissolved oxygen concentrations in the shallow groundwaters at both sites being very low all means 1 5 mg o2 l fig 6 a the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations occurred at groundwater depths furthest from the water table concentrations of dissolved manganese and particularly dissolved iron fig 6b c the childs tests on the retrieved core materials and the hydrogen sulphide odour at tatuanui all confirmed that the shallow groundwater at both sites was in a reduced redox status reduced groundwater under artificially drained land has also been reported by hansen et al 2019a in their situation reducing conditions are attributed to the presence of an inorganic electron donor pyrite 4 2 concentrations of n fractions through the shallow groundwater differences in the subsurface hydrology sources of n n transformations and removal processes all manifest themselves in the shallow groundwater n concentrations shown in fig 7 a b to facilitate comparison between groundwater and artificial drainage chemistry artificial drainage data from june to november 2017 are also included in these figures at tatuanui the org n and nh4 n concentrations increased by at least two fold between the aerobic artificial drainage and the reduced shallow groundwater close to the water table fig 7a the concentrations of both forms of n continued to increase through the shallow groundwater to maximums of 19 9 mg n l of org n and 4 1 mg n l of nh4 n at 6 0 m depth with the subsurface environment at tatuanui consisting of decomposing peat under reduced redox status elevated org n and nh4 n concentrations through the shallow groundwater were consistent with n mineralisation occurring petersen et al 2020b pijlman et al 2020 the elevated org n and nh4 n concentrations occurring below the drain level were probably due to the water table dropping in the warmer months temporarily encouraging higher mineralisation rates under aerobic conditions the nh4 n formed in this process would have been nitrified to no3 n under the temporary aerobic conditions however subsequently the mineralised no3 n would have been consumed in the autumn once recharge caused the water table to rise and re establish reduced conditions in this fluctuating water table zone groundwater no3 n concentrations at tatuanui fig 7a were very low reflecting the reduced redox status mcmahon and chapelle 2008 the maximum no3 n concentration observed closest to the water table in june 2017 0 14 mg n l was approximately one order of magnitude lower than in the aerobic artificial drainage while no3 n concentrations were already low close to the water table they decreased further with depth and date to an average of 0 005 mg n l in october these very low residual no3 n concentrations in the reduced saturated zone may have been due to no3 n formed from the aerobic mineralisation of the peaty material during lowered water table conditions in summer or from episodic leaching events before the start of the main drainage season independent of its source any no3 n existing in the shallow groundwater before the onset of the drainage season was nearly entirely consumed presumably by dnra and or denitrification rutting et al 2011 the org n concentrations in groundwater at waharoa in june 2017 fig 7b were similar to the peak concentrations in the artificial drainage however by october they were lower and better matched the baseflow drainage org n concentrations observed during july and august the nh4 n concentrations in shallow groundwater at waharoa were an order of magnitude higher than in the artificial drainage fig 7b while org n and nh4 n are both products of organic matter mineralisation under reduced conditions petersen et al 2020b pijlman et al 2020 no resident source of organic material was identified in the silty sandy deposits found at waharoa in contrast to the peat materials at tatuanui therefore ammonification of resident organic materials was not considered a feasible explanation for increased nh4 n concentrations in the shallow groundwater at waharoa in the absence of resident organic matter and increased concentrations of nh4 n concomitant with decreased no3 n in a reduced environment this strongly indicated that dnra was occurring probably concurrently with denitrification rutting et al 2011 both processes require reduced conditions to proceed with the relative availability of the common electron acceptors no2 n and no3 n being the key factor determining the relative strength of the two competing processes kraft et al 2014 dnra is favoured when the rate of no3 n formation exceeded that of no2 n with denitrification being dominant when no2 n formation was higher tiedje et al 1982 reported dnra occurs when a higher ratio of liable carbon c to no3 n exists concurrent occurrence of denitrification and dnra was reported in shallow groundwater beneath a dairy farm on poorly drained clay loam with elevated groundwater concentrations of dissolved org n 74 of tn and nh4 n 12 of tn by necpalova et al 2012 jahangir et al 2017 also measured concomitant dnra and denitrification accounting for 54 79 of the no3 n removed in shallow groundwater beneath constructed wetlands of the no3 n consumed they attributed between 14 and 16 to denitrification and 40 63 to dnra they concurred with tiedje et al 1982 that higher dnra than denitrification rates were related to higher concentrations of liable c indicated by a higher c no3 n ratio they reported ratios of dissolved organic carbon doc to no3 n in the shallow groundwater from 40 to 183 reflecting loadings from the wetlands above in june 2017 the doc to no3 n ratio in groundwater at waharoa ranged from 127 to 168 with magnitudes being an order greater in october which reflected the decrease in groundwater no3 n concentrations the favourable doc to no3 n ratios concomitant with increased nh4 n concentrations between the drain level and the reduced groundwater strongly indicated that dnra was at least partly responsible for no3 n consumption in the shallow groundwater at waharoa the use of whey permeate as a fertiliser rich in organic c and n is considered at least partly responsible for the elevated org n concentrations in the artificial drainage therefore doc is also expected to be leached from the whey permeate which would potentially have provided ample liable c facilitating the dnra process as n measurements were made very close to the water table dilution by horizontal groundwater flow from upgradient locations was considered negligible this assumption allows changes in n concentrations between the artificial drainage and shallow groundwater to provide an indication of the relative contributions of the two no3 n consuming processes org n was assumed to be conservatively transported into the shallow groundwater as concentrations were similar in each zone fig 7b in contrast nh4 n increased from a typical concentration of 0 05 mg n l in the artificial drainage to 1 0 mg n l in the reduced groundwater fig 7b concurrently no3 n concentrations decreased from approximately 2 0 mg n l in the aerobic drainage to 0 02 mg n l in the shallow groundwater assuming no n mineralisation was occurring in the saturated zone and no3 n consumption resulted from these two processes only then dnra and denitrification are estimated to have consumed approximately equal amounts of no3 n as at tatuanui the groundwater no3 n concentrations at waharoa fig 7b were also extremely low the maximum no3 n groundwater concentration in june was approximately 25 times lower than in the aerobic artificial drainage groundwater no3 n concentrations showed little variation with depth at waharoa but concentrations at the october sampling were an order of magnitude lower than those measured in june this is presumably due to a combination of continuing no3 n consumption and reduced no3 n leaching over the winter drainage season 4 3 n exported through the shallow groundwater as the shallow unconfined groundwater at tatuanui was practically immobile the n exports from the site only occurred via the artificial drainage as presented in table 7 a similar result was reported by schilling et al 2020 where the oxic groundwater was responsible for 1 3 of the flow from the site and between 0 4 and 4 of the n export at waharoa the average org n concentration measured through the groundwater was 1 83 mg n l in june 2017 and 0 84 mg n l in october fig 7 the higher groundwater concentration early in the drainage season reflects a similarly higher org n concentration in the artificial drainage fluxes the lower october org n concentration was nearly identical to the annual flow weighted concentration in artificial drainage 0 85 mg n l accordingly this value was considered representative of the org n groundwater concentrations over the 2017 drainage season with org n leaching at waharoa being disproportionality higher in 2017 as compared to 2016 the lower flow weighted average drainage concentration of 0 55 mg n l measured in 2016 table 8 was used to represent the shallow groundwater concentration in 2016 resulting annual exports of org n from the waharoa site via the shallow groundwater were 1 8 kg n ha yr in 2016 and 3 5 kg n ha yr in 2017 total org n exported from waharoa site including the artificial drainage component are reported in table 8 the total org n exported from waharoa in 2016 was 3 2 kg n ha yr of which 56 was through the shallow groundwater pathway in the wetter 2017 year the total org n exported from the site increased to 8 5 kg n ha yr with 41 of this being exported via the shallow groundwater over the two years an average of 45 of the org n exported from the waharoa site was via the shallow groundwater which was relatively consistent with the approximately equal hydrological flow through each pathway consistent with no3 n consuming processes in the reduced waharoa groundwater the average groundwater no3 n concentration 0 03 mg n l was extremely low using this representative groundwater concentration resulted in only approximately 0 1 kg n ha yr table 8 as the annual estimated no3 n exported through the shallow groundwater this equates to at most 1 of the total annual no3 n exported from the site being via the shallow groundwater the measured average groundwater nh4 n concentration of 1 0 mg n l was used to estimate the nh4 n exported through the groundwater for both years which resulted in estimated exports of 3 4 kg n ha yr in 2016 and 4 6 kg n ha yr in 2017 combined this resolved that 92 of the nh4 n exported from the waharoa site was via the shallow groundwater fig 8 combined over the two years 40 9 kg n ha of tn was exported from the waharoa site of this 68 was via artificial drainage and 32 through the shallow groundwater fig 8 this indicates that n was being preferentially exported via artificial drainage with no3 n consumption processes diminishing the n export via the reduced groundwater pathway in comparison rozemeijer et al 2010a reported that the oxic groundwater which discharged 20 of the hydrological export contributed 9 of the no3 n and 18 of the nh4 n exported from their physically separated field site the average percentage of the inorganic n exported from the field sites via the mobile oxic groundwater under cropped drained fields reported by sunohara et al 2014 was 15 of the combined tile and groundwater export when measured under conventional drainage but this fraction increased to 40 when controlled water table management was investigated 5 mitigation options for n recognising that artificial drainage was the only significant contaminant export pathway at tatuanui edge of field drainage bioreactors christianson et al 2017 rivas et al 2020 could effectively reduce n exports from this site at waharoa where exports occur through the shallow groundwater as well as artificial drainage a decrease in no3 n exports could be achieved by employing water table management previously called controlled drainage this would increase flows through the reducing shallow groundwater beneath the artificial drainage however concomitant increases in nh4 n and org n loads would need to be carefully considered for n treatment of the artificial drainage exports an edge of field bioreactor could also be installed at waharoa 6 conclusions when total water flows and nutrient exports from an artificially drained site are to be quantified it is a crucial first step to consider how important the groundwater pathway might be concerning water flow the comparison of our sites suggests that vertical groundwater recharge may be insignificant where the need for artificial drainage arises from a groundwater table seasonally rising into the soil zone as at tatuanui due to impermeable conditions beneath the artificial drainage in contrast substantial recharge into the shallow groundwater may occur where artificial drainage is primarily installed to alleviate restricted percolation through the soil zone but the underlying groundwater is mobile as at waharoa however site specific investigations allowing the establishment of defensible water balances or detailed analysis and modelling of the groundwater flows will be required to obtain realistic estimates of the split between artificial drainage and groundwater flows secondly our results demonstrate that in order to accurately estimate total n exports at sites with significant groundwater recharge the redox status of the underlying groundwater system needs to be taken into account and all relevant forms of n measured for example the artificial drainage accounted for effectively all no3 n export from our waharoa site but only for 68 of the total n export from the site conversely no no3 n but approx 45 of the org n and 94 of the nh4 n were exported on the groundwater pathway it is noteworthy that dnra resulting in nh4 n generation may be an important nitrate reduction process additionally to denitrification in the saturated zone automated monitoring of the groundwater table proved very informative in our study as water table dynamics strongly affected not only drainage flow but also drainage chemistry daily average water table height and daily drainage flows were at both sites strongly linearly correlated average r2 0 88 importantly the change in the no3 n nh4 n and org n concentrations with changing drainage flow reflected the presumed vertical gradients of these n forms in the soil profile contributing to the drainage flow at the corresponding water table height these results confirmed that the vertical change in the water table height drives drainage flow and chemistry dynamics at drained sites with flat topography rather than spatial changes in the

4626,due to the energy imbalance problem that the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes is not equivalent to available energy there exists a structural error in energy balance based evapotranspiration models in this study the data driven solution was proposed to address this problem we combined three machine learning algorithms deep neural network long short term memory and random forest with observations from 69 flxunet sites to quantify instantaneous energy balance ratio ebr then corrected the energy imbalance induced structural error in evapotranspiration models the contributions of the environmental factors to the energy imbalance problem was evaluated using the sobol sensitivity analysis our results showed that the data driven methods obtained a good estimation of ebr and further decreased the error of evapotranspiration estimation the data driven solution performed well from the scale of individual site to global which demonstrated a good generalization performance the three machine learning algorithms had similar performances on overcoming the energy imbalance induced structural error friction velocity and atmospheric stability were detected as the most sensitive factors to the energy imbalance problem which can be explained by the vital influence of advection on the energy imbalance problem our work provided new insight into the improvement of evapotranspiration models keywords evapotranspiration energy imbalance problem structural error machine learning 1 introduction the law of energy conservation is the fundamental theory of energy balance based evapotranspiration models including temperature driven models and conductance driven models comprehensively reviewed by chen and liu 2020 this law is typically shown in the form of eq 1 which contains four terms net radiation rn soil heat flux g sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le however the long term global eddy covariance observations show that the available energy rn g systematically exceeds the sum of sensible and latent heat flux measurement h le which conflicts with the energy conservation law consequently the so called energy imbalance problem also energy balance closure problem brings uncertainties in the foundation and validation of evapotranspiration models 1 r n g h l e previous studies revealed the main reasons for the energy imbalance problem including 1 the inconsistent footprints of radiation soil heat flux and eddy covariance flux measurements 2 the instrument errors of the sensors 3 the neglected minor energy terms including the storage term in the canopy and air the advection fluxes caused by surface heterogeneities and non stationarity and the energy transported by low frequency motions the neglected minor energy terms can be explained by the theory of eddy covariance control volume finnigan et al 2003 aubinet et al 2012 the conservation equation for a scalar quantity χ in a control volume of height h and length of side 2l can be expressed as 2 1 4 l 2 l l l l 0 h ρ d χ t 1 ρ d u χ x ρ d v χ y ρ d w χ z 2 ρ d u χ x ρ d v χ y 3 ρ d w χ z 4 d z d x d y 1 4 l 2 l l l l 0 h s d z d x d y 5 where ρd is the dry air density u v w are horizontal lateral and vertical components of wind velocity respectively s is the source sink this conservation equation can be divided into five components 1 storage term 2 advection term 3 horizontal turbulence 4 vertical turbulence and 5 source sink inside the control volume the vertical turbulence is what the eddy covariance system measures and the other terms are the pathways of missed energy in particular there is a broad consensus in the field of micrometeorology that the advective flux is the major cause of the energy imbalance problem foken et al 2011 mauder et al 2020 in addition there are some other mechanistic explanations for the energy imbalance problem for example gao et al 2017 claimed that the variation of energy balance ratio is rooted in the phase difference between quantity and vertical velocity fluctuations up to now the understanding of the energy imbalance problem has been largely expanded but how to close the energy imbalance remains to be an opening question at the early stage the energy imbalance problem was attributed to the underestimation of eddy covariance fluxes and thus the eddy covariance fluxes were adjusted to force energy closure the residual energy was distributed to the sensible and latent heat fluxes based on the bowen ratio or directly added in latent heat flux twine et al 2000 some field experiments designed the comprehensive observation networks with multi sites and multilayer sensors and measured all terms of the energy budget to close the energy balance equation such as the ebex 2000 oncley et al 2007 similar works that paid attention to the effect of some specific energy terms such as advection heat storage and soil heat flux were also reported jacobs et al 2008 kochendorfer and paw 2011 higgins and pardyjak 2013 russell et al 2015 eshonkulov et al 2019a kutikoff et al 2019 these works confirmed the possibility of closing energy balance by comprehensive consideration of all sources of measurement unfortunately in many flux sites the observations are collected by limited sensors so there is a lack of measurements for the minor energy terms some studies turned to extract the relationship between energy imbalance and environmental factors from massive flux observations stoy et al 2013 and cui and chui 2019 explored the variation of energy balance closure using hundreds of global fluxnet research sites these works discovered the relationship between energy balance closure and environmental factors including air temperature vapor friction velocity and atmospheric stability etc the former especially stressed that the landscape scale heterogeneity has a substantial effect on energy balance closure similar analyses were also conducted in some specific regions for example some areas in europe hendricks franssen et al 2010 mcgloin et al 2018 eshonkulov et al 2019b heihe river basin in china zhou and li 2019 kruger national park in south africa majozi et al 2017 the enforcing closure method was once widely adopted and even was recommended by some practical guides of the eddy covariance system aubinet et al 2012 when using this method it is implicitly presumed that the energy balance equation with four terms net radiation soil heat flux sensible and latent heat flux strictly holds however there are some disputes about the forcing closure method imukova et al 2016 compared the eddy covariance system with the soil water balance method they found that the bowen ratio and the le post closure method led to substantially higher evapotranspiration than the water balance method in contrast the raw non adjusted eddy covariance measured evapotranspiration fluxes agreed best with water balance measured evapotranspiration in fact the forcing closure not only denies the reliability of the eddy covariance technique but also lacks solid theoretical foundations foken et al 2011 pointed out that the bowen ratio correction depends on two hypotheses the first is the scalar similarity between the sensible and latent fluxes and the second is that the sensors for temperature and humidity and their covariance with vertical velocity are equally affected by any sensor limitations however it is difficult to fulfill the two hypotheses in the real world it is theoretically rational to regard minor energy terms as the structural error of the energy balance equation eq 1 directly estimating these terms is complicated because it requires some extra information such as the spatial gradient of temperature and vapor which is rarely measured in most situations therefore quantifying the total neglected energy components indirectly from environmental factors is likely to be a feasible solution several studies about the energy balance closure parameterization are reported on the one hand some researchers such as huang et al 2008 de roo et al 2018 and zhou et al 2019 designed the models of energy balance closure based on virtual measurements obtained by large eddy simulations respectively huang et al 2008 found that the source location in the boundary layer is an important factor controlling the imbalance magnitude de roo et al 2018 showed that secondary circulation is important zhou et al 2019 revealed that the variation of flux imbalance depends on the surface heterogeneity scale and boundary layer height on the other hand other researchers for example panin and bernhofer 2008 and varmaghani et al 2019 built the schemes of energy balance closure using the actual observations with some particular assumptions panin and bernhofer 2008 emphasized the characteristics of horizontal surface heterogeneity while varmaghani et al 2019 paid attention to the effect of meteorological elements although many efforts have been made on the energy closure parameterization most of the abovementioned solutions are less effective because these solutions are built based on too idealized assumptions while the mechanism of the energy imbalance problem is so complicated eder et al 2014 evaluated the solutions of huang et al 2008 and panin and bernhofer 2008 and showed that both of the two approaches failed in the prediction of energy balance closure eder et al 2014 particularly pointed out that the large eddy simulation fails to resolve the transport process near surface and neglects the influence of an underlying heterogeneous surface zhou et al 2019 considered the effect of surface heterogeneity in large eddy simulation however they also acknowledged that the large eddy simulation based methods can only serve as the diagnostic equation but can not be used as the prognostic equation to compute the energy balance closure because some variables are unknown a priori in reality in addition most energy closure parameterizations are expressed as the multiplication of different single variable functions and thus the interaction effects between different factors are ignored due to the lack of available ways to predict energy balance closure the energy imbalance induced structural error in evapotranspiration models remains unsolved the breakthrough of data driven thoughts brings a novel insight to deal with the energy imbalance induced structural error the attraction of the data driven method is that it relies on not physical understanding but observations therefore the data driven strategy is a promising solution to those problems with too complicated and unclear mechanisms just like the energy imbalance problem in this study furthermore reichstein et al 2019 proposed that the hybrid modeling approach coupling physical process models with data driven machine learning is an optimal way to solve complex earth system science problems this thought has been applied in several lastest studies for example overcoming the model structural error in simulating soil moisture movement zhang et al 2019 the model parameter error in the estimation of turbulent heat flux hu et al 2020 following the thoughts of data driven and hybrid modeling this study defined the neglected energy terms in eq 1 as the energy imbalance induced structural error which was described using the energy balance ratio we combined global flux site observations with the machine learning algorithms to overcome the structural error and improve the accuracy of evapotranspiration modeling our contribution in this paper is three fold 1 we build the data driven ebr model using three mainstream machine learning algorithms including the deep neural networks dnn long short term memory lstm and random forest rf 2 we correct the energy imbalance problem induced structural error in evapotranspiration model using data driven ebr model 3 we evaluate the critical features for the energy imbalance problem using sensitivity analysis the novelty of this paper is to provide a prognostic solution to the structural error in the evapotranspiration model the paper is structured as follows section 2 provides the dataset and three machine learning algorithms sections 3 and 4 list the results of energy balance ratio and evapotranspiration estimation and present a discussion respectively section 5 delivers our conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites and data sixty nine flux sites fig 1 and table a1 with the observations of eddy covariance fluxes meteorological elements and soil moisture were selected from the fluxnet2015 dataset in this study the 69 sites covered ten land cover types which are evergreen needle leaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf closed shrubland csh open shrubland osh woody savannas wsa savannas sav grasslands gra permanent wetlands wet and cropland cro canopy height and instrument height were retrieved from the badm zip file on the fluxnet website the 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhance vegetation index evi were attained from mod myd13q1 datasets the observations with low quality were removed the missing data were filled using the temporal spatial filter method proposed by yuan et al 2011 then daily ndvi and lai were obtained by linear interpolation the boundary layer height zi was acquired from european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis interim era interim dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 125 and a temporal resolution of 3 h the 3 h zi data was interpolated in the half hour scale 2 2 energy balance ratio here we used the energy balance ratio to indicate the magnitude of energy imbalance 3 ebr le h r n g where rn is the net radiation wm 2 g is the soil heat flux wm 2 le is the latent heat flux wm 2 h is the sensible heat flux wm 2 in this study we focused on the energy imbalance problem at a half hourly hourly scale which was denoted as instantaneous scale to ensure the accuracy of ebr calculation the energy terms with low quality the quality flag is not equal to 0 which mean that the data is produced using gap filling method and the turbulent fluxes whose absolute value is below the detection limits 10 wm 2 according to mauder et al 2020 were excluded for the outliers of ebr we adopted the threshold values of 2 and 1 according to cui and chui 2019 the ebr values exceeding the bounds were removed finally we obtained 1 25 million instantaneous observations table 1 shows the number of sites and observations under different land cover types 2 3 environmental factors in this study several representatives and widely measured environmental factors for estimating ebr were selected as shown in table 2 some of these environmental factors have been proven to be related to ebr some additional environmental factors were considered in this work the storage terms depend on the rate of temporal variation for temperature and vapor concentration so the time derivative of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit was introduced as indicators of the storage term the land surface temperature and soil water content can indicate the water and heat conditions of the underlying surface the fraction vegetation cover and canopy height can serve as the extra information of landscape heterogeneity moreover the canopy height influences the storage term eshonkulov et al 2019b it should be pointed out that there are some other valuable environmental factors that were not taken into consideration such as the variation of land surface temperature near the eddy covariance tower xu et al 2017 zhou and li 2019 turbulent kinetic energy zhou and li 2019 because the abovementioned information was not available in the study the ratio of boundary layer height to monin obukhov length zi l which is equivalent to the ratio between friction velocity and convective velocity scale is also reported as an essential factor in the energy imbalance problem schalkwijk et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 the previous studies only discussed the effect of zi l in the convective boundary layer with a limited range for example schalkwijk et al 2016 analyzed the relationship between flux imbalance and zi l when zi l ranges from about 1000 to 0 while the zi l observation was found to vary on the order of 105 it is unclear how to determine the outliers of zi l observation we noticed that the three variables z l z zi and zi l are mutually dependent therefore we excluded zi l when building data driven ebr models the time derivatives of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were calculated using a five point stencil method the atmospheric stability was calculated by 4 ζ z m d l 5 l ρ c p u 3 t a p 0 p a 0 286 kgh where zm is the measurement

cover was estimated as follows 7 fvc ndvi n d v i s ndv i v n d v i s 2 where ndviv and ndvis refer to the ndvi of vegetation and soil respectively the detailed process of calculating ts and fvc can be seen in hu et al 2020 2 4 machine learning algorithms in this study three mainstream machine learning algorithms were employed including deep neural networks long short term memory and random forest the deep neural network has multiple fully connected layers between input and output fig 2 a considering a neural network with n layers including one input layer one output layer and n 2 hidden layers it can be expressed as follow 8 a n 1 f n w n a n b n where n indicates the ordinal of layer n 1 2 n 1 a n is the input of layer n as well as the output of layer n 1 w n and b n are the weight and bias from layer n to layer n 1 fn is the active function of layer n the deep neural network in this study consists of six layers 1 an input layer 2 four hidden layers 3 an output layer the rectified linear unit was chosen as the activation function in the hidden layers and there was no activation function in the output layer the number of neurons in hidden layers are 40 number of features 20 number of features 20 number of feature 2 number of features the long short term memory is a type of recurrent neural network fig 2 b it can combine the inputs of the current time step and network states of previous time steps thus succeeds in dealing with the problems with time dependencies compared with the original recurrent neural network the long short term memory has additional units such as cell states and gates to solve the vanishing gradient problem the following equations can describe the long short term memory 9 i t σ w ix x t w ih h t 1 b i 10 f t σ w fx x t w fh h t 1

cell at last and current time step respectively σ is the sigmoidal function tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function w and b are the weights and bias parameters respectively indicates element wise multiplication to check whether there exists a time dependency in the energy imbalance problem the long short term memory algorithm was also employed to build ebr models in this study we used a single hidden layer with 256 neurons and set the sequence length as 24 namely considering the historical information within the previous 12 h for half hourly observations and 24 h for hourly observations random forest is a kind of ensemble learning approach fig 2 c it combines multi decision trees each independent decision tree is created using a training set constructed by the bootstrap sampling method the final result is determined by averaging the output of each decision tree in this work the number of trees was set at 1000 the deep neural network and long short term memory were implemented using pytorch the random forest was implemented using scikit learn all input variables were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one before training the data driven models then the dataset was apportioned into training and test sets with a 70 30 split to evaluate the generalization performance of data driven ebr models in different scales we used three strategies building the ebr models for each site for each land cover type and building a universal model using global sites the effect of some hyperparameters including the hidden layer structure in dnn and lstm the number of trees in rf was evaluated in appendix b 2 5 evapotranspiration estimation to test the performance of data driven ebr models on overcoming the energy imbalance induced structural error we compared estimated evapotranspiration with true evapotranspiration which is the original eddy covariance observation without any energy balance closure correction the reason why we use original eddy covariance observation as the true evapotranspiration is that the energy balance closure correction essentially is to retrieve the fluxes on the ground from the fluxes on the measurement height while flux gradient similarity theory indicates that evapotranspiration models acquire the vertical fluxes in the constant flux layer which is accurately measured by eddy covariance rather than the fluxes on the ground surface three schemes of estimating evapotranspiration were evaluated in the study the first scheme does not consider the effect of the energy imbalance problem the evapotranspiration in the form of latent heat flux was estimated as follow 16 le r n g h where h is the sensible heat flux measured from the eddy covariance system without any energy balance closure correction the reason for using the measured sensible heat flux is to eliminate the uncertainty from the process of calculating sensible heat flux the second scheme corrects the energy imbalance induced structural error using the data driven ebr models 17 le e b r m r n g h where ebrm is the ebr values estimated by the data driven ebr model the third scheme follows the surface energy balance system sebs model that introduced dry and wet limitation to constrain the evapotranspiration estimation su 2002 18 le λ r l e wet 19 λ r 1 h h wet h dry h wet where λr is reference evaporation fraction lewet is the wet limitation of latent heat flux hdry and hwet are the dry and wet limitations of sensible heat flux respectively 2 6 sensitivity analysis sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 1993 was conducted to evaluate the contributions of the input variable to the output in the data driven ebr models sobol s method is a form of global sensitivity analysis approach based on variance decomposition sobol sensitivity analysis is attractive because it can measure the sensitivity across the whole input space deal with nonlinear responses and evaluate the effect of interactions in non additive systems any model can be viewed as a function 20 y f x f x 1 x 2 x d f x can be decomposed in the following way 21 y f 0 i 1 d f i x i i j d f ij x i x j f 1 2 d x 1 x 2 x d where all the terms in the functional decomposition are orthogonal the variance of model output var y can be decomposed as 22 v a r y i 1 d v i i j d v ij v 12 d 23 v i v a r x i e x ĩ y x i 24 v ij v a r x ij e x ĩ j y x i x j v i v j where vi is the contribution to var y due solely to the effect of xi and vi2 d is the contribution to var y due to interaction of x1 x2 xd so the first order index si second order index sij and total effect index sti were calculated as 25 s i v i v a r y 26 s ij va r ij v a r y 27 s ti 1 va r x ĩ v a r y the computation of sobol sensitivity analysis was implemented using the salib package because the input data were rescaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one the lower and the upper bounds of input range were set as 3 and 3 the input data of lstm are sequences and thus own inherent patterns this feature makes it difficult to generate samples therefore the sobol sensitivity analysis for lstm based models was skipped 2 7 metrics three metrics including correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse median absolute percentage error mdape were utilized to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the data driven ebr model 3 results 3 1 the variation patterns of instantaneous ebr the frequency distributions of instantaneous ebr in the selected 69 sites are diagrammed in fig 3 which are categorized based on land cover types it can be seen that the mean instantaneous ebr ranged from 0 67 to 0 87 and the standard deviation of instantaneous ebr varied from 0 33 to 0 44 the highest mean ebr appeared in csh with a value of 0 87 the lowest mean ebr occurred in wet where the frequency of negative ebr was high and the value of mean ebr was only 0 67 some different land cover types had similar mean and standard deviation values for example in the three forest land cover types the value of mean ebr was about 0 73 and the value of the standard deviation was about 0 43 similar statistical characteristics were also found in was and sav as well as gra and cro respectively all land cover types had a one peak shape in frequency distributions figs 4 and 5 display the diurnal and seasonal variations of instantaneous ebr respectively an obvious pattern that the nocturnal ebr was low while diurnal ebr was high was shown this pattern was reported by many previous studies wilson et al 2002 majozi et al 2017 the monthly mean instantaneous ebr almost kept constant in most land cover types except wet where ebr reached a plateau after september and fell to the bottom in april 3 2 evaluation of data driven ebr models performances the performances of data driven ebr models are presented in fig 6 in general the r rmse and mdape of ebr estimation ranged from 0 47 to 0 97 0 11 to 0 53 and 0 07 to 0 36 respectively in the training period the lstm algorithm significantly outperformed the dnn and rf algorithms in most cases the r rmse and mdape of lstm based ebr models varied from 0 58 to 0 96 0 11 to 0 24 0 07 to 0 18 respectively by contrast the three metrics of dnn based ebr models changed from 0 72 to 0 97 0 15 to 0 21 0 09 to 0 15 and the range of these evaluation criteria in rf based ebr models were 0 80 0 85 0 15 0 38 0 08 0 28 in the testing period all data driven ebr models showed a trend of performance degradation with the value of r rmse mdape varying from 0 47 to 0 77 0 16 to 0 53 0 09 to 0 36 respectively which indicated some overfitting in these models in addition the gaps among the three algorithms decreased and the rf algorithm performed slightly better than the lstm and dnn algorithms when building single site ebr models in global ebr models the performances of the three algorithms were similar these results indicated that considering the previous information contributed little to the improvement of ebr estimation an abnormal result was found in wet where the performance of ebr models was obviously worse than that in other land cover types with rmse and mdape reaching about 0 5 and 0 4 respectively 3 3 evaluation of evapotranspiration estimation the results of evapotranspiration estimation are displayed in fig 7 when taking no account of the effect of the energy imbalance problem a very high error in evapotranspiration estimation was found the r rmse and mdpae varied in the range of 0 35 0 76 68 02 176 18 wm 2 and 0 17 2 06 respectively by contrast correcting the energy imbalance induced structural error using data driven ebr models made dramatic improvements in evapotranspiration estimation the r reached 0 55 0 93 rmse and mdape decreased to 29 32 123 27 wm 2 and 0 13 1 31 respectively in the sebs scheme the wet and dry limitations slightly enhanced the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimation with r averagely increasing by 0 01 and rmse as well as mdape decreasing by 4 99 wm 2 and 0 19 the data driven ebr models in different scales namely single site land cover type and global obtained a very similar level of error this result proved the good generalization performance of data driven ebr models among the three machine learning algorithms lstm slightly outperformed dnn and rf when building the single site structural error models while rf performed best when building structural error models for each land cover type and global in the view of land cover types rmse decreased to about 50 wm 2 in most cases however there was no obvious improvement of evapotranspiration estimation in wet which is associated with the bad performance of the ebr model in ebf despite the great advancement after employing data driven ebr models the error of evapotranspiration estimation was still large with rmse reaching 73 19 95 79 wm 2 this high error resulted from the au wac site where the energy imbalance problem was too severe the mdape in osh significantly exceeded the level of other land cover types this high relative error was due to low le values in the au tte site where most le value is around zero 3 4 sensitivity analysis of model input variables the sensitivity analysis is illustrated using two examples dnn and rf based single site ebr models as shown in figs 8 11 the sensitivity analysis in other cases is shown in appendix c for dnn based ebr models the three factors the atmospheric stability friction velocity and land surface temperature played the dominant roles for all land cover types the meteorological elements including wind speed air temperature and vapor pressure deficit appeared less important and showed a similar level of sensitivity while some apparent variation can be seen in different land cover types the sensitivity of wind speed was relatively higher in ebf and csh while air temperature outweighed the two other meteorological elements in osh and gra the effect of the vapor pressure deficit was relatively strong in enf wet and cro the sensitivity of time derivative of air temperature was close to the three meteorological elements and even higher than them in sav by contrast the time derivative of the vapor pressure deficit had a weak effect the sensitivity of rest terms including the ratio between measurement height and boundary layer height fractional vegetation cover the standard deviation of evi soil water content canopy height were low and even approached to zero in some land cover types it can be seen that there were significant gaps between total sensitivity and first order sensitivity which indicated the strong interaction effect between these environmental factors according to the result of second order sensitivity the strong interaction mainly centered on atmospheric stability friction velocity and land surface temperature an exception was found in wet where the relatively evident interaction between vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric stability fractional vegetation cover as well as soil water content were shown when it comes to rf based ebr models there are some different results in the sensitivity analysis in most land cover types friction velocity and atmospheric stability were still the most critical factors while atmospheric stability significantly outweighed friction velocity and the sensitivity of land surface temperature dramatically decrease and nearly approach to zero in comparison with that in dnn based ebr models the evident change in the pattern of sensitivity was found in csh and wet in csh wind speed became the most sensitive factor whereas the sensitivity of friction velocity was low in wet the vapor pressure deficit had a substantial effect whereas friction velocity even had a rare contribution in the result of second order sensitivity the interaction between friction velocity and atmospheric stability was strong except for wet where strong interaction effects between air temperature and atmospheric stability and the interaction effects between vapor pressure deficit and fractional vegetation cover were shown and csh where strong interaction effect was related to wind speed the effect of land surface temperature disappeared in some land cover types such as enf ebf dbf csh 4 discussion the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the important role of friction velocity and atmospheric stability in the energy imbalance problem fig 12 furtherly presents the relationship between ebr and friction velocity and atmospheric stability it can be found that ebr is large in the condition of high friction velocity and unstable atmospheres there are some interpretations of the two factors aubinet et al 2000 considered the advection has a strong dependence on atmospheric stability and higgins 2012 further built a function for advection using atmospheric stability based on their views the strong sensitivity of atmospheric stability partially confirms that energy loss by advection component 2 in eq 2 is the main reason for the energy imbalance problem according to the studies of hendricks franssen et al 2010 and zhou and li 2019 the friction velocity indicates the mechanically induced turbulence and atmospheric stability represent the joint effect of mechanically induced and thermally induced turbulence both of the two factors can quantify the mixing degree of atmospheric turbulence the more strongly the atmospheric turbulence mixes the more homogeneous the atmosphere is which results in fewer advection fluxes this explanation also proves the vital influence of advection on the energy imbalance problem the wind speed air temperature and vapor pressure deficit implicitly contain the information of energy imbalance the advection can change the state of air parcels in psychrometrics eagleson 2002 yang 2014 thus these three variables took effect in data driven ebr models to a certain extent on the other hand cui and chui 2019 explained the influence of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit on ebr in the view of stomata the direct link between land surface temperature and energy imbalance problem was rarely reported the land surface temperature is related to heat transport so the strong sensitivity of land surface temperature in dnn based ebr models implies that the missing energy is possibly transported in the form of heat instead of water vapor mauder et al 2018 also extracted the importance of vertical temperature gradient using the method of principal component analysis which suggests the important role of heat transport in the energy imbalance problem however the entirely different sensitivity of land surface temperature between dnn and rf algorithms is confusing and remains uninterpreted the low sensitivity of time derivative of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit proves that the storage term in the air component 1 in eq 2 makes few contributions to the energy imbalance problem a similar conclusion was drawn by some previous studies such as oncley et al 2007 kutikoff et al 2019 however leuning et al 2012 claimed that heat storage plays an important role in energy imbalance problem while advection is possibly small in forest sites this conclusion is not supported by the low sensitivity of time derivative and the interaction effect between time derivative and canopy height another possible reason for the low sensitivity is that advection and storage are important during nighttime conditions while the model primarily captures day vs night it should be noted that other media such as biomass and soil also store energy the information related to these storage terms was not considered in this work moreover oncley et al 2007 and kutikoff et al 2019 pointed out that amount of storage term in the soil is large but in other studies for example russell et al 2015 regarded the storage term in the soil as one part of soil heat flux in this study there was an ambiguity about whether storage term in soil was added in soil heat flux this ambiguity affects the rationality of feature selection namely whether considering the environmental factors related to storage terms in soil the surface heterogeneity is a widely acknowledged reason for the energy imbalance problem however the standard deviation of evi seemingly failed to take effect in data driven ebr models zhou and li 2019 showed that the standard deviation of land surface temperature has a stronger relationship with ebr than the standard deviation of evi in fact surface heterogeneity can be described in different aspects such as terrain complexity wilson et al 2002 geometric roughness panin and bernhofer 2008 land surface temperature xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 zhou and li 2019 etc in addition the standard deviation may not be the best index to quantify surface heterogeneity considering other forms of surface heterogeneity perhaps will improve the ebr models another unexpected phenomenon is the weak sensitivity of the ratio of measurement height to boundary layer height this environmental factor is considered as a key variable in the large eddy simulation based studies of the energy imbalance problem eder et al 2014 also reported the weak correlation between energy imbalance and boundary layer height in joint measurements of aircraft and tower they attributed the weak correlation to the uncertainty of boundary layer height and the mismatch between large eddy simulation and reality which are likely to be the reasons for the low sensitivity in this study lstm algorithm that owns an advantage in considering history information was not obviously superior to the other two algorithms this result implied that there is no strong temporal relationship in the half hourly hourly energy imbalance problem the weak temporal relationship is understandable because the atmospheric boundary layer responds to changes in surface radiative forcing in an hour or less it should be admitted that there are several limitations to our study firstly some valuable environmental factors were ignored in this study zhou and li 2019 claimed that the turbulent kinetic energy is the main factor affecting the diurnal variation of ebr in wet data driven ebr models performed badly the lack of water body information is a possible reason because the heat storage in the water body is considerable burba et al 1999 the variation of instantaneous ebr in some sites does not match the general pattern shown in figs 4 and 5 fig 13 presented some some sites mismatching the general pattern of ebr variations for example in au lox which is a dbf site there is no plateau at nighttime in au whr which is an ebf site there is no steep drop during 17 00 18 00 ru fyo which is an enf site has higher ebr values during nighttime the ebr in in it tor which is a gra site reaches a plateau from june to october while falls down in february this result indicates that some site specific features need to be extracted then ebr calculated by eddy covariance observations contains the errors from instruments and mismatch in footprints although the two errors are claimed to be ruled out as the major contributors of missing energy mauder et al 2020 there is no a priori knowledge about the accurate value of these errors in the flxunet 2015 dataset so it is unclear whether the instrumental error and footprint mismatch error will cover up the structural error from neglected energy terms especially in the heterogeneous surface last the data driven models can predict the ebr thus is practicable in comparison with those diagnostic equations such as huang et al 2008 zhou et al 2019 nevertheless they have insufficient interpretability which is an inherent defect in the data driven method the sensitivity analysis offers some insights but is far away to explicitly describe the mechanism of the energy imbalance problem 5 conclusions in this study we proposed the data driven ebr models using three mainstream machine learning algorithms deep neural network long short term memory and random forest we applied the data driven ebr models to overcome the energy imbalance induced structural error in the evapotranspiration model the main findings are summarized as 1 the data driven methods can obtain a good estimation of energy balance ratio and further significantly decrease energy imbalance induced structural error in the evapotranspiration model the data driven ebr models have good generalization abilities and can perform well from the scale of the individual site to global 2 the three machine learning algorithms have similar performance on addressing the energy imbalance induced structural error 3 sobol sensitivity analysis shows that the friction velocity and atmospheric stability are the two most important factors for the energy imbalance problem wind speed air temperature and vapor pressure deficit appear less important the time derivative of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit the ratio between measurement height and boundary layer height as well as indexes quantifying the surface heterogeneity have few influences on the energy imbalance problem one novelty of this study is to offer a prognostic and practicable solution to quantify the structural error in the evapotranspiration models such as penman monteith model the sebs model because the data driven model is universal and all input variables are easily obtainable the two micrometeorological elements friction velocity and atmospheric stability which are measured by the eddy covariance system can be estimated from conventional meteorological data using the monin obukhov similarity theory thus the data driven ebr models are convenient to be added in evapotranspiration models as a structural error correction module the future research on energy imbalance induced structural errors deserves to be investigated in two aspects the one is to find other valuable environmental factors to improve the accuracy of ebr estimation the other one is to extend data driven ebr models at different time scales credit authorship contribution statement xiaolong hu conceptualization methodology software

upon request appendix a the information on the 69 eddy covariance sites is listed in table a1 appendix b to determine the appropriate hyperparameters the effect of hyperparameters in three machine learning algorithms was evaluated the computational cost will be too heavy if searching the whole hyperparameters space therefore we only tested several cases which are listed in table a2 figs a1 a3 show the evaluation of hyperparameters in different land cover types in the deep neural network and long short term memory algorithms with the increase of structural complexity of networks the training error was significantly decreased while the testing error was slightly reduced the gap between training error and testing error was relatively large when building single site ebr models this result is likely due to the sample size in the random forest algorithm the number of trees almost did not affect the training and testing errors appendix c the sensitivity analysis of data driven models for each land cover type and global are shown in figs a4 a9 the patterns of sensitivity were similar to that of the single site ebr models 
4626,due to the energy imbalance problem that the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes is not equivalent to available energy there exists a structural error in energy balance based evapotranspiration models in this study the data driven solution was proposed to address this problem we combined three machine learning algorithms deep neural network long short term memory and random forest with observations from 69 flxunet sites to quantify instantaneous energy balance ratio ebr then corrected the energy imbalance induced structural error in evapotranspiration models the contributions of the environmental factors to the energy imbalance problem was evaluated using the sobol sensitivity analysis our results showed that the data driven methods obtained a good estimation of ebr and further decreased the error of evapotranspiration estimation the data driven solution performed well from the scale of individual site to global which demonstrated a good generalization performance the three machine learning algorithms had similar performances on overcoming the energy imbalance induced structural error friction velocity and atmospheric stability were detected as the most sensitive factors to the energy imbalance problem which can be explained by the vital influence of advection on the energy imbalance problem our work provided new insight into the improvement of evapotranspiration models keywords evapotranspiration energy imbalance problem structural error machine learning 1 introduction the law of energy conservation is the fundamental theory of energy balance based evapotranspiration models including temperature driven models and conductance driven models comprehensively reviewed by chen and liu 2020 this law is typically shown in the form of eq 1 which contains four terms net radiation rn soil heat flux g sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le however the long term global eddy covariance observations show that the available energy rn g systematically exceeds the sum of sensible and latent heat flux measurement h le which conflicts with the energy conservation law consequently the so called energy imbalance problem also energy balance closure problem brings uncertainties in the foundation and validation of evapotranspiration models 1 r n g h l e previous studies revealed the main reasons for the energy imbalance problem including 1 the inconsistent footprints of radiation soil heat flux and eddy covariance flux measurements 2 the instrument errors of the sensors 3 the neglected minor energy terms including the storage term in the canopy and air the advection fluxes caused by surface heterogeneities and non stationarity and the energy transported by low frequency motions the neglected minor energy terms can be explained by the theory of eddy covariance control volume finnigan et al 2003 aubinet et al 2012 the conservation equation for a scalar quantity χ in a control volume of height h and length of side 2l can be expressed as 2 1 4 l 2 l l l l 0 h ρ d χ t 1 ρ d u χ x ρ d v χ y ρ d w χ z 2 ρ d u χ x ρ d v χ y 3 ρ d w χ z 4 d z d x d y 1 4 l 2 l l l l 0 h s d z d x d y 5 where ρd is the dry air density u v w are horizontal lateral and vertical components of wind velocity respectively s is the source sink this conservation equation can be divided into five components 1 storage term 2 advection term 3 horizontal turbulence 4 vertical turbulence and 5 source sink inside the control volume the vertical turbulence is what the eddy covariance system measures and the other terms are the pathways of missed energy in particular there is a broad consensus in the field of micrometeorology that the advective flux is the major cause of the energy imbalance problem foken et al 2011 mauder et al 2020 in addition there are some other mechanistic explanations for the energy imbalance problem for example gao et al 2017 claimed that the variation of energy balance ratio is rooted in the phase difference between quantity and vertical velocity fluctuations up to now the understanding of the energy imbalance problem has been largely expanded but how to close the energy imbalance remains to be an opening question at the early stage the energy imbalance problem was attributed to the underestimation of eddy covariance fluxes and thus the eddy covariance fluxes were adjusted to force energy closure the residual energy was distributed to the sensible and latent heat fluxes based on the bowen ratio or directly added in latent heat flux twine et al 2000 some field experiments designed the comprehensive observation networks with multi sites and multilayer sensors and measured all terms of the energy budget to close the energy balance equation such as the ebex 2000 oncley et al 2007 similar works that paid attention to the effect of some specific energy terms such as advection heat storage and soil heat flux were also reported jacobs et al 2008 kochendorfer and paw 2011 higgins and pardyjak 2013 russell et al 2015 eshonkulov et al 2019a kutikoff et al 2019 these works confirmed the possibility of closing energy balance by comprehensive consideration of all sources of measurement unfortunately in many flux sites the observations are collected by limited sensors so there is a lack of measurements for the minor energy terms some studies turned to extract the relationship between energy imbalance and environmental factors from massive flux observations stoy et al 2013 and cui and chui 2019 explored the variation of energy balance closure using hundreds of global fluxnet research sites these works discovered the relationship between energy balance closure and environmental factors including air temperature vapor friction velocity and atmospheric stability etc the former especially stressed that the landscape scale heterogeneity has a substantial effect on energy balance closure similar analyses were also conducted in some specific regions for example some areas in europe hendricks franssen et al 2010 mcgloin et al 2018 eshonkulov et al 2019b heihe river basin in china zhou and li 2019 kruger national park in south africa majozi et al 2017 the enforcing closure method was once widely adopted and even was recommended by some practical guides of the eddy covariance system aubinet et al 2012 when using this method it is implicitly presumed that the energy balance equation with four terms net radiation soil heat flux sensible and latent heat flux strictly holds however there are some disputes about the forcing closure method imukova et al 2016 compared the eddy covariance system with the soil water balance method they found that the bowen ratio and the le post closure method led to substantially higher evapotranspiration than the water balance method in contrast the raw non adjusted eddy covariance measured evapotranspiration fluxes agreed best with water balance measured evapotranspiration in fact the forcing closure not only denies the reliability of the eddy covariance technique but also lacks solid theoretical foundations foken et al 2011 pointed out that the bowen ratio correction depends on two hypotheses the first is the scalar similarity between the sensible and latent fluxes and the second is that the sensors for temperature and humidity and their covariance with vertical velocity are equally affected by any sensor limitations however it is difficult to fulfill the two hypotheses in the real world it is theoretically rational to regard minor energy terms as the structural error of the energy balance equation eq 1 directly estimating these terms is complicated because it requires some extra information such as the spatial gradient of temperature and vapor which is rarely measured in most situations therefore quantifying the total neglected energy components indirectly from environmental factors is likely to be a feasible solution several studies about the energy balance closure parameterization are reported on the one hand some researchers such as huang et al 2008 de roo et al 2018 and zhou et al 2019 designed the models of energy balance closure based on virtual measurements obtained by large eddy simulations respectively huang et al 2008 found that the source location in the boundary layer is an important factor controlling the imbalance magnitude de roo et al 2018 showed that secondary circulation is important zhou et al 2019 revealed that the variation of flux imbalance depends on the surface heterogeneity scale and boundary layer height on the other hand other researchers for example panin and bernhofer 2008 and varmaghani et al 2019 built the schemes of energy balance closure using the actual observations with some particular assumptions panin and bernhofer 2008 emphasized the characteristics of horizontal surface heterogeneity while varmaghani et al 2019 paid attention to the effect of meteorological elements although many efforts have been made on the energy closure parameterization most of the abovementioned solutions are less effective because these solutions are built based on too idealized assumptions while the mechanism of the energy imbalance problem is so complicated eder et al 2014 evaluated the solutions of huang et al 2008 and panin and bernhofer 2008 and showed that both of the two approaches failed in the prediction of energy balance closure eder et al 2014 particularly pointed out that the large eddy simulation fails to resolve the transport process near surface and neglects the influence of an underlying heterogeneous surface zhou et al 2019 considered the effect of surface heterogeneity in large eddy simulation however they also acknowledged that the large eddy simulation based methods can only serve as the diagnostic equation but can not be used as the prognostic equation to compute the energy balance closure because some variables are unknown a priori in reality in addition most energy closure parameterizations are expressed as the multiplication of different single variable functions and thus the interaction effects between different factors are ignored due to the lack of available ways to predict energy balance closure the energy imbalance induced structural error in evapotranspiration models remains unsolved the breakthrough of data driven thoughts brings a novel insight to deal with the energy imbalance induced structural error the attraction of the data driven method is that it relies on not physical understanding but observations therefore the data driven strategy is a promising solution to those problems with too complicated and unclear mechanisms just like the energy imbalance problem in this study furthermore reichstein et al 2019 proposed that the hybrid modeling approach coupling physical process models with data driven machine learning is an optimal way to solve complex earth system science problems this thought has been applied in several lastest studies for example overcoming the model structural error in simulating soil moisture movement zhang et al 2019 the model parameter error in the estimation of turbulent heat flux hu et al 2020 following the thoughts of data driven and hybrid modeling this study defined the neglected energy terms in eq 1 as the energy imbalance induced structural error which was described using the energy balance ratio we combined global flux site observations with the machine learning algorithms to overcome the structural error and improve the accuracy of evapotranspiration modeling our contribution in this paper is three fold 1 we build the data driven ebr model using three mainstream machine learning algorithms including the deep neural networks dnn long short term memory lstm and random forest rf 2 we correct the energy imbalance problem induced structural error in evapotranspiration model using data driven ebr model 3 we evaluate the critical features for the energy imbalance problem using sensitivity analysis the novelty of this paper is to provide a prognostic solution to the structural error in the evapotranspiration model the paper is structured as follows section 2 provides the dataset and three machine learning algorithms sections 3 and 4 list the results of energy balance ratio and evapotranspiration estimation and present a discussion respectively section 5 delivers our conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites and data sixty nine flux sites fig 1 and table a1 with the observations of eddy covariance fluxes meteorological elements and soil moisture were selected from the fluxnet2015 dataset in this study the 69 sites covered ten land cover types which are evergreen needle leaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf closed shrubland csh open shrubland osh woody savannas wsa savannas sav grasslands gra permanent wetlands wet and cropland cro canopy height and instrument height were retrieved from the badm zip file on the fluxnet website the 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhance vegetation index evi were attained from mod myd13q1 datasets the observations with low quality were removed the missing data were filled using the temporal spatial filter method proposed by yuan et al 2011 then daily ndvi and lai were obtained by linear interpolation the boundary layer height zi was acquired from european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis interim era interim dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 125 and a temporal resolution of 3 h the 3 h zi data was interpolated in the half hour scale 2 2 energy balance ratio here we used the energy balance ratio to indicate the magnitude of energy imbalance 3 ebr le h r n g where rn is the net radiation wm 2 g is the soil heat flux wm 2 le is the latent heat flux wm 2 h is the sensible heat flux wm 2 in this study we focused on the energy imbalance problem at a half hourly hourly scale which was denoted as instantaneous scale to ensure the accuracy of ebr calculation the energy terms with low quality the quality flag is not equal to 0 which mean that the data is produced using gap filling method and the turbulent fluxes whose absolute value is below the detection limits 10 wm 2 according to mauder et al 2020 were excluded for the outliers of ebr we adopted the threshold values of 2 and 1 according to cui and chui 2019 the ebr values exceeding the bounds were removed finally we obtained 1 25 million instantaneous observations table 1 shows the number of sites and observations under different land cover types 2 3 environmental factors in this study several representatives and widely measured environmental factors for estimating ebr were selected as shown in table 2 some of these environmental factors have been proven to be related to ebr some additional environmental factors were considered in this work the storage terms depend on the rate of temporal variation for temperature and vapor concentration so the time derivative of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit was introduced as indicators of the storage term the land surface temperature and soil water content can indicate the water and heat conditions of the underlying surface the fraction vegetation cover and canopy height can serve as the extra information of landscape heterogeneity moreover the canopy height influences the storage term eshonkulov et al 2019b it should be pointed out that there are some other valuable environmental factors that were not taken into consideration such as the variation of land surface temperature near the eddy covariance tower xu et al 2017 zhou and li 2019 turbulent kinetic energy zhou and li 2019 because the abovementioned information was not available in the study the ratio of boundary layer height to monin obukhov length zi l which is equivalent to the ratio between friction velocity and convective velocity scale is also reported as an essential factor in the energy imbalance problem schalkwijk et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 the previous studies only discussed the effect of zi l in the convective boundary layer with a limited range for example schalkwijk et al 2016 analyzed the relationship between flux imbalance and zi l when zi l ranges from about 1000 to 0 while the zi l observation was found to vary on the order of 105 it is unclear how to determine the outliers of zi l observation we noticed that the three variables z l z zi and zi l are mutually dependent therefore we excluded zi l when building data driven ebr models the time derivatives of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were calculated using a five point stencil method the atmospheric stability was calculated by 4 ζ z m d l 5 l ρ c p u 3 t a p 0 p a 0 286 kgh where zm is the measurement height m d is the zero plane displacement and set as 0 67hc l is monin obukhov length m ρ is air density kg m 3 cp is the specific heat for air 1004 7 j kg 1 k 1 p0 is the reference pressure 105 pa pa

cover was estimated as follows 7 fvc ndvi n d v i s ndv i v n d v i s 2 where ndviv and ndvis refer to the ndvi of vegetation and soil respectively the detailed process of calculating ts and fvc can be seen in hu et al 2020 2 4 machine learning algorithms in this study three mainstream machine learning algorithms were employed including deep neural networks long short term memory and random forest the deep neural network has multiple fully connected layers between input and output fig 2 a considering a neural network with n layers including one input layer one output layer and n 2 hidden layers it can be expressed as follow 8 a n 1 f n w n a n b n where n indicates the ordinal of layer n 1 2 n 1 a n is the input of layer n as well as the output of layer n 1 w n and b n are the weight and bias from layer n to layer n 1 fn is the active function of layer n the deep neural network in this study consists of six layers 1 an input layer 2 four hidden layers 3 an output layer the rectified linear unit was chosen as the activation function in the hidden layers and there was no activation function in the output layer the number of neurons in hidden layers are 40 number of features 20 number of features 20 number of feature 2 number of features the long short term memory is a type of recurrent neural network fig 2 b it can combine the inputs of the current time step and network states of previous time steps thus succeeds in dealing with the problems with time dependencies compared with the original recurrent neural network the long short term memory has additional units such as cell states and gates to solve the vanishing gradient problem the following equations can describe the long short term memory 9 i t σ w ix x t w ih h t 1 b i 10 f t σ w fx x t w fh h t 1

cell at last and current time step respectively σ is the sigmoidal function tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function w and b are the weights and bias parameters respectively indicates element wise multiplication to check whether there exists a time dependency in the energy imbalance problem the long short term memory algorithm was also employed to build ebr models in this study we used a single hidden layer with 256 neurons and set the sequence length as 24 namely considering the historical information within the previous 12 h for half hourly observations and 24 h for hourly observations random forest is a kind of ensemble learning approach fig 2 c it combines multi decision trees each independent decision tree is created using a training set constructed by the bootstrap sampling method the final result is determined by averaging the output of each decision tree in this work the number of trees was set at 1000 the deep neural network and long short term memory were implemented using pytorch the random forest was implemented using scikit learn all input variables were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one before training the data driven models then the dataset was apportioned into training and test sets with a 70 30 split to evaluate the generalization performance of data driven ebr models in different scales we used three strategies building the ebr models for each site for each land cover type and building a universal model using global sites the effect of some hyperparameters including the hidden layer structure in dnn and lstm the number of trees in rf was evaluated in appendix b 2 5 evapotranspiration estimation to test the performance of data driven ebr models on overcoming the energy imbalance induced structural error we compared estimated evapotranspiration with true evapotranspiration which is the original eddy covariance observation without any energy balance closure correction the reason why we use original eddy covariance observation as the true evapotranspiration is that the energy balance closure correction essentially is to retrieve the fluxes on the ground from the fluxes on the measurement height while flux gradient similarity theory indicates that evapotranspiration models acquire the vertical fluxes in the constant flux layer which is accurately measured by eddy covariance rather than the fluxes on the ground surface three schemes of estimating evapotranspiration were evaluated in the study the first scheme does not consider the effect of the energy imbalance problem the evapotranspiration in the form of latent heat flux was estimated as follow 16 le r n g h where h is the sensible heat flux measured from the eddy covariance system without any energy balance closure correction the reason for using the measured sensible heat flux is to eliminate the uncertainty from the process of calculating sensible heat flux the second scheme corrects the energy imbalance induced structural error using the data driven ebr models 17 le e b r m r n g h where ebrm is the ebr values estimated by the data driven ebr model the third scheme follows the surface energy balance system sebs model that introduced dry and wet limitation to constrain the evapotranspiration estimation su 2002 18 le λ r l e wet 19 λ r 1 h h wet h dry h wet where λr is reference evaporation fraction lewet is the wet limitation of latent heat flux hdry and hwet are the dry and wet limitations of sensible heat flux respectively 2 6 sensitivity analysis sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 1993 was conducted to evaluate the contributions of the input variable to the output in the data driven ebr models sobol s method is a form of global sensitivity analysis approach based on variance decomposition sobol sensitivity analysis is attractive because it can measure the sensitivity across the whole input space deal with nonlinear responses and evaluate the effect of interactions in non additive systems any model can be viewed as a function 20 y f x f x 1 x 2 x d f x can be decomposed in the following way 21 y f 0 i 1 d f i x i i j d f ij x i x j f 1 2 d x 1 x 2 x d where all the terms in the functional decomposition are orthogonal the variance of model output var y can be decomposed as 22 v a r y i 1 d v i i j d v ij v 12 d 23 v i v a r x i e x ĩ y x i 24 v ij v a r x ij e x ĩ j y x i x j v i v j where vi is the contribution to var y due solely to the effect of xi and vi2 d is the contribution to var y due to interaction of x1 x2 xd so the first order index si second order index sij and total effect index sti were calculated as 25 s i v i v a r y 26 s ij va r ij v a r y 27 s ti 1 va r x ĩ v a r y the computation of sobol sensitivity analysis was implemented using the salib package because the input data were rescaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one the lower and the upper bounds of input range were set as 3 and 3 the input data of lstm are sequences and thus own inherent patterns this feature makes it difficult to generate samples therefore the sobol sensitivity analysis for lstm based models was skipped 2 7 metrics three metrics including correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse median absolute percentage error mdape were utilized to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the data driven ebr model 3 results 3 1 the variation patterns of instantaneous ebr the frequency distributions of instantaneous ebr in the selected 69 sites are diagrammed in fig 3 which are categorized based on land cover types it can be seen that the mean instantaneous ebr ranged from 0 67 to 0 87 and the standard deviation of instantaneous ebr varied from 0 33 to 0 44 the highest mean ebr appeared in csh with a value of 0 87 the lowest mean ebr occurred in wet where the frequency of negative ebr was high and the value of mean ebr was only 0 67 some different land cover types had similar mean and standard deviation values for example in the three forest land cover types the value of mean ebr was about 0 73 and the value of the standard deviation was about 0 43 similar statistical characteristics were also found in was and sav as well as gra and cro respectively all land cover types had a one peak shape in frequency distributions figs 4 and 5 display the diurnal and seasonal variations of instantaneous ebr respectively an obvious pattern that the nocturnal ebr was low while diurnal ebr was high was shown this pattern was reported by many previous studies wilson et al 2002 majozi et al 2017 the monthly mean instantaneous ebr almost kept constant in most land cover types except wet where ebr reached a plateau after september and fell to the bottom in april 3 2 evaluation of data driven ebr models performances the performances of data driven ebr models are presented in fig 6 in general the r rmse and mdape of ebr estimation ranged from 0 47 to 0 97 0 11 to 0 53 and 0 07 to 0 36 respectively in the training period the lstm algorithm significantly outperformed the dnn and rf algorithms in most cases the r rmse and mdape of lstm based ebr models varied from 0 58 to 0 96 0 11 to 0 24 0 07 to 0 18 respectively by contrast the three metrics of dnn based ebr models changed from 0 72 to 0 97 0 15 to 0 21 0 09 to 0 15 and the range of these evaluation criteria in rf based ebr models were 0 80 0 85 0 15 0 38 0 08 0 28 in the testing period all data driven ebr models showed a trend of performance degradation with the value of r rmse mdape varying from 0 47 to 0 77 0 16 to 0 53 0 09 to 0 36 respectively which indicated some overfitting in these models in addition the gaps among the three algorithms decreased and the rf algorithm performed slightly better than the lstm and dnn algorithms when building single site ebr models in global ebr models the performances of the three algorithms were similar these results indicated that considering the previous information contributed little to the improvement of ebr estimation an abnormal result was found in wet where the performance of ebr models was obviously worse than that in other land cover types with rmse and mdape reaching about 0 5 and 0 4 respectively 3 3 evaluation of evapotranspiration estimation the results of evapotranspiration estimation are displayed in fig 7 when taking no account of the effect of the energy imbalance problem a very high error in evapotranspiration estimation was found the r rmse and mdpae varied in the range of 0 35 0 76 68 02 176 18 wm 2 and 0 17 2 06 respectively by contrast correcting the energy imbalance induced structural error using data driven ebr models made dramatic improvements in evapotranspiration estimation the r reached 0 55 0 93 rmse and mdape decreased to 29 32 123 27 wm 2 and 0 13 1 31 respectively in the sebs scheme the wet and dry limitations slightly enhanced the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimation with r averagely increasing by 0 01 and rmse as well as mdape decreasing by 4 99 wm 2 and 0 19 the data driven ebr models in different scales namely single site land cover type and global obtained a very similar level of error this result proved the good generalization performance of data driven ebr models among the three machine learning algorithms lstm slightly outperformed dnn and rf when building the single site structural error models while rf performed best when building structural error models for each land cover type and global in the view of land cover types rmse decreased to about 50 wm 2 in most cases however there was no obvious improvement of evapotranspiration estimation in wet which is associated with the bad performance of the ebr model in ebf despite the great advancement after employing data driven ebr models the error of evapotranspiration estimation was still large with rmse reaching 73 19 95 79 wm 2 this high error resulted from the au wac site where the energy imbalance problem was too severe the mdape in osh significantly exceeded the level of other land cover types this high relative error was due to low le values in the au tte site where most le value is around zero 3 4 sensitivity analysis of model input variables the sensitivity analysis is illustrated using two examples dnn and rf based single site ebr models as shown in figs 8 11 the sensitivity analysis in other cases is shown in appendix c for dnn based ebr models the three factors the atmospheric stability friction velocity and land surface temperature played the dominant roles for all land cover types the meteorological elements including wind speed air temperature and vapor pressure deficit appeared less important and showed a similar level of sensitivity while some apparent variation can be seen in different land cover types the sensitivity of wind speed was relatively higher in ebf and csh while air temperature outweighed the two other meteorological elements in osh and gra the effect of the vapor pressure deficit was relatively strong in enf wet and cro the sensitivity of time derivative of air temperature was close to the three meteorological elements and even higher than them in sav by contrast the time derivative of the vapor pressure deficit had a weak effect the sensitivity of rest terms including the ratio between measurement height and boundary layer height fractional vegetation cover the standard deviation of evi soil water content canopy height were low and even approached to zero in some land cover types it can be seen that there were significant gaps between total sensitivity and first order sensitivity which indicated the strong interaction effect between these environmental factors according to the result of second order sensitivity the strong interaction mainly centered on atmospheric stability friction velocity and land surface temperature an exception was found in wet where the relatively evident interaction between vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric stability fractional vegetation cover as well as soil water content were shown when it comes to rf based ebr models there are some different results in the sensitivity analysis in most land cover types friction velocity and atmospheric stability were still the most critical factors while atmospheric stability significantly outweighed friction velocity and the sensitivity of land surface temperature dramatically decrease and nearly approach to zero in comparison with that in dnn based ebr models the evident change in the pattern of sensitivity was found in csh and wet in csh wind speed became the most sensitive factor whereas the sensitivity of friction velocity was low in wet the vapor pressure deficit had a substantial effect whereas friction velocity even had a rare contribution in the result of second order sensitivity the interaction between friction velocity and atmospheric stability was strong except for wet where strong interaction effects between air temperature and atmospheric stability and the interaction effects between vapor pressure deficit and fractional vegetation cover were shown and csh where strong interaction effect was related to wind speed the effect of land surface temperature disappeared in some land cover types such as enf ebf dbf csh 4 discussion the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the important role of friction velocity and atmospheric stability in the energy imbalance problem fig 12 furtherly presents the relationship between ebr and friction velocity and atmospheric stability it can be found that ebr is large in the condition of high friction velocity and unstable atmospheres there are some interpretations of the two factors aubinet et al 2000 considered the advection has a strong dependence on atmospheric stability and higgins 2012 further built a function for advection using atmospheric stability based on their views the strong sensitivity of atmospheric stability partially confirms that energy loss by advection component 2 in eq 2 is the main reason for the energy imbalance problem according to the studies of hendricks franssen et al 2010 and zhou and li 2019 the friction velocity indicates the mechanically induced turbulence and atmospheric stability represent the joint effect of mechanically induced and thermally induced turbulence both of the two factors can quantify the mixing degree of atmospheric turbulence the more strongly the atmospheric turbulence mixes the more homogeneous the atmosphere is which results in fewer advection fluxes this explanation also proves the vital influence of advection on the energy imbalance problem the wind speed air temperature and vapor pressure deficit implicitly contain the information of energy imbalance the advection can change the state of air parcels in psychrometrics eagleson 2002 yang 2014 thus these three variables took effect in data driven ebr models to a certain extent on the other hand cui and chui 2019 explained the influence of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit on ebr in the view of stomata the direct link between land surface temperature and energy imbalance problem was rarely reported the land surface temperature is related to heat transport so the strong sensitivity of land surface temperature in dnn based ebr models implies that the missing energy is possibly transported in the form of heat instead of water vapor mauder et al 2018 also extracted the importance of vertical temperature gradient using the method of principal component analysis which suggests the important role of heat transport in the energy imbalance problem however the entirely different sensitivity of land surface temperature between dnn and rf algorithms is confusing and remains uninterpreted the low sensitivity of time derivative of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit proves that the storage term in the air component 1 in eq 2 makes few contributions to the energy imbalance problem a similar conclusion was drawn by some previous studies such as oncley et al 2007 kutikoff et al 2019 however leuning et al 2012 claimed that heat storage plays an important role in energy imbalance problem while advection is possibly small in forest sites this conclusion is not supported by the low sensitivity of time derivative and the interaction effect between time derivative and canopy height another possible reason for the low sensitivity is that advection and storage are important during nighttime conditions while the model primarily captures day vs night it should be noted that other media such as biomass and soil also store energy the information related to these storage terms was not considered in this work moreover oncley et al 2007 and kutikoff et al 2019 pointed out that amount of storage term in the soil is large but in other studies for example russell et al 2015 regarded the storage term in the soil as one part of soil heat flux in this study there was an ambiguity about whether storage term in soil was added in soil heat flux this ambiguity affects the rationality of feature selection namely whether considering the environmental factors related to storage terms in soil the surface heterogeneity is a widely acknowledged reason for the energy imbalance problem however the standard deviation of evi seemingly failed to take effect in data driven ebr models zhou and li 2019 showed that the standard deviation of land surface temperature has a stronger relationship with ebr than the standard deviation of evi in fact surface heterogeneity can be described in different aspects such as terrain complexity wilson et al 2002 geometric roughness panin and bernhofer 2008 land surface temperature xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 zhou and li 2019 etc in addition the standard deviation may not be the best index to quantify surface heterogeneity considering other forms of surface heterogeneity perhaps will improve the ebr models another unexpected phenomenon is the weak sensitivity of the ratio of measurement height to boundary layer height this environmental factor is considered as a key variable in the large eddy simulation based studies of the energy imbalance problem eder et al 2014 also reported the weak correlation between energy imbalance and boundary layer height in joint measurements of aircraft and tower they attributed the weak correlation to the uncertainty of boundary layer height and the mismatch between large eddy simulation and reality which are likely to be the reasons for the low sensitivity in this study lstm algorithm that owns an advantage in considering history information was not obviously superior to the other two algorithms this result implied that there is no strong temporal relationship in the half hourly hourly energy imbalance problem the weak temporal relationship is understandable because the atmospheric boundary layer responds to changes in surface radiative forcing in an hour or less it should be admitted that there are several limitations to our study firstly some valuable environmental factors were ignored in this study zhou and li 2019 claimed that the turbulent kinetic energy is the main factor affecting the diurnal variation of ebr in wet data driven ebr models performed badly the lack of water body information is a possible reason because the heat storage in the water body is considerable burba et al 1999 the variation of instantaneous ebr in some sites does not match the general pattern shown in figs 4 and 5 fig 13 presented some some sites mismatching the general pattern of ebr variations for example in au lox which is a dbf site there is no plateau at nighttime in au whr which is an ebf site there is no steep drop during 17 00 18 00 ru fyo which is an enf site has higher ebr values during nighttime the ebr in in it tor which is a gra site reaches a plateau from june to october while falls down in february this result indicates that some site specific features need to be extracted then ebr calculated by eddy covariance observations contains the errors from instruments and mismatch in footprints although the two errors are claimed to be ruled out as the major contributors of missing energy mauder et al 2020 there is no a priori knowledge about the accurate value of these errors in the flxunet 2015 dataset so it is unclear whether the instrumental error and footprint mismatch error will cover up the structural error from neglected energy terms especially in the heterogeneous surface last the data driven models can predict the ebr thus is practicable in comparison with those diagnostic equations such as huang et al 2008 zhou et al 2019 nevertheless they have insufficient interpretability which is an inherent defect in the data driven method the sensitivity analysis offers some insights but is far away to explicitly describe the mechanism of the energy imbalance problem 5 conclusions in this study we proposed the data driven ebr models using three mainstream machine learning algorithms deep neural network long short term memory and random forest we applied the data driven ebr models to overcome the energy imbalance induced structural error in the evapotranspiration model the main findings are summarized as 1 the data driven methods can obtain a good estimation of energy balance ratio and further significantly decrease energy imbalance induced structural error in the evapotranspiration model the data driven ebr models have good generalization abilities and can perform well from the scale of the individual site to global 2 the three machine learning algorithms have similar performance on addressing the energy imbalance induced structural error 3 sobol sensitivity analysis shows that the friction velocity and atmospheric stability are the two most important factors for the energy imbalance problem wind speed air temperature and vapor pressure deficit appear less important the time derivative of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit the ratio between measurement height and boundary layer height as well as indexes quantifying the surface heterogeneity have few influences on the energy imbalance problem one novelty of this study is to offer a prognostic and practicable solution to quantify the structural error in the evapotranspiration models such as penman monteith model the sebs model because the data driven model is universal and all input variables are easily obtainable the two micrometeorological elements friction velocity and atmospheric stability which are measured by the eddy covariance system can be estimated from conventional meteorological data using the monin obukhov similarity theory thus the data driven ebr models are convenient to be added in evapotranspiration models as a structural error correction module the future research on energy imbalance induced structural errors deserves to be investigated in two aspects the one is to find other valuable environmental factors to improve the accuracy of ebr estimation the other one is to extend data driven ebr models at different time scales credit authorship contribution statement xiaolong hu conceptualization methodology software

upon request appendix a the information on the 69 eddy covariance sites is listed in table a1 appendix b to determine the appropriate hyperparameters the effect of hyperparameters in three machine learning algorithms was evaluated the computational cost will be too heavy if searching the whole hyperparameters space therefore we only tested several cases which are listed in table a2 figs a1 a3 show the evaluation of hyperparameters in different land cover types in the deep neural network and long short term memory algorithms with the increase of structural complexity of networks the training error was significantly decreased while the testing error was slightly reduced the gap between training error and testing error was relatively large when building single site ebr models this

4627,hydrological drought evolution development and recovery is directly related to the amount of precipitation transformed into effective streamflow however how hydrological drought alters the precipitation streamflow relationship and how the precipitation streamflow relationship affects the hydrological drought development and recovery require more in depth research we present a detailed assessment of the effects of hydrological drought propagation on the precipitation streamflow relationship we propose the concept of effective streamflow precipitation ratio espr which is defined as the amount of precipitation in the current month that is converted to effective streamflow relative to that of the previous month for hydrological drought propagation assessment long term unregulated streamflow and precipitation data from six hydrometric stations in different countries china usa and australia were used to investigate the proposed concept the results show that hydrological drought causes a significant decrease in the precipitation streamflow correlation and coefficient of determination however the changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship are substantially different during the hydrological drought development and recovery stages in our study areas the precipitation streamflow relationship was weakened by 60 mainly during the hydrological drought development rather than recovery the espr values during the hydrological drought development are substantially lower than those of the recovery period suggesting insufficient precipitation leads to little to no streamflow especially during the drought development period additionally the larger the espr during hydrological drought evolution the faster the hydrological drought recovery will occur and vice versa this study provides insights into the drivers of hydrological drought evolution by connecting with the changes in precipitation streamflow relationship keywords hydrological drought development and recovery precipitation streamflow relationship espr interaction 1 introduction drought is a complex and recurrent climate phenomenon that occurs in all climatic regions wilhite and glantz 1985 droughts are also called the creeping natural hazard and have far reaching negative impacts on the economy ecology agriculture and human life aghakouchak et al 2021 ashraf et al 2017 lake 2006 mehran et al 2015 hydrological drought refers to a lack of water resources in the hydrological system and is characterized by abnormally low flow in river channels or low levels in lakes reservoirs and groundwater tallaksen and van lanen 2004 hydrological drought evolves from meteorological drought precipitation deficit often develops slowly and can last for months to years with serious impacts on the ecosystem environment agricultural production and water resources systems van loon 2015 in previous studies hydrological drought evolution was separated into two processes namely development and recovery parry et al 2016a 2016b the former stage is regarded as the period from the beginning of the hydrological drought to its peak intensity pi i e maximum intensity during the hydrological drought duration the latter is defined as the period from the pi to the end of the hydrological drought and is called the drought recovery period wu et al 2018a tallaksen and van lanen 2004 a great deal of research has focused on hydrological drought evolution e g thomas et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2018a and its socio environmental impacts e g aghakouchak et al 2021 madadgar et al 2017 mehran et al 2015 parry et al 2016b van loon 2015 other than meteorological conditions basin hydrological properties such as water storage capacity groundwater surface water interactions snow condition vegetation type and land use land cover are key factors affecting hydrological drought evolution tijdeman et al 2018 van loon et al 2014 van loon 2015 parry et al 2016a 2018 zhao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a wu et al 2018a pointed out that factors that influence hydrological drought evolution are complex and include not only meteorological and basin properties but also human activities and man made infrastructure nevertheless the most important factors in both hydrological drought development hdd and hydrological drought recovery hdr are the decrease and increase in precipitation relative to the long term mean tallaksen and van lanen 2004 in addition some previous studies investigated the evolution patterns of hydrological drought and found that the average hdd was longer than the average hdr and several explanations were given parry et al 2016a wu et al 2019 for instance it was proposed that hydrological drought was caused by a shortage of precipitation over a long period but heavy rainfall in a short period may terminate a hydrological drought tallaksen and van lanen 2004 wu et al 2018a however there is a lack of quantitative indicators or methods to explain the reasons for the differences in the hydrological drought development and recovery patterns hydrological drought occurrence and evolution are primarily influenced by meteorological precipitation conditions and the resulting streamflow tallaksen and van lanen 2004 van loon 2015 consequently it is necessary to recognize and track meteorological conditions from the onset to the recovery of hydrological drought and determine the corresponding interactions with land surface processes to understand hydrological drought zhang et al 2019b the critical conditions for the occurrence of hydrological drought in response to meteorological drought and the influencing drivers were investigated by using linear e g pearson correlation analysis lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 sun et al 2016 and non linear e g logarithmic function models wu et al 2017 in earlier studies the evolution of hydrological drought including the onset and recovery times was also investigated in recent studies i e parry et al 2016a 2016b wu et al 2018a these studies primarily focused on the meteorological conditions at the time of the onset of hydrological drought rather than hydrological and meteorological interactions throughout the drought onset development and recovery periods given that changes in hydrological drought are a function of meteorological conditions the precipitation streamflow relationship is expected to change during the drought development and recovery process yang et al 2017 thus the precipitation streamflow relationship is commonly used to investigate the possible hydrologic responses to meteorological drought at the catchment scale for example saft et al 2015 analyzed the annual precipitation streamflow relationship in southwest australia and showed that the relationship weakened in 46 of the study region because of a long term meteorological drought zhang et al 2018 conducted a study in the yellow river basin in china and found that the annual precipitation streamflow relationships during the droughts were significantly different from those during non drought periods investigating the millennium drought in southeast australia yang et al 2017 studied the time lags between meteorological and hydrological drought recovery and concluded that the recovery was primarily influenced by precipitation and other factors e g catchment landscape and properties had only a secondary or minor influence while previous studies have broadly investigated the precipitation streamflow relationship during drought and non drought periods we are not aware of any investigation on the precipitation streamflow relationship during the hydrological drought development and recovery i e change in the precipitation streamflow relationship during hdd and hdr furthermore we lack information on the feedback effects of shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship during the hdd and hdr the objective of this study therefore is to establish an indicator to explain the differences in hydrological drought development and recovery patterns using the precipitation streamflow relationships during hdd and hdr this paper focuses on the following two aspects i identify the hydrological drought development and recovery patterns and determine whether the precipitation streamflow relationship is different during hdd and hdr ii develop an indicator for investigating the feedback mechanism of the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship and the effects on hydrological drought development and recovery this paper presents a general framework for understanding the onset development and recovery of hydrological droughts and the underlying mechanisms the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the framework and details of the analysis approaches section 3 presents the case study area and the data set used in this study the key results and discussion are presented in sections 4 and 5 we note that throughout the paper we use the terms rainfall and precipitation and runoff and streamflow interchangeably 2 methodology the proposed methodological framework includes four steps see fig 1 i the first step involves selecting a threshold for identifying hydrological droughts based on the historical monthly streamflow records ii the second is the identification of the hydrological drought characteristics including duration d intensity i peak intensity pi and the development and recovery processes based on the drought threshold determined in step 1 and the so called run theory discussed in the following section the definitions of these hydrological drought characteristics are described later iii the third step is to investigate the precipitation streamflow relationship during different periods i e non drought drought drought development and recovery periods following previous studies we use a linear regression model and the coefficient of determination r 2 to explore changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship in different periods sankarasubramanian et al 2001 saft et al 2015 iv the fourth step is to calculate the effective streamflow precipitation ratio espr during the non drought drought development and recovery periods we define the espr as the amount of precipitation in the current month that is converted to effective streamflow relative to the previous month we propose the espr as an indicator to reflect the interactions between the precipitation streamflow relationships during different periods fig 1 displays the flowchart of the proposed method 2 1 defining hydrological droughts based on a threshold step 1 drought indices are commonly used to identify and characterize hydrological droughts mishra and singh 2010 broadly hydrological drought indices can be grouped into two types namely standardized indices and threshold based indices standardized indices allow for consistent regional comparison of hydrological drought severity mishra and singh 2010 examples include the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 and standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 both of which are based on the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 however the severity of hydrological drought events identified from standardized indices is expressed only in relative terms i e using a non dimensional standardized value which does not provide any information on the volume of water deficit during hydrological droughts van loon and van lanen 2013 however for water resource applications the absolute deficit relative to the normal condition is fundamental to risk assessment and decision making van loon 2015 the alternative to standardized indices is a threshold based approach for identifying droughts in this approach a hydrological drought is identified when the value of the streamflow drops below a certain threshold the main advantage of the threshold based methods is that they provide information on the volume of water deficit during hydrological droughts van loon 2015 rangecroft et al 2019 two types of threshold based approaches have been used in the literature fixed and variable the fixed threshold is more suitable for areas with less variability throughout the year whereas the variable threshold method is more practical for locations with considerable seasonal variability van loon 2015 a comprehensive review of different hydrological drought indices can be found in mishra and singh 2010 the framework presented in fig 1 can be used with both fixed and variable thresholds the procedures for determining the variable threshold is shown in step 1 of fig 1 first the monthly streamflow records are ranked separately for each month from january to december then the corresponding threshold level e g q80 for each month is determined based on a particular percentile of the flow duration curve i e twelve thresholds corresponding to the january to december records as suggested by van loon 2015 2 2 extract the hydrological drought evolution using the run theory step 2 here the evolution pattern of hydrological drought refers only to the temporal component of drought evolution i e development and recovery processes parry et al 2016a wu et al 2018a in this step hydrological drought characteristics such as d s i pi hdd and hdr of all historical hydrological droughts are identified in this study we extract the hydrological drought characteristics based on the run theory yevjevich 1967 and the threshold obtained in the previous step according to the rules of the run theory if the streamflow series in a certain month is below the threshold e g the dotted line in fig 1 step 2 the month is regarded as a drought month e g hd 1 and hd 2 in the fig 1 step 2 if the streamflow series in a certain period of time remains below the threshold this period is regarded as a hydrological drought event e g hd 3 hd 4 and hd 5 linsley et al 1982 the drought d is defined as the period from the beginning of the drought to the time of drought termination correspondingly the hydrological drought development duration hddd is defined as the period from the beginning of the drought to the time of pi and the hydrological drought recovery duration hdrd is defined as the period from the time of pi to the time of drought termination the negative value for the difference between the streamflow and drought threshold at each time point is called the drought intensity of each month the histogram in fig 1 step 2 the integration of the difference between the streamflow and the drought threshold during d is defined as s the average s during d is regarded as the drought intensity i the maximum drought i during the d is defined as the pi e g pi 1 pi 2 and pi 3 see fig 1 step 2 in the flowchart here hydrological drought events with a minimum duration of 3 months were extracted the hddd and hdrd cannot be obtained when d is less than 3 months parry et al 2016a 2016b wu et al 2018a 2 3 quantifying the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship step 3 although the precipitation streamflow relationship is complex at different spatial and temporal scales in catchments with low human activities a simple linear statistical model may be sufficient to represent the changes of relationship between precipitation and streamflow sankarasubramanian et al 2001 saft et al 2015 in this study we compared the linear relationship between precipitation and streamflow during the non drought drought hdd and hdr periods step 3 in fig 1 to determine changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship during hydrological droughts i e whether hydrologic drought substantially changes the precipitation streamflow relationship we then compared the precipitation streamflow relationship during the drought hdd and hdr periods to determine shifts in the relationship here r 2 is used to describe the changes in the linear relationships during different periods r 2 represents the part of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable spiess and neumeyer 2010 the percent change in r 2 in a drought period compared to a non drought period is described as follows 1 cp λ 1 λ 2 λ 2 100 where the cp is the contribution percentage to the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship in a drought period compared to a non drought period λ 1 and λ 2 represent the r 2 of precipitation streamflow relationship during the drought and non drought respectively similarly if we want to obtain the contribution percentage to the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship by the hydrological development and recovery periods hddd and hdrd we can use their corresponding r 2 values in eq 1 this allows optaining the relative change of the precipitation streamflow relationship during the development and recovery period 2 4 effective streamflow precipitation ratio espr step 4 in this paper espr is proposed to determine the feedback effects of the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship during hydrological drought development and recovery the effective streamflow is defined as the portion of rainfall that generates direct or indirect streamflow in the river channel as mentioned above the effective streamflow includes rainfall entering the river directly and the fraction of rainfall in the basin that is drained by the river it does not exclude the inflow from other watersheds in fig 1 step 4 shows a simple example of the watershed yield left part of fig 1 step 4 the right part of fig 1 step 4 shows a simple diagram indicating the rising a and falling b of the river flow in the any given month e g current relative to the previous month as shown the river flow is expected to rise when there is additional discharge j added to the water level of the previous month i i e the total flow in the current month would be i j with the actual water supply of j in the current month based on this perspective the actual amount of river flow j can be defined as the effective streamflow in the current month relative to the previous month in contrast when the river flow in the current month is lower than the previous month there is a deficit and hence the espr equation 4 would be equal to or less than 0 because the unit of precipitation i e mm is different from the unit of streamflow i e m3 s calculating the espr requires a third variable that is the runoff depth rd hence the espr is defined as follows 2 espr δ r d j p j 100 1 p j w 1000 f 100 3 w q δ t j where rdj is the absolute value of the increase in rd in the current month compared to the last month pj q w and f are the precipitation unit mm in the current month absolute value of changes in streamflow in the current month relative to the last month m3 s total runoff volume in a certain period e g tj unit m3 and catchment area km2 respectively it should be noted that the rdj and actual rd are different the actual rd is calculated from the actual flow in the current month and the rdj is calculated using the absolute value of the increase in the flow in the current month relative to the previous month 3 study areas and data resources 3 1 study areas we present results from three case studies selected from different countries china united states and australia for six hydrometric stations two stations per study area fig 2 the stations are located in the upstream catchment unregulated with little human activity and at least 30 years of monthly observed streamflow and corresponding precipitation records are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework limited human activities in the study basins have been confirmed in previous studies lin et al 2014 pena gallardo et al 2018 van loon et al 2019 in addition to the two hydrometric stations located in china yuecheng and jiuzhou hereafter referred to as china stations we selected two hydrometric stations in the southeast united states usgs number 02 372 250 and 02361000 referred to as the usa stations and two stations in southeastern australia id number 419 005 and 419016 referred to as australian stations the climate in the first two regions chinese and usa stations is a subtropical wet monsoon climate with abundant heat and precipitation in the same seasons blum et al 2017 wu et al 2018b the climate in the third region australia is a semi arid savanna climate van loon et al 2019 3 2 data the monthly streamflow and precipitation records of the chinese stations were obtained from

waternsw of australia https www waternsw con au we obtained the corresponding monthly precipitation for the australian station from the australia bureau of meteorology http www bom gov au ref logo based on the location of the hydrometric stations these hydrometric stations were chosen because they also have been used as unregulated stations for hydrological process and drought identification analysis in previous studies blum et al 2017 lin et al 2014 tu et al 2018 van loon et al 2019 wu et al 2018b yang et al 2017 only a few months of streamflow data were missing in the datasets of these hydrometric stations the missing data were filled by using the average of the month in the same period in history 30 years there were no missing data in the monthly precipitation records the detailed information on the hydro meteorological data is given in table 1 to further investigate other drought related variables e g potential evapotranspiration soil moisture groundwater and etc during the drought and non drought periods we collected additional data from the two china stations thus monthly weather data such as temperature wind speed and relative humanity during 1960 2006 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration http www nmic gov cn these weather data were used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith equation penman 1948 monteith 1965 monthly groundwater and soil moisture soil surface to 10 cm depth data from 2002 to 2010 were also used in this study the processed groundwater

related variables the grace groundwater and gldas 2 1 soil moisture were used here because they have been widely employed to examine the evolution of global and regional water cycle e g famiglietti 2014 rodell and famiglietti 2001 rodell et al 2004 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological drought development and recovery patterns by combining the q80 threshold i e a threshold above which 80 of the data falls level with the run theory as mentioned in step 2 the hydrological drought events and evolution properties including the development and recovery information for each hydrologic station in the study area were identified the time series of hydrological drought intensity is provided in fig s1 supporting information and the boxplots of the development and recovery time for the six hydrometric stations are shown in fig 3 the average hddds for the yuecheng jiuzhou usgs 02372250 usgs 02361000 id 419005 and id 419 016 stations are 2 56 2 85 2 60 3 73 2 74 and 2 69 months respectively the average hdrds for the same stations are 1 69 2 08 2 40 1 64 1 91 and 2 31 months respectively the average hdrd is considerably shorter than the average hddd at each hydrologic station these results are consistent with previous studies parry et al 2016b wu et al 2018a the reasons for the different patterns of hydrological drought development and recovery are explained below 4 2 precipitation streamflow relationship and hydrological drought evolution 4 2 1 impact of hydrological drought on the precipitation streamflow relationship fig 4 shows the r 2 of the linear relationship between precipitation and streamflow during the non drought drought drought development and recovery periods fig 4 a and the corresponding percent changes during hydrological droughts fig 4 b the following observations are made i the r 2 of the precipitation streamflow relationship during the non drought period differs from that of the drought period overall the r 2 for the precipitation streamflow relationship is significantly larger during the non drought period all the p values are less than 0 05 the r 2 of the drought period is 30 56 47 83 66 78 76 24 86 66 and 96 64 lower than that of the non drought period equation 1 at the yuecheng jiuzhou usgs 02372250 usgs 0236100 id 419005 and id 419 016 stations respectively fig 4 b ii the r 2 values exhibit considerable differences during drought development and recovery periods the r 2 of precipitation streamflow relationship during the hdrd is often higher than that during the hddd which is reasonable because more precipitation may occur during the recovery period during the hydrological drought studied here the relative changes in r 2 of the precipitation streamflow relationship during the hddds at the six hydrologic stations are 68 63 69 23 62 93 65 20 61 35 and 64 46 respectively the corresponding changes in precipitation streamflow r 2 values during the hdrds at the six hydrologic stations are decreased by 31 37 30 77 37 07 34 80 38 65 and 35 54 respectively fig 4 b from fig 4 we can conclude that the occurrence of hydrological drought significantly alters the precipitation streamflow relationship and the changes during the hddd period are larger than those in the hdrd period although the intensity of the changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship due to drought is different general behavior of changes during to precipitation streamflow relationship during hddd and hdrd are similar in different hydrometric stations 4 2 2 responses of hydrological drought evolution patterns to different precipitation streamflow relationships fig 5 shows that the espr values are considerably larger during non drought periods than drought periods at the six hydrologic stations this indicates that the amount of precipitation converted to effective streamflow was significantly greater during non drought periods than drought periods this is believed to be the primary cause of hydrological droughts when precipitation decreases the amount of effective streamflow generated from precipitation reduces substantially leading to hydrologic drought a comparison of espr values during the hddd and hdrd periods indicates that the espr values during the hddd are substantially lower than those of the hdrd period or are close to 0 during the hddd e g see the australian station in other words insufficient precipitation leads to little to no streamflow especially during the drought development period that is during hddd the espr decreases whereas during hdrd the espr increases this explains why the average of the development time of hydrological drought is usually longer than the recovery time 4 3 discussion it is well known that the occurrence of hydrological drought changes the precipitation streamflow relationship zhang et al 2018 saft et al 2015 the reason is that the amount of precipitation that turns into discharge changes significantly throughout hydrological drought evolution lake 2006 yang et al 2017 most previous studies however focused on this issue at the annual scale investigating the annual precipitation streamflow relationships during drought and non drought in this study we investigated this issue at monthly scale in addition to drought and non drought periods the precipitation streamflow relationship was also investigated during drought development and recovery periods our results confirm earlier findings that hydrologic droughts change the precipitation streamflow relationship zhang et al 2018 saft et al 2015 however we investigated this relationship in greater details during the hdd and hdr we found that the changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship were more apparent during hdd periods than during hdr in addition hydrological drought has different impacts on the precipitation streamflow relationship in different locations which may be related to the differences in the climate and catchment characteristics saft et al 2015 van loon et al 2014 van loon 2015 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for example there were significant differences in the multi year average runoff coefficients fig 6 in the six study areas the overall behavior of the multi year average runoff coefficients fig 6 was consistent with the percent changes in the precipitation streamflow relationships fig 4 b in other words the smaller the runoff coefficient the more significant the change in the precipitation streamflow relationship is expected during droughts additionally the proposed espr was used to analyze the feedback effect of the precipitation streamflow relationship on hydrological drought evolution as shown in the espr results section 4 2 this indicator appears to work well in describing the changes in hydrologic condition throughout the drought development and recovery previous studies have concluded that hydrological drought is caused by meteorological drought linsley et al 1982 van loon 2015 liu et al 2020 and several studies have investigated the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 pena gallardo et al 2018 wu et al 2017 2018b here by investigating the precipitation streamflow relationship throughout hydrologic drought we strive to understand how this relationship changes and how it can be described using a generalized indicator fig 7 shows the correlation between streamflow and other drought related variables i e precipitation pet soil moisture and groundwater during the drought and non drought periods in two china hydrological stations the figure shows that the correlations are significantly different between the drought and non drought periods and across different variables fig 7 highlights that while hydrological droughts are originated by deficit in precipitation other variable such as pet and sm can also influence the process shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 for simplicity however here we focused on an indicator between the two main drivers namely precipitation and streamflow moreover it is undeniable that the precipitation streamflow relationship can be affected by non climatic factors such as land use cover change change in irrigation pattern intensity groundwater withdrawal surface water diversion and catchment characteristics see step 4 in fig 1 aghakouchak et al 2015 haslinger et al 2014 lópez moreno et al 2009 mehran et al 2015 van loon et al 2014 van loon 2015 yuan et al 2017 zhang and zhang 2019 however such changes occur often slowly and over a long period of time we did not consider such external factors with the hope to develop a more generalized approach for this reason we focused on upstream basins with limited human impacts unraveling anthropogenic impacts on precipitation streamflow relationship is more complex and warrants more in depth research in the future aghakouchak et al 2021 5 conclusions we proposed a framework to analyze the interaction between hydrologic drought evolution and the precipitation streamflow relationship hydrological drought evolution i e development and recovery was investigated using the variable threshold level and the run theory subsequently the effects of hydrological droughts on the precipitation streamflow relationship were analyzed during hydrological drought development hdd and hydrological drought recovery hdr we also analyzed the feedback effect of shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship on hydrological drought evolution based on the effective streamflow precipitation ratio espr indicator the proposed framework was used to analyze drought conditions at six unregulated hydrologic stations in china the usa and australia the main conclusions are as follows i the average hdd period was longer than the average hdr period because the amount of effective streamflow generated by precipitation was lower during the hdd periods relative to the hdr periods ii the occurrence of hydrological droughts de linearized the precipitation streamflow relationship significantly and the changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship were substantially different during the hydrological drought development and recovery the observed changes in precipitation streamflow relationship were more pronounced during the hdd periods iii the espr can be regarded as a suitable indicator to evaluated changes during hydrological drought evolution development and recovery at the watershed scale the hydrological drought worsens as the espr approaches 0 during hdd periods generally the larger the espr during the hdr the faster the recovery occurs and vice versa drought related variables typically exhibit some level of relationship however the underlying relationships are often complex and variable in different locations for instance many studies have showed that pet teuling et al 2013 geology stoelzle et al 2014 groundwater haslinger et al 2014 parry et al 2018 land surface liu et al 2017 and various human activities e g reservoir regulation chang et al 2019 tijdeman et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 influence hydrological drought evolution in a variety of ways directly or indirectly the anthropogenic component cannot be generalized and requires case by case analysis in general the precipitation streamflow relationship is more pronounced than other variables hence in this study we focused on describing hydrologic droughts and their changes using an indicator based on precipitation and streamflow we are not considering the impact of different streamflow generation mechanisms on the hydrological drought development and recovery patterns we believe that in most cases the effects of soil moisture groundwater and land surface condition are somewhat captured in streamflow anthropogenic changes can also alter the precipitation streamflow relationship in complex ways more research should focus on how anthropogenic impacts change the precipitation streamflow relationship and hence hydrologic droughts credit authorship contribution statement jiefeng wu conceptualization methodology writing original draft funding acquisition xiaohong chen

4627,hydrological drought evolution development and recovery is directly related to the amount of precipitation transformed into effective streamflow however how hydrological drought alters the precipitation streamflow relationship and how the precipitation streamflow relationship affects the hydrological drought development and recovery require more in depth research we present a detailed assessment of the effects of hydrological drought propagation on the precipitation streamflow relationship we propose the concept of effective streamflow precipitation ratio espr which is defined as the amount of precipitation in the current month that is converted to effective streamflow relative to that of the previous month for hydrological drought propagation assessment long term unregulated streamflow and precipitation data from six hydrometric stations in different countries china usa and australia were used to investigate the proposed concept the results show that hydrological drought causes a significant decrease in the precipitation streamflow correlation and coefficient of determination however the changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship are substantially different during the hydrological drought development and recovery stages in our study areas the precipitation streamflow relationship was weakened by 60 mainly during the hydrological drought development rather than recovery the espr values during the hydrological drought development are substantially lower than those of the recovery period suggesting insufficient precipitation leads to little to no streamflow especially during the drought development period additionally the larger the espr during hydrological drought evolution the faster the hydrological drought recovery will occur and vice versa this study provides insights into the drivers of hydrological drought evolution by connecting with the changes in precipitation streamflow relationship keywords hydrological drought development and recovery precipitation streamflow relationship espr interaction 1 introduction drought is a complex and recurrent climate phenomenon that occurs in all climatic regions wilhite and glantz 1985 droughts are also called the creeping natural hazard and have far reaching negative impacts on the economy ecology agriculture and human life aghakouchak et al 2021 ashraf et al 2017 lake 2006 mehran et al 2015 hydrological drought refers to a lack of water resources in the hydrological system and is characterized by abnormally low flow in river channels or low levels in lakes reservoirs and groundwater tallaksen and van lanen 2004 hydrological drought evolves from meteorological drought precipitation deficit often develops slowly and can last for months to years with serious impacts on the ecosystem environment agricultural production and water resources systems van loon 2015 in previous studies hydrological drought evolution was separated into two processes namely development and recovery parry et al 2016a 2016b the former stage is regarded as the period from the beginning of the hydrological drought to its peak intensity pi i e maximum intensity during the hydrological drought duration the latter is defined as the period from the pi to the end of the hydrological drought and is called the drought recovery period wu et al 2018a tallaksen and van lanen 2004 a great deal of research has focused on hydrological drought evolution e g thomas et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2018a and its socio environmental impacts e g aghakouchak et al 2021 madadgar et al 2017 mehran et al 2015 parry et al 2016b van loon 2015 other than meteorological conditions basin hydrological properties such as water storage capacity groundwater surface water interactions snow condition vegetation type and land use land cover are key factors affecting hydrological drought evolution tijdeman et al 2018 van loon et al 2014 van loon 2015 parry et al 2016a 2018 zhao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a wu et al 2018a pointed out that factors that influence hydrological drought evolution are complex and include not only meteorological and basin properties but also human activities and man made infrastructure nevertheless the most important factors in both hydrological drought development hdd and hydrological drought recovery hdr are the decrease and increase in precipitation relative to the long term mean tallaksen and van lanen 2004 in addition some previous studies investigated the evolution patterns of hydrological drought and found that the average hdd was longer than the average hdr and several explanations were given parry et al 2016a wu et al 2019 for instance it was proposed that hydrological drought was caused by a shortage of precipitation over a long period but heavy rainfall in a short period may terminate a hydrological drought tallaksen and van lanen 2004 wu et al 2018a however there is a lack of quantitative indicators or methods to explain the reasons for the differences in the hydrological drought development and recovery patterns hydrological drought occurrence and evolution are primarily influenced by meteorological precipitation conditions and the resulting streamflow tallaksen and van lanen 2004 van loon 2015 consequently it is necessary to recognize and track meteorological conditions from the onset to the recovery of hydrological drought and determine the corresponding interactions with land surface processes to understand hydrological drought zhang et al 2019b the critical conditions for the occurrence of hydrological drought in response to meteorological drought and the influencing drivers were investigated by using linear e g pearson correlation analysis lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 sun et al 2016 and non linear e g logarithmic function models wu et al 2017 in earlier studies the evolution of hydrological drought including the onset and recovery times was also investigated in recent studies i e parry et al 2016a 2016b wu et al 2018a these studies primarily focused on the meteorological conditions at the time of the onset of hydrological drought rather than hydrological and meteorological interactions throughout the drought onset development and recovery periods given that changes in hydrological drought are a function of meteorological conditions the precipitation streamflow relationship is expected to change during the drought development and recovery process yang et al 2017 thus the precipitation streamflow relationship is commonly used to investigate the possible hydrologic responses to meteorological drought at the catchment scale for example saft et al 2015 analyzed the annual precipitation streamflow relationship in southwest australia and showed that the relationship weakened in 46 of the study region because of a long term meteorological drought zhang et al 2018 conducted a study in the yellow river basin in china and found that the annual precipitation streamflow relationships during the droughts were significantly different from those during non drought periods investigating the millennium drought in southeast australia yang et al 2017 studied the time lags between meteorological and hydrological drought recovery and concluded that the recovery was primarily influenced by precipitation and other factors e g catchment landscape and properties had only a secondary or minor influence while previous studies have broadly investigated the precipitation streamflow relationship during drought and non drought periods we are not aware of any investigation on the precipitation streamflow relationship during the hydrological drought development and recovery i e change in the precipitation streamflow relationship during hdd and hdr furthermore we lack information on the feedback effects of shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship during the hdd and hdr the objective of this study therefore is to establish an indicator to explain the differences in hydrological drought development and recovery patterns using the precipitation streamflow relationships during hdd and hdr this paper focuses on the following two aspects i identify the hydrological drought development and recovery patterns and determine whether the precipitation streamflow relationship is different during hdd and hdr ii develop an indicator for investigating the feedback mechanism of the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship and the effects on hydrological drought development and recovery this paper presents a general framework for understanding the onset development and recovery of hydrological droughts and the underlying mechanisms the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the framework and details of the analysis approaches section 3 presents the case study area and the data set used in this study the key results and discussion are presented in sections 4 and 5 we note that throughout the paper we use the terms rainfall and precipitation and runoff and streamflow interchangeably 2 methodology the proposed methodological framework includes four steps see fig 1 i the first step involves selecting a threshold for identifying hydrological droughts based on the historical monthly streamflow records ii the second is the identification of the hydrological drought characteristics including duration d intensity i peak intensity pi and the development and recovery processes based on the drought threshold determined in step 1 and the so called run theory discussed in the following section the definitions of these hydrological drought characteristics are described later iii the third step is to investigate the precipitation streamflow relationship during different periods i e non drought drought drought development and recovery periods following previous studies we use a linear regression model and the coefficient of determination r 2 to explore changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship in different periods sankarasubramanian et al 2001 saft et al 2015 iv the fourth step is to calculate the effective streamflow precipitation ratio espr during the non drought drought development and recovery periods we define the espr as the amount of precipitation in the current month that is converted to effective streamflow relative to the previous month we propose the espr as an indicator to reflect the interactions between the precipitation streamflow relationships during different periods fig 1 displays the flowchart of the proposed method 2 1 defining hydrological droughts based on a threshold step 1 drought indices are commonly used to identify and characterize hydrological droughts mishra and singh 2010 broadly hydrological drought indices can be grouped into two types namely standardized indices and threshold based indices standardized indices allow for consistent regional comparison of hydrological drought severity mishra and singh 2010 examples include the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 and standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 both of which are based on the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 however the severity of hydrological drought events identified from standardized indices is expressed only in relative terms i e using a non dimensional standardized value which does not provide any information on the volume of water deficit during hydrological droughts van loon and van lanen 2013 however for water resource applications the absolute deficit relative to the normal condition is fundamental to risk assessment and decision making van loon 2015 the alternative to standardized indices is a threshold based approach for identifying droughts in this approach a hydrological drought is identified when the value of the streamflow drops below a certain threshold the main advantage of the threshold based methods is that they provide information on the volume of water deficit during hydrological droughts van loon 2015 rangecroft et al 2019 two types of threshold based approaches have been used in the literature fixed and variable the fixed threshold is more suitable for areas with less variability throughout the year whereas the variable threshold method is more practical for locations with considerable seasonal variability van loon 2015 a comprehensive review of different hydrological drought indices can be found in mishra and singh 2010 the framework presented in fig 1 can be used with both fixed and variable thresholds the procedures for determining the variable threshold is shown in step 1 of fig 1 first the monthly streamflow records are ranked separately for each month from january to december then the corresponding threshold level e g q80 for each month is determined based on a particular percentile of the flow duration curve i e twelve thresholds corresponding to the january to december records as suggested by van loon 2015 2 2 extract the hydrological drought evolution using the run theory step 2 here the evolution pattern of hydrological drought refers only to the temporal component of drought evolution i e development and recovery processes parry et al 2016a wu et al 2018a in this step hydrological drought characteristics such as d s i pi hdd and hdr of all historical hydrological droughts are identified in this study we extract the hydrological drought characteristics based on the run theory yevjevich 1967 and the threshold obtained in the previous step according to the rules of the run theory if the streamflow series in a certain month is below the threshold e g the dotted line in fig 1 step 2 the month is regarded as a drought month e g hd 1 and hd 2 in the fig 1 step 2 if the streamflow series in a certain period of time remains below the threshold this period is regarded as a hydrological drought event e g hd 3 hd 4 and hd 5 linsley et al 1982 the drought d is defined as the period from the beginning of the drought to the time of drought termination correspondingly the hydrological drought development duration hddd is defined as the period from the beginning of the drought to the time of pi and the hydrological drought recovery duration hdrd is defined as the period from the time of pi to the time of drought termination the negative value for the difference between the streamflow and drought threshold at each time point is called the drought intensity of each month the histogram in fig 1 step 2 the integration of the difference between the streamflow and the drought threshold during d is defined as s the average s during d is regarded as the drought intensity i the maximum drought i during the d is defined as the pi e g pi 1 pi 2 and pi 3 see fig 1 step 2 in the flowchart here hydrological drought events with a minimum duration of 3 months were extracted the hddd and hdrd cannot be obtained when d is less than 3 months parry et al 2016a 2016b wu et al 2018a 2 3 quantifying the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship step 3 although the precipitation streamflow relationship is complex at different spatial and temporal scales in catchments with low human activities a simple linear statistical model may be sufficient to represent the changes of relationship between precipitation and streamflow sankarasubramanian et al 2001 saft et al 2015 in this study we compared the linear relationship between precipitation and streamflow during the non drought drought hdd and hdr periods step 3 in fig 1 to determine changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship during hydrological droughts i e whether hydrologic drought substantially changes the precipitation streamflow relationship we then compared the precipitation streamflow relationship during the drought hdd and hdr periods to determine shifts in the relationship here r 2 is used to describe the changes in the linear relationships during different periods r 2 represents the part of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable spiess and neumeyer 2010 the percent change in r 2 in a drought period compared to a non drought period is described as follows 1 cp λ 1 λ 2 λ 2 100 where the cp is the contribution percentage to the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship in a drought period compared to a non drought period λ 1 and λ 2 represent the r 2 of precipitation streamflow relationship during the drought and non drought respectively similarly if we want to obtain the contribution percentage to the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship by the hydrological development and recovery periods hddd and hdrd we can use their corresponding r 2 values in eq 1 this allows optaining the relative change of the precipitation streamflow relationship during the development and recovery period 2 4 effective streamflow precipitation ratio espr step 4 in this paper espr is proposed to determine the feedback effects of the shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship during hydrological drought development and recovery the effective streamflow is defined as the portion of rainfall that generates direct or indirect streamflow in the river channel as mentioned above the effective streamflow includes rainfall entering the river directly and the fraction of rainfall in the basin that is drained by the river it does not exclude the inflow from other watersheds in fig 1 step 4 shows a simple example of the watershed yield left part of fig 1 step 4 the right part of fig 1 step 4 shows a simple diagram indicating the rising a and falling b of the river flow in the any given month e g current relative to the previous month as shown the river flow is expected to rise when there is additional discharge j added to the water level of the previous month i i e the total flow in the current month would be i j with the actual water supply of j in the current month based on this perspective the actual amount of river flow j can be defined as the effective streamflow in the current month relative to the previous month in contrast when the river flow in the current month is lower than the previous month there is a deficit and hence the espr equation 4 would be equal to or less than 0 because the unit of precipitation i e mm is different from the unit of streamflow i e m3 s calculating the espr requires a third variable that is the runoff depth rd hence the espr is defined as follows 2 espr δ r d j p j 100 1 p j w 1000 f 100 3 w q δ t j where rdj is the absolute value of the increase in rd in the current month compared to the last month pj q w and f are the precipitation unit mm in the current month absolute value of changes in streamflow in the current month relative to the last month m3 s total runoff volume in a certain period e g tj unit m3 and catchment area km2 respectively it should be noted that the rdj and actual rd are different the actual rd is calculated from the actual flow in the current month and the rdj is calculated using the absolute value of the increase in the flow in the current month relative to the previous month 3 study areas and data resources 3 1 study areas we present results from three case studies selected from different countries china united states and australia for six hydrometric stations two stations per study area fig 2 the stations are located in the upstream catchment unregulated with little human activity and at least 30 years of monthly observed streamflow and corresponding precipitation records are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework limited human activities in the study basins have been confirmed in previous studies lin et al 2014 pena gallardo et al 2018 van loon et al 2019 in addition to the two hydrometric stations located in china yuecheng and jiuzhou hereafter referred to as china stations we selected two hydrometric stations in the southeast united states usgs number 02 372 250 and 02361000 referred to as the usa stations and two stations in southeastern australia id number 419 005 and 419016 referred to as australian stations the climate in the first two regions chinese and usa stations is a subtropical wet monsoon climate with abundant heat and precipitation in the same seasons blum et al 2017 wu et al 2018b the climate in the third region australia is a semi arid savanna climate van loon et al 2019 3 2 data the monthly streamflow and precipitation records of the chinese stations were obtained from the water conservancy and electric bureau in guangdong province monthly streamflow records for the usa stations were downloaded from u s geological survey https waterdata usgs gov nwis rt the corresponding monthly precipitation for the usa stations was obtained from the prism climate group http prism oregonstate edu the streamflow data for the australian stations were obtained from waternsw of australia https www waternsw con au we obtained the corresponding monthly precipitation for the australian station from the australia bureau of meteorology http www bom gov au ref logo based on the location of the hydrometric stations these hydrometric stations were chosen because they also have been used as unregulated stations for hydrological process and drought identification analysis in previous studies blum et al 2017 lin et al 2014 tu et al 2018 van loon et al 2019 wu et al 2018b yang et al 2017 only a few months of streamflow data were missing in the datasets of these hydrometric stations the missing data were filled by using the average of the month in the same period in history 30 years there were no missing data in the monthly precipitation records the detailed information on the hydro meteorological data is given in table 1 to further investigate other drought related variables e g potential evapotranspiration soil moisture groundwater and etc during the drought and non drought periods we collected additional data from the two china stations thus monthly weather data such as temperature wind speed and relative humanity during 1960 2006 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration http www nmic gov cn these weather data were used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith equation penman 1948 monteith 1965 monthly groundwater and soil moisture soil surface to 10 cm depth data from 2002 to 2010 were also used in this study the processed groundwater and soil moisture data were downloaded from the google earth engine website the former was derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace monthly mass grids land https developers

catalog nasa gldas v021 noah g025 t3h these data were used to determine the possible correlations between the variation in streamflow hydrological drought characterization index and these drought related variables the grace groundwater and gldas 2 1 soil moisture were used here because they have been widely employed to examine the evolution of global and regional water cycle e g famiglietti 2014 rodell and famiglietti 2001 rodell et al 2004 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological drought development and recovery patterns by combining the q80 threshold i e a threshold above which 80 of the data falls level with the run theory as mentioned in step 2 the hydrological drought events and evolution properties including the development and recovery information for each hydrologic station in the study area were identified the time series of hydrological drought intensity is provided in fig s1 supporting information and the boxplots of the development and recovery time for the six hydrometric stations are shown in fig 3 the average hddds for the yuecheng jiuzhou usgs 02372250 usgs 02361000 id 419005 and id 419 016 stations are 2 56 2 85 2 60 3 73 2 74 and 2 69 months respectively the average hdrds for the same stations are 1 69 2 08 2 40 1 64 1 91 and 2 31 months respectively the average hdrd is considerably shorter than the average hddd at each hydrologic station these results are consistent with previous studies parry et al 2016b wu et al 2018a the reasons for the different patterns of hydrological drought development and recovery are explained below 4 2 precipitation streamflow relationship and hydrological drought evolution 4 2 1 impact of hydrological drought on the precipitation streamflow relationship fig 4 shows the r 2 of the linear relationship between precipitation and streamflow during the non drought drought drought development and recovery periods fig 4 a and the corresponding percent changes during hydrological droughts fig 4 b the following observations are made i the r 2 of the precipitation streamflow relationship during the non drought period differs from that of the drought period overall the r 2 for the precipitation streamflow relationship is significantly larger during the non drought period all the p values are less than 0 05 the r 2 of the drought period is 30 56 47 83 66 78 76 24 86 66 and 96 64 lower than that of the non drought period equation 1 at the yuecheng jiuzhou usgs 02372250 usgs 0236100 id 419005 and id 419 016 stations respectively fig 4 b ii the r 2 values exhibit considerable differences during drought development and recovery periods the r 2 of precipitation streamflow relationship during the hdrd is often higher than that during the hddd which is reasonable because more precipitation may occur during the recovery period during the hydrological drought studied here the relative changes in r 2 of the precipitation streamflow relationship during the hddds at the six hydrologic stations are 68 63 69 23 62 93 65 20 61 35 and 64 46 respectively the corresponding changes in precipitation streamflow r 2 values during the hdrds at the six hydrologic stations are decreased by 31 37 30 77 37 07 34 80 38 65 and 35 54 respectively fig 4 b from fig 4 we can conclude that the occurrence of hydrological drought significantly alters the precipitation streamflow relationship and the changes during the hddd period are larger than those in the hdrd period although the intensity of the changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship due to drought is different general behavior of changes during to precipitation streamflow relationship during hddd and hdrd are similar in different hydrometric stations 4 2 2 responses of hydrological drought evolution patterns to different precipitation streamflow relationships fig 5 shows that the espr values are considerably larger during non drought periods than drought periods at the six hydrologic stations this indicates that the amount of precipitation converted to effective streamflow was significantly greater during non drought periods than drought periods this is believed to be the primary cause of hydrological droughts when precipitation decreases the amount of effective streamflow generated from precipitation reduces substantially leading to hydrologic drought a comparison of espr values during the hddd and hdrd periods indicates that the espr values during the hddd are substantially lower than those of the hdrd period or are close to 0 during the hddd e g see the australian station in other words insufficient precipitation leads to little to no streamflow especially during the drought development period that is during hddd the espr decreases whereas during hdrd the espr increases this explains why the average of the development time of hydrological drought is usually longer than the recovery time 4 3 discussion it is well known that the occurrence of hydrological drought changes the precipitation streamflow relationship zhang et al 2018 saft et al 2015 the reason is that the amount of precipitation that turns into discharge changes significantly throughout hydrological drought evolution lake 2006 yang et al 2017 most previous studies however focused on this issue at the annual scale investigating the annual precipitation streamflow relationships during drought and non drought in this study we investigated this issue at monthly scale in addition to drought and non drought periods the precipitation streamflow relationship was also investigated during drought development and recovery periods our results confirm earlier findings that hydrologic droughts change the precipitation streamflow relationship zhang et al 2018 saft et al 2015 however we investigated this relationship in greater details during the hdd and hdr we found that the changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship were more apparent during hdd periods than during hdr in addition hydrological drought has different impacts on the precipitation streamflow relationship in different locations which may be related to the differences in the climate and catchment characteristics saft et al 2015 van loon et al 2014 van loon 2015 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for example there were significant differences in the multi year average runoff coefficients fig 6 in the six study areas the overall behavior of the multi year average runoff coefficients fig 6 was consistent with the percent changes in the precipitation streamflow relationships fig 4 b in other words the smaller the runoff coefficient the more significant the change in the precipitation streamflow relationship is expected during droughts additionally the proposed espr was used to analyze the feedback effect of the precipitation streamflow relationship on hydrological drought evolution as shown in the espr results section 4 2 this indicator appears to work well in describing the changes in hydrologic condition throughout the drought development and recovery previous studies have concluded that hydrological drought is caused by meteorological drought linsley et al 1982 van loon 2015 liu et al 2020 and several studies have investigated the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 pena gallardo et al 2018 wu et al 2017 2018b here by investigating the precipitation streamflow relationship throughout hydrologic drought we strive to understand how this relationship changes and how it can be described using a generalized indicator fig 7 shows the correlation between streamflow and other drought related variables i e precipitation pet soil moisture and groundwater during the drought and non drought periods in two china hydrological stations the figure shows that the correlations are significantly different between the drought and non drought periods and across different variables fig 7 highlights that while hydrological droughts are originated by deficit in precipitation other variable such as pet and sm can also influence the process shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 for simplicity however here we focused on an indicator between the two main drivers namely precipitation and streamflow moreover it is undeniable that the precipitation streamflow relationship can be affected by non climatic factors such as land use cover change change in irrigation pattern intensity groundwater withdrawal surface water diversion and catchment characteristics see step 4 in fig 1 aghakouchak et al 2015 haslinger et al 2014 lópez moreno et al 2009 mehran et al 2015 van loon et al 2014 van loon 2015 yuan et al 2017 zhang and zhang 2019 however such changes occur often slowly and over a long period of time we did not consider such external factors with the hope to develop a more generalized approach for this reason we focused on upstream basins with limited human impacts unraveling anthropogenic impacts on precipitation streamflow relationship is more complex and warrants more in depth research in the future aghakouchak et al 2021 5 conclusions we proposed a framework to analyze the interaction between hydrologic drought evolution and the precipitation streamflow relationship hydrological drought evolution i e development and recovery was investigated using the variable threshold level and the run theory subsequently the effects of hydrological droughts on the precipitation streamflow relationship were analyzed during hydrological drought development hdd and hydrological drought recovery hdr we also analyzed the feedback effect of shifts in the precipitation streamflow relationship on hydrological drought evolution based on the effective streamflow precipitation ratio espr indicator the proposed framework was used to analyze drought conditions at six unregulated hydrologic stations in china the usa and australia the main conclusions are as follows i the average hdd period was longer than the average hdr period because the amount of effective streamflow generated by precipitation was lower during the hdd periods relative to the hdr periods ii the occurrence of hydrological droughts de linearized the precipitation streamflow relationship significantly and the changes in the precipitation streamflow relationship were substantially different during the hydrological drought development and recovery the observed changes in precipitation streamflow relationship were more pronounced during the hdd periods iii the espr can be regarded as a suitable indicator to evaluated changes during hydrological drought evolution development and recovery at the watershed scale the hydrological drought worsens as the espr approaches 0 during hdd periods generally the larger the espr during the hdr the faster the recovery occurs and vice versa drought related variables typically exhibit some level of relationship however the underlying relationships are often complex and variable in different locations for instance many studies have showed that pet teuling et al 2013 geology stoelzle et al 2014 groundwater haslinger et al 2014 parry et al 2018 land surface liu et al 2017 and various human activities e g reservoir regulation chang et al 2019 tijdeman et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 influence hydrological drought evolution in a variety of ways directly or indirectly the anthropogenic component cannot be generalized and requires case by case analysis in general the precipitation streamflow relationship is more pronounced than other variables hence in this study we focused on describing hydrologic droughts and their changes using an indicator based on precipitation and streamflow we are not considering the impact of different streamflow generation mechanisms on the hydrological drought development and recovery patterns we believe that in most cases the effects of soil moisture groundwater and land surface condition are somewhat captured in streamflow anthropogenic changes can also alter the precipitation streamflow relationship in complex ways more research should focus on how anthropogenic impacts change the precipitation streamflow relationship and hence hydrologic droughts credit authorship contribution statement jiefeng wu conceptualization methodology writing original draft funding acquisition xiaohong chen

of great environmental concern worldwide su et al 2011 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 influenced by natural factors such as climatic topographical and geological conditions and anthropogenic activities including urbanization and industrialization hydro chemistry in river systems demonstrates high spatio seasonal complexity panda et al 2006 ouyang et al 2006 zhou et al 2007 huang et al 2010 understanding the variation patterns of hydro chemistry and identifying the influencing factors are important to efficient water management and pollution control in river systems the yangtze river with a length of approximately 6300 km and a drainage basin of 1 8 million km2 is the largest river in china and the third largest in the world in terms of a huge annual runoff 976 billion m3 in average locating in central southern china and accounting for 18 8 of the total national territorial area the upper yangtze river basin uyrb plays a vital role in drinking water supply agricultural irrigation hydropower generation fishery industry shipping transportation and ecological landscape however with the rapid urbanization and industrialization in recent decades changes of land cover and the increased discharge of wastewater have led to deterioration of water quality besides owing to the vast expanse hydro chemistry in uyrb demonstrates significant variations in both seasonal and spatial dimensions associated with the complex natural factors and anthropogenic activities shen et al 2013 identifying the variation patterns and their influencing factors are essential for pollution control and the sustainable development of the whole river basin or even nationally environmental monitoring systems have been established for most river basins including uyrb which provide critical information about the dynamic changes of hydrology and water quality however these monitoring datasets are always difficult to be interpreted since they concern complicated spatio seasonal variations and a large number of inter related parameters given the powerful exploratory features multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis ca and factor analysis principal component analysis fa pca have been widely applied in data interpretation and variation pattern recognition li et al 2021 ouyang et al 2006 assessed the seasonal variations in hydro chemistry and found that water quality parameters played different roles in different seasons suggesting that these variations must be considered when developing the pollutant management plans zhao et al 2011 divided 12 months into three flow periods and proposed that the contaminated characteristics were highly associated with the hydrological conditions for spatial variations shrestha and kazama 2007 found that water quality in the upper fuji river basin japan was preferable compared to the downstream reach huang et al 2010 classified 46 monitoring sites in the qiantang river china into three pollution levels and concluded that water pollution was more serious in the smaller tributaries besides anthropogenic activities were also found to produce significant influence on the spatial variations of hydro chemistry zhou et al 2007 wang et al 2008 shen et al 2013 while spatio seasonal analysis of hydro chemistry has been widely conducted in river systems they focused on the apparent outputs from monitoring data but paid less or no attention to the universality and practicability variation patterns that have been identified are usually applicable to a specific case since each case has unique hydro chemical characteristics but lack of generalization and universality besides most studies attempted to explore the pollution sources and variation patterns based on the multivariate statistical results only without sufficient field verification and science practice integration su et al 2011 as a consequence despite the impressive variation patterns identified they have hardly advanced water management practices and further studies given the above considerations the present study employed multivariate statistical techniques to explore the spatio seasonal variations of hydro chemistry in uyrb following which variation patterns were generalized via an inter comparison with related works to provide a comprehensive insight field investigation was performed on the distribution of residential areas industrial activities and sewage discharge in the study area which can serve as verification for pattern recognition and pollutant source identification 2 background and field investigation 2 1 study area uyrb originates from the central tibetan plateau and extends approximately 4500 km with a steep slope to the three gorge reservoir tgr in yichang city hubei province fig 1 it covers a drainage basin of about 1 million km2 comprising the watersheds of jinsha river min river tuo river jialing river wu river and the main stream sequentially the main stream flows through qinghai province tibet autonomous region sichuan province yunnan province chongqing municipality and hubei province due to the large expanse associated with various terrains and administrative regions climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities in uyrb are extremely complex the northwestern plateau and mountains are characterized by arid and cold condition thus possessing less population and relatively original environment in contrast a subtropical monsoon climate with humid and warm features is determined in the southeast leading to the increase of population development of urbanization and prosperity of industrialization and related human activities 2 2 sampling stations the monitoring network was designed taking the topographic control points distribution of tributaries and technical difficulties into primary consideration some monitoring stations have more or less monitoring variables than the others after overall consideration of the variables used for analysis twelve sampling stations were selected in uyrb fig 1 field investigation was performed on the distribution of residential areas industrial activities and sewage discharge associated with these sampling stations which provided information for the pollutant source identification huatan ht station huatan town sichuan province and xiangjiaba xjb station shuifu county yunnan province locate in the jinsha river the upper stretch of uyrb ht station has a high elevation there was no obvious wastewater discharge in the sparsely populated area due to the steep terrain the erosive flow has led to sediment scouring and the fragmentized riverbed xjb station locates in the lower reach of the jinsha river apart from the domestic sewage from shuifu county field investigation has found that the industrial wastewater was discharged from a chemical plant into the river near xjb station hengjiang hj station hengjiang town sichuan province locates in the hengjiang river a tributary flowing into the yangtze river main stream at the right bank downstream from xjb station hj station was far away from industrial and manufacturing districts but some household wastes from hengjiang town were discharged into the river zhutuo zt station zhutuo town chongqing municipality and cuntan ct station cuntan town chongqing municipality locate in the yangtze river main stream zt station is upstream from the confluence with the jialing river domestic sewage from zhutuo town which had a population of about 88 000 was discharged at 400 m downstream there was a small paper mill at 2 km upstream and a small plastic plant nearby whose wastewater was discharged into the river ct station is approximately 7 5 km downstream from the confluence with the jialing river there was an important container port nearby wastewater from the surrounding towns was responsible for the deterioration of ct water the jialing river a large tributary of uyrb have three sampling stations in total wusheng ws station wusheng county sichuan province locates at a big bend of the jialing river and has a steep slope there was a small chemical fertilizer plant a power station a lamp factory and a distillery at approximately 5 km upstream in contrast beibei bb station beibei district chongqing municipality locates in a straight reach with stable bank slope and riverbed both wusheng county and beibei district had a population of more than 800 000 linjiangmen ljm station yuzhong district chongqing municipality is 200 m upstream from the confluence with the yangtze river main stream this station locates within the chongqing shipping port at which the sewage from shipping was discharged directly into the river furthermore wastewater from a big car factory and a pharmaceutical factory at 4 km upstream as well as the domestic sewage from the surrounding towns were also responsible for the river contamination luoduxi ldx station luodu town sichuan province locates in the qujiang river the largest tributary of the jialing river luodu town had a population of about 72 000 domestic sewage from luodu town and wastewater from the distillery and machinery work in town were discharged directly into the river wulong wl station wulong county chongqing municipality locates in the wujiang river a tributary of the yangtze river wulong county had a population of approximately 410 000 there was a sugar factory a glasswork and a meat processing plant upstream of which the wastewater was discharged into the river qingxichang qxc station qingxi town chongqing municipality and wanxian wx station tuokou town chongqing municipality locate in the yangtze river main stream within the influencing area of tgr qxc station is approximately 13 km downstream from the confluence with the wujiang river ripraps mingling with sands distribute in the right bank and riverbed as a consequence alternate effects of scouring and deposition were observed every year domestic sewage from towns and wastewater from a paper mill upstream were discharged into the river wx station locates in the vital area of tgr apart from the domestic sewage from wanzhou district that had a population of approximately 1 65 million pollutant source to wx water included the wastewater discharged by the shipyard power station and machinery work upstream 3 methods and materials 3 1 determination of hydro chemistry this study aims to investigate the spatio temporal variations of water quality in which the temporal variation refers to seasonal variation inter year variations and temporal trend are not included in the present study hydro chemistry at the selected sampling stations was determined monthly in 2010 table 1 summarizes the 20 hydro chemical parameters and their abbreviations units analytical techniques and the corresponding government standards and detection limits water stage flow rate water temperature do conductivity and ph were measured in situ using reference meters or probes water stage in uyrb was determined based on the reference in wusong estuary water samples were analyzed by yangtze river upstream water environment monitoring center at each station three sampling verticals were set across the river section generally for each vertical two samples were taken at 0 5 m below water surface and 0 5 m above riverbed respectively however for some small stations locating in tributaries such as hj and ljm water was only sampled at 0 5 m below water surface for the dominant stations in the main stream namely zt ct qxc and wx each sampling vertical has three sampling points at 0 5 m below water surface half water depth and 0 5 m above riverbed respectively 3 2 exploratory analysis accordingly each observation had more than three duplicates and the mean value was used for analysis correlation analysis was conducted to provide an initial exploration of the interrelation between the 20 hydro chemical variables the statistical significance of correlation coefficients was determined by t test at p 0 01 level in order to minimize the effect of significant spatial heterogeneity correlation analysis was carried out for the 12 sampling stations respectively li et al 2021 box plots of some representative parameters presented a visual impression on the spatio seasonal variations analysis of variance anova was performed to evaluate the spatial difference between sampling stations and seasonal difference between dry season nov apr and wet season may oct the significance of difference was determined by least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 level multivariate statistical techniques were employed to further explore the spatio seasonal variation patterns and the underlying pollution sources intrinsic correlation and similarity of monitoring data were explored via ca an unsupervised pattern recognition technique zhou et al 2007 belkhiri and narany 2015 li et al 2019 when conducting ca hydro chemical parameters were always used as attribute variables to group sampling sites periods or data points wunderlin et al 2001 singh et al 2004 kazi et al 2009 but scarcely considered as grouping objects in this study bi clustering was performed to group the water samples and hydro chemical parameters simultaneously cluster significance was discriminated by the criterion of 0 8dmax and sub clusters might be further determined at 0 6dmax in which dmax is the maximal linkage distance data dimensionality was reduced using pca to generate a small number of orthogonal principal components pcs to explain the majority of variance with minimum loss of original information helena et al 2000 simeonov et al 2003 chen et al 2007 huang et al 2010 rotation transformation was subsequently performed to produce a new set of pcs namely varifactors vfs which has less overlap involving original variables vega et al 1998 ouyang et al 2006 statistical analysis was conducted using spss 22 0 4 results 4 1 correlation analysis correlation matrix determined at zt station was shown in table 2 as an example since universality was observed for the other stations typical seasonal factors including water stage flow rate and temperature were closely correlated water stage was highly and positively correlated to flow rate except for qxc and wx stations which showed an anti seasonal artificial water level regulation in tgr zhao et al 2011 lu et al 2018 a reducing solubility of oxygen in water due to increasing temperature accounted for the negative correlation between temperature and do contamination parameters such as ss heavy metals fcoli and codmn were positively correlated to flow rate and temperature whereas the mineral indicators including water hardness and sulfate showed negative correlation with flow rate positive correlations with statistical significance p 0 01 were observed between fe cu pb fcoli tp codmn and ss probably due to the flocculated potential of heavy metals with organic matters krishna et al 2009 4 2 box plots box plots of three typical variables namely flow rate codmn and sulfate were displayed in fig 2 according to the correlation analysis these three parameters were representative of hydrological indices positively q correlated parameters and negatively q correlated parameters respectively data determined in the 12 months were plotted with different colors to demonstrate the variations more clearly flow rate was remarkably higher in wet season than in dry season p 0 05 fig 2a particularly the maximum was observed in jul sep for all monitoring stations higher flow rate and larger seasonal variation were determined in the main stream zt ct qxc and wx stations similar with flow rate codmn was obviously increased in wet season compared to dry season with a significant difference at 0 05 confidence level fig 2b related guidelines in the national environmental quality standards for surface water nepa and gaqsiq 2002 issued by china environmental protection agency were also plotted for reference generally in terms of codmn water quality in the study area was good class ii in dry season but deteriorated to be ordinary class iii in wet season the worst condition was determined in jul sep heavy metals ss and fcoli showed similar variation patterns in contrast with the increased flow rate concentration of sulfate was decreased in wet season for the most stations fig 2c similar with the variation of hardness 4 3 bi clustering bi clustering heatmaps of water samples and their hydro chemical parameters were shown in fig 3 for dry season according to the horizontal dendrogram fig 3a hydro chemical parameters can be grouped into five variable clusters a water stage ss fe cu and ph b flow rate codmn fcoli tp pb and fluoride c temperature conductivity and chloride d do bod5 hardness and sulfate and e tn and nn as for the vertical dendrogram ljm4 sample determined in apr at ljm was grouped separately from the other samples due to the serious contamination of codmn and fcoli ht and xjb samples were grouped together resulted from their high values in variable cluster a typically water stage ss and fe and low in variable cluster e namely nitrogen nutrients low content in mineral components together with the intense nitrogen pollution accounted for the clustering of hj samples clustering of most samples from ws bb and ldx was mainly because of a low codmn value and an abundance of sulfate similarly hydro chemical parameters determined in wet season fig 3b can be grouped into four variable clusters a flow rate temperature ss fe cu fcoli codmn tp and fluoride b water stage ph conductivity pb and chloride c do bod5 hardness and sulfate and d tn and nn water samples can be basically grouped into two clusters each of which consisted of several sub clusters just like that in dry season ht samples determined in wet season were grouped together due to their high values in variable cluster b typically water stage and chloride and low in variable cluster d namely tn and nn similar distributing patterns of the four variable clusters led to the grouping of xjb samples with some from zt ct and qxc hj samples were still grouped separately from others caused by a lack of mineral components and an abundance of nitrogen nutrients 4 4 fa pca fa pca was performed for dry season and wet season respectively to reduce the dimensionality of the 20 original hydro chemical variables six vfs were extracted for each season with eigenvalues higher than 1 0 table 3 samples were projected on the bi dimensional plane defined by the first two vfs fig 4 for dry season data vf1 explained 24 6 of the variance positively contributed by water stage chloride ss fe cu and negatively by tn nn these parameters were closely associated with the spatial locations and vf1 can be interpreted as the solid and nitrogen pollution samples from ht and xjb the upstream stations which had higher water stage and were less contaminated with nitrogen located at the positive vf1 axis on the projected plane fig 4a vf2 closely involving conductivity ph sulfate and hardness explained 14 6 of the variance representing the mineral components bb and ldx samples possessing a higher content of mineral components located at the positive vf2 axis while hj samples which were low in minerals distributed at the negative vf2 axis vf3 positively associated with flow rate temperature chloride and negatively with do bod5 explained 12 5 of the variance vf3 represented the oxygen indices which was influenced by climatic and hydrological factors vf4 and vf5 mainly involved with fluoride tp and fcoli codmn respectively which implied the industrial and domestic pollution associating with anthropogenic activities similar with vf6 which was positively contributed by pb for wet season data vf1 was positively associated with water stage conductivity chloride and negatively with tn nn explaining 18 9 of the variance it represented the nitrogen and chloride pollution which was influenced by spatial factor vf2 mainly contributed by flow rate temperature ss fe fcoli and codmn explained 15 1 of the variance implying the anthropogenic pollution influenced by climatic and hydrological variations due to these significant variations samples from wet season distributed dispersedly on the vf1 vf2 plane and the station associated clustering was less significant compared to dry season fig 4b nevertheless ht and xjb samples still showed distinct spatial difference from the others and thus locating at the positive vf1 axis vf3 was closely involved with conductivity sulfate hardness and fe and vf4 was associated with do bod5 and ph which can be interpreted as the mineral components and oxygen indices respectively vf5 and vf6 represented the latent pollutant sources associated with fluoride tp and pb respectively 5 discussion based on the multivariate statistical analysis results this section provided an inter comparison of hydro chemical spatio seasonal variation patterns and discussed the research prospects 5 1 spatial variations spatial variation pattern of hydro chemistry highly varied with the study area nevertheless three kinds of factors can be generalized from the related works that contributed to water quality spatial heterogeneity in river systems the first factor was whether the sampling site located in the main stream or tributaries generally water contamination was more severe in tributaries due to their smaller environmental capacity compared to the main stream huang et al 2010 sampling stations selected in the present study covered small tributaries the hengjiang river and wujiang river and huge runoff main stream tn concentration for hj and wl waters and tp concentration for wl water were classified as terrible level worse than class v data not shown according to the national environmental quality standards for surface water nepa and gaqsiq 2002 household wastes and industrial wastewater discharged from the surrounding towns seemed to produce remarkable effect on the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution partially due to the lower capacity to mitigate pollution loads in these two tributaries besides agricultural runoff with nitrogen and phosphorus rich fertilizers also contributed to the eutrophication potential he et al 2011 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 however opposite result has been reported in the luanhe river basin that higher pollution level was determined in the main river channel and larger tributaries xie et al 2013 on the one hand the luanhe river possesses a significantly lower environmental capacity with an annual runoff of 1 3 13 billion m3 compared to uyrb on the other hand the spatial variation pattern was also influenced by human related factor which would be discussed below in contrast high flow rate was determined in the main stream namely zt ct qxc and wx stations accompanied by a greater content of ss and heavy metals high flow rate with significant seasonal variation brought about an alternant process of sediment deposition and suspension resulting in an increase of solid pollution especially in wet season topographical and geological investigations have shown a significant effect of longshore sediment erosion in the jinsha river a mountainous area consequently water at ht and xjb stations was abundant in ss which would be transported into the main stream in addition soils entering the river with surface runoff in rainy season accounted for an increase of solid pollution as well the second factor involving spatial variation was the relative location of the sampling sites e g upstream or downstream in a river shrestha and kazama 2007 generally water quality in the upstream reach was preferable since it was less affected by human living and production the present study area uyrb ranged from sparsely populated mountainous area to prosperous cities concentrations of tn and nn were in a relatively low level in the jinsha river ht and xjb stations the upper stretch although nitrogen pollution was terrible class v or worse than class v for the other areas of uyrb similar situation was also observed in the jialing river with the upstream water ws station was less contaminated by tn and fcoli compared to the downstream water ljm and bb stations on the contrary water in ht and xjb stations was abundant in chloride ss fe and had a high conductivity presence of chloride and fe in source water was mainly resulted from soils weathering and minerals dissolution zhou et al 2007 su et al 2011 which also led to an increase of conductivity and ss as water flowed downstream mineral components were diluted on the whole whereas their concentrations might be increased again at specific sites due to inflow of tributaries however opposite variation pattern has also been determined that the relatively conservative constituents such as sulfate and chloride appeared to accumulate from upper to lower catchments singh et al 2004 this implied that the variation pattern was associated with the lithology types and hydrological conditions anthropogenic activities including urbanization industrialization and agriculturalization were the third factor influencing spatial heterogeneity of water quality in river systems zhou et al 2007 wang et al 2008 shen et al 2013 as mentioned above the jinsha river basin was mountainous with less population resulting in the minimal anthropogenic effect and preferable water quality at ht and xjb stations in contrast the downstream terrain became much flatter with pleasant warm humid climate leading to the increase of population development of urbanization and prosperity of industrialization and related human activities industrial wastewater domestic sewage and agricultural runoff from the surrounding cities towns and counties accounted for the severe nitrogen or phosphorus pollution at ljm and wl stations in addition water at ljm was terribly contaminated with fcoli worse than class v due to the sewage discharged from the chongqing shipping port which needed to be controlled and managed with caution 5 2 seasonal variations seasonal changes influenced the hydro chemical characteristics of surface water in multiple ways including the local climatic conditions temperature and precipitation hydrological processes rainfall and runoff and anthropogenic activities ouyang et al 2006 zhao et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2001 divided the water quality parameters into three categories according to their seasonal variation patterns a parameters possessing clear seasonal differences such as temperature and do b dilution related parameters which have lower concentration during wet season i e dissolved salts and c eroded materials including ss showing an increase in wet season due to rainfall and runoff however the latent anthropogenic factor has not been included in this interpretation in uyrb temperature and precipitation were significantly increased in wet season especially in jul sep directly resulting in an increase of runoff a lot of contamination parameters such as ss heavy metals tp codmn and fcoli were positively correlated with flow rate indicating that these contaminants were mainly input as non point sources accompanying with an increase of surface runoff zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 increasing flow rate in wet season caused souring on riverbed and longshore sediments suspending the small particle solids and thus leading to an increase of solid pollution urban runoff and agricultural runoff during rainfall events brought dusts and nutrients to the river systems panda et al 2006 he et al 2011 shen et al 2013 accounting for the increased turbidity and eutrophication potential furthermore owing to the active agricultural practices such as irrigation and crop residue burning in harvest seasons pan et al 2012 2015 xie et al 2013 a larger amount of sewage and wastes would be produced and discharged either directly or indirectly into the rivers accordingly these positively q correlated pollutants mostly associated with anthropogenic sources while partially came from natural processes such as erosion on the contrary water hardness and sulfate concentration were reduced with increased flow rate mineral components which mainly originated from natural processes including lithology and soil weathering were usually input into the surface water more constantly throughout the year edwards and withers 2008 zhao et al 2011 an increase of flow volume decreased the concentration of these relatively conservative constituents due to the dilution effect similar variation pattern has also been reported by ouyang et al 2006 that the mineral related parameters including alkalinity and salinity were negatively correlated with flow rate and temperature although there are not enforced regulations concerning these parameters in the surface water quality standards mineral components such as chloride sulfate and bi carbonate not only play an important role in the corrosive behavior hu et al 2018 li et al 2020 but also largely determine the flavor of drinking water whelton et al 2007 accordingly water quality parameters played distinct roles in different river environments and different periods when developing the water management and pollution control frameworks both the general influencing factors and particularities of specific cases should be taken into careful consideration 5 3 research prospects this study aimed to explore the spatial and seasonal variation patterns of hydro chemistry in river systems in order to minimize the influence caused by inter year variations and temporal trend one year data was employed for seasonal analysis in practice given the huge and valuable hydro energy uyrb is typical of hydropower cascade development with tens of reservoirs either in operation or under construction the world famous tgr has been put into operation since 2003 with the impounded water level increased step by step from 135 m to 175 m in 2010 in the upper catchment the jinsha river water impoundment has also been implemented successively for the xiangjiaba reservoir in 2012 and the xiluodu reservoir in 2013 all these human interventions significantly changed the hydrological processes and surrounding environments furthermore combined regulation of these cascade reservoirs produced a more complicated operational mode it would be both necessary and significant to investigate how these engineering implementations influence the spatio seasonal variation patterns of hydro chemistry in the future works which could also provide important insights to evaluate the environmental effects of hydraulic constructions when conducting spatial analysis the present study as well as the related works discussed above took the instantaneous observations in the whole study area into calculations simultaneously without considering the spatial hysteresis water particles flow downstream and convey the conservative mineral salts from upper to lower reaches which would take some time a numerical study showed that the water age from ct station to tgr dramatically increased from 5 days to 60 days due to water impoundment in tgr sun et al 2021 besides when point sources were discharged at specific sites it also takes time for the pollutants to spread and blend with bulk water furthermore nonconservative constituents such as nutrients could be degraded or decomposed with time to investigate this problem a more elaborate study program is required for which combining numerical simulation and field experiments could be taken into primary consideration field investigation on the distribution of residential areas industrial activities and sewage discharge in the study area was performed to assist the pollutant source identification and influencing factors exploration while beyond the scope of the present study to further conduct quantitative source apportionment absolute principle component score apcs could be used to estimate the contribution of each latent pollution component extracted by fa pca thurston and spengler 1985 simeonov et al 2003 zhou et al 2007 su et al 2011 in future study more related information such as reservoir operation land cover and other socio economic variables could be introduced to the correlation or causal analysis associated with the spatio seasonal variation patterns of hydro chemistry in river systems 6 conclusions hydro chemistry in uyrb was analyzed with ca and fa pca to explore the spatio seasonal variation patterns which were subsequently inter compared with related works to provide a comprehensive insight and systematic supports to future studies and practices environmental capacity relative up down stream location and anthropogenic activities were generalized as three critical factors that influenced the spatial heterogeneity of water quality the active anthropogenic practices together with the increased surface runoff accounted for the deteriorated water quality in wet season as an innovative attempt bi clustering of water samples and hydro chemical parameters intuitively revealed the intrinsic relationship of complex datasets contributing to the exploration of variation patterns the present study area ranging from small tributaries to huge runoff river covering sparsely populated mountainous area and prosperous cities involving in operation and under construction reservoirs was highly representative to analyze the spatio seasonal heterogeneity of hydro chemistry credit authorship contribution

understanding the variation patterns of hydro chemistry and identifying the influencing factors are important to efficient water management and pollution control in river systems the yangtze river

monitoring data but paid less or no attention to the universality and practicability variation patterns that have been identified are usually applicable to a specific case since each case has unique hydro chemical characteristics but lack of generalization and universality besides most studies attempted to explore the pollution sources and variation patterns based on the multivariate statistical results only without sufficient field verification and science practice integration su et al 2011 as a consequence despite the impressive variation patterns identified they have hardly advanced water management practices and further studies given the above considerations the present study employed multivariate statistical techniques to explore the spatio seasonal variations of hydro chemistry in uyrb following which variation patterns were generalized via an inter comparison with related works to provide a comprehensive insight field investigation was performed on the distribution of residential areas industrial activities and sewage discharge in the study area which can serve as verification for pattern recognition and pollutant source identification 2 background and field investigation 2 1 study area uyrb originates from the central tibetan plateau and extends approximately 4500 km with a steep slope to the three gorge reservoir tgr in yichang city hubei province fig 1 it covers a drainage basin of about 1 million km2 comprising the watersheds of jinsha river min river tuo river jialing river wu river and the main stream sequentially the main stream flows through qinghai province tibet autonomous region sichuan province yunnan province chongqing municipality and hubei province due to the large expanse associated with various terrains and administrative regions climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities in uyrb are extremely complex the northwestern plateau and mountains are characterized by arid and cold condition thus possessing less population and relatively original environment in contrast a subtropical monsoon climate with humid and warm features is determined in the southeast leading to the increase of population development of urbanization and prosperity of industrialization and related human activities 2 2 sampling stations the monitoring network was designed taking the topographic control points distribution of tributaries and technical difficulties into primary consideration some monitoring stations have more or less monitoring variables than the others after overall consideration of the variables used for analysis twelve sampling stations were selected in uyrb fig 1 field investigation was performed on the distribution of residential areas industrial activities and sewage discharge associated with these sampling stations which provided information for the pollutant source identification huatan ht station huatan town sichuan province and xiangjiaba xjb station shuifu county yunnan province locate in the jinsha river the upper stretch of uyrb ht station has a high elevation there was no obvious wastewater discharge in the sparsely populated area due to the steep terrain the erosive flow has led to sediment scouring and the fragmentized riverbed xjb station locates in the lower reach of the jinsha river apart from the domestic sewage from shuifu county field investigation has found that the industrial wastewater was discharged from a chemical plant into the river near xjb station hengjiang hj station hengjiang town sichuan province locates in the hengjiang river a tributary flowing into the yangtze river main stream at the right bank downstream from xjb station hj station was far away from industrial and manufacturing districts but some household wastes from hengjiang town were discharged into the river zhutuo zt station zhutuo town chongqing municipality and cuntan ct station cuntan town chongqing municipality locate in the yangtze river main stream zt station is upstream from the confluence with the jialing river domestic sewage from zhutuo town which had a population of about 88 000 was discharged at 400 m downstream there was a small paper mill at 2 km upstream and a small plastic plant nearby whose wastewater was discharged into the river ct station is approximately 7 5 km downstream from the confluence with the jialing river there was an important container port nearby wastewater from the surrounding towns was responsible for the deterioration of ct water the jialing river a large tributary of uyrb have three sampling stations in total wusheng ws station wusheng county sichuan province locates at a big bend of the jialing river and has a steep slope there was a small chemical fertilizer plant a power station a lamp factory and a distillery at approximately 5 km upstream in contrast beibei bb station beibei district chongqing municipality locates in a straight reach with stable bank slope and riverbed both wusheng county and beibei district had a population of more than 800 000 linjiangmen ljm station yuzhong district chongqing municipality is 200 m upstream from the confluence with the yangtze river main stream this station locates within the chongqing shipping port at which the sewage from shipping was discharged directly into the river furthermore wastewater from a big car factory and a pharmaceutical factory at 4 km upstream as well as the domestic sewage from the surrounding towns were also responsible for the river contamination luoduxi ldx station luodu town sichuan province locates in the qujiang river the largest tributary of the jialing river luodu town had a population of about 72 000 domestic sewage from luodu town and wastewater from the distillery and machinery work in town were discharged directly into the river wulong wl station wulong county chongqing municipality locates in the wujiang river a tributary of the yangtze river wulong county had a population of approximately 410 000 there was a sugar factory a glasswork and a meat processing plant upstream of which the wastewater was discharged into the river qingxichang qxc station qingxi town chongqing municipality and wanxian wx station tuokou town chongqing municipality locate in the yangtze river main stream within the influencing area of tgr qxc station is approximately 13 km downstream from the confluence with the wujiang river ripraps mingling with sands distribute in the right bank and riverbed as a consequence alternate effects of scouring and deposition were observed every year domestic sewage from towns and wastewater from a paper mill upstream were discharged into the river wx station locates in the vital area of tgr apart from the domestic sewage from wanzhou district that had a population of approximately 1 65 million pollutant source to wx water included the wastewater discharged by the shipyard power station and machinery work upstream 3 methods and materials 3 1 determination of hydro chemistry this study aims to investigate the spatio temporal variations of water quality in which the temporal variation refers to seasonal variation inter year variations and temporal trend are not included in the present study hydro chemistry at the selected sampling stations was determined monthly in 2010 table 1 summarizes the 20 hydro chemical parameters and their abbreviations units analytical techniques and the corresponding government standards and detection limits water stage flow rate water temperature do conductivity and ph were measured in situ using reference meters or probes water stage in uyrb was determined based on the reference in wusong estuary water samples were analyzed by yangtze river upstream water environment monitoring center at each station three sampling verticals were set across the river section generally for each vertical two samples were taken at 0 5 m below water surface and 0 5 m above riverbed respectively however for some small stations locating in tributaries such as hj and ljm water was only sampled at 0 5 m below water surface for the dominant stations in the main stream namely zt ct qxc and wx each sampling vertical has three sampling points at 0 5 m below water surface half water depth and 0 5 m above riverbed respectively 3 2 exploratory analysis accordingly each observation had more than three duplicates and the mean value was used for analysis correlation analysis was conducted to provide an initial exploration of the interrelation between the 20 hydro chemical variables the statistical significance of correlation coefficients was determined by t test at p 0 01 level in order to minimize the effect of significant spatial heterogeneity correlation analysis was carried out for the 12 sampling stations respectively li et al 2021 box plots of some representative parameters presented a visual impression on the spatio seasonal variations analysis of variance anova was performed to evaluate the spatial difference between sampling stations and seasonal difference between dry season nov apr and wet season may oct the significance of difference was determined by least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 level multivariate statistical techniques were employed to further explore the spatio seasonal variation patterns and the underlying pollution sources intrinsic correlation and similarity of monitoring data were explored via ca an unsupervised pattern recognition technique zhou et al 2007 belkhiri and narany 2015 li et al 2019 when conducting ca hydro chemical parameters were always used as attribute variables to group sampling sites periods or data points wunderlin et al 2001 singh et al 2004 kazi et al 2009 but scarcely considered as grouping objects in this study bi clustering was performed to group the water samples and hydro chemical parameters simultaneously cluster significance was discriminated by the criterion of 0 8dmax and sub clusters might be further determined at 0 6dmax in which dmax is the maximal linkage distance data dimensionality was reduced using pca to generate a small number of orthogonal principal components pcs to explain the majority of variance with minimum loss of original information helena et al 2000 simeonov et al 2003 chen et al 2007 huang et al 2010 rotation transformation was subsequently performed to produce a new set of pcs namely varifactors vfs which has less overlap involving original variables vega et al 1998 ouyang et al 2006 statistical analysis was conducted using spss 22 0 4 results 4 1 correlation analysis correlation matrix determined at zt station was shown in table 2 as an example since universality was observed for the other stations typical seasonal factors including water stage flow rate and temperature were closely correlated water stage was highly and positively correlated to flow rate except for qxc and wx stations which showed an anti seasonal artificial water level regulation in tgr zhao et al 2011 lu et al 2018 a reducing solubility of oxygen in water due to increasing temperature accounted for the negative correlation between temperature and do contamination parameters such as ss heavy metals fcoli and codmn were positively correlated to flow rate and temperature whereas the mineral indicators including water hardness and sulfate showed negative correlation with flow rate positive correlations with statistical significance p 0 01 were observed between fe cu pb fcoli tp codmn and ss probably due to the flocculated potential of heavy metals with organic matters krishna et al 2009 4 2 box plots box plots of three typical variables namely flow rate codmn and sulfate were displayed in fig 2 according to the correlation analysis these three parameters were representative of hydrological indices positively q correlated parameters and negatively q correlated parameters respectively data determined in the 12 months were plotted with different colors to demonstrate the variations more clearly flow rate was remarkably higher in wet season than in dry season p 0 05 fig 2a particularly the maximum was observed in jul sep for all monitoring stations higher flow rate and larger seasonal variation were determined in the main stream zt ct qxc and wx stations similar with flow rate codmn was obviously increased in wet season compared to dry season with a significant difference at 0 05 confidence level fig 2b related guidelines in the national environmental quality standards for surface water nepa and gaqsiq 2002 issued by china environmental protection agency were also plotted for reference generally in terms of codmn water quality in the study area was good class ii in dry season but deteriorated to be ordinary class iii in wet season the worst condition was determined in jul sep heavy metals ss and fcoli showed similar variation patterns in contrast with the increased flow rate concentration of sulfate was decreased in wet season for the most stations fig 2c similar with the variation of hardness 4 3 bi clustering bi clustering heatmaps of water samples and their hydro chemical parameters were shown in fig 3 for dry season according to the horizontal dendrogram fig 3a hydro chemical parameters can be grouped into five variable clusters a water stage ss fe cu and ph b flow rate codmn fcoli tp pb and fluoride c temperature conductivity and chloride d do bod5 hardness and sulfate and e tn and nn as for the vertical dendrogram ljm4 sample determined in apr at ljm was grouped separately from the other samples due to the serious contamination of codmn and fcoli ht and xjb samples were grouped together resulted from their high values in variable cluster a typically water stage ss and fe and low in variable cluster e namely nitrogen nutrients low content in mineral components together with the intense nitrogen pollution accounted for the clustering of hj samples clustering of most samples from ws bb and ldx was mainly because of a low codmn value and an abundance of sulfate similarly hydro chemical parameters determined in wet season fig 3b can be grouped into four variable clusters a flow rate temperature ss fe cu fcoli codmn tp and fluoride b water stage ph conductivity pb and chloride c do bod5 hardness and sulfate and d tn and nn water samples can be basically grouped into two clusters each of which consisted of several sub clusters just like that in dry season ht samples determined in wet season were grouped together due to their high values in variable cluster b typically water stage and chloride and low in variable cluster d namely tn and nn similar distributing patterns of the four variable clusters led to the grouping of xjb samples with some from zt ct and qxc hj samples were still grouped separately from others caused by a lack of mineral components and an abundance of nitrogen nutrients 4 4 fa pca fa pca was performed for dry season and wet season respectively to reduce the dimensionality of the 20 original hydro chemical variables six vfs were extracted for each season with eigenvalues higher than 1 0 table 3 samples were projected on the bi dimensional plane defined by the first two vfs fig 4 for dry season data vf1 explained 24 6 of the variance positively contributed by water stage chloride ss fe cu and negatively by tn nn these parameters were closely associated with the spatial locations and vf1 can be interpreted as the solid and nitrogen pollution samples from ht and xjb the upstream stations which had higher water stage and were less contaminated with nitrogen located at the positive vf1 axis on the projected plane fig 4a vf2 closely involving conductivity ph sulfate and hardness explained 14 6 of the variance representing the mineral components bb and ldx samples possessing a higher content of mineral components located at the positive vf2 axis while hj samples which were low in minerals distributed at the negative vf2 axis vf3 positively associated with flow rate temperature chloride and negatively with do bod5 explained 12 5 of the variance vf3 represented the oxygen indices which was influenced by climatic and hydrological factors vf4 and vf5 mainly involved with fluoride tp and fcoli codmn respectively which implied the industrial and domestic pollution associating with anthropogenic activities similar with vf6 which was positively contributed by pb for wet season data vf1 was positively associated with water stage conductivity chloride and negatively with tn nn explaining 18 9 of the variance it represented the nitrogen and chloride pollution which was influenced by spatial factor vf2 mainly contributed by flow rate temperature ss fe fcoli and codmn explained 15 1 of the variance implying the anthropogenic pollution influenced by climatic and hydrological variations due to these significant variations samples from wet season distributed dispersedly on the vf1 vf2 plane and the station associated clustering was less significant compared to dry season fig 4b nevertheless ht and xjb samples still showed distinct spatial difference from the others and thus locating at the positive vf1 axis vf3 was closely involved with conductivity sulfate hardness and fe and vf4 was associated with do bod5 and ph which can be interpreted as the mineral components and oxygen indices respectively vf5 and vf6 represented the latent pollutant sources associated with fluoride tp and pb respectively 5 discussion based on the multivariate statistical analysis results this section provided an inter comparison of hydro chemical spatio seasonal variation patterns and discussed the research prospects 5 1 spatial variations spatial variation pattern of hydro chemistry highly varied with the study area nevertheless three kinds of factors can be generalized from the related works that contributed to water quality spatial heterogeneity in river systems the first factor was whether the sampling site located in the main stream or tributaries generally water contamination was more severe in tributaries due to their smaller environmental capacity compared to the main stream huang et al 2010 sampling stations selected in the present study covered small tributaries the hengjiang river and wujiang river and huge runoff main stream tn concentration for hj and wl waters and tp concentration for wl water were classified as terrible level worse than class v data not shown according to the national environmental quality standards for surface water nepa and gaqsiq 2002 household wastes and industrial wastewater discharged from the surrounding towns seemed to produce remarkable effect on the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution partially due to the lower capacity to mitigate pollution loads in these two tributaries besides agricultural runoff with nitrogen and phosphorus rich fertilizers also contributed to the eutrophication potential he et al 2011 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 however opposite result has been reported in the luanhe river basin that higher pollution level was determined in the main river channel and larger tributaries xie et al 2013 on the one hand the luanhe river possesses a significantly lower environmental capacity with an annual runoff of 1 3 13 billion m3 compared to uyrb on the other hand the spatial variation pattern was also influenced by human related factor which would be discussed below in contrast high flow rate was determined in the main stream namely zt ct qxc and wx stations accompanied by a greater content of ss and heavy metals high flow rate with significant seasonal variation brought about an alternant process of sediment deposition and suspension resulting in an increase of solid pollution especially in wet season topographical and geological investigations have shown a significant effect of longshore sediment erosion in the jinsha river a mountainous area consequently water at ht and xjb stations was abundant in ss which would be transported into the main stream in addition soils entering the river with surface runoff in rainy season accounted for an increase of solid pollution as well the second factor involving spatial variation was the relative location of the sampling sites e g upstream or downstream in a river shrestha and kazama 2007 generally water quality in the upstream reach was preferable since it was less affected by human living and production the present study area uyrb ranged from sparsely populated mountainous area to prosperous cities concentrations of tn and nn were in a relatively low level in the jinsha river ht and xjb stations the upper stretch although nitrogen pollution was terrible class v or worse than class v for the other areas of uyrb similar situation was also observed in the jialing river with the upstream water ws station was less contaminated by tn and fcoli compared to the downstream water ljm and bb stations on the contrary water in ht and xjb stations was abundant in chloride ss fe and had a high conductivity presence of chloride and fe in source water was mainly resulted from soils weathering and minerals dissolution zhou et al 2007 su et al 2011 which also led to an increase of conductivity and ss as water flowed downstream mineral components were diluted on the whole whereas their concentrations might be increased again at specific sites due to inflow of tributaries however opposite variation pattern has also been determined that the relatively conservative constituents such as sulfate and chloride appeared to accumulate from upper to lower catchments singh et al 2004 this implied that the variation pattern was associated with the lithology types and hydrological conditions anthropogenic activities including urbanization industrialization and agriculturalization were the third factor influencing spatial heterogeneity of water quality in river systems zhou et al 2007 wang et al 2008 shen et al 2013 as mentioned above the jinsha river basin was mountainous with less population resulting in the minimal anthropogenic effect and preferable water quality at ht and xjb stations in contrast the downstream terrain became much flatter with pleasant warm humid climate leading to the increase of population development of urbanization and prosperity of industrialization and related human activities industrial wastewater domestic sewage and agricultural runoff from the surrounding cities towns and counties accounted for the severe nitrogen or phosphorus pollution at ljm and wl stations in addition water at ljm was terribly contaminated with fcoli worse than class v due to the sewage discharged from the chongqing shipping port which needed to be controlled and managed with caution 5 2 seasonal variations seasonal changes influenced the hydro chemical characteristics of surface water in multiple ways including the local climatic conditions temperature and precipitation hydrological processes rainfall and runoff and anthropogenic activities ouyang et al 2006 zhao et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2001 divided the water quality parameters into three categories according to their seasonal variation patterns a parameters possessing clear seasonal differences such as temperature and do b dilution related parameters which have lower concentration during wet season i e dissolved salts and c eroded materials including ss showing an increase in wet season due to rainfall and runoff however the latent anthropogenic factor has not been included in this interpretation in uyrb temperature and precipitation were significantly increased in wet season especially in jul sep directly resulting in an increase of runoff a lot of contamination parameters such as ss heavy metals tp codmn and fcoli were positively correlated with flow rate indicating that these contaminants were mainly input as non point sources accompanying with an increase of surface runoff zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 increasing flow rate in wet season caused souring on riverbed and longshore sediments suspending the small particle solids and thus leading to an increase of solid pollution urban runoff and agricultural runoff during rainfall events brought dusts and nutrients to the river systems panda et al 2006 he et al 2011 shen et al 2013 accounting for the increased turbidity and eutrophication potential furthermore owing to the active agricultural practices such as irrigation and crop residue burning in harvest seasons pan et al 2012 2015 xie et al 2013 a larger amount of sewage and wastes would be produced and discharged either directly or indirectly into the rivers accordingly these positively q correlated pollutants mostly associated with anthropogenic sources while partially came from natural processes such as erosion on the contrary water hardness and sulfate concentration were reduced with increased flow rate mineral components which mainly originated from natural processes including lithology and soil weathering were usually input into the surface water more constantly throughout the year edwards and withers 2008 zhao et al 2011 an increase of flow volume decreased the concentration of these relatively conservative constituents due to the dilution effect similar variation pattern has also been reported by ouyang et al 2006 that the mineral related parameters including alkalinity and salinity were negatively correlated with flow rate and temperature although there are not enforced regulations concerning these parameters in the surface water quality standards mineral components such as chloride sulfate and bi carbonate not only play an important role in the corrosive behavior hu et al 2018 li et al 2020 but also largely determine the flavor of drinking water whelton et al 2007 accordingly water quality parameters played distinct roles in different river environments and different periods when developing the water management and pollution control frameworks both the general influencing factors and particularities of specific cases should be taken into careful consideration 5 3 research prospects this study aimed to explore the spatial and seasonal variation patterns of hydro chemistry in river systems in order to minimize the influence caused by inter year variations and temporal trend one year data was employed for seasonal analysis in practice given the huge and valuable hydro energy uyrb is typical of hydropower cascade development with tens of reservoirs either in operation or under construction the world famous tgr has been put into operation since 2003 with the impounded water level increased step by step from 135 m to 175 m in 2010 in the upper catchment the jinsha river water impoundment has also been implemented successively for the xiangjiaba reservoir in 2012 and the xiluodu reservoir in 2013 all these human interventions significantly changed the hydrological processes and surrounding environments furthermore combined regulation of these cascade reservoirs produced a more complicated operational mode it would be both necessary and significant to investigate how these engineering implementations influence the spatio seasonal variation patterns of hydro chemistry in the future works which could also provide important insights to evaluate the environmental effects of hydraulic constructions when conducting spatial analysis the present study as well as the related works discussed above took the instantaneous observations in the whole study area into calculations simultaneously without considering the spatial hysteresis water particles flow downstream and convey the conservative mineral salts from upper to lower reaches which would take some time a numerical study showed that the water age from ct station to tgr dramatically increased from 5 days to 60 days due to water impoundment in tgr sun et al 2021 besides when point sources were discharged at specific sites it also takes time for the pollutants to spread and blend with bulk water furthermore nonconservative constituents such as nutrients could be degraded or decomposed with time to investigate this problem a more elaborate study program is required for which combining numerical simulation and field experiments could be taken into primary consideration field investigation on the distribution of residential areas industrial activities and sewage discharge in the study area was performed to assist the pollutant source identification and influencing factors exploration while beyond the scope of the present study to further conduct quantitative source apportionment absolute principle component score apcs could be used to estimate the contribution of each latent pollution component extracted by fa pca thurston and spengler 1985 simeonov et al 2003 zhou et al 2007 su et al 2011 in future study more related information such as reservoir operation land cover and other socio economic variables could be introduced to the correlation or causal analysis associated with the spatio seasonal variation patterns of hydro chemistry in river systems 6 conclusions hydro chemistry in uyrb was analyzed with ca and fa pca to explore the spatio seasonal variation patterns which were subsequently inter compared with related works to provide a comprehensive insight and systematic supports to future studies and practices environmental capacity relative up down stream location and anthropogenic activities were generalized as three critical factors that influenced the spatial heterogeneity of water quality the active anthropogenic practices together with the increased surface runoff accounted for the deteriorated water quality in wet season as an innovative attempt bi clustering of water samples and hydro chemical parameters intuitively revealed the intrinsic relationship of complex datasets contributing to the exploration of variation patterns the present study area ranging from small tributaries to huge runoff river covering sparsely populated mountainous area and prosperous cities involving in operation and under construction reservoirs was highly representative to analyze the spatio seasonal heterogeneity of hydro chemistry credit authorship contribution

4629,the air2water model is a widely used tool for the forecasting of lake water temperatures and projection of climate change it has been applied in thousands of lakes worldwide however it employed the particle swarm optimization pso as the calibration method which was proposed more than 20 years ago in this study 12 advanced optimization algorithms proposed during the recent few years were implemented to calibrate and validate the air2water model daily observed water temperature in temperate lakes 22 lowland lakes in poland were used to evaluate the model performance each optimizer was run 30 times with 3 different settings of the maximum number of function calls 5000 20 000 and 100 000 we have found that the pso method used in the original air2water model performs relatively poor compared with most of the recent algorithms and the majority of recently proposed algorithms reach the similar best solutions on many lakes when the highest number of function calls is allowed however only the hard de hierarchical archive based mutation strategy with depth information of differential evolution algorithm is never outperformed by any competitor irrespective which lake and maximum number of function calls is considered as a result we highly recommend using hard de as the calibration method for the air2water model in the future studies keywords water temperature lake air2water calibration algorithm pso hard de 1 introduction water temperature is one of the key abiotic properties of lakes thermal classification of lakes is among the basic characteristics diversifying these elements of the hydrosphere both in the global and regional approaches hutchinson and loffler 1956 water temperature is of great importance for the course of water mixing water quality concentration of gases farmer and carmack 1981 saber et al 2020 water temperature plays an important role in impacting the bio chemical processes and the metabolism of many aquatic species in lakes price and sowers 2004 åberg et al 2010 beaulieu et al 2013 kraemer et al 2017 for example metabolic rates for microbial growth development and survival depend on water temperature price and sowers 2004 water temperature impacts cyanobacterial abundance and nutrient concentrations ho and michalak 2020 therefore it is of great significance to evaluate the temporal variations of water temperature in lake systems prediction of lake surface water temperature lswt has been particularly popular in recent years as lswt is an important indicator of global climate change in the past years three groups of models have been developed and used to forecast lswt the first category is the process based deterministic models based on energy balance which require many model inputs such as lake morphology bathymetry inflow outflow conditions full meteorological parameters stefan et al 1998 the second group is the statistical models without physical meanings heddam et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020a 2020b the third one is the so called hybrid physically statistically based models and a typical example is the air2water model piccolroaz et al 2013 the hybrid air2water model is based on the energy balance equation it is simple and accurate heddam et al 2020 piccolroaz et al 2021 and needs only the air temperature as model input which makes it a robust tool for the forecasting of lake surface temperature until now it has been applied in thousands of lakes over the world piccolroaz et al 2013 2015 2020 2021 piccolroaz and toffolon 2018a 2018b toffolon et al 2014 2020 piccolroaz 2016 czernecki and ptak 2018 prats and danis 2019 guo et al 2020 though the model is easy to use it requires calibration of a number of parameters for the full air2water model eight parameters are needed to be calibrated in this regard the calibration method is of great importance for model applications however to the best of our knowledge there is no study focusing on the calibration algorithm for the model until now how does the calibration method impact the performance of the air2water model for the forecasting of lake surface water temperatures is still unknown in the original air2water model the monte carlo method with 100 000 000 realizations of eight model parameters was used for model calibration piccolroaz et al 2013 but in the subsequent research the authors moved to the variant of the particle swarm optimization pso with inertia weight kennedy and eberhart 1995 for model calibration piccolroaz et al 2018 although it is still popular pso has been proposed more than 20 years ago and a huge number of its improved variants have been introduced during the latest two decades bonyadi and michalewicz 2017a moreover pso algorithm was shown to be efficient when the problem is very simple or the number of allowed function calls is very low which is often the case when time is of higher importance than the quality of solution piotrowski et al 2017 price et al 2019 we already know that for the similar problem of calibration of the air2stream model that relates the stream water temperature with the air temperature and discharge the basic pso algorithm is not efficient piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 in the last two decades a large number of other optimization algorithms have been proposed and applied in various scientific fields e g das et al 2016 bonyadi and michalewicz 2017a price et al 2019 fausto et al 2020 in this study we have chosen several recently proposed algorithms that have already confirmed their efficiency on various problems including a number of winners of the recent ieee competitions in numerical optimization for the air2water model calibration the list of the chosen algorithms is given in table 1 long term observed data from 22 lakes in poland were used for the evaluation the results in the present study may benefit the community with a robust tool for lake water temperature modeling the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 described the studied lakes and data structure of the air2water model reasons for choosing the optimization algorithms listed in table 1 setup of the calibration methods as well as the model performance metrics section 3 presented the modeling results section 4 discussed the modeling results the major findings and limitations were summarized in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied lakes and data in this study long term observed daily water temperatures from 22 lakes and daily air temperatures from the nearby 9 meteorological stations in poland central europe were used fig 1 the morphologies of these lakes are summarized in table 2 as is shown the studied lakes have diverse morphologies which will benefit the model testing for each calibration algorithm for almost all the lakes 30 years of the observed data are available 1987 2016 among which 20 years of data 1987 2006 are used for model calibration and the remaining data with 10 years 2007 2016 are used for model validation there are two exceptions in the case of the bachotek lake the data from december 2016 are unavailable and in the case of the slawskie lake the data ends in december 2014 for these two cases the calibration periods are kept the same as that for the remaining lakes but the validation ones are shorter water temperature was measured at 7 00 or 8 00 am at the local time at a water depth 0 4 m below the water surface or ice cover when present one time a day by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute in poland water temperature was measured at the shore using well scoop thermometers the time series data for each lake is consecutive ensuring modeling and climate change studies e g heddam et al 2020 piccolroaz et al 2021 time series data of daily water temperature and air temperature of eight lakes are presented in fig 2 as an example to limit the impact of initial condition on the results the first 30 days of each data set are considered as a warm up period and are not used to evaluate the modelling performance 2 2 the air2water model the air2water model is a simple and accurate model for lswt modeling heddam et al 2020 piccolroaz et al 2020 2021 zhu et al 2020b it is based on the volume integrated heat balance equation and by linearizing the heat flux terms through taylor expansion a simplified equation takes the form 1 d t w dt 1 δ a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w a 5 cos 2 π t t y a 6 2 δ exp t w t h a 4 if t w t h δ exp t h t w a 7 exp t w a 8 if t w t h where t is time tw is lswt ta is air temperature δ is a dimensionless parameter representing the ratio between the volume of the surface lake layer and a reference volume ty is the duration of the year in days which reflects the assumption that the sum of the external forcing on lake surface volume can be depicted with a sinusoidal term characterized by a primary annual period toffolon et al 2014 th is a reference value for the deep lake water temperature 4 c for dimictic lakes and the minimum or maximum water temperature for the other lakes a1 a8 are the eight model parameters and they are determined by the calibration

were ranked among the very best performing methods during previous ieee competitions on numerical optimizations that were held on larger number of higher dimensional problems and are hence used in the present study as differential evolution de methods storn and price 1997 are among the most efficient evolutionary algorithms we use a number of advanced recently proposed de variants namely a hybrid

depth information of de hard de meng and pan 2019 and ensemble of de variants edev wu et al 2018 as the basic pso with inertia weight shi and eberhart 1998 was used so far in the air2water calibration we test this algorithm and more recent pso variants namely dual environmental particle swarm optimizer depso zhang et al 2019 and ensemble particle swarm optimizer epso lynn and suganthan 2017 in recent years a large number of versatile optimizers based on different biological or physical inspirations have been proposed however these methods are sometimes criticized as ad hoc developments to large extent mimicking older algorithms under new names sorensen 2015 fausto et al 2020 nonetheless among these methods we have chosen a hybrid of invasive weed optimization iwo with biogeography based optimization bbo iwo bbo khademi et al 2017 finally our comparison includes the best method found by piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 a few years ago for the air2stream model cobide wang et al 2014 all the newer optimization algorithms are implemented with control parameter settings including population sizes that were proposed by their authors in the case of the pso with inertia weight after some initial tests and based on the pso related literature we have chosen swarm size 50 see discussion in piotrowski et al 2020 acceleration coefficients c1 c2 1 49445 clerc and kennedy 2002 and the inertia weight was decided to be linearly decreasing from 0 9 at the beginning of the search to 0 4 at the end shi and eberhart 1998 the global topology is used for information sharing between pso particles another important issue is the maximum number of function calls used which is often related to the dimensionality d of the problem in various ieee competitions the number of function calls was set to 10 000d suganthan et al 2005 awad et al 2016 however in the recent competition yue et al 2019 on low dimensional problems this value was avoided and the number of function calls ranged from 50 000 for 5 dimensional problems to 10 000 000 for 20 dimensional ones on the other hand in older competition on real world problems das and suganthan 2010 collected from various fields of science all the problems were solved with 150 000 function calls irrespectively of the dimensionality that ranged from 1 to over 200 the impact of the choice of the number of function calls has also been discussed and analyzed for various problems in details in posik et al 2012 and piotrowski et al 2017 considering the very different settings of the allowed number of function calls used in various papers and competitions aimed at comparing optimization algorithms in this study we also aim to evaluate the impact of the number of function calls on the performance of each algorithm for the air2water model the dimensionality d is 8 as there are eight parameters to be determined hence we have decided to use the following three maximum numbers of function calls in our tests 5 000 20 000 and 100 000 1000d 10 000d as some algorithms e g lshade spacma pso with inertia weight behave differently at various stages of the search depending on how many function calls is allowed separate runs are performed for each number of function calls hence the results for 5 000 function calls are not the same as the results obtained after 5000 function calls when e g 20 000 calls are allowed it may hence turn out that by chance some methods produce better results when lower number of function calls is allowed we found a problem with implementing hs es zhang and shi 2018 which code was obtained from the conference webpage https www3 ntu edu sg home epnsugan https github com p n suganthan cec2018 for lower numbers of function calls the problem is purely technical as hs es performs different steps in different periods of the search but the initial period is assumed to be larger than our assumed lower numbers of allowed function calls as a result for 5000 and 20 000 function calls the algorithm is unable to proceed all its stages using hs es for such number of function calls would require a detailed study of configuration of its various control parameters that are set fixed in the code and are not studied in zhang and shi 2018 as a result we have decided to implement hs es solely for 100 000 function calls to get a reliable result we repeat each calibration 30 times for all the algorithms lakes and allowed numbers of function calls and the comparison is based on the mean performance from the 30 runs 2 4 model performance metrics in this study as an objective function used during calibration the mean square error mse is used 3 mse 1 n i 1 n t m t o 2 to compare results among different algorithms lakes and numbers of function calls we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsc and the root mean squared error rmse 4 nsc 1 i 1 n t m t o 2 i 1 n t o t av 2 the rmse the square root of the mse is a standard way to measure the error of a model in predicting quantitative data in the above equations n is the number of data points for either calibration or validation period to and tm are respectively the observed and modeled water temperature and tav is the average value of to 3 results the results for the 30 run mean values of mse rmse and nsc for the air2water model calibrated with different optimization algorithms and numbers of function calls for two lakes dadaj and wdzydze are summarized in tables 4 and 5 the results for the other 20 lakes are presented in tables s1 s20 with 5000 function calls only a few optimization algorithms can produce the reasonable result for each lake and the majority of the algorithms fail to obtain the sufficiently good performance among the 11 algorithms tested for this number of function calls hard de always performs the best 22 times with the best result lshade spacma method is able to reach the same results as hard de for 11 lakes which is also shown in fig 3 with the increase of function calls most of the optimization algorithms tend to perform better which is clearly shown in tables 4 6 and s1 s20 as seen in figs 3 5 with the increase of function calls most of the optimization algorithms tend to have the similar ranges for rmse and nsc in table 6 we show the number of lakes for which particular algorithm achieved the best result we understand the best result for particular lake as follows first we compute the mean performance from 30 runs for each algorithm then we find the method with the lowest mse for the validation period all the algorithms that achieve the mse equaling to the best one for the validation period with precision up to 0 005 are considered to achieve the best result we assume that differences lower than 0 005 are meaningless from any practical point of view with the number of function calls increasing from 5000 to 20 000 the number of lakes for which best results are achieved increase sharply for many algorithms fig 4 for example cobide was unable to achieve the best results with 5000 calls but did so for 19 out of 22 lakes when the number of function calls is extended to 20 000 increasing the number of function calls from 20 000 to 100 000 does not improve the performance of majority of algorithms fig 5 however there are notable exceptions like edev epso and imode for example the number of lakes for which the best results are achieved increase from 4 to 19 for the edev when the number of function calls increases from 20 000 to 100 000 this clearly indicates that some algorithms may reach the performance of the best methods but require more time to do so as seen for all the three cases of function calls the number of times with the best result for pso is 0 and the pso method used in the original air2water model performs relatively poor compared with most of the recent algorithms listed in table 1 most of the algorithms can produce the best results for more than 50 of the studied lakes with 100 000 function calls two lakes for which the calibration process is the most difficult for majority of algorithms are dadaj and wdzydze as is shown in tables 4 and 5 4 discussions the general poor performance of the pso method in this study is not surprising as this is simply an outdated approach and its performance is greatly depended on the values of its control parameters clerc and kennedy 2002 bonyadi and michalewicz 2017b cleghorn and engelbrecht 2018 piotrowski et al 2020 a more recent pso variant the depso method zhang et al 2019 also doesn t work well as is shown in table 5 the number of times with the best result for depso is 0 for all the three maximum numbers of function calls the another pso variant called epso works well with larger function calls it reaches the best results for 17 lakes with 100 000 function calls though its performance is relatively poor with smaller function calls 5000 and 20 000 as the two best methods from ieee 2020 competition on single objective bound constrained numerical optimization that was held on 5 20 dimensional problems the agsk and imode methods perform generally well when the allowed number of function calls is high however for some lakes e g dadaj wdzydze they are outperformed by other advanced de based algorithms such as lshade spacma and hard de when the number of function calls is lower the performance of both imode and agsk deteriorates what is not surprising considering that both of them were tested by their authors on problems when the number of allowed function calls was set very high hs es and lshade spacma were ranked among the very best performing methods during some recent ieee competitions on numerical optimizations that were held on larger number of higher dimensional problems however the hs es method due to its methodological features are tested only on the largest number of function calls obtains the worst performance among all the algorithms for all the lakes which may be induced by the configuration of its various control parameters on the contrary the performance of the lshade spacma is among the very best among the tested algorithms and it can obtain good modeling results for different lakes and for all the considered maximum numbers of function calls among all the algorithms implemented in this study it is outperformed only by hard de as seen in the tables 4 6 and s1 s20 the various de methods cijade di de edev hard de lshade spacma and cobide perform pretty well with larger numbers of allowed function calls 20 000 and 100 000 among all the algorithms the hard de performs the best and the other de methods are ranked at four consecutive places iwo bbo outperforms the pso algorithms but is not competitive against the de methods piotrowski and naporkowski 2018 found that the cobide method works well for the air2stream model for the forecasting of stream temperature the modeling results in this study also indicate that the cobide method works well for the air2water model for the forecasting of water temperature in lakes as seen in table 5 when sufficiently high number of function calls is allowed the cobide method works pretty well 19 times with the best result for the 22 lakes however this algorithm is outperformed by at least two more recent approaches hard de and lshade spacma two best methods lshade spacma and hard de have different control parameter adaptation mechanisms which are however based on the similar concepts both methods follow different but classical bounds handling e g rebounding helwig et al 2013 in case of the version of hard de used in this study and jade based approach zhang and sanderson 2009 in case of lshade spacma both algorithms also perform population size reduction but in different ways lshade spacma uses classical tanabe and fukunaga 2014 linear reduction but hard de uses its own version of nonlinear convex reduction meng and pan 2019 in which population decreases slowly at the initial part of the search and more rapidly at the later stages what enhances exploration although classical bounds handling is used by the majority of algorithms tested in this study advanced adaptation mechanisms or population reduction strategies are not which may clarify the superior performance of the hard de and lshade spacma summarizing the overall performance for the algorithms with three allowed numbers of function calls it is found that the hard de method performs the best irrespective which lake and number of function calls is considered see fig 6 for the comparison of the simulated and observed values for four lakes as an example as a result we highly recommend using hard de as the calibration method for the air2water model in the future studies from the point of view of lake management provision of the most credible models of water temperature fluctuations is one of the key aspects for further legal and technical decisions and the comparison presented in the paper provides more details regarding the current state of knowledge in the scope 5 conclusions in this study 12 advanced optimization algorithms mainly proposed during 2017 2020 period were implemented to the air2water model as the calibration methods long term observed data from 22 lowland polish lakes are used to evaluate the model performance the study results lead to the following conclusions 1 the pso method used in the original air2water model performs relatively poor compared with most of the recent algorithms 2 the majority of recently proposed algorithms reach the similar solutions on many lakes when the highest number of function calls is allowed 3 de based methods perform especially well 4 the performance of algorithms to large extent depends on the number of function calls used and the higher the number of function calls is allowed the smaller difference between performance of algorithms is noted 5 the hard de method is highly recommended as the calibration method for the air2water model in the future studies in this study due to data availability we only tested the optimization algorithms for air2water model calibration on 22 lowland polish lakes which are relatively shallow table 2 more studies are needed to

4629,the air2water model is a widely used tool for the forecasting of lake water temperatures and projection of climate change it has been applied in thousands of lakes worldwide however it employed the particle swarm optimization pso as the calibration method which was proposed more than 20 years ago in this study 12 advanced optimization algorithms proposed during the recent few years were implemented to calibrate and validate the air2water model daily observed water temperature in temperate lakes 22 lowland lakes in poland were used to evaluate the model performance each optimizer was run 30 times with 3 different settings of the maximum number of function calls 5000 20 000 and 100 000 we have found that the pso method used in the original air2water model performs relatively poor compared with most of the recent algorithms and the majority of recently proposed algorithms reach the similar best solutions on many lakes when the highest number of function calls is allowed however only the hard de hierarchical archive based mutation strategy with depth information of differential evolution algorithm is never outperformed by any competitor irrespective which lake and maximum number of function calls is considered as a result we highly recommend using hard de as the calibration method for the air2water model in the future studies keywords water temperature lake air2water calibration algorithm pso hard de 1 introduction water temperature is one of the key abiotic properties of lakes thermal classification of lakes is among the basic characteristics diversifying these elements of the hydrosphere both in the global and regional approaches hutchinson and loffler 1956 water temperature is of great importance for the course of water mixing water quality concentration of gases farmer and carmack 1981 saber et al 2020 water temperature plays an important role in impacting the bio chemical processes and the metabolism of many aquatic species in lakes price and sowers 2004 åberg et al 2010 beaulieu et al 2013 kraemer et al 2017 for example metabolic rates for microbial growth development and survival depend on water temperature price and sowers 2004 water temperature impacts cyanobacterial abundance and nutrient concentrations ho and michalak 2020 therefore it is of great significance to evaluate the temporal variations of water temperature in lake systems prediction of lake surface water temperature lswt has been particularly popular in recent years as lswt is an important indicator of global climate change in the past years three groups of models have been developed and used to forecast lswt the first category is the process based deterministic models based on energy balance which require many model inputs such as lake morphology bathymetry inflow outflow conditions full meteorological parameters stefan et al 1998 the second group is the statistical models without physical meanings heddam et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020a 2020b the third one is the so called hybrid physically statistically based models and a typical example is the air2water model piccolroaz et al 2013 the hybrid air2water model is based on the energy balance equation it is simple and accurate heddam et al 2020 piccolroaz et al 2021 and needs only the air temperature as model input which makes it a robust tool for the forecasting of lake surface temperature until now it has been applied in thousands of lakes over the world piccolroaz et al 2013 2015 2020 2021 piccolroaz and toffolon 2018a 2018b toffolon et al 2014 2020 piccolroaz 2016 czernecki and ptak 2018 prats and danis 2019 guo et al 2020 though the model is easy to use it requires calibration of a number of parameters for the full air2water model eight parameters are needed to be calibrated in this regard the calibration method is of great importance for model applications however to the best of our knowledge there is no study focusing on the calibration algorithm for the model until now how does the calibration method impact the performance of the air2water model for the forecasting of lake surface water temperatures is still unknown in the original air2water model the monte carlo method with 100 000 000 realizations of eight model parameters was used for model calibration piccolroaz et al 2013 but in the subsequent research the authors moved to the variant of the particle swarm optimization pso with inertia weight kennedy and eberhart 1995 for model calibration piccolroaz et al 2018 although it is still popular pso has been proposed more than 20 years ago and a huge number of its improved variants have been introduced during the latest two decades bonyadi and michalewicz 2017a moreover pso algorithm was shown to be efficient when the problem is very simple or the number of allowed function calls is very low which is often the case when time is of higher importance than the quality of solution piotrowski et al 2017 price et al 2019 we already know that for the similar problem of calibration of the air2stream model that relates the stream water temperature with the air temperature and discharge the basic pso algorithm is not efficient piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 in the last two decades a large number of other optimization algorithms have been proposed and applied in various scientific fields e g das et al 2016 bonyadi and michalewicz 2017a price et al 2019 fausto et al 2020 in this study we have chosen several recently proposed algorithms that have already confirmed their efficiency on various problems including a number of winners of the recent ieee competitions in numerical optimization for the air2water model calibration the list of the chosen algorithms is given in table 1 long term observed data from 22 lakes in poland were used for the evaluation the results in the present study may benefit the community with a robust tool for lake water temperature modeling the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 described the studied lakes and data structure of the air2water model reasons for choosing the optimization algorithms listed in table 1 setup of the calibration methods as well as the model performance metrics section 3 presented the modeling results section 4 discussed the modeling results the major findings and limitations were summarized in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied lakes and data in this study long term observed daily water temperatures from 22 lakes and daily air temperatures from the nearby 9 meteorological stations in poland central europe were used fig 1 the morphologies of these lakes are summarized in table 2 as is shown the studied lakes have diverse morphologies which will benefit the model testing for each calibration algorithm for almost all the lakes 30 years of the observed data are available 1987 2016 among which 20 years of data 1987 2006 are used for model calibration and the remaining data with 10 years 2007 2016 are used for model validation there are two exceptions in the case of the bachotek lake the data from december 2016 are unavailable and in the case of the slawskie lake the data ends in december 2014 for these two cases the calibration periods are kept the same as that for the remaining lakes but the validation ones are shorter water temperature was measured at 7 00 or 8 00 am at the local time at a water depth 0 4 m below the water surface or ice cover when present one time a day by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute in poland water temperature was measured at the shore using well scoop thermometers the time series data for each lake is consecutive ensuring modeling and climate change studies e g heddam et al 2020 piccolroaz et al 2021 time series data of daily water temperature and air temperature of eight lakes are presented in fig 2 as an example to limit the impact of initial condition on the results the first 30 days of each data set are considered as a warm up period and are not used to evaluate the modelling performance 2 2 the air2water model the air2water model is a simple and accurate model for lswt modeling heddam et al 2020 piccolroaz et al 2020 2021 zhu et al 2020b it is based on the volume integrated heat balance equation and by linearizing the heat flux terms through taylor expansion a simplified equation takes the form 1 d t w dt 1 δ a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w a 5 cos 2 π t t y a 6 2 δ exp t w t h a 4 if t w t h δ exp t h t w a 7 exp t w a 8 if t w t h where t is time tw is lswt ta is air temperature δ is a dimensionless parameter representing the ratio between the volume of the surface lake layer and a reference volume ty is the duration of the year in days which reflects the assumption that the sum of the external forcing on lake surface volume can be depicted with a sinusoidal term characterized by a primary annual period toffolon et al 2014 th is a reference value for the deep lake water temperature 4 c for dimictic lakes and the minimum or maximum water temperature for the other lakes a1 a8 are the eight model parameters and they are determined by the calibration method during model calibration the ranges of these parameters are based on toffolon et al 2014 and are given in table 3 2 3 calibration algorithms in the original air2water model the pso algorithm

performs the best 22 times with the best result lshade spacma method is able to reach the same results as hard de for 11 lakes which is also shown in fig 3 with the increase of function calls most of the optimization algorithms tend to perform better which is clearly shown in tables 4 6 and s1 s20 as seen in figs 3 5 with the increase of function calls most of the optimization algorithms tend to have the similar ranges for rmse and nsc in table 6 we show the number of lakes for which particular algorithm achieved the best result we understand the best result for particular lake as follows first we compute the mean performance from 30 runs for each algorithm then we find the method with the lowest mse for the validation period all the algorithms that achieve the mse equaling to the best one for the validation period with precision up to 0 005 are considered to achieve the best result we assume that differences lower than 0 005 are meaningless from any practical point of view with the number of function calls increasing from 5000 to 20 000 the number of lakes for which best results are achieved increase sharply for many algorithms fig 4 for example cobide was unable to achieve the best results with 5000 calls but did so for 19 out of 22 lakes when the number of function calls is extended to 20 000 increasing the number of function calls from 20 000 to 100 000 does not improve the performance of majority of algorithms fig 5 however there are notable exceptions like edev epso and imode for example the number of lakes for which the best results are achieved increase from 4 to 19 for the edev when the number of function calls increases from 20 000 to 100 000 this clearly indicates that some algorithms may reach the performance of the best methods but require more time to do so as seen for all the three cases of function calls the number of times with the best result for pso is 0 and the pso method used in the original air2water model performs relatively poor compared with most of the recent algorithms listed in table 1 most of the algorithms can produce the best results for more than 50 of the studied lakes with 100 000 function calls two lakes for which the calibration process is the most difficult for majority of algorithms are dadaj and wdzydze as is shown in tables 4 and 5 4 discussions the general poor performance of the pso method in this study is not surprising as this is simply an outdated approach and its performance is greatly depended on the values of its control parameters clerc and kennedy 2002 bonyadi and michalewicz 2017b cleghorn and engelbrecht 2018 piotrowski et al 2020 a more recent pso variant the depso method zhang et al 2019 also doesn t work well as is shown in table 5 the number of times with the best result for depso is 0 for all the three maximum numbers of function calls the another pso variant called epso works well with larger function calls it reaches the best results for 17 lakes with 100 000 function calls though its performance is relatively poor with smaller function calls 5000 and 20 000 as the two best methods from ieee 2020 competition on single objective bound constrained numerical optimization that was held on 5 20 dimensional problems the agsk and imode methods perform generally well when the allowed number of function calls is high however for some lakes e g dadaj wdzydze they are outperformed by other advanced de based algorithms such as lshade spacma and hard de when the number of function calls is lower the performance of both imode and agsk deteriorates what is not surprising considering that both of them were tested by their authors on problems when the number of allowed function calls was set very high hs es and lshade spacma were ranked among the very best performing methods during some recent ieee competitions on numerical optimizations that were held on larger number of higher dimensional problems however the hs es method due to its methodological features are tested only on the largest number of function calls obtains the worst performance among all the algorithms for all the lakes which may be induced by the configuration of its various control parameters on the contrary the performance of the lshade spacma is among the very best among the tested algorithms and it can obtain good modeling results for different lakes and for all the considered maximum numbers of function calls among all the algorithms implemented in this study it is outperformed only by hard de as seen in the tables 4 6 and s1 s20 the various de methods cijade di de edev hard de lshade spacma and cobide perform pretty well with larger numbers of allowed function calls 20 000 and 100 000 among all the algorithms the hard de performs the best and the other de methods are ranked at four consecutive places iwo bbo outperforms the pso algorithms but is not competitive against the de methods piotrowski and naporkowski 2018 found that the cobide method works well for the air2stream model for the forecasting of stream temperature the modeling results in this study also indicate that the cobide method works well for the air2water model for the forecasting of water temperature in lakes as seen in table 5 when sufficiently high number of function calls is allowed the cobide method works pretty well 19 times with the best result for the 22 lakes however this algorithm is outperformed by at least two more recent approaches hard de and lshade spacma two best methods lshade spacma and hard de have different control parameter adaptation mechanisms which are however based on the similar concepts both methods follow different but classical bounds handling e g rebounding helwig et al 2013 in case of the version of hard de used in this study and jade based approach zhang and sanderson 2009 in case of lshade spacma both algorithms also perform population size reduction but in different ways lshade spacma uses classical tanabe and fukunaga 2014 linear reduction but hard de uses its own version of nonlinear convex reduction meng and pan 2019 in which population decreases slowly at the initial part of the search and more rapidly at the later stages what enhances exploration although classical bounds handling is used by the majority of algorithms tested in this study advanced adaptation mechanisms or population reduction strategies are not which may clarify the superior performance of the hard de and lshade spacma summarizing the overall performance for the algorithms with three allowed numbers of function calls it is found that the hard de method performs the best irrespective which lake and number of function calls is considered see fig 6 for the comparison of the simulated and observed values for four lakes as an example as a result we highly recommend using hard de as the calibration method for the air2water model in the future studies from the point of view of lake management provision of the most credible models of water temperature fluctuations is one of the key aspects for further legal and technical decisions and the comparison presented in the paper provides more details regarding the current state of knowledge in the scope 5 conclusions in this study 12 advanced optimization algorithms mainly proposed during 2017 2020 period were implemented to the air2water model as the calibration methods long term observed data from 22 lowland polish lakes are used to evaluate the model performance the study results lead to the following conclusions 1 the pso method used in the original air2water model performs relatively poor compared with most of the recent algorithms 2 the majority of recently proposed algorithms reach the similar solutions on many lakes when the highest number of function calls is allowed 3 de based methods perform especially well 4 the performance of algorithms to large extent depends on the number of function calls used and the higher the number of function calls is allowed the smaller difference between performance of algorithms is noted 5 the hard de method is highly recommended as the calibration method for the air2water model in the future studies in this study due to data availability we only tested the optimization algorithms for air2water model calibration on 22 lowland polish lakes which are relatively shallow table 2 more studies are needed to confirm our results for deeper or greater lakes in other regions of the world credit authorship contribution statement senlin zhu conceptualization methodology software adam p piotrowski methodology
