22045,compliant vertical access risers cvar offer significant economic benefits and prospects for development because of their special configuration in this paper the dynamic performance of cvar is studied by model experiments and numerical simulations based on virtual work and variational principles a vibration equation considering the large deformation mechanical behaviors of cvar with the influences of bending stiffness and non uniform internal flow is proposed to verify it model experiments on the cvar are firstly conducted and compared the results with those of a numerical simulation time domain analyses of key nodes regular wave analysis and dynamic response at different positions of the buoyancy module were then carried out the vibration near the platform was the largest due to the wave load and decreased rapidly when in the transitional region the minimum tension of the transition zone was even subzero at the far end which means the cvar is unstable when the platform subject to regular wave conditions when the buoyancy block was above 1000 m tension at the bottom was smaller than 672 kn which will cause the lower region to become catenary shaped and the cvar to lose its unique operational advantage keywords compliant vertical access riser vibration equation model experiments dynamic performance 1 introduction in the past century to meet the requirements of offshore oil exploration and development a number of risers have been developed that are suitable for different marine environments as this exploration moves into deeper water new forms of risers are being developed four types of risers are mainly used in deepwater platforms top tension risers ttrs steel catenary risers scrs flexible risers frs and hybrid risers hrs ttrs have been popular in recent decades because of their high strength and good weldability but also have the disadvantages of poor compliance and corrosion resistance william toh et al 2018 the lower part of the scr is in direct contact with subsea soil frequent interactions make it prone to fatigue fracture research has shown that weak points of the scr are generally located at the top hanging and bottom touchdown zones lucile m queau et al 2015 rasoul hejazi et al 2016 hodjat shiri 2014 slwrs steel lazy wave risers derive from the scr and have a longer hanging part and larger buoyancy module that increases its outer diameter according to morrison s equation this causes the slwr to be subjected to a greater fluid force and the maximum offset can usually reach more than 10 m wang and duan 2015 to solve these problems it is usually necessary to install top bending stiffeners and subsea foundations owing to the special nature of the material fr is unsuitable in high temperature and high pressure fields for flexible risers with a large diameter the cost of production is high so that the space for its development is minimal furthermore the connection joints of hrs are complex and failure due to fatigue from towing and installation is common ruilong tan et al 2018 a cvar is a compliant rigid riser with a differentiated geometric configuration that allows for the exploitation of oil and gas in deepwater fields and provides several operational advantages for offshore systems fig 1 compared with the scr the upper and lower parts of the cvar are nearly vertical therefore the fatigue lives of the top and bottom zones are longer compared with the slwr the cvar offers greater economic benefits because the design of its weighted part does not require the top bending stiffener and tension system another major feature of cvar systems is that they allow for direct intervention procedures in the well bore thus enabling workover operations to be performed directly from the production platform this feature eliminates the need for hiring specific units for this purpose and makes this new riser economically attractive thus cvar systems have the potential to reduce the costs of completion and well intervention chris et al 2004 the two ends of the cvar connect the wells and the platform with a stress joint or flexible joint a horizontal distance is maintained between the wellhead and the platform to provide compliance for the cvar this compensates for the motion of the floating platform and allows it to operate in deeper sea the cvar is divided into three regions an upper region a transition region and a lower region in general a buoyancy module with a large diameter is arranged at the top of the lower region to maintain rigidity the lower region is similar to the ttr the middle region is evenly arranged with a relatively low buoyancy module and is called the transition region the upper region is similar to the scr and has an additional weight this special configuration of the cvar determines its unique mechanical properties compared with work on the ttr scr and fr little research has been devoted to the cvar mungall and haverty proposed the concept of a semi submersible platform combined with the cvar in the gulf of mexico they applied this setup below 8000 feet and extreme response analysis and fatigue analysis of the cvar proved its feasibility mungall c et al 2004 kuroiwa and nishigaki et al proposed the design concept of the fpso called the cvar fpso to study the interaction between the cvar and tubing martins optimized this design using the nsga ii the elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm method and doe design of experiments method and analyzed and compared several key parameters of the cvar he then designed the optimal solution of its dynamic response michele et al 2012 martins et al 2013 zhen and yang et al used the doe design of experiments method to establish an approximate model and performed a simple weight optimization for the cvar zhen w q et al 2010 a structural analysis of cvar can be conducted by software such as orcaflex riflex offpipe cable3d etc though the above commercial software can lead to refined enough results they are also relatively time consuming due to the cumbersome graphical user interface in the meantime thus that software are usually adopted in the final stages of the design pavel a trapper 2020 consequently engineers tend to use convenient methods to conduct numerous simulations at least for the intermediate stages of the design to analyze the initial riser configuration lenci and callegari 2005 nevertheless it is required that these models need to be sufficiently accurate on an efficient basis many scholars has have done extensive studies on simplified models of risers ruan et al 2014 wang et al 2015 li et al 2010 these work often consider the riser as several segments i e upper segment buoyancy segment lower segment which use continuity conditions at the segment boundaries to connect each segment as a whole segment and each segment are usually modeled to be a simple catenary without considering the effect of bending stiffness and non uniform internal flow at present research on cvar is in the stage of conceptual design whilst no reported literature has been devoted to simplified model of cvar to solve this problem in a more relatively accurate way it is necessary to derive the vibration equations thus we propose a vibration equation of cvar based on virtual work and variational principles the model we develop takes large deformation mechanical behaviors of cvar with the influences of bending stiffness and non uniform internal flow into account and will make it possible to consider the whole riser as a single continuous segment moreover most experiments on marine risers have focused on vortex induced vibrations and the stability of other types of risers and no model experiment on the dynamic performance of the cvar has been reported to explore the dynamic performance of cvars using model experiments and numerical simulations we firstly conducted model experiments on the cvar and compared the results with those of a numerical simulation time domain analyses of key nodes regular wave analysis and dynamic response at different positions of the buoyancy module were also carried out 2 vibration equation of cvar owing to its large slenderness ratio ratio of diameter to length the deepwater cvar can resist the movement and hydrodynamic load of the floating platform and thus geometric nonlinearity is a prominent feature in addition when the cvar operates in its service period the internal fluid runs at a high temperature and pressure studies have shown that the internal fluid affects the nonlinear mechanical characteristics of the structure and is thus an important factor in this section the vibration model of the cvar is considered in light of its geometric nonlinear characteristics including the internal fluid at high temperature and pressure to consider geometric nonlinearity the equation of static equilibrium of the cvar needs to be established at the corresponding position because of which it is necessary to use a special coordinate system there are two methods available the global lagrange method and the updated lagrange method the vibration equation used in this paper is based on the updated lagrange method the elemental local coordinate system is not fixed but changes with the displacement of the structure 2 1 vibration equation the virtual work principle involves only the active force and thus simplifies the establishment of the vibration equation of the cvar with ideal constraints the variational principle can directly deal with the entire elastic system by considering its energy relation and the problem of elasticity is reduced to the variational problem of finding the functional extremum under a given constraint this model is based on the virtual work principle and variational principle chucheepsakul et al 2003 to consider its generality an independent variable Î± fig 2 is introduced to the derivation process the strain energy is mainly produced by axial deformation and bending deformation athisakul and chucheepsakul 2008 bernitsas 1982 the main virtual work of the external loads consists of effective gravity buoyancy wave current and vortex induced lift bernitsas m m 1985 chucheepsakul s et al 2002 2 1 1 motion and deformation relative to its outside diameter the length of the riser is longer and the cvar thus has a large slenderness ratio therefore the riser is usually considered a three dimensional 3d rod element rather than a cylindrical shell element meng and chen 2012 the centerline of the riser can be described by a 3d orthogonal coordinate system fig 2 the entire coordinate system uses the cartesian coordinate system x y z and the corresponding unit base vectors are i j k the local coordinates are in the orthogonal coordinate

independent variables to solve the problem more efficiently the variable s is suitable for any type of riser but it is necessary to know the riser s length considering the special geometry of the cvar we choose s as independent variable to consider geometric nonlinearity the static equilibrium equation of the cvar must be established at the corresponding position and the 3d euler equation 47 and

main purpose of the experiment was to conduct a preliminary exploration of the unique configuration of cvar verify the numerical model proposed above and summarize the response analysis of the cvar under various working conditions 3 1 design of experimental model 3 1 1 riser model the purpose of the experiment was to study the mechanical properties of the unique configuration of the cvar therefore the primary condition for the riser model was for it to naturally exhibit the proper configuration in a water tank and move with the water under different conditions however the high strength steel used in practice cannot be used to form a flexible tubular shape at a small scale because of which selecting appropriate materials is a major difficulty the pipe requires a certain rigidity in the local part and flexibility overall by screening 20 materials pvc polyvinyl chloride was finally used as riser material the buoyancy block was made of expandable polyethylene epe pearl cotton it was non absorbent and had a very low density of only 0 022 g cm 3 that can be neglected in weight related experiments it is the ideal experimental material of buoyancy module fig 4 a and the weighted section is made of mirrored thick walled seamless steel pipe which is placed on the outer wall of the riser model to provide gravity fig 4b to use local similarity in the overall design while maintaining similarity between the flow systems under the action of gravity the ratio of the inertial force of the fluid to gravity must remain unchanged which is froude s law of similarity morooka and tsukada 2013 and the detailed parameters of model are as shown in table 1 3 1 2 experimental equipment model experiments were carried out in a wave and current flume the flume can produce well controlled steady regular and irregular waves with constant velocity and wave height of 0 02m 0 2m according to different requirements and give a complete view of the model the model support fig 5 a is designed by using the aluminum alloy it is fixed on the inner wall of the flume and a slot is installed in the middle of its bottom to make sure that the riser can be replaced quickly without water drainage therefore the support can not only fix the riser model conveniently but also improve the experimental efficiency the measurements show that the natural frequencies of the support and the riser model are far from each other and the fluid action will not lead to the resonance besides flexible joint fig 5b is adopted at both ends of the riser model to ensure its movement in any direction moreover the 3d pdt precision displacement meter is a non contact 3d video displacement sensor fig 5c used to measure spatial position object displacement and strain this experiment used it to measure the displacement of the riser model 3 2 experimental results 3 2 1 verification of results a typical case was used in the experiment involving a regular wave height 0 04 m period 2 s the bare tube and the cvar model are shown in fig 6 we compared the experimental results with the results of the numerical simulation as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the results of the numerical simulation in terms of vibrational frequency were in good agreement with the experimental results while for the vibrational amplitude there was a slight difference between the two sets of results because the numerical simulation represented an ideal state thus the vibrational amplitude was very stable in it however in the model experiment the measured amplitude fluctuated due to the influence of wave reflection cross flow and noise by comparing displacements at three key points it was evident the displacements of the transition region and the weighted section were large and decreased rapidly in the large buoyancy module the numerical and experimental results showed the same trend this model was thus verified 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis of position of buoyancy module in this section we describe the use of the model experiment to analyze the influence of the position of the buoyancy module on dynamic performance the length of the lower region bare was set to 15 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm and the other parameters are as shown in table 2 the time history curve of the maximum displacement was measured fig 8 shows that as the position of the buoyancy module moved upward the displacement of the model increased in all directions the upward displacement of the buoyancy module also led to an increase in the dynamic response of the riser and rendered it more unstable because the upward movement of the buoyancy blocks meant that the transition zone moved upward and the influence of waves increased accordingly at the same time the upward movement of large buoyancy blocks caused the lower riser to become too long to provide sufficient tension and the stiffness of the lower riser section decreases which made it easier for vibrations to occur in practice thus the buoyancy module should be placed as low in the riser as possible but at the same time the length of the lower region should have a certain feasible value 4 dynamic analysis of cvar dynamic analysis is a key step in the design of a marine riser based on the formula described in section 2 we created a finite element program in matlab to discuss the dynamic performance of the cvar aamo and fossen 2000 in this part of the analysis we defined the farthest drift from the wellhead to be the far end i e far x l 730 m the intermediate position was set as the equilibrium position i e cross x l 610 m and the near end was defined as the position where the offset was close to the wellhead i e near x l 490 m thus assuming that the offset of the floating body was 120 m in extreme marine conditions we used a water depth of 2400 m as an example and performed a static mechanical cvar analysis at three locations our design parameters are listed in table 3 4 1 time domain analysis of key nodes for further analysis we used four key nodes node 1 node 4 as shown in fig 9 at 0 m platform 1710 m top of small buoyancy modules 1910 m bottom end of small buoyancy modules and 2200 m bottom end of large buoyancy modules the time history curves of each key node are shown below fig 10 shows that the vibration near the platform was the largest due to the wave load and decreased rapidly when in the transitional region the amplitude of vibration of the lower region decreased to 1 10 due to its buffering effect the maximum vertical and horizontal displacements were reduced to less than 1 m which ensured the verticality of the lower region fig 10g shows that stress in the transition zone of the riser was generally high and the corresponding bending moment was large fig 10h indicating the stress was mainly caused by the bending moment of the riser 4 2 regular wave analysis cvars are designed for using in ultra deep water under complex conditions therefore dynamic response analysis under environmental loads is important regular wave analysis with variation of period over a certain range is used for the extreme response studies maximum wave height and associated maximum wave period are used for different load cases and the wave period is varied by 1 5 seconds on either side of t max to estimate variations in load the data for regular wave analysis were based on oceanic conditions in the gulf of mexico and the specific parameters of platform motions are identified in table 4 4 2 1 regular wave analysis under hurricane conditions fig 11 shows that regardless of the position of the far mid or near end the vertical displacement of the riser was the same the vertical displacement of the upper region reached 7 1 m and that of the lower region was limited to 0 1 m or smaller because the transition region effectively buffered the vertical displacement of the upper portion this ensured the stability of the lower region fig 12 shows that while that the top displacement was significantly affected by the platform the transition region had the largest horizontal displacement in the transition and lower regions because the transition region had a smaller stiffness and was relatively flexible which rendered it more susceptible to disturbance at the near end the horizontal displacement decreased but the range was very small however horizontal displacement at the far end increased prominently in the transition and lower regions the maximum displacement even exceeded the top displacement with a value of 10 2 m and the maximum horizontal displacement of the lower region reached 3 17 m at 2295 m fig 13 shows that the trend of change in the maximum mises stress was the same when the platform was at the far mid and near end both ends were low stress areas and high stress was concentrated in the transition region the maximum mises stress was controlled to be below 200 mpa and the maximum stress was 422 4 mpa in the transition zone 1740 m in the riser for the upper and lower regions the stress increased to a greater extent when the riser was located at the far end whereas for the transition area of the riser the maximum stress increased by about 50 mpa when the riser was located at the far and near ends therefore the middle position was the safest and the offset of the upper platform should be minimized as shown in fig 14 the weighting module and large buoyancy module provided sufficient tension for the upper and lower sections of the riser the minimum tension of the transition zone was even subzero at the far end which is not empirically possible therefore the cvar was unstable when the platform was at the far end under hurricane conditions changes in the stress of the transition region should thus be considered to avoid negative values 4 2 2 regular wave analysis under current conditions fig 15 shows that compared with the hurricane conditions the response of cvar under current conditions is less and displacement was controlled below 0 1 m because the current as the main load was a static load the impact on the cvar was mostly reflected in the static configuration and the response in the time history was minor fig 16 shows that compared with the hurricane conditions the maximum mises stress of the upper and the lower regions were nearly identical and the difference was mainly concentrated in the transition area the three cases differed by nearly 100 mpa because the current had a significant influence on the configuration of the riser especially in the relatively flexible transition region the maximum mises stress was 313 9 mpa 1600 m and 314 9 mpa 1750 m when the platform was at the near end fig 17 shows that tension in the riser was not considerably different when the platform was at the far mid and near end the riser also did not have a negative tension point which was safer in the three cases of current conditions and the three conditions were clearly sufficient to provide at least 672 kn of tension for the bottom end stress joint 4 3 dynamic response analysis with different positions of buoyancy module the parameters for dynamic response analysis with different positions of buoyancy module are given in table 5 fig 18 a shows that as the buoyancy module moved upward the maximum vertical displacement of the lower region increased which corresponded to the results of the above model experiment fig 18b shows that when the large buoyancy block was at 1200 m a high stress point appeared at the bottom of the riser this point also had a high bend moment point because the lower region was too long it was catenary shaped and thus lost its unique operational advantage it is clear from fig 18d that as the large buoyancy module moved upward the length of the lower region increased and tension at the wellhead decreased when the buoyancy block was above than 1000 m the bottom tension was smaller than 672 kn which did not satisfy the needs of the bottom joint to further corroborate this the riser profile is shown in fig 18 with the buoyancy module located at different positions fig 19 shows that when the buoyancy module was too high the upper portion was too curved to provide a certain vertical length for operation at this time the lower portion was too long to close to the catenary shape and the advantage of cvar could not be exploited with this type therefore the buoyancy module should be placed as close to the bottom as possible 5 conclusion to explore the dynamic performance of cvars using model experiments and numerical simulations based on virtual work and variational principles the vibration equation of the cvar was established and validated by model experiments in this study time domain analyses of key nodes regular wave analysis and dynamic response at different positions of the buoyancy module were conducted as well the results showed the following the vibration near the platform was the largest due to the wave load and decreased rapidly when in the transitional region the amplitude of vibration of the lower region decreased to 1 10 due to its buffering effect the maximum vertical and horizontal displacements were reduced to less than 1 m which ensured the verticality of the lower region regardless of the position of the platform the vertical displacement of the riser was constant under hurricane conditions the vertical displacement of the upper region reached 7 1 m and that of the lower region was limited to 0 1 m or smaller the largest horizontal displacement was significantly affected by the platform and horizontal displacement at the far end increased prominently both ends were low stress areas and high stress was concentrated in the transition region the maximum mises stress was controlled to below 200 mpa and the maximum stress was 422 4 mpa in the transition zone the minimum tension in the transition zone was even subzero at the far end which is not empirically possible therefore the cvar was unstable when the platform was at the far end under extreme wave conditions the response of cvar subjected to current conditions is less than that of hurricane conditions and displacement was controlled to below 0 1 m the maximum mises stresses of the upper and the lower regions were nearly identical and the difference was mainly concentrated in the transition area when the platform was at the far mid and near ends the three cases differed by nearly 100 mpa the position of a higher buoyancy block not only increased the dynamic response of the riser but also led to an increase in the bending moment at the bottom as the large buoyancy module moved upward the length of the lower region increased and tension at the wellhead decreased when the buoyancy block was above 1000 m the bottom tension was smaller than 672 kn which did not satisfy the requirements of the bottom joint and caused the lower region to become catenary shaped and thus losing its unique operational advantage author contributions section min lou contributed significantly

22045,compliant vertical access risers cvar offer significant economic benefits and prospects for development because of their special configuration in this paper the dynamic performance of cvar is studied by model experiments and numerical simulations based on virtual work and variational principles a vibration equation considering the large deformation mechanical behaviors of cvar with the influences of bending stiffness and non uniform internal flow is proposed to verify it model experiments on the cvar are firstly conducted and compared the results with those of a numerical simulation time domain analyses of key nodes regular wave analysis and dynamic response at different positions of the buoyancy module were then carried out the vibration near the platform was the largest due to the wave load and decreased rapidly when in the transitional region the minimum tension of the transition zone was even subzero at the far end which means the cvar is unstable when the platform subject to regular wave conditions when the buoyancy block was above 1000 m tension at the bottom was smaller than 672 kn which will cause the lower region to become catenary shaped and the cvar to lose its unique operational advantage keywords compliant vertical access riser vibration equation model experiments dynamic performance 1 introduction in the past century to meet the requirements of offshore oil exploration and development a number of risers have been developed that are suitable for different marine environments as this exploration moves into deeper water new forms of risers are being developed four types of risers are mainly used in deepwater platforms top tension risers ttrs steel catenary risers scrs flexible risers frs and hybrid risers hrs ttrs have been popular in recent decades because of their high strength and good weldability but also have the disadvantages of poor compliance and corrosion resistance william toh et al 2018 the lower part of the scr is in direct contact with subsea soil frequent interactions make it prone to fatigue fracture research has shown that weak points of the scr are generally located at the top hanging and bottom touchdown zones lucile m queau et al 2015 rasoul hejazi et al 2016 hodjat shiri 2014 slwrs steel lazy wave risers derive from the scr and have a longer hanging part and larger buoyancy module that increases its outer diameter according to morrison s equation this causes the slwr to be subjected to a greater fluid force and the maximum offset can usually reach more than 10 m wang and duan 2015 to solve these problems it is usually necessary to install top bending stiffeners and subsea foundations owing to the special nature of the material fr is unsuitable in high temperature and high pressure fields for flexible risers with a large diameter the cost of production is high so that the space for its development is minimal furthermore the connection joints of hrs are complex and failure due to fatigue from towing and installation is common ruilong tan et al 2018 a cvar is a compliant rigid riser with a differentiated geometric configuration that allows for the exploitation of oil and gas in deepwater fields and provides several operational advantages for offshore systems fig 1 compared with the scr the upper and lower parts of the cvar are nearly vertical therefore the fatigue lives of the top and bottom zones are longer compared with the slwr the cvar offers greater economic benefits because the design of its weighted part does not require the top bending stiffener and tension system another major feature of cvar systems is that they allow for direct intervention procedures in the well bore thus enabling workover operations to be performed directly from the production platform this feature eliminates the need for hiring specific units for this purpose and makes this new riser economically attractive thus cvar systems have the potential to reduce the costs of completion and well intervention chris et al 2004 the two ends of the cvar connect the wells and the platform with a stress joint or flexible joint a horizontal distance is maintained between the wellhead and the platform to provide compliance for the cvar this compensates for the motion of the floating platform and allows it to operate in deeper sea the cvar is divided into three regions an upper region a transition region and a lower region in general a buoyancy module with a large diameter is arranged at the top of the lower region to maintain rigidity the lower region is similar to the ttr the middle region is evenly arranged with a relatively low buoyancy module and is called the transition region the upper region is similar to the scr and has an additional weight this special configuration of the cvar determines its unique mechanical properties compared with work on the ttr scr and fr little research has been devoted to the cvar mungall and haverty proposed the concept of a semi submersible platform combined with the cvar in the gulf of mexico they applied this setup below 8000 feet and extreme response analysis and fatigue analysis of the cvar proved its feasibility mungall c et al 2004 kuroiwa and nishigaki et al proposed the design concept of the fpso called the cvar fpso to study the interaction between the cvar and tubing martins optimized this design using the nsga ii the elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm method and doe design of experiments method and analyzed and compared several key parameters of the cvar he then designed the optimal solution of its dynamic response michele et al 2012 martins et al 2013 zhen and yang et al used the doe design of experiments method to establish an approximate model and performed a simple weight optimization for the cvar zhen w q et al 2010 a structural analysis of cvar can be conducted by software such as orcaflex riflex offpipe cable3d etc though the above commercial software can lead to refined enough results they are also relatively time consuming due to the cumbersome graphical user interface in the meantime thus that software are usually adopted in the final stages of the design pavel a trapper 2020 consequently engineers tend to use convenient methods to conduct numerous simulations at least for the intermediate stages of the design to analyze the initial riser configuration lenci and callegari 2005 nevertheless it is required that these models need to be sufficiently accurate on an efficient basis many scholars has have done extensive studies on simplified models of risers ruan et al 2014 wang et al 2015 li et al 2010 these work often consider the riser as several segments i e upper segment buoyancy segment lower segment which use continuity conditions at the segment boundaries to connect each segment as a whole segment and each segment are usually modeled to be a simple catenary without considering the effect of bending stiffness and non uniform internal flow at present research on cvar is in the stage of conceptual design whilst no reported literature has been devoted to simplified model of cvar to solve this problem in a more relatively accurate way it is necessary to derive the vibration equations thus we propose a vibration equation of cvar based on virtual work and variational principles the model we develop takes large deformation mechanical behaviors of cvar with the influences of bending stiffness and non uniform internal flow into account and will make it possible to consider the whole riser as a single continuous segment moreover most experiments on marine risers have focused on vortex induced vibrations and the stability of other types of risers and no model experiment on the dynamic performance of the cvar has been reported to explore the dynamic performance of cvars using model experiments and numerical simulations we firstly conducted model experiments on the cvar and compared the results with those of a numerical simulation time domain analyses of key nodes regular wave analysis and dynamic response at different positions of the buoyancy module were also carried out 2 vibration equation of cvar owing to its large slenderness ratio ratio of diameter to length the deepwater cvar can resist the movement and hydrodynamic load of the floating platform and thus geometric nonlinearity is a prominent feature in addition when the cvar operates in its service period the internal fluid runs at a high temperature and pressure studies have shown that the internal fluid affects the nonlinear mechanical characteristics of the structure and is thus an important factor in this section the vibration model of the cvar is considered in light of its geometric nonlinear characteristics including the internal fluid at high temperature and pressure to consider geometric nonlinearity the equation of static equilibrium of the cvar needs to be established at the corresponding position because of which it is necessary to use a special coordinate system there are two methods available the global lagrange method and the updated lagrange method the vibration equation used in this paper is based on the updated lagrange method the elemental local coordinate system is not fixed but changes with the displacement of the structure 2 1 vibration equation the virtual work principle involves only the active force and thus simplifies the establishment of the vibration equation of the cvar with ideal constraints the variational principle can directly deal with the entire elastic system by considering its energy relation and the problem of elasticity is reduced to the variational problem of finding the functional extremum under a given constraint this model is based on the virtual work principle and variational principle chucheepsakul et al 2003 to consider its generality an independent variable Î± fig 2 is introduced to the derivation process the strain energy is mainly produced by axial deformation and bending deformation athisakul and chucheepsakul 2008 bernitsas 1982 the main virtual work of the external loads consists of effective gravity buoyancy wave current and vortex induced lift bernitsas m m 1985 chucheepsakul s et al 2002 2 1 1 motion and deformation relative to its outside diameter the length of the riser is longer and the cvar thus has a large slenderness ratio therefore the riser is usually considered a three dimensional 3d rod element rather than a cylindrical shell element meng and chen 2012 the centerline of the riser can be described by a 3d orthogonal coordinate system fig 2 the entire coordinate system uses the cartesian coordinate system x y z and the corresponding unit base vectors are i j k the local coordinates are in the orthogonal coordinate

main purpose of the experiment was to conduct a preliminary exploration of the unique configuration of cvar verify the numerical model proposed above and summarize the response analysis of the cvar under various working conditions 3 1 design of experimental model 3 1 1 riser model the purpose of the experiment was to study the mechanical properties of the unique configuration of the cvar therefore the primary condition for the riser model was for it to naturally exhibit the proper configuration in a water tank and move with the water under different conditions however the high strength steel used in practice cannot be used to form a flexible tubular shape at a small scale because of which selecting appropriate materials is a major difficulty the pipe requires a certain rigidity in the local part and flexibility overall by screening 20 materials pvc polyvinyl chloride was finally used as riser material the buoyancy block was made of expandable polyethylene epe pearl cotton it was non absorbent and had a very low density of only 0 022 g cm 3 that can be neglected in weight related experiments it is the ideal experimental material of buoyancy module fig 4 a and the weighted section is made of mirrored thick walled seamless steel pipe which is placed on the outer wall of the riser model to provide gravity fig 4b to use local similarity in the overall design while maintaining similarity between the flow systems under the action of gravity the ratio of the inertial force of the fluid to gravity must remain unchanged which is froude s law of similarity morooka and tsukada 2013 and the detailed parameters of model are as shown in table 1 3 1 2 experimental equipment model experiments were carried out in a wave and current flume the flume can produce well controlled steady regular and irregular waves with constant velocity and wave height of 0 02m 0 2m according to different requirements and give a complete view of the model the model support fig 5 a is designed by using the aluminum alloy it is fixed on the inner wall of the flume and a slot is installed in the middle of its bottom to make sure that the riser can be replaced quickly without water drainage therefore the support can not only fix the riser model conveniently but also improve the experimental efficiency the measurements show that the natural frequencies of the support and the riser model are far from each other and the fluid action will not lead to the resonance besides flexible joint fig 5b is adopted at both ends of the riser model to ensure its movement in any direction moreover the 3d pdt precision displacement meter is a non contact 3d video displacement sensor fig 5c used to measure spatial position object displacement and strain this experiment used it to measure the displacement of the riser model 3 2 experimental results 3 2 1 verification of results a typical case was used in the experiment involving a regular wave height 0 04 m period 2 s the bare tube and the cvar model are shown in fig 6 we compared the experimental results with the results of the numerical simulation as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the results of the numerical simulation in terms of vibrational frequency were in good agreement with the experimental results while for the vibrational amplitude there was a slight difference between the two sets of results because the numerical simulation represented an ideal state thus the vibrational amplitude was very stable in it however in the model experiment the measured amplitude fluctuated due to the influence of wave reflection cross flow and noise by comparing displacements at three key points it was evident the displacements of the transition region and the weighted section were large and decreased rapidly in the large buoyancy module the numerical and experimental results showed the same trend this model was thus verified 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis of position of buoyancy module in this section we describe the use of the model experiment to analyze the influence of the position of the buoyancy module on dynamic performance the length of the lower region bare was set to 15 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm and the other parameters are as shown in table 2 the time history curve of the maximum displacement was measured fig 8 shows that as the position of the buoyancy module moved upward the displacement of the model increased in all directions the upward displacement of the buoyancy module also led to an increase in the dynamic response of the riser and rendered it more unstable because the upward movement of the buoyancy blocks meant that the transition zone moved upward and the influence of waves increased accordingly at the same time the upward movement of large buoyancy blocks caused the lower riser to become too long to provide sufficient tension and the stiffness of the lower riser section decreases which made it easier for vibrations to occur in practice thus the buoyancy module should be placed as low in the riser as possible but at the same time the length of the lower region should have a certain feasible value 4 dynamic analysis of cvar dynamic analysis is a key step in the design of a marine riser based on the formula described in section 2 we created a finite element program in matlab to discuss the dynamic performance of the cvar aamo and fossen 2000 in this part of the analysis we defined the farthest drift from the wellhead to be the far end i e far x l 730 m the intermediate position was set as the equilibrium position i e cross x l 610 m and the near end was defined as the position where the offset was close to the wellhead i e near x l 490 m thus assuming that the offset of the floating body was 120 m in extreme marine conditions we used a water depth of 2400 m as an example and performed a static mechanical cvar analysis at three locations our design parameters are listed in table 3 4 1 time domain analysis of key nodes for further analysis we used four key nodes node 1 node 4 as shown in fig 9 at 0 m platform 1710 m top of small buoyancy modules 1910 m bottom end of small buoyancy modules and 2200 m bottom end of large buoyancy modules the time history curves of each key node are shown below fig 10 shows that the vibration near the platform was the largest due to the wave load and decreased rapidly when in the transitional region the amplitude of vibration of the lower region decreased to 1 10 due to its buffering effect the maximum vertical and horizontal displacements were reduced to less than 1 m which ensured the verticality of the lower region fig 10g shows that stress in the transition zone of the riser was generally high and the corresponding bending moment was large fig 10h indicating the stress was mainly caused by the bending moment of the riser 4 2 regular wave analysis cvars are designed for using in ultra deep water under complex conditions therefore dynamic response analysis under environmental loads is important regular wave analysis with variation of period over a certain range is used for the extreme response studies maximum wave height and associated maximum wave period are used for different load cases and the wave period is varied by 1 5 seconds on either side of t max to estimate variations in load the data for regular wave analysis were based on oceanic conditions in the gulf of mexico and the specific parameters of platform motions are identified in table 4 4 2 1 regular wave analysis under hurricane conditions fig 11 shows that regardless of the position of the far mid or near end the vertical displacement of the riser was the same the vertical displacement of the upper region reached 7 1 m and that of the lower region was limited to 0 1 m or smaller because the transition region effectively buffered the vertical displacement of the upper portion this ensured the stability of the lower region fig 12 shows that while that the top displacement was significantly affected by the platform the transition region had the largest horizontal displacement in the transition and lower regions because the transition region had a smaller stiffness and was relatively flexible which rendered it more susceptible to disturbance at the near end the horizontal displacement decreased but the range was very small however horizontal displacement at the far end increased prominently in the transition and lower regions the maximum displacement even exceeded the top displacement with a value of 10 2 m and the maximum horizontal displacement of the lower region reached 3 17 m at 2295 m fig 13 shows that the trend of change in the maximum mises stress was the same when the platform was at the far mid and near end both ends were low stress areas and high stress was concentrated in the transition region the maximum mises stress was controlled to be below 200 mpa and the maximum stress was 422 4 mpa in the transition zone 1740 m in the riser for the upper and lower regions the stress increased to a greater extent when the riser was located at the far end whereas for the transition area of the riser the maximum stress increased by about 50 mpa when the riser was located at the far and near ends therefore the middle position was the safest and the offset of the upper platform should be minimized as shown in fig 14 the weighting module and large buoyancy module provided sufficient tension for the upper and lower sections of the riser the minimum tension of the transition zone was even subzero at the far end which is not empirically possible therefore the cvar was unstable when the platform was at the far end under hurricane conditions changes in the stress of the transition region should thus be considered to avoid negative values 4 2 2 regular wave analysis under current conditions fig 15 shows that compared with the hurricane conditions the response of cvar under current conditions is less and displacement was controlled below 0 1 m because the current as the main load was a static load the impact on the cvar was mostly reflected in the static configuration and the response in the time history was minor fig 16 shows that compared with the hurricane conditions the maximum mises stress of the upper and the lower regions were nearly identical and the difference was mainly concentrated in the transition area the three cases differed by nearly 100 mpa because the current had a significant influence on the configuration of the riser especially in the relatively flexible transition region the maximum mises stress was 313 9 mpa 1600 m and 314 9 mpa 1750 m when the platform was at the near end fig 17 shows that tension in the riser was not considerably different when the platform was at the far mid and near end the riser also did not have a negative tension point which was safer in the three cases of current conditions and the three conditions were clearly sufficient to provide at least 672 kn of tension for the bottom end stress joint 4 3 dynamic response analysis with different positions of buoyancy module the parameters for dynamic response analysis with different positions of buoyancy module are given in table 5 fig 18 a shows that as the buoyancy module moved upward the maximum vertical displacement of the lower region increased which corresponded to the results of the above model experiment fig 18b shows that when the large buoyancy block was at 1200 m a high stress point appeared at the bottom of the riser this point also had a high bend moment point because the lower region was too long it was catenary shaped and thus lost its unique operational advantage it is clear from fig 18d that as the large buoyancy module moved upward the length of the lower region increased and tension at the wellhead decreased when the buoyancy block was above than 1000 m the bottom tension was smaller than 672 kn which did not satisfy the needs of the bottom joint to further corroborate this the riser profile is shown in fig 18 with the buoyancy module located at different positions fig 19 shows that when the buoyancy module was too high the upper portion was too curved to provide a certain vertical length for operation at this time the lower portion was too long to close to the catenary shape and the advantage of cvar could not be exploited with this type therefore the buoyancy module should be placed as close to the bottom as possible 5 conclusion to explore the dynamic performance of cvars using model experiments and numerical simulations based on virtual work and variational principles the vibration equation of the cvar was established and validated by model experiments in this study time domain analyses of key nodes regular wave analysis and dynamic response at different positions of the buoyancy module were conducted as well the results showed the following the vibration near the platform was the largest due to the wave load and decreased rapidly when in the transitional region the amplitude of vibration of the lower region decreased to 1 10 due to its buffering effect the maximum vertical and horizontal displacements were reduced to less than 1 m which ensured the verticality of the lower region regardless of the position of the platform the vertical displacement of the riser was constant under hurricane conditions the vertical displacement of the upper region reached 7 1 m and that of the lower region was limited to 0 1 m or smaller the largest horizontal displacement was significantly affected by the platform and horizontal displacement at the far end increased prominently both ends were low stress areas and high stress was concentrated in the transition region the maximum mises stress was controlled to below 200 mpa and the maximum stress was 422 4 mpa in the transition zone the minimum tension in the transition zone was even subzero at the far end which is not empirically possible therefore the cvar was unstable when the platform was at the far end under extreme wave conditions the response of cvar subjected to current conditions is less than that of hurricane conditions and displacement was controlled to below 0 1 m the maximum mises stresses of the upper and the lower regions were nearly identical and the difference was mainly concentrated in the transition area when the platform was at the far mid and near ends the three cases differed by nearly 100 mpa the position of a higher buoyancy block not only increased the dynamic response of the riser but also led to an increase in the bending moment at the bottom as the large buoyancy module moved upward the length of the lower region increased and tension at the wellhead decreased when the buoyancy block was above 1000 m the bottom tension was smaller than 672 kn which did not satisfy the requirements of the bottom joint and caused the lower region to become catenary shaped and thus losing its unique operational advantage author contributions section min lou contributed significantly

22046,the linear hydroelastic theory has been widely used in engineering applications in the past however the increasing demand for larger merchant ships makes it necessary to evaluate the influences of second order nonlinear fluid forces on ship response in seas in this study the second order nonlinear responses induced by sea waves are calculated using generalized second order wave force theory in the frequency domain the fluid structure interaction fsi method is presented first in this paper which is used for the assessment of ship response and loads including both linear and second order nonlinear methods in the frequency domain subsequently the effects of linear forces on the wave induced responses and loads for a 180k dwt large bulk carrier with and without forward speed are calculated using pulsating source green s function and translating pulsating source green s function the second order nonlinear responses are predicted mainly based on pulsating source green s function the numerical results show that the ship responses change significantly at high speed and there are extra vertical bending moments caused by second order fluid forces acting on the ship in large amplitude waves compared to linear results it indicates that both the speed of the ship and the second order nonlinear wave forces acting on the ship could amplify the wave induced responses and vertical bending moments keywords hydroelasticity bulk carrier linear response second order nonlinear vertical bending moment 1 introduction the increasing demand for longer and larger merchant ships for instance bulk carriers and containerships with length up to 300 m 400 m has reemphasized the importance of accurate prediction of wave induced motions and loads in ship design by being larger their first elastic natural frequencies tend to move down to the lower wave frequency region and the ships become highly susceptible to resonant vibrations also called springing this is particularly true for high speed ships whose vibration frequencies are more likely to resonate with lower wave frequencies the responses of large ship especially those with the high speed need to be analyzed carefully in waves since the responses of the ship are very closely related to wave exciting forces the exciting forces acting on a ship s body should be considered properly in linear theory only linear hydrodynamic forces are included which may not be enough under some wave conditions because both linear and second order nonlinear hydrodynamic forces can trig hull springing which is a major cause of fatigue failure referring to linear hydroelastic theory significant developments have been achieved in the methods to calculate the hydroelastic loads acting on ships by the work of bishop and price 1979 after that to examine the behavior of the non beam like structures 3d linear wu 1984 hydroelastic methods have been proposed based on sea keeping and structural dynamics theories in order to improve the theory du 1996 extended the unified theory for the calculation of hydroelastic response of floating structures in non uniform flow with forward speed effects taken into account the establishment of linear hydroelastic theory provides an important basis for ship response prediction this theory was widely applied to floating structures for motions and strength analysis e g for very large floating structure wang et al 2001 liu et al 2007 yang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 ding et al 2017 2019 swath catamaran wu et al 2008 ye et al 2013 floating bridge zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2007 and fpso li et al 2008 from the past studies it can prove that the linear theories can provide reasonable results for practical applications in low to moderate seas however in extreme seas the loads acting on ships and its responses become highly nonlinear and the linear theories become less applicable the nonlinear effect is mainly due to the change of ship s wet surface and the nonlinearity of wave surface in some studies only weak nonlinearity is considered and the calculation of some forces takes into account the effect of wet surface change caused by ship motion the free surface satisfies linear control condition in terms of this aspect lin and yue 1990 constructed the integration equation of fluid velocity potential distributing source sink on wetted body surface solved with time domain green function the nonlinear equations of motion of the ship in head waves and oblique waves are established and the corresponding wave loads are calculated by ren 1995 according to hydroelasticity theory wang 1996 proposed a nonlinear hydroelastic theory based on the 3d boundary element method three dimensional integral equations and hydrodynamic coefficients were derived based on 3d green s function in the time domain and the generalized fsi boundary condition compared to weak nonlinearity fully nonlinearity is more suitable in dealing with the problem of strong nonlinear action duan 1995 systematically studied the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force of the floating body in the time domain calculation of body surface nonlinearity and fully nonlinearity and obtained the unified integral form of hydrodynamic calculation formula for both two dimensional and three dimensional bodies although there have been many studies on nonlinearity in the time domain it is still important that the wave force expands to the second order accurately for the performance prediction of ships in frequency domain which can explain some nonlinear phenomenon the second order forces can also affect the motions and loads of ships to tackle this problem second order nonlinear hydroelastic theories and methods have been proposed wu et al 1997 based on the previous study conducted by wu et al 1997 the second order nonlinear theory was applied in mooring force calculation by chen 2001 2002 the author calculated first order and second order hydroelastic responses of a floating structure with mooring this method was further developed by tian 2007 to analyze the hydroelastic responses of sailing ships in large amplitude waves and extreme irregular seas a more comprehensive coupled analysis method was proposed by ni 2016 to simulate the rigid body motion and elastic deflection of large floating structures and to predict mooring line tensions with the quasi static method in time domain based on the results from frequency domain analysis although there have been a lot of studies considering the nonlinear effect on ships floating platform and mooring tension analysis the application of second order nonlinear theory on large ships especially with high speed is seldom thus it is still an important topic worth studying this paper focuses on different methods to evaluate the effect of ship speed on load responses the other is to evaluate the effect of second order nonlinear wave force on ship loads to achieve this a 180 000 dwt bulk carrier is selected as a sample in the first step the hydroelastic characteristics of this ship are analyzed based on the 3d structural and hydrodynamic models of the vessel in this paper the linear wave forces are applied as external forces to calculate the wave induced hydroelastic responses of the vessel at 0 and 23kn forward speed in the frequency domain respectively using the green functions of pulsating source and translating pulsating source then the effect of second order nonlinear fluid forces on section loads in an irregular sea is calculated based on wu et al 1997 formulation 2 three dimensional hydroelastic theory in frequency domain 2 1 velocity potential decomposition and green s function the three dimensional linear hydroelastic theory can be used to analyze the hydroelastic responses of the hull under fluid structure interaction wu 1984 the total deformation of the hull structure can be obtained with the use of the mode superposition method the total velocity potential at any point in the flow field can be expressed as 1 Ï t x y z t u Ï x y z Ï x y z t where the first part of the right hand side u Ï x y z equals to u x u Ï x y z which is the velocity potential

deformation of the structure with the assumption of small amplitude incident wave and small motion of the ship the unsteady velocity potential can be decomposed into the product of time terms and space terms by using the method of variable separation which can be expressed as follows 4 Ï i x y z t Ï i x y z e i Ï t Ï d x y z t Ï d x y z e i Ï t Ï r x y z t Ï r x y z p r e i Ï t the

solving the hydrodynamic problems of ships in waves with forward speed and the bessho form translating pulsating source green s function initially introduced by bessho 1977 is employed in this study a

verify the accuracy of second order force calculated with the method in this paper the same hemisphere model selected from the paper by kudou et al 1978 was meshed to compare the results from calculation and model test the radius of the sphere is 35 m and half of the sphere is submerged totally in water the number of the panel on the wetted surface is 206 and the line segment on the water line is 36 fig 1 displays the comparison results of experimental data and thafts the horizontal ordinate is ka and y axis is c 1 m e a n which can be expressed as follow 12 c 1 m e a n f 1 m e a n Ï

data is acquired from kudou et al 1978 and calculation results are outputted by thafts which is an in house software as shown in fig 1 it is found that the results agree very well with model test results 2 3 equation of motion with second order forces a three dimensional second order nonlinear hydroelastic theory was established by wu et al 1997 which considered the effects of second order nonlinear forces on the dynamic responses of ships under rough sea conditions the second order forces are higher order components mainly derived from coupled effects of first order values including motion responses static pressure and velocity potential and the change of the wetted surface comparing with second order forces based on rigid body theory pinkster 1980 the role of elastic modes is added to the calculation process of the second order forces in hydroelastic theory which can consider the effect of fluid and structure interaction especially for large ships or offshore structures to acquire more accurate second order forces the contribution of elastic modes obviously cannot be neglected when the effect of the second order nonlinear wave loads on the dynamic responses of the floating structure is taken into account the motion eq 8 of ships can be changed to eq 13 13 a a p b b p c c Î´ c p f 1 z 2 Î´ z 2 where f 1 is first order wave exciting force same as f t in eq 6 z 2 is a second order wave force component caused by first order motions and first order fluid pressures Î´ z 2 is another second order wave force component caused by the change of the instantaneous wetted surface z 2 and Î´ z 2 can be written in the form of the formula 14 and 15 the detailed expression of each component in formula 14 can be found in the paper by wu et al 1997 14 z r 2 t f r 2 t

to the second order force z is the vertical coordinate in body axes system w Ï is relative wave elevation n 3 is the vertical component of the normal vector of a floating body wetted surface the components of second order nonlinear wave loads include wave frequency forces difference frequency forces and sum frequency forces therefore the principal coordinate responses also contain the above three frequency components only z 2 and Î´ z 2 on the right hand side of eq 13 are retained to obtain the second order responses the discrete equations of the second order hydroelastic motion of the

et al 2009 which are shown in table 1 the hydrodynamic grid model is displayed in fig 2 in this study two cartesian coordinate systems are adopted one is a global system and the other is a local system the global coordinate system is fixed with its origin at still water level these two coordinate systems coincide when the ship is at rest three transverse section positions named mv1 mv2 mv3 which are located at 72 18 m 141 34 m and 212 32 m starting from the stern are defined for the calculation of vertical bending moment 3 2 vibration modes of the hull the results shown in fig 3 are hull modes from three dimensional finite element analysis using the displacement normalization method the dry mode natural frequencies and resonant frequencies are displayed in table 2 in this table the natural represents for dry natural frequency of the structure and the resonant is defined for the wet natural frequency of the structure in water the vbm coefficients at three typical sections are shown in table 3 4 linear hydroelastic response 4 1 linear principal coordinate responses in this study the pulsating source green function is used to calculate the principal coordinates of elastic modes at speed 0 and 23kn as shown in figs 4 6 the resonant frequencies of 2 node vertical bending and 3 node vertical bending are marked with the increase of the natural frequency of the ship hull the magnitude of the principal coordinate response becomes smaller and their peak values at the position of resonant frequencies are at similar levels in following and head waves fig 6 shows the linear hydroelastic responses of the hull at speed 23kn in a head sea the resonant frequencies and response amplitudes corresponding to the elastic modes are also shown in this figure from the comparison of the results between figs 5 and 6 it can be found that in the low frequency region the response peak position of the hull at 23kn is slightly more to the right than that at zero speed and the high frequency resonant response frequency is almost the same in terms of the response amplitude the response peak at 23kn is higher than that at zero speed both in low frequency and high frequency regions the hydroelastic responses from pulsating source green function and translating pulsating source green function in the uniform flow with a single constant flow velocity on the free surface and double body flow are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the overall trend of hydroelastic responses calculated with three different methods is consistent however there are also some differences for 2 node vertical bending mode in the low frequency region a single peak and double peaks can be observed using pulsating source green function and translating pulsating source green function respectively the three methods all have the elastic modal resonant response peaks at the frequency near 3 0 rad s however under the same damping coefficient 2 of critical damping the peak value of the response calculated with the use of the translating pulsating green function is larger than that calculated with the use of pulsating green function on the curves of 3 node vertical bending mode responses shown in fig 6 double peaks are observed in the low frequency region at about 0 75 rad s and the second peak positions are almost the same a few discrepancies are found at the first peak among three different numerical methods 3 node vertical bending mode resonant frequencies are found to be around 6 0 rad s with a single peak calculated using a pulsating green function and double peaks using a translating pulsating green function 4 2 vertical bending moments 4 2 1 the responses of vertical bending moments based on the 2 node vertical bending mode and 3 node vertical bending mode responses and the modal loads given in table 3 the loads of three transverse sections of the ship at zero speed can be calculated using the superposition method fig 7 and fig 8 illustrate the vertical moment transfer functions at sections mv1 mv2 and mv3 in the case of the following sea the peak vbm at section mv3 is smaller than that of the other two sections in the low frequency region the peak vbm at section mv2 is larger than that of the other two sections in the region on the left of the peak the magnitudes of vbm at section mv1 and mv3 are almost equal in the region on the right of the peak vbm at section mv1 is larger than that at section mv3 in the high frequency region the vbm at section mv2 is significantly greater than that at sections mv1 and mv3 at the resonant frequency of the first elastic mode in the head sea case the peak vbm at section mv2 is maximum in the low frequency region and the peak moment at section mv3 is slightly larger than that at section mv1 in the region on the left of the peak frequency the vbm at section mv2 is larger than that at the other two sections the magnitude of moments in section mv1 and mv3 are almost equal in the region on the right of the peak frequency the vbm at section mv3 is slightly larger than that at section mv1 in a certain frequency range the magnitudes of the moment at sections mv2 and mv3 are in the same order in the high frequency region the peak responses of the first order elastic mode vbm decrease in the sequence of sections mv2 mv3 and mv1 fig 9 shows the vertical moment transfer functions of three sections at 23kn forward speed it can be seen that the vbms increase at these sections in the sequence of mv1 mv3 and mv2 at the first order elastic modal resonant frequency the peak of the resonant response of the 2 node elastic mode is greater than the one at a lower resonant frequency around 0 7 rad s the vbm response at section mv2 is the smallest at the 3 node elastic modal resonant frequency comparing to the results in fig 8 the response amplitude is slightly larger in lower wave frequency because of forward speed at resonant frequencies of 2 node and 3 node vertical bending modes the peak responses at 23kn are significantly greater than that at zero speed indicating that the responses of the elastic modes are sensitive to speed 4 2 2 short term prediction of loads at midship a jonswap wave spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 2 0 was adopted to predict the short term values of vertical bending moments at midship the significant wave height hs is assumed to be 5 0 m and the spectral peak period tp satisfies the condition of 13 h s t p 30 h s based on the relationship between hs and tp the spectral peak periods are chosen from 8 06s to 12 25s in this paper the following 10 periods are selected 8 06s 8 5s 9 0s 9 5s 10 0s 10 5s 11 0s 11 5s 12 0s 12 25s supposing the random distribution of peak and trough values of wave loads fit the rayleigh distribution the possible short term extreme value is then about 1 86 times the significant value from short term prediction the amplitude of the design wave can then be derived which equals 1 3 times the ratio of the maximum short term extreme value to the maximum rao in this paper the vertical bending moment at midship was selected as a control value for determining the parameters of the design wave vertical bending moment raos at midship under different wave directions are presented in fig 10 which shows that the maximum moment is 8 86e 8 n m at wave frequency 0 6 rad s its corresponding phase angle is 62 95 and the wave direction is 60 the short term prediction of the vertical bending moment at midship is listed in table 4 from the data in this table the maximum of extreme values under different wave conditions is 2 837e 9n m and its spectral peak period is 10 0s based on the method for determining the parameters of the design wave mentioned above it can be found that the amplitude of the design wave is 3 465 m 4 2 3 long term prediction of structural loads at midship based on the global wave scatter diagram and jonswap wave spectrum the long term forecasting function of compass thafts software is used to calculate the loads at different exceeding probability levels fig 11 shows the vertical bending moment prediction curve for the midship section in which a logarithm abscissa is used for the exceeding probability assuming that the exceeding probability is 10e 8 the long term predicted value of the vertical bending moment is 7 174e 09n m as shown in table 4 the short term extreme load of vertical bending moment is 2 837e 09nm and the long term forecast value is 2 53 times of that it can be seen that the load value of the long term forecast is obviously larger than the extreme value of the short term forecast because the sea condition is more severe in the long term forecast if the design wave parameters are determined based on the long term prediction the amplitude of the design wave can reach 8 1 m which is significantly larger than that based on the short term prediction therefore the design wave amplitude obtained by long term prediction tends to be safer which method should be adopted will depend on the requirements of relevant regulations of classification societies fig 12 shows the relationship between the long term prediction of vbm and the section position along the longitudinal direction of the ship from the aft perpendicular ap from the figure it can be seen that the long term extreme values are in an arched shape the values at both ends of the hull are small and the maximum value appears around the midship of the hull 5 second order hydroelastic responses three dimensional and two dimensional curves of difference frequency and sum frequency responses of the bulk carrier at 23kn speed are illustrated in figs 13 14 the calculations here are all based on the assumption of uniform flow fig 13 shows the results of the difference frequency hydroelastic responses predicted using the pulsating green function it can be seen that line â  indicates the resonant response frequency corresponding to a 2 node vertical bending mode in fig 13 a fixing the encounter frequency Ï e i in fig 13 a at1 03 rad s and changing the other frequency Ï e j the difference frequency response in a two dimensional curve is then plotted again in fig 13 b against Ï e j Ï e i the resonant response occurs near 3 0 rad s corresponding to 2 node vertical bending resonant frequency fig 14 shows the results of the sum frequency hydroelastic responses in fig 14 a line â  indicates the resonant frequency corresponding to 2 node vertical bending line â  marked in fig 14 c is corresponding to the 3 node vertical bending mode resonant frequency the results are displayed in fig 14 b and fig 14 d when the encounter frequency Ï e i is set to be equal to frequency Ï e j the resonant frequencies of 2 node and 3 node vertical bending modes can be clearly observed fig 15 fig 16 display the time histories of the exciting force the integration of wave pressure on wetted surface panels in the specified normal direction caused by the combined first order and second order forces in irregular waves the irregular wave is simulated by an ittc double parameter wave spectrum in which the significant wave height is 3 0 m and the characteristic period is 10 0s there are obvious differences between the dash line and solid line in figs 15 and 16 fig 17 and fig 18 show the time histories of the principal coordinates of two elastic modes the responses of the elastic modes are altered clearly as the second order responses and the components of the nonlinear high frequency responses are added to the linear low frequency responses the linear and second order nonlinear responses of the vbm at 0 25l 0 75l and midship due to wave forces in irregular waves are displayed from figs 19 27 respectively when the effect of second order nonlinearity is included the extreme value of vbm will increase noticeably the difference between the maximum and minimum vbm is 1 71e 09n m in fig 25 and 2 08e 09n m in fig 26 it has increased by 21 53 because of the second order nonlinearity fig 27 shows the contribution of the second order nonlinear response to the vbm which is mainly derived from the nonlinear resonant response of the 2 node vertical bending mode through the statistical analysis the vbm at section 0 25l and 0 75l increase 3 81 and 11 64 respectively due to the second order nonlinearity the results show that the vbm at midship is more sensitive to the second order forces than the other two sections 6 conclusion in this paper the responses and vertical bending moments of a 180k dwt large bulk carrier induced by wave loads are investigated by using linear and second order nonlinear hydroelastic theories the following conclusions can be drawn from the predictions and analysis in this study it is confirmed from this study that the motions and vertical bending moments change significantly due to forward speed and second order wave loads in both low frequency and high frequency regions as merchant ships becoming larger their first natural frequencies tend to become close to the lower wave frequencies and the ships become more susceptible to resonant vibrations this is particularly true for ships with forward speed as the wave induced responses by linear and second order nonlinear fluid forces may more likely fall into the peak frequency region of a wave spectrum long term extreme values are also predicted based on the global wave scatter diagram presented in the paper it is found that the predicted long term extreme value is significantly larger than the short term prediction the results of the linear hydroelastic responses are broadly the same in the overall trend and the resonant frequencies calculated by different combinations of pulsating source or translating pulsating source green function and uniform flow or double body flow however some discrepancies are found for the amplitudes of the responses between different methods the second order nonlinear forces play a significant role in the hydroelastic response calculation in low or medium seas linear hydroelastic responses are usually sufficient for the performance evaluation of ships however in large waves the role of second order nonlinear forces should not be neglected consequently the non linearity at least the second order force must be included in the prediction of ship

22046,the linear hydroelastic theory has been widely used in engineering applications in the past however the increasing demand for larger merchant ships makes it necessary to evaluate the influences of second order nonlinear fluid forces on ship response in seas in this study the second order nonlinear responses induced by sea waves are calculated using generalized second order wave force theory in the frequency domain the fluid structure interaction fsi method is presented first in this paper which is used for the assessment of ship response and loads including both linear and second order nonlinear methods in the frequency domain subsequently the effects of linear forces on the wave induced responses and loads for a 180k dwt large bulk carrier with and without forward speed are calculated using pulsating source green s function and translating pulsating source green s function the second order nonlinear responses are predicted mainly based on pulsating source green s function the numerical results show that the ship responses change significantly at high speed and there are extra vertical bending moments caused by second order fluid forces acting on the ship in large amplitude waves compared to linear results it indicates that both the speed of the ship and the second order nonlinear wave forces acting on the ship could amplify the wave induced responses and vertical bending moments keywords hydroelasticity bulk carrier linear response second order nonlinear vertical bending moment 1 introduction the increasing demand for longer and larger merchant ships for instance bulk carriers and containerships with length up to 300 m 400 m has reemphasized the importance of accurate prediction of wave induced motions and loads in ship design by being larger their first elastic natural frequencies tend to move down to the lower wave frequency region and the ships become highly susceptible to resonant vibrations also called springing this is particularly true for high speed ships whose vibration frequencies are more likely to resonate with lower wave frequencies the responses of large ship especially those with the high speed need to be analyzed carefully in waves since the responses of the ship are very closely related to wave exciting forces the exciting forces acting on a ship s body should be considered properly in linear theory only linear hydrodynamic forces are included which may not be enough under some wave conditions because both linear and second order nonlinear hydrodynamic forces can trig hull springing which is a major cause of fatigue failure referring to linear hydroelastic theory significant developments have been achieved in the methods to calculate the hydroelastic loads acting on ships by the work of bishop and price 1979 after that to examine the behavior of the non beam like structures 3d linear wu 1984 hydroelastic methods have been proposed based on sea keeping and structural dynamics theories in order to improve the theory du 1996 extended the unified theory for the calculation of hydroelastic response of floating structures in non uniform flow with forward speed effects taken into account the establishment of linear hydroelastic theory provides an important basis for ship response prediction this theory was widely applied to floating structures for motions and strength analysis e g for very large floating structure wang et al 2001 liu et al 2007 yang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 ding et al 2017 2019 swath catamaran wu et al 2008 ye et al 2013 floating bridge zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2007 and fpso li et al 2008 from the past studies it can prove that the linear theories can provide reasonable results for practical applications in low to moderate seas however in extreme seas the loads acting on ships and its responses become highly nonlinear and the linear theories become less applicable the nonlinear effect is mainly due to the change of ship s wet surface and the nonlinearity of wave surface in some studies only weak nonlinearity is considered and the calculation of some forces takes into account the effect of wet surface change caused by ship motion the free surface satisfies linear control condition in terms of this aspect lin and yue 1990 constructed the integration equation of fluid velocity potential distributing source sink on wetted body surface solved with time domain green function the nonlinear equations of motion of the ship in head waves and oblique waves are established and the corresponding wave loads are calculated by ren 1995 according to hydroelasticity theory wang 1996 proposed a nonlinear hydroelastic theory based on the 3d boundary element method three dimensional integral equations and hydrodynamic coefficients were derived based on 3d green s function in the time domain and the generalized fsi boundary condition compared to weak nonlinearity fully nonlinearity is more suitable in dealing with the problem of strong nonlinear action duan 1995 systematically studied the calculation method of the hydrodynamic force of the floating body in the time domain calculation of body surface nonlinearity and fully nonlinearity and obtained the unified integral form of hydrodynamic calculation formula for both two dimensional and three dimensional bodies although there have been many studies on nonlinearity in the time domain it is still important that the wave force expands to the second order accurately for the performance prediction of ships in frequency domain which can explain some nonlinear phenomenon the second order forces can also affect the motions and loads of ships to tackle this problem second order nonlinear hydroelastic theories and methods have been proposed wu et al 1997 based on the previous study conducted by wu et al 1997 the second order nonlinear theory was applied in mooring force calculation by chen 2001 2002 the author calculated first order and second order hydroelastic responses of a floating structure with mooring this method was further developed by tian 2007 to analyze the hydroelastic responses of sailing ships in large amplitude waves and extreme irregular seas a more comprehensive coupled analysis method was proposed by ni 2016 to simulate the rigid body motion and elastic deflection of large floating structures and to predict mooring line tensions with the quasi static method in time domain based on the results from frequency domain analysis although there have been a lot of studies considering the nonlinear effect on ships floating platform and mooring tension analysis the application of second order nonlinear theory on large ships especially with high speed is seldom thus it is still an important topic worth studying this paper focuses on different methods to evaluate the effect of ship speed on load responses the other is to evaluate the effect of second order nonlinear wave force on ship loads to achieve this a 180 000 dwt bulk carrier is selected as a sample in the first step the hydroelastic characteristics of this ship are analyzed based on the 3d structural and hydrodynamic models of the vessel in this paper the linear wave forces are applied as external forces to calculate the wave induced hydroelastic responses of the vessel at 0 and 23kn forward speed in the frequency domain respectively using the green functions of pulsating source and translating pulsating source then the effect of second order nonlinear fluid forces on section loads in an irregular sea is calculated based on wu et al 1997 formulation 2 three

solving the hydrodynamic problems of ships in waves with forward speed and the bessho form translating pulsating source green s function initially introduced by bessho 1977 is employed in this study a

verify the accuracy of second order force calculated with the method in this paper the same hemisphere model selected from the paper by kudou et al 1978 was meshed to compare the results from calculation and model test the radius of the sphere is 35 m and half of the sphere is submerged totally in water the number of the panel on the wetted surface is 206 and the line segment on the water

data is acquired from kudou et al 1978 and calculation results are outputted by thafts which is an in house software as shown in fig 1 it is found that the results agree very well with model test results 2 3 equation of motion with second order forces a three dimensional second order nonlinear hydroelastic theory was established by wu et al 1997 which considered the effects of second order nonlinear forces on the dynamic responses of ships under rough sea conditions the second order forces are higher order components mainly derived from coupled effects of first order values including motion responses static pressure and velocity potential and the change of the wetted surface comparing with second order forces based on rigid body theory pinkster 1980 the role of elastic modes is added to the calculation process of the second order forces in hydroelastic theory which can consider the effect of fluid and structure interaction especially for large ships or offshore structures to acquire more accurate second order forces the contribution of elastic modes obviously cannot be neglected when the effect of the second order nonlinear wave loads on the dynamic responses of the floating structure is taken into account the motion eq 8 of ships can be changed to eq 13 13 a a p b b p c c Î´ c p f 1 z 2 Î´ z 2 where f 1 is first order wave exciting force same as f t in eq 6 z 2

to the second order force z is the vertical coordinate in body axes system w Ï is relative wave elevation n 3 is the vertical component of the normal vector of a floating body wetted surface the components of second order nonlinear wave loads include wave frequency forces difference frequency forces and sum frequency forces therefore the principal coordinate responses also contain the above three frequency components only z 2 and Î´ z 2 on the right hand side of eq 13 are retained to obtain the second order responses the discrete equations of the second order hydroelastic motion of the

from formula 20 21 and 22 respectively 3 study of a bulk carrier 3 1 hull particulars the length between perpendiculars of the bulk carrier is 285 0 m and its principal particulars were given by tian et al 2009 which are shown in table 1 the hydrodynamic grid model is displayed in fig 2 in this study two cartesian coordinate systems are adopted one is a global system and the other is a local system the global coordinate system is fixed with its origin at still water level these two coordinate systems coincide when the ship is at rest three transverse section positions named mv1 mv2 mv3 which are located at 72 18 m 141 34 m and 212 32 m starting from the stern are defined for the calculation of vertical bending moment 3 2 vibration modes of the hull the results shown in fig 3 are hull modes from three dimensional finite element analysis using the displacement normalization method the dry mode natural frequencies and resonant frequencies are displayed in table 2 in this table the natural represents for dry natural frequency of the structure and the resonant is defined for the wet natural frequency of the structure in water the vbm coefficients at three typical sections are shown in table 3 4 linear hydroelastic response 4 1 linear principal coordinate responses in this study the pulsating source green function is used to calculate the principal coordinates of elastic modes at speed 0 and 23kn as shown in figs 4 6 the resonant frequencies of 2 node vertical bending and 3 node vertical bending are marked with the increase of the natural frequency of the ship hull the magnitude of the principal coordinate response becomes smaller and their peak values at the position of resonant frequencies are at similar levels in following and head waves fig 6 shows the linear hydroelastic responses of the hull at speed 23kn in a head sea the resonant frequencies and response amplitudes corresponding to the elastic modes are also shown in this figure from the comparison of the results between figs 5 and 6 it can be found that in the low frequency region the response peak position of the hull at 23kn is slightly more to the right than that at zero speed and the high frequency resonant response frequency is almost the same in terms of the response amplitude the response peak at 23kn is higher than that at zero speed both in low frequency and high frequency regions the hydroelastic responses from pulsating source green function and translating pulsating source green function in the uniform flow with a single constant flow velocity on the free surface and double body flow are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the overall trend of hydroelastic responses calculated with three different methods is consistent however there are also some differences for 2 node vertical bending mode in the low frequency region a single peak and double peaks can be observed using pulsating source green function and translating pulsating source green function respectively the three methods all have the elastic modal resonant response peaks at the frequency near 3 0 rad s however under the same damping coefficient 2 of critical damping the peak value of the response calculated with the use of the translating pulsating green function is larger than that calculated with the use of pulsating green function on the curves of 3 node vertical bending mode responses shown in fig 6 double peaks are observed in the low frequency region at about 0 75 rad s and the second peak positions are almost the same a few discrepancies are found at the first peak among three different numerical methods 3 node vertical bending mode resonant frequencies are found to be around 6 0 rad s with a single peak calculated using a pulsating green function and double peaks using a translating pulsating green function 4 2 vertical bending moments 4 2 1 the responses of vertical bending moments based on the 2 node vertical bending mode and 3 node vertical bending mode responses and the modal loads given in table 3 the loads of three transverse sections of the ship at zero speed can be calculated using the superposition method fig 7 and fig 8 illustrate the vertical moment transfer functions at sections mv1 mv2 and mv3 in the case of the following sea the peak vbm at section mv3 is smaller than that of the other two sections in the low frequency region the peak vbm at section mv2 is larger than that of the other two sections in the region on the left of the peak the magnitudes of vbm at section mv1 and mv3 are almost equal in the region on the right of the peak vbm at section mv1 is larger than that at section mv3 in the high frequency region the vbm at section mv2 is significantly greater than that at sections mv1 and mv3 at the resonant frequency of the first elastic mode in the head sea case the peak vbm at section mv2 is maximum in the low frequency region and the peak moment at section mv3 is slightly larger than that at section mv1 in the region on the left of the peak frequency the vbm at section mv2 is larger than that at the other two sections the magnitude of moments in section mv1 and mv3 are almost equal in the region on the right of the peak frequency the vbm at section mv3 is slightly larger than that at section mv1 in a certain frequency range the magnitudes of the moment at sections mv2 and mv3 are in the same order in the high frequency region the peak responses of the first order elastic mode vbm decrease in the sequence of sections mv2 mv3 and mv1 fig 9 shows the vertical moment transfer functions of three sections at 23kn forward speed it can be seen that the vbms increase at these sections in the sequence of mv1 mv3 and mv2 at the first order elastic modal resonant frequency the peak of the resonant response of the 2 node elastic mode is greater than the one at a lower resonant frequency around 0 7 rad s the vbm response at section mv2 is the smallest at the 3 node elastic modal resonant frequency comparing to the results in fig 8 the response amplitude is slightly larger in lower wave frequency because of forward speed at resonant frequencies of 2 node and 3 node vertical bending modes the peak responses at 23kn are significantly greater than that at zero speed indicating that the responses of the elastic modes are sensitive to speed 4 2 2 short term prediction of loads at midship a jonswap wave spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 2 0 was adopted to predict the short term values of vertical bending moments at midship the significant wave height hs is assumed to be 5 0 m and the spectral peak period tp satisfies the condition of 13 h s t p 30 h s based on the relationship between hs and tp the spectral peak periods are chosen from 8 06s to 12 25s in this paper the following 10 periods are selected 8 06s 8 5s 9 0s 9 5s 10 0s 10 5s 11 0s 11 5s 12 0s 12 25s supposing the random distribution of peak and trough values of wave loads fit the rayleigh distribution the possible short term extreme value is then about 1 86 times the significant value from short term prediction the amplitude of the design wave can then be derived which equals 1 3 times the ratio of the maximum short term extreme value to the maximum rao in this paper the vertical bending moment at midship was selected as a control value for determining the parameters of the design wave vertical bending moment raos at midship under different wave directions are presented in fig 10 which shows that the maximum moment is 8 86e 8 n m at wave frequency 0 6 rad s its corresponding phase angle is 62 95 and the wave direction is 60 the short term prediction of the vertical bending moment at midship is listed in table 4 from the data in this table the maximum of extreme values under different wave conditions is 2 837e 9n m and its spectral peak period is 10 0s based on the method for determining the parameters of the design wave mentioned above it can be found that the amplitude of the design wave is 3 465 m 4 2 3 long term prediction of structural loads at midship based on the global wave scatter diagram and jonswap wave spectrum the long term forecasting function of compass thafts software is used to calculate the loads at different exceeding probability levels fig 11 shows the vertical bending moment prediction curve for the midship section in which a logarithm abscissa is used for the exceeding probability assuming that the exceeding probability is 10e 8 the long term predicted value of the vertical bending moment is 7 174e 09n m as shown in table 4 the short term extreme load of vertical bending moment is 2 837e 09nm and the long term forecast value is 2 53 times of that it can be seen that the load value of the long term forecast is obviously larger than the extreme value of the short term forecast because the sea condition is more severe in the long term forecast if the design wave parameters are determined based on the long term prediction the amplitude of the design wave can reach 8 1 m which is significantly larger than that based on the short term prediction therefore the design wave amplitude obtained by long term prediction tends to be safer which method should be adopted will depend on the requirements of relevant regulations of classification societies fig 12 shows the relationship between the long term prediction of vbm and the section position along the longitudinal direction of the ship from the aft perpendicular ap from the figure it can be seen that the long term extreme values are in an arched shape the values at both ends of the hull are small and the maximum value appears around the midship of the hull 5 second order hydroelastic responses three dimensional and two dimensional curves of difference frequency and sum frequency responses of the bulk carrier at 23kn speed are illustrated in figs 13 14 the calculations here are all based on the assumption of uniform flow fig 13 shows the results of the difference frequency hydroelastic responses predicted using the pulsating green function it can be seen that line â  indicates the resonant response frequency corresponding to a 2 node vertical bending mode in fig 13 a fixing the encounter frequency Ï e i in fig 13 a at1 03 rad s and changing the other frequency Ï e j the difference frequency response in a two dimensional curve is then plotted again in fig 13 b against Ï e j Ï e i the resonant response occurs near 3 0 rad s corresponding to 2 node vertical bending resonant frequency fig 14 shows the results of the sum frequency hydroelastic responses in fig 14 a line â  indicates the resonant frequency corresponding to 2 node vertical bending line â  marked in fig 14 c is corresponding to the 3 node vertical bending mode resonant frequency the results are displayed in fig 14 b and fig 14 d when the encounter frequency Ï e i is set to be equal to frequency Ï e j the resonant frequencies of 2 node and 3 node vertical bending modes can be clearly observed fig 15 fig 16 display the time histories of the exciting force the integration of wave pressure on wetted surface panels in the specified normal direction caused by the combined first order and second order forces in irregular waves the irregular wave is simulated by an ittc double parameter wave spectrum in which the significant wave height is 3 0 m and the characteristic period is 10 0s there are obvious differences between the dash line and solid line in figs 15 and 16 fig 17 and fig 18 show the time histories of the principal coordinates of two elastic modes the responses of the elastic modes are altered clearly as the second order responses and the components of the nonlinear high frequency responses are added to the linear low frequency responses the linear and second order nonlinear responses of the vbm at 0 25l 0 75l and midship due to wave forces in irregular waves are displayed from figs 19 27 respectively when the effect of second order nonlinearity is included the extreme value of vbm will increase noticeably the difference between the maximum and minimum vbm is 1 71e 09n m in fig 25 and 2 08e 09n m in fig 26 it has increased by 21 53 because of the second order nonlinearity fig 27 shows the contribution of the second order nonlinear response to the vbm which is mainly derived from the nonlinear resonant response of the 2 node vertical bending mode through the statistical analysis the vbm at section 0 25l and 0 75l increase 3 81 and 11 64 respectively due to the second order nonlinearity the results show that the vbm at midship is more sensitive to the second order forces than the other two sections 6 conclusion in this paper the responses and vertical bending moments of a 180k dwt large bulk carrier induced by wave loads are investigated by using linear and second order nonlinear hydroelastic theories the following conclusions can be drawn from the predictions and analysis in this study it is confirmed from this study that the motions and vertical bending moments change significantly due to forward speed and second order wave loads in both low frequency and high frequency regions as merchant ships becoming larger their first natural frequencies tend to become close to the lower wave frequencies and the ships become more susceptible to resonant vibrations this is particularly true for ships with forward speed as the wave induced responses by linear and second order nonlinear fluid forces may more likely fall into the peak frequency region of a wave spectrum long term extreme values are also predicted based on the global wave scatter diagram presented in the paper it is found that the predicted long term extreme value is significantly larger than the short term prediction the results of the linear hydroelastic responses are broadly the same in the overall trend and the resonant frequencies calculated by different combinations of pulsating source or translating pulsating source green function and uniform flow or double body flow however some discrepancies are found for the amplitudes of the responses between different methods the second order nonlinear forces play a significant role in the hydroelastic response calculation in low or medium seas linear hydroelastic responses are usually sufficient for the performance evaluation of ships however in large waves the role of second order nonlinear forces should not be neglected consequently the non linearity at least the second order force must be included in the prediction of ship

22047,ultra large container ship as an essential role during international trade is required for precision fabrication due to highly efficient teu loading and unloading in this study two major structures so called watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure of ultra large container with 20000teu were examined for out of plane welding distortion prediction and mitigation with measurement and computational analysis based on the welding inherent deformation theory typical welded joints of two major structures were systematically classified with the different material thickness welding condition and joining form and the relationships between welding heat input and inherent deformations were also presented elastic fe analysis with shell elements model and welding inherent deformation as input loading was employed for welding distortion prediction not only the distributions but also the magnitudes of predicted out of plane welding distortions of considered major structures have a good agreement comparing to the measurements furthermore welding sequence influence was considered for dimensional precision controlling during the watertight transverse bulkhead structure fabrication and welding groove optimization of thick plate was examined for out of plane welding distortion mitigation during the torsion box structure fabrication computational results show that welding distortions of both ship block structures can be significantly reduced for requirement of fabrication precision keywords ultra large container out of plane welding distortion precision fabrication welding inherent deformation elastic fe analysis welding sequence optimization of groove design 1 introduction with the fast increasing of international trade the container vessel in particular ultra large container ship was eagerly required due to its advantages such as efficiency convenience safety and so on ultra large container ship with 20 000teu as shown in fig 1 is stepwise becoming the dominant type comparing to that with less carrying capacity generally ultra large container ship is assembled with lots of panel block and curved section and there are two major structures watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure as shown in fig 2 due to the mechanical performance consideration and teu loading unloading efficiency panel blocks with watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure were required to precision fabrication with much less out of plane welding distortion moreover different plate thicknesses and materials as well as partial penetration welded joint were employed to reduce fabrication cost and schedule those applications during the actual fabrication of examined panel blocks cause the investigation complexity for accurately predicting and obviously mitigating out of plane welding distortion therefore both advanced and efficient computational approach for welding distortion prediction and mitigation of fabrication precision of large complex ship panel blocks are indeed desired during modern shipbuilding in addition for the welding distortion investigation during the fabrication of ultra large container ship it is better to predict the distribution and magnitude of out of plane welding distortion with advanced computational approach then consider the generation mechanism and propose the advanced techniques for welding distortion correction in actual manufacturing of shipbuilding according to rapid development of computational approach in particular the finite element method thermal elastic plastic fe computation was widely accepted and employed to solve welding distortion problem but only for welded joint and simple welded structures due to its large consumption of computer memory and computing time elastic fe analysis with shell elements model is an ideal and practical computational approach for prediction and mitigation of welding distortion during the fabrication of ship structures brown and song brown and song 1992 employed solid shell elements finite model of a circular cylinder and a ring stiffened structure to investigate the effect of welding configurations such as weld gap clearance and fixture on the dimensional precision of considered large structure later michaleris and debiccari 1997 presented a numerical analysis combining 2d welding computation with 3d structural analyses which is effective when the computer resources are limited jung and tsai 2003 examined the relationship between cumulative plastic strains and welding distortion in advance and then mapped each cumulative plastic strain component evaluated by thermal elastic plastic analysis incorporating the effects of moving heat and non linear material properties into elastic fe analysis using equivalent thermal strains jung 2007 also predicted the welding distortion in the fabrication of ship panels by means of elastic fe analysis with shell elements model in which only longitudinal and transverse plastic strains were employed to compute the welding distortion and good agreement was observed comparing with results of thermal elastic plastic fe analysis zhang et al 2007 evaluated six components of plastic strain of each welding pass with thermal elastic plastic fe analysis while moving heat source and solid elements model with shorter length are employed and then these plastic strain components were mapped to shell elements mode of actual welded structure for welding distortion prediction yang et al 2011 developed a stepwise computational approach to predict welding distortion of large welded structure for computational efficiency promotion the lump pass modeling of welded joints with thermal mechanical analysis is carried out to obtain plastic strain and then welding distortion prediction is achieved by means of mapping plastic strains evaluated beforehand into the shell elements model of actual welded structure since elastic fe computation with shell element models based on inherent strain deformation has high computational efficiency and accurate computed result it is usually employed and applied for welding distortion investigation during ship structure fabrication luo et al 1997 pointed out that welding inherent strain is dominantly determined by the highest temperature reached during thermal cycles and the self constraint supported by surrounding materials and then an elastic fe analysis is carried out to predict the welding distortion with the inherent strain as loading wang et al wang and luo 2000 established the relationship between inherent strain and welding configurations of typical welded joints with experimental results and thermal elastic plastic fe computation and then inherent strains were applied as loading to predict welding distortion of large welded cylinder with multi pass welding later murakawa et al 1998 considered welding distortion as the result of elastic response of examined welded structure with inelastic strains as loads while inelastic strains are totally defined as inherent strain and can be evaluated using a limited number of typical joints moreover these evaluated inherent strains on each transverse cross section were integrated to be welding inherent deformation which is easier to store in databases for welding distortion prediction in future luo et al 1999 predicted welding distortion by elastic fe analysis using inherent deformations and tendon force which are the integrations of welding inherent strains and then validation was demonstrated through numerical examples luo at al luo et al 2004 constituted a database of welding inherent deformation by a series of thermal elastic plastic fe computations of aluminum alloy butt welded joint and elastic fe analysis base on this database was carried out to predict welding distortion of a large train coping with aluminum alloy plates deng and murakawa deng et al 2007 developed an elastic fe analysis to accurately predict welding distortion considering large deformation theory tep fe computations were carried out to evaluate inherent deformations of various types of welded joints beforehand and then elastic fe computation was employed to predict welding distortion based on evaluated inherent deformations murakawa et al 2010 summarized the concepts of inherent strain inherent stress inherent deformation and inherent force during welding distortion prediction in detail inherent strain will be conveyed to be the deformation when self restraint is weak and it will be conveyed to be the force when self restraint is strong enough as the applications of elastic fe computation for welding distortion prediction and mitigation during complex welded structure fabrication wang et al 2011 examined a spherical structure assembled with multi thin plates by elastic fe computation and computed welding distortions have good agreement with experimental measurements murakawa et al 2012 studied welding distortion during assembly process of thin plate structure with elastic fe computation while influence of assembly sequence as well as gap and misalignment on final dimensional accuracy was also investigated assembly processes such as cutting forming welding and straightening during shipbuilding were all examined during the fabrications of boxy structure ship block ship panel and super structure murakawa et al 2009 2013 while influences of gaps and misalignments during fitting procedure on dimensional accuracy were also considered in addition wang et al 2013a achieved welding distortion prediction in fabrication of hatch coaming of bulk cargo ship by elastic fe computation and welding distortion was reduced applying an improved assembly process with numerical analysis welding distortion in fabrication of cantilever beam component of jack up drilling rig was also examined by elastic fe computation wang et al 2017a and mitigation techniques such as inverse distortion welding sequence optimization and mechanical constraint were practiced to ensure dimensional accuracy from the above mentioned literatures welding distortion investigation of large scale welded structures were already achieved with advanced computational approach however welding distortion prediction and mitigation in the fabrication of ultra large container with much more complex structure and strict requirement of dimensional precision is currently still not easy to implement during actual manufacturing two major and essential structures as watertight transverse bulkhead and torsion box structure of ultra large container with 20000teu were considered to be research object welding procedures with different welding methods and welding conditions were carried out for considered welded structure fabrication and measurements of out of plane welding distortion were also conducted with total station experimentally typical welded joints with different materials and joining forms were classified and summarized welding induced inherent deformations were evaluated based on efficient tep fe computations with ism and openmp parallel computation of all typical welded joints while integration method of welding inherent strain and inverse analysis of displacement were both employed and compared for accuracy validation for inherent deformation evaluation database of welding inherent deformation of ultra large container ship was then established and empirical formulae relating welding inherent deformations to welding heat input for different welded joints were proposed by linear regression approach for later elastic fe computation applications of welding distortion prediction by means of elastic fe computation with shell elements model and welding inherent deformation as mechanical loading were practiced for the considered welded structures not only the deformed shape but also the magnitudes of out of plane welding distortions have good agreement with comparing computed results to measurements influence of welding sequence on welding distortion mitigation was studied during the fabrication of watertight transverse bulkhead structure and design optimization of thick plate butt welded joint with x type groove was examined for welding distortion mitigation during the fabrication of torsion box structure reduction effects of out of plane welding distortion with different mitigation practices were observed and demonstrated with the employed elastic fe computation and precision fabrication of ultra large container can be achieved with the computed results and corresponding analysis 2 computational approach and method advanced computational approaches such as effective non linear tep fe computation based on openmp parallel technology and elastic fe computation based on inherent deformation were employed to investigate the dimensional precision during the fabrication of ultra large container with 20000teu the fundamental methods of above mentioned computational approaches were summarized as follows 2 1 nonlinear tep fe analysis with parallel computation in general there are two physical behaviors during welding process thermal process and elastic plastic process which will be considered with transient non linear thermal elastic plastic fe computation wang et al 2014 due to the decisive effect of thermal process on the mechanical process uncoupled thermal mechanical formulation is usually employed to examine the thermal mechanical response during welding process wang et al 2015 in which the contribution of transient temperature field to stress through linear thermal expansion as well as temperature dependent thermal physical and mechanical properties as demonstrated in fig 3 since the region away from the welding arc has weakly non linear feature only region moving together with the welding arc is considered and solved as strongly non linear problem by means of iterative substructure method wang et al 2012 moreover in order to utilize the high performance computer with multi threads to enhance the computational efficiency parallel computation with open multi processing is employed to deal with the operation of large range matrix during computational welding mechanics ma 2016 in detail heat flux matrix during thermal analysis and mechanical stiffness matrix during mechanical analysis will be divided into sub matrices and is arranged for different thread for parallel computation thus much more threads can be employed for one computation and computing time can be significantly reduced in addition an in house fortran code was programmed and compiled with intel parallel studio xe 2011 based on the platform of ubuntu 14 04 os and dell poweredge t420 server 2 2 inherent deformation and its evaluation with lots of experimental observations and thermal elastic plastic fe computations ueda et al 2012 pointed out that welding inherent strain is the main reason to generate residual stress and welding distortion welding inherent strain considered as all strain components except the elastic strain during the welding process is defined as a summation of thermal strain plastic strain creep strain and that caused by the phase transformation as given by eq 1 1 Îµ i n h e r e n t Îµ t o t a l Îµ e l a s t i c Îµ t h e r m a l Îµ p l a s t i c Îµ c r e e p Îµ p h a s e welding inherent strain has mechanical feature of welded joint which is determined by welding heat input temperature dependent material properties configuration of welded joint and regardless of length and width of welded joint among the all components of inherent strain the plastic strain is the dominant component which can be measured by experiment or evaluated by the thermal elastic plastic fe analysis theoretically welding plastic strain of examined point is determined by the maximal temperature reached at this position during welding process and the self constraint supported by the surrounding material luo et al 1997 in order to conveniently achieve industrial application inherent deformation is later proposed which bases on the assumption that a welded joint in plate structure has an inherent amount of deformation on each cross section normal to the welding line during the welding process thus inherent deformation is an integration of the inherent strain as given by eq 2 and can be evaluated by means of the integration of inherent strain on a cross section normal to the welding line wang et al 2017a 2 Î´ lo n g i t u d i n a l 1 h Îµ l o n g i t u d i n a l d y d z Î¸ l o n g i t u d i n a l 12 h 3 z h 2 Îµ l o n g i t u d i n a l d y d z Î´ t r a n s v e r s e 1 h Îµ t r a n s v e r s e d y d z Î¸ t r a n s v e r s e 12 h 3 z

and Î¸ t r a n s v e r s e mean the inherent bending deformation in the longitudinal and the transverse directions h is the thickness of the welded joint and x y z are the welding direction transverse direction and thickness direction respectively moreover the influence of the length and the width of a welded joint are small when the size of welded plate is large enough and the magnitudes of inherent deformation can be approximated to be constant values along the welding line when the end effect is ignored wang et al 2013b 2018 these constant values are applied into the elastic shell elements model as loads forces displacements and moments to predict welding distortion without accuracy loss in additional the magnitudes of inherent strains as well as inherent deformations are significantly influenced by self constraint supported by surrounding base materials wang et al 2015 therefore longitudinal inherent shrinkage can be converted to tendon force as a result of the strong self constraint in longitudinal direction which is much more rational to represent the actual mechanical behavior of longitudinal welding distortion due to the weak self constraint in transverse direction the transverse inherent shrinkage and bending moment can be evaluated directly by welding displacement and the longitudinal bending moment is usually neglected because of its much smaller magnitude 2 3 elastic fe analysis with interface element when the welding inherent deformations considered as mechanical response of welded joint were evaluated elastic fe analysis with shell elements model can be employed for welding distortion prediction during the fabrication of large scale welded structure such as ship and naval architecture wang et al 2015 however the fitting procedure and tack welding also influence the welding distortion and final dimensional precision in actual manufacturing since all pieces and components of large scale welded structure are assembled sequentially by welding it is inevitable to generate intermediate welding distortion and geometrical errors comparing to designed dimensions thus interface element was proposed to consider the influence of fitting procedure on the final dimensional precision which is non linear spring element and arranged between the plates to be welded the evolution of mechanical interaction between parts to be assembled from free to fitting tack welding and fully welded states then can be considered and examined murakawa et al 2009 in detail opening in transverse direction as well as misalignments in longitudinal or thickness direction should be corrected with fitting procedure before full welding when the gap or the misalignment between two parts to be welded exceeds the tolerable limitation 3 examined structures and welding experiment the watertight transverse bulkhead structure which is important for teu delivery and fixation is usually assembled by angle steel stiffener frame girders and slideway structures the examined structure as shown in fig 4 is a typical watertight transverse bulkhead structure of ultra large container ship with 20 000teu which is 29 79m in length 16 50m in width and 1 95m in height in detail this examined structure is a two layer stiffened structure bulkhead structure was joined by 11 rectangle steel plates 38 angle steel structures and 17 frame girders was then welded to bulkhead structure with fillet welding along the length direction 24 stiffeners were also welded to bulkhead structure with fillet welding along the width direction additionally some stiffeners and frame girders were designed with hole for piping due to the complicated welding procedure of different thickness plates welding distortion will be generated obviously which will influence the dimensional precision and subsequent fitting procedure with other block from the measurement out of plane welding distortion has a large magnitude with almost 20 mm meanwhile torsion box structure as shown in fig 5 is totally two layers structure which has 18 50m in length 7 31m in width and 3 50m in height there are lots of longitudinal and transverse stiffeners as support component in the center region and thick plates with 60 85 mm were applied for hatch coaming structure in addition 2 skin plates as outside and inside bulkheads are assembled by four rectangular plates with different thicknesses and six longitudinal stiffeners with continuous geometry are welded to skin plates in transverse direction there are five frame girders which are all perforated to ensure continuity of longitudinal stiffener and reduce the weight with rectangular form in addition deck is fabricated by 3 thick plates with 85 mm thickness and joined to skin plates by 4 longitudinal and continuous stiffeners with large size based on the diversity of welding condition material plate thickness and welded joint form table 1 and table 2 summarized the typical butt and fillet welded joints in both watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure of examined ultra large container with 20000teu in addition fys means y type groove with fcb flux copper backing welding axs means x type groove with double sides gmaw gas metal arc welding or saw submerged arc welding covn means v type groove with gmaw gas metal arc welding ai means i type groove with double sides saw submerged arc welding for fillet welded joint fp means welded joint with full penetration pp means partial penetration of web plate meanwhile welding conditions of fcaw flux cored arc welding and saw submerged arc welding during ship structure fabrication were also summarized as listed in tables 3 and 4 respectively where different welding processes such as root welding fill welding and cap welding were individually carried out with corresponding welding conditions during the fabrication of watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure out of plane welding distortion was also measured with total station as shown in fig 6 in shipyard which will be applied to validate the accuracy of computed results later 4 establishment of inherent deformation database for the large and complex welded structure it is challenge to predict the welding distortion with conventional thermal elastic plastic fe computation because of large consumption of computer resource and computing time wang et al 2015 elastic fe computation with welding inherent deformation is an ideal and practical numerical approach for welding mechanical response investigation in advance magnitude of welding inherent deformation is desired for elastic fe analysis there are generally two methods for inherent deformation evaluation one is inverse analysis with measurement of welding distortion liang and murakawa 2012 the other is integration method with computed inherent strain which is based on the definition of inherent deformation wang et al 2015 2017a based on tables 1 and 2 typical welded joints with different joint forming material and plate thickness were created with solid elements model then fast thermal elastic plastic fe computation was employed to investigate the thermal and mechanical responses during the multi pass welding procedure for each typical welded joints with computed results welding inherent deformations were evaluated by inverse method with computed welding distortion and integration method with computed plastic strain respectively the accuracy was also validated by comparing computed result of elastic fe analysis with welding inherent deformation as input loading to thermal elastic plastic fe analysis 4 1 solid elements model of welded joints as mentioned above welding inherent deformation can be employed for welding distortion prediction of large ship structure with elastic fe computation thus welding inherent deformation should be evaluated beforehand and integration method with computed inherent strain is selected while thermal elastic plastic fe computation for typical welded joints will be carried out later in order to clarify the difference of typical welded joints there are six welded joints with solid elements model to be introduced and considered for welding inherent deformation evaluation in detail 1 fig 7 shows welded joint fys 16 16 which is y type groove with fcb welding and plate thicknesses are both 16 mm 2 fig 8 shows ai 14 22 which is i type groove with double sides saw and different plate thicknesses are 14 mm and 22 mm respectively 3 fig 9 shows axs 85 85 which is x type groove with double sides gmaw or saw and plate thicknesses are both 85 mm 4 fig 10 shows covn 14 14 which is v type groove with gmaw and plate thicknesses are both 14 mm 5 fig 11 shows fp 22 16 which is full penetration joint with single side gmaw and web thicknesses is 22 mm and flange thickness is 16 mm 6 fig 12 shows c 85 85 which is partial penetration joint with double side gmaw and flange and web thicknesses are both 85 mm 4 2 fast tep fe computation with the in house code which was programmed and implemented depending on theorem of heating conduction elastic plastic mechanics and finite element method thermal analysis was carried out to represent the transient temperature distribution during welding process and predict the shape of welded pool for above mentioned 6 welded joints as illustrated from figss 7 12 in addition dummy element technology was employed to consider the un welded pass for multi pass welding procedure body heat source with uniform power density q w m3 welding arc energy volume was applied to model the welding arc moreover heat losses as well as surface heat flux due to thermal convection and radiation were also taken into account with a combined convection and radiation boundary flux q w m2 as given by eq 3 on all external surfaces ma et al 2016 3 q q c q r h t t r o o m Îµ c t 273 4 t r o o m 273 4 h Îµ c t 273 2 t r o o m 273 2 t 273 t r o

for ideal radiator c is the stefan boltzmann constant also h t means the combined convection and radiation boundary flux coefficient which value is fixed to be 5 7 10 6 w oc m2 regardless of temperature variation during fe computation t t room is elevated temperature magnitude then transient temperature distributions were considered as input thermal loading to investigate mechanical response as welding distortion plastic strain and others while rigid body motion is fixed to be mechanical boundary condition as illustrated from figss 7 12 fig 13 shows the temperature dependent thermal and mechanical material properties of ah32 fig 14 shows the computed transient temperature distribution of cap welding and shape profile of welded pool while the region with temperature above steel molten point is close to the welded groove meanwhile fig 15 illustrates the predicted out of plane welding distortion after welding of fys 16 16 welded joint in which the deformed rate is 5 as well as the deformed shape is amplified with 5 times for clear observation and analysis of deformed tendency during post process of welding computation in addition distribution of transverse plastic strain after welding of fys 16 16 welded joint is shown in fig 16 for the other typical welded joints mentioned above temperature field out of plane welding distortion and residual plastic strain were also examined with thermal mechanical coupling computational approach computed results were illustrated in fig 17 for ai 14 22 fig 18 for axs 85 85 fig 19 for covn 14 14 fig 20 for fp 22 16 and fig 21 for c 85 85 in which transient temperature distribution shape of welded pool out of plane welding distortion and transverse plastic strain can be all observed during the thermal elastic plastic fe analysis for multi pass welded joint parallel computation with openmp technology was employed to enhance the computational efficiency and less computational time was consumed obviously in addition the computing times of thermal elastic plastic fe computation for each typical welded joint were summarized in table 5 when parallel computation technology with openmp was employed computing time of axs 85 85 6 55 h is reduced to be 30 of computing time of covn 14 14 23 08 h while axs 85 85 has much more nodes and elements than that of covn 14 14 even axs 85 85 has three times of welding passes comparing with covn 14 14 in particular computation of c 85 85 with 50 welding passes can be achieved with 17 22 h with openmp which can be accepted for engineering application 4 3 inherent deformation evaluation and its validation as mentioned above there are two methods to evaluate the welding inherent deformation of examined welded joints one is inverse analysis with welding distortion liang and murakawa 2012 the other is integration method with residual plastic strain based on definition of welding inherent deformation wang et al 2015 2017a later two methods are both employed to evaluate welding inherent deformations of butt and fillet welded joints and elastic fe analysis with evaluated welding inherent deformation was carried out to predict welding distortion results of elastic fe analysis with evaluated welding inherent deformation was then compared with computed results of thermal elastic plastic fe computation to confirm the precision of evaluated inherent deformation with different methods in particular longitudinal inherent shrinkage is usually converted to longitudinal shrinkage force tendon force as given in eq 4 during the elastic fe analysis due to strong self constraint and un uniform distribution of shrinkage in longitudinal direction wang et al 2017b zhou and wang 2019 table 6 and table 7 summarized the evaluated welding inherent deformations with both inverse analysis and integration method for butt and fillet welded joints respectively 4 f l o n g i t u d i n a l Îµ l o n g i t u d i n a l p l a s t i c e d a e Îµ l

validate the accuracy of evaluated inherent deformations with inverse analysis and integration method butt welded joint of ai 10 14 was modeled with solid elements and shell elements as show in fig 22 a and fig 23 a respectively from the plotting contour of out of plane welding distortion as shown in figs 22 b fig 23 b and fig 23 c deformed tendency are almost the identical with each other considering the points on line 1 as indicated in fig 23 a the magnitudes of out of plane welding distortions were compared as shown in fig 24 it can be seen that computed out of plane welding distortion by means of elastic fe computation with welding inherent deformation evaluated by inverse analysis has a good agreement to that of tep fe computation 4 3 2 validation for fillet welded joint fillet welded joint as typical welding in shipbuilding was also examined for welding inherent deformation validation as shown in fig 25 a and fig 26 a solid elements and shell elements models were employed for tep and elastic fe computations computed out of plane welding distortions have similar deformed tendency as indicated in figs 25 b fig 26 b and fig 26 c for fillet welding both flange and web have bending deformation therefore points on line 1 of flange edge an points on line 2 of web top edge as indicated in fig 26 were selected for welding inherent deformation validation as shown in fig 27 bending deformations of points on line 1 as indicated in fig 26 have consistent feature with each other however a little bit difference of bending deformations of points on line 2 computed by tep and elastic fe computations can be also observed from the above comparisons inherent deformations evaluated by inverse analysis may be better choice for typical welding joints in shipbuilding 4 4 database and empirical formulae of inherent deformation in general longitudinal bending is ignored due to its less magnitude welding inherent deformations are dominantly determined by welding heat input when the welded joint and material properties are both fixed in order to avoid the influence of plate thickness inherent deformations are uniformly considered regardless of plate thickness and then converted to tendon force and parameters for all examined welded joints which are calculated by multiplication with thickness then evaluated welding inherent deformations for sequential elastic fe analysis were summarized in table 8 for butt welded joints and table 9 for fillet welded joints based on database as summarized in tables 8 and 9 welding inherent deformations of other welded joints in the examined ship structure also can be obtained without lots of tep fe computation to decrease complexity of fe analysis moreover linear regression approach was employed as shown in fig 28 to establish the relationships between inherent deformation parameters and welding heat input and these formulae were obtained as listed in table 10 5 prediction and validation of out of plane welding distortion with the welding inherent deformation as loading for mechanical response of welded joints elastic fe computation can be carried out to efficiently predict welding distortion without precision loss which is considered as a practical engineering tool for precision fabrication of large ship structures 5 1 watertight transverse bulkhead structure as shown in fig 29 geometrical model of examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure was introduced in which the plate stiffeners l section steel and even opening hole for pipeline system continuous in plate stiffeners are all considered in addition dimensional size of skin plate l section steel plate stiffeners and their spacing distances are also illustrated in fig 29 with shell elements identical dimensions as mentioned above were utilized and the plate thicknesses are also identical to the actual ship structure fe mesh model was then created as shown in fig 30 the total number of nodes and elements are 10 631 and 10 478 respectively the total number of parts is 92 which are distinguished with different colors as indicated in fig 30 the welding lines exist between the adjacent parts with different color and then were used to load welding inherent deformations for elastic fe computation considering the rigidity of section steel and plate stiffener boundary condition as indicated in fig 30 was employed to prevent rigid body motion points on line1 4 with different colors were marked in fig 30 to validate magnitude of computed welding distortions comparing to measurement later comparing to in plane shrinkage distortion out of plane welding distortion has much more significant influence on the dimensional precision of ship structure as shown in fig 31 distribution of computed out of plane welding distortion was illustrated while deformed shape with overall middle hogging was observed and maximal magnitude about 20 87 mm appears in the center region this kind of welding distortion may result from the different plate thickness density of welding line and corresponding welding heat inputs as mentioned above points on line 1 and line2 as indicated in fig 30 were selected to validate the accuracy of computed out of plane welding distortion fig 32 shows the comparison of points on line 1 and line 2 between computed out of plane welding distortions and experimental results not only the tendency but also the magnitude of welding distortion has good agreement with each other while their distributions can be understood due to structural feature and corresponding welding heat input 5 2 torsion box structure since fe mesh will influence the computed accuracy and computer consumption ship structure modeling as engineering application should ensure the identical geometrical profile and utilize fine mesh for the region near the welding line according to the actual torsion box structure fig 33 gives the geometrical dimension and 60 parts are marked with different colors fe mesh with shell elements is illustrated in fig 34 in which the number of nodes and elements are 10 554 and 8 741 respectively in addition welding lines are automatically generated between the adjacent parts with different colors boundary condition considering structural stiffness was employed to prevent rigid body motion as also shown in fig 34 line 1 to line 4 were also marked and selected for computed accuracy validation by comparing predicted out of plane welding distortion to measurements fig 35 shows plotting contour of computed out of plane welding distortion with five times deformed rate it can be seen that minimal out of plane welding distortion with 7 00 mm magnitude appears in the middle region due to the angular distortion of thick plates welding with 85 mm and 60 mm in thickness due to the weak stiffness maximal out of plane welding distortion with magnitude of 9 68 mm was generated at the edge region in order to exactly compare the computed results welding distortion of points on line1 and line2 as indicated in fig 34 was picked up and compared with measurement as shown in fig 36 good agreement can be obviously observed not only for deformed tendency but also for magnitudes 6 influence of welding sequence on precision fabrication for complicated welded structure with lots of parts the final dimensional precision was determined not only by mechanical response of welded joints but also by welding sequence and fitting configuration the application of welding sequence influence was practiced in fabrication of watertight transverse bulkhead structure by elastic fe computation for actual fabrication in shipbuilding ship block such as examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure of ultra large container was assembled sequentially through steel pieces parts and segments welding distortion during steel pieces joining can be reduced significantly with lots of mitigation practices and then dimensional precision of segments can be guaranteed however the welding distortion in the fabrication of segments to be block may be difficult to control due to the large structure stiffness of assembled segments watertight transverse bulkhead structure was selected to examine the influence of segments welding sequence on dimensional precision as shown in fig 37 watertight transverse bulkhead structure was assembled by two segments tb11a and tb11b in conventional fabrication in addition tb11a and tb11b were fabricated separately and then were assembled together due to the high productivity however the tb11b segment is too huge to control and reduce the welding distortion during its fabrication and it will influence the fitting precision and final dimensional quality when tb11b is assembled with tb11a segment it is better to separate the examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure to be five segments for fabrication as shown in fig 38 considering the structural continuity with the proposed fabrication plan welding distortion not only during each segment joining but also during segments assemble together can be easily reduced with a little bit longer working hours moreover the requirement of lifting capacity can be reduced and coefficient of utilization of workshop even shipway can be obviously improved in detail the weight of segment of tb11b structure in conventional fabrication plan is about 71 190 kg among all segments in proposed fabrication plan the largest segment is 3rd structure and its weight is reduced by 43 7 to be 40 081 kg which is convenient for utilization of lifting equipment the segments its parts and weights of conventional and proposed fabrication plans were summarized as listed in table 11 due to the proposed segments of examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure as listed in table 11 the influence of segments welding sequence on overall out of plane welding distortion was then examined as summarized in table 11 four different welding sequences of sequential assembly were considered which are conventional welding sequential welding symmetrical welding and intermittent welding in addition conventional welding means two segments so called tb11a and tb11b as shown in fig 37 were directly welded together moreover there are five components of examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure as indicated in fig 38 which are called s1 s5 sequential welding means that s1 is welded with s2 s2 then is welded with s3 and s3 is welded with s4 eventually s4 is welded with s5 symmetrical welding means s1 and s2 is welded simultaneously with that s4 and s5 is welded together then s4 and s2 are welded with s3 at the same time intermittent welding means that s1 is welded with s2 and s3 is then welded with s4 later s2 is welded with s3 and s4 is welded with s5 the overall maximal out of plane welding distortion were also summarized in table 12 with different welding sequences out of plane welding distortions of points on line 3 and line 4 as indicated in fig 30 were illustrated in fig 39 it can be seen that out of plane welding distortion can be significantly reduced with proposed fabrication plan however their distributions can not be easily compared to analyze which welding sequence is the optimal case quantitatively therefore relative deflection was presented which is defined with eq 5 as follows 5 r e l a t i v e d e f l e c t i o n i 1 p o int n o d e f l e c t i o n i in addition relative deflections of points on line1 and line2 as indicated in fig 30 were also summarized in table 12 among the considered welding sequences it can be concluded that the best welding sequence to reduce out of plane welding distortion of examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure is symmetrical welding from center to edge which can be clarified with stiffness prior theory spt total relative deflection by symmetrical welding from center to edge is about 1096 49 mm which is reduced about 40 from 1842 98 mm by conventional welding and its maximal out of plane welding distortion is about 17 43 mm which is reduced about 20 from 20 87 mm 7 x groove optimization of butt welded joint with thick plates currently in shipbuilding there are two practical techniques for out of plane welding distortion mitigation during the butt welding of thick plates with x type groove symmetrical welding and inverse deformation application c wang et al 2019 however they both have engineering limitation in detail symmetrical welding requires the frequent turnover of welded joint during assemble procedure which will significantly reduce the fabrication efficiency require much more equipment and even improve the probability of safety accident inverse deformation application can ensure the welding productivity without many turnover of welded joint but magnitudes of inverse deformations are not easy to obtain which requires lots of experimental measurements or tep fe computations due to their dependence on material properties and plate thickness moreover mould weight may require to support mechanical constrain during the inverse deformation application therefore design optimization of welding groove with x type was proposed and examined in addition out of plane welding distortion generated by upper welding can be reduced by lower welding in the butt welding of thick plates with asymmetrical groove which has the advantages of high productivity less out of plane welding distortion comparing with the current mitigation practices actually symmetrical groove design for butt welding with thick plates as shown in fig 40 was employed while the groove angle is about 32 gap is about 8 mm and the length of truncated edge is about 3 mm with experimental measurement out of plane welding distortion using above mentioned groove design will extend the fabrication tolerance while the upper welding passes were finished and then turnover the welding joint once for lower welding passes the underlying mechanism is that almost same transverse plastic strains were generated during both upper and lower welding however bending moment caused by transverse plastic strains and structural stiffness were altered during the entire welding procedure with wire fusion and filling asymmetrical x groove can provide a particular depth ratio of upper and lower welding passes defined by eq 6 to mitigate out of plane welding distortion with only once turnover moreover that the groove angle will not be less than 32 due to actual welding procedure should be guaranteed 6 d e p t h r a t i o h 1 d e p t h o f u p p e r w e l d i n g h 2 d e p t h o f l o w e r w e l d i n g taking the butt welding of thick plate with 60 mm in thickness as example fig 41 shows the solid elements model and a series of tep fe computations were carried out to optimize the asymmetrical groove design with less out of plane welding distortion in detail the considered solid elements model is 300 mm in length 300 mm in width and 60 mm in thickness the total number of elements and points are 27 360 and 29 264 respectively in order to improve the computational efficiency an in house code for auto bead technique abt was proposed c wang et al 2019 and employed to confirm the number and position of welding pass for asymmetrical groove design with different depth ratio while the cross sectional area of each welding pass will be identical due to the same welding condition in detail one solid elements model is required in which fine mesh was created near the welding region and coarse mesh can be used for the region far away welding pass geometrical feature of welding pass can be described by origin coordinate as well as width depth and height of heated region with a double ellipsoid model goldak et al 1986 then groove design can be subsequently modified according to the welding pass arrangement as illustrated in fig 42 at first the case that depth of upper welding groove h1 equals to depth of lower welding groove h2 as well as that depth ratio is one was examined according to the saw welding condition as summarized in table 4 and its corresponding deposition amount arrangement of welding pass for butt welding with 60 mm thick pates was designed as shown in fig 41 essentially welding pass in lower groove will start when all welding passes in upper groove are finished and welded joint was already turnover with the in house tep fe programming thermal analysis was carried out and then its computed temperature profile was applied as thermal loading to examine the mechanical response distribution of maximal temperature as well as geometrical profile of molten pool was illustrated in fig 43 in addition plotting contour of final out of plane welding distortion in the view of cross section was drawn in fig 43 it can be seen that predicted geometrical profile of welding molten pool is agree with the dimension of designed groove and out of plane welding distortion with about 4 5 mm magnitude was observed which is not easy to mitigate therefore it can be inferred that current welding groove when depth ratio is one is not appropriate to reduce out of plane welding distortion as mentioned above bending moment caused by welding plastic strain in transverse direction and structural stiffness due to filler deposition will both developed during entire welding procedure which will together determine the eventual out of plane welding distortion moreover a series of tep fe computations with different depth ratios were carried out then distribution of maximal temperature and plotting contour of out of plane welding distortion were demonstrated in fig 44 in which squeeze theorem for domain approximation was employed and implemented as illustrated in fig 45 in addition if the welded joint bends downward with negative magnitude of out of plane welding distortion the depth of lower groove should be increase otherwise the depth of lower groove should be decrease with upward bending deformation in detail table 13 summarized the computed results with different depth ratio such as temperature profile number of welding pass maximal deflection and flatness of top surface when the depth ratio is 1 1 9 computed temperature profile and out of plane welding distortion were illustrated in fig 46 in addition there are 5 and 8 welding passes for upper and lower groove respectively it can be seen that the final out of plane welding distortions are reduced to be less than 1 0 mm due to the effect of transverse plastic strain generated by lower welding not only magnitude of out of plane welding distortion but also flatness of top surface are employed to evaluate the welding groove as summarized in table 13 flatness of top surface can be understood with the value of welding angle respected to the initial configuration as well as welding inherent transverse bending moreover the points on cross sectional line of bottom surface are examined and fig 47 shows the comparison of the out of plane welding distortions with different depth ratios obviously it can be seen that less magnitude of out of plane welding distortion was generated when depth ratio is 1 1 9 comparing to that with other depth ratios in detail large magnitude of out of plane welding distortion was generated by upper welding with current groove design and which can not be completely reduced by lower welding and its generated bending moment due to the strong structural stiffness point of truncated edge was also examined comparing the welding procedure of current groove design with that of optimized groove fig 48 shows the evolution of out of plane welding distortion of examined point with different groove design in addition out of plane welding distortion can be well controlled with optimized groove design as shown in fig 48 then the above tep fe computational analysis was carried out to examine groove optimization for butt welding with different plate thicknesses as a result table 14 summarized the optimized depth ratios for plate thicknesses with 40 mm 50 mm 60 mm 65 mm 70 mm 85 mm which all utilize the identical welded joint type as shown in fig 40 based on the results summarized in table 14 the relation between optimized depth ratio and plate thickness can be evaluated with regression analysis as shown in fig 49 non linear numerical fitting with boltzmann function can be employed welding joint with less and larger thicknesses has almost constant depth ratio of optimized groove which can be clarified as the balance of welding bending moment and structural stiffness with this empirical formula depth ratio of optimized groove for other thickness can be conveniently obtained to mitigate the out of plane welding distortion which will improve investigation efficiency without numerous consumption of computer resource from the database of welding inherent deformation of butt welding as summarized in tables 8 and 10 welding groove of thick plate 40 85 mm can be optimized with less out of plane welding distortion and the corresponding transverse bending will also be reduced applying the latest welding inherent deformations as loading to be shell elements model of examined torsion box structure elastic fe analysis was carried out to predict fabrication precision and plotting contour of out of plane welding distortion was obtained as shown in fig 50 comparing with the computed result as shown in fig 35 magnitude of maximal out of plane welding distortion was reduced by about 28 from 16 68 mm to 12 03 mm moreover points on line 3 and line 4 as indicated in fig 34 are examined and their out of plane welding distortion with current and optimized groove designs were compared as demonstrated in fig 51 in addition magnitudes of out of plane welding distortions are significantly reduced when the optimized groove design is employed 8 conclusions with above investigation on watertight transverse bulkhead and torsion box structures of ultra large container ship welding distortion prediction and mitigation were demonstrated in general typical welded joints with different plate thickness material property and joining form were classified and examined with corresponding welding heat input by highly effective fe tep computation then welding inherent deformations were evaluated and validated for database establishment which were applied as mechanical load for fabrication precision investigation by means of elastic fe analysis good agreement of welding deflection between computed result and measurement can be obtained moreover influences of welding sequence and groove design on out of plane welding distortion were numerically considered significant mitigation effect can be observed comparing the result to that with actual fabrication procedure the following conclusions also can be drawn 1 iterative substructure method and openmp computation were employed to enhance the computational efficiency during transient non linear tep fe analysis of typical welded joints 2 integration method with inherent deformation and inverse analysis with welding displacement were both proposed and employed for welding inherent deformation evaluation while their accuracy was validated by elastic fe analysis with shell elements model for database establishment in later engineering application 3 elastic fe analysis of examined ship structures was carried out for welding distortion prediction with less computer consumption in which welding inherent deformation was applied as mechanical load good agreements between computed results and measurements were obtained 4 for examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure welding sequence of five individual segments was numerically examined symmetrical welding from center to edge can significantly reduce welding distortion comparing with conventional welding procedure maximal deflection and total relative deflection were reduced about 20 and 40 respectively due to the structural stiffness reinforcement with proposed welding sequence 5 welding groove optimization with asymmetrical feature of butt welding thick plate 40 85 mm was considered for fabrication precision controlling of examined torsion box structure which has advantage of high productivity and low cost optimized groove depth ratios of different plate thickness with above highly effective tep fe computation were calculated and corresponding welding inherent deformations were obtained for elastic fe analysis out of plane welding distortion can be significantly reduced by about 28 with the optimized groove design for butt welding thick plate credit authorship contribution statement jiangchao wang

22047,ultra large container ship as an essential role during international trade is required for precision fabrication due to highly efficient teu loading and unloading in this study two major structures so called watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure of ultra large container with 20000teu were examined for out of plane welding distortion prediction and mitigation with measurement and computational analysis based on the welding inherent deformation theory typical welded joints of two major structures were systematically classified with the different material thickness welding condition and joining form and the relationships between welding heat input and inherent deformations were also presented elastic fe analysis with shell elements model and welding inherent deformation as input loading was employed for welding distortion prediction not only the distributions but also the magnitudes of predicted out of plane welding distortions of considered major structures have a good agreement comparing to the measurements furthermore welding sequence influence was considered for dimensional precision controlling during the watertight transverse bulkhead structure fabrication and welding groove optimization of thick plate was examined for out of plane welding distortion mitigation during the torsion box structure fabrication computational results show that welding distortions of both ship block structures can be significantly reduced for requirement of fabrication precision keywords ultra large container out of plane welding distortion precision fabrication welding inherent deformation elastic fe analysis welding sequence optimization of groove design 1 introduction with the fast increasing of international trade the container vessel in particular ultra large container ship was eagerly required due to its advantages such as efficiency convenience safety and so on ultra large container ship with 20 000teu as shown in fig 1 is stepwise becoming the dominant type comparing to that with less carrying capacity generally ultra large container ship is assembled with lots of panel block and curved section and there are two major structures watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure as shown in fig 2 due to the mechanical performance consideration and teu loading unloading efficiency panel blocks with watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure were required to precision fabrication with much less out of plane welding distortion moreover different plate thicknesses and materials as well as partial penetration welded joint were employed to reduce fabrication cost and schedule those applications during the actual fabrication of examined panel blocks cause the investigation complexity for accurately predicting and obviously mitigating out of plane welding distortion therefore both advanced and efficient computational approach for welding distortion prediction and mitigation of fabrication precision of large complex ship panel blocks are indeed desired during modern shipbuilding in addition for the welding distortion investigation during the fabrication of ultra large container ship it is better to predict the distribution and magnitude of out of plane welding distortion with advanced computational approach then consider the generation mechanism and propose the advanced techniques for welding distortion correction in actual manufacturing of shipbuilding according to rapid development of computational approach in particular the finite element method thermal elastic plastic fe computation was widely accepted and employed to solve welding distortion problem but only for welded joint and simple welded structures due to its large consumption of computer memory and computing time elastic fe analysis with shell elements model is an ideal and practical computational approach for prediction and mitigation of welding distortion during the fabrication of ship structures brown and song brown and song 1992 employed solid shell elements finite model of a circular cylinder and a ring stiffened structure to investigate the effect of welding configurations such as weld gap clearance and fixture on the dimensional precision of considered large structure later michaleris and debiccari 1997 presented a numerical analysis combining 2d welding computation with 3d structural analyses which is effective when the computer resources are limited jung and tsai 2003 examined the relationship between cumulative plastic strains and welding distortion in advance and then mapped each cumulative plastic strain component evaluated by thermal elastic plastic analysis incorporating the effects of moving heat and non linear material properties into elastic fe analysis using equivalent thermal strains jung 2007 also predicted the welding distortion in the fabrication of ship panels by means of elastic fe analysis with shell elements model in which only longitudinal and transverse plastic strains were employed to compute the welding distortion and good agreement was observed comparing with results of thermal elastic plastic fe analysis zhang et al 2007 evaluated six components of plastic strain of each welding pass with thermal elastic plastic fe analysis while moving heat source and solid elements model with shorter length are employed and then these plastic strain components were mapped to shell elements mode of actual welded structure for welding distortion prediction yang et al 2011 developed a stepwise computational approach to predict welding distortion of large welded structure for computational efficiency promotion the lump pass modeling of welded joints with thermal mechanical analysis is carried out to obtain plastic strain and then welding distortion prediction is achieved by means of mapping plastic strains evaluated beforehand into the shell elements model of actual welded structure since elastic fe computation with shell element models based on inherent strain deformation has high computational efficiency and accurate computed result it is usually employed and applied for welding distortion investigation during ship structure fabrication luo et al 1997 pointed out that welding inherent strain is dominantly determined by the highest temperature reached during thermal cycles and the self constraint supported by surrounding materials and then an elastic fe analysis is carried out to predict the welding distortion with the inherent strain as loading wang et al wang and luo 2000 established the relationship between inherent strain and welding configurations of typical welded joints with experimental results and thermal elastic plastic fe computation and then inherent strains were applied as loading to predict welding distortion of large welded cylinder with multi pass welding later murakawa et al 1998 considered welding distortion as the result of elastic response of examined welded structure with inelastic strains as loads while inelastic strains are totally defined as inherent strain and can be evaluated using a limited number of typical joints moreover these evaluated inherent strains on each transverse cross section were integrated to be welding inherent deformation which is easier to store in databases for welding distortion prediction in future luo et al 1999 predicted welding distortion by elastic fe analysis using inherent deformations and tendon force which are the integrations of welding inherent strains and then validation was demonstrated through numerical examples luo at al luo et al 2004 constituted a database of welding inherent deformation by a series of thermal elastic plastic fe computations of aluminum alloy butt welded joint and elastic fe analysis base on this database was carried out to predict welding distortion of a large train coping with aluminum alloy plates deng and murakawa deng et al 2007 developed an elastic fe analysis to accurately predict welding distortion considering large deformation theory tep fe computations were carried out to evaluate inherent deformations of various types of welded joints beforehand and then elastic fe computation was employed to predict welding distortion based on evaluated inherent deformations murakawa et al 2010 summarized the concepts of inherent strain inherent stress inherent deformation and inherent force during welding distortion prediction in detail inherent strain will be conveyed to be the deformation when self restraint is weak and it will be conveyed to be the force when self restraint is strong enough as the applications of elastic fe computation for welding distortion prediction and mitigation during complex welded structure fabrication wang et al 2011 examined a spherical structure assembled with multi thin plates by elastic fe computation and computed welding distortions have good agreement with experimental measurements murakawa et al 2012 studied welding distortion during assembly process of thin plate structure with elastic fe computation while influence of assembly sequence as well as gap and misalignment on final dimensional accuracy was also investigated assembly processes such as cutting forming welding and straightening during shipbuilding were all examined during the fabrications of boxy structure ship block ship panel and super structure murakawa et al 2009 2013 while influences of gaps and misalignments during fitting procedure on dimensional accuracy were also considered in addition wang et al 2013a achieved welding distortion prediction in fabrication of hatch coaming of bulk cargo ship by elastic fe computation and welding distortion was reduced applying an improved assembly process with numerical analysis welding distortion in fabrication of cantilever beam component of jack up drilling rig was also examined by elastic fe computation wang et al 2017a and mitigation techniques such as inverse distortion welding sequence optimization and mechanical constraint were practiced to ensure dimensional accuracy from the above mentioned literatures welding distortion investigation of large scale welded structures were already achieved with advanced computational approach however welding distortion prediction and mitigation in the fabrication of ultra large container with much more complex structure and strict requirement of dimensional precision is currently still not easy to implement during actual manufacturing two major and essential structures as watertight transverse bulkhead and torsion box structure of ultra large container with 20000teu were considered to be research object welding procedures with different welding methods and welding conditions were carried out for considered welded structure fabrication and measurements of out of plane welding distortion were also conducted with total station experimentally typical welded joints with different materials and joining forms were classified and summarized welding induced inherent deformations were evaluated based on efficient tep fe computations with ism and openmp parallel computation of all typical welded joints while integration method of welding inherent strain and inverse analysis of displacement were both employed and compared for accuracy validation for inherent deformation evaluation database of welding inherent deformation of ultra large container ship was then established and empirical formulae relating welding inherent deformations to welding heat input for different welded joints were proposed by linear regression approach for later elastic fe computation applications of welding distortion prediction by means of elastic fe computation with shell elements model and welding inherent deformation as mechanical loading were practiced for the considered welded structures not only the deformed shape but also the magnitudes of out of plane welding distortions have good agreement with comparing computed results to measurements influence of welding sequence on welding distortion mitigation was studied during the fabrication of watertight transverse bulkhead structure and design optimization of thick plate butt welded joint with x type groove was examined for welding distortion mitigation during the fabrication of torsion box structure reduction effects of out of plane welding distortion with different mitigation practices were observed and demonstrated with the employed elastic fe computation and precision fabrication of ultra large container can be achieved with the computed results and corresponding analysis 2 computational approach and method advanced computational approaches such as effective non linear tep fe computation based on openmp parallel technology and elastic fe computation based on inherent deformation were employed to investigate the dimensional precision during the fabrication of ultra large container with 20000teu the fundamental methods of above mentioned computational approaches were summarized as follows 2 1 nonlinear tep fe analysis with parallel computation in general there are two physical behaviors during welding process thermal process and elastic plastic process which will be considered with transient non linear thermal elastic plastic fe computation wang et al 2014 due to the decisive effect of thermal process on the mechanical process uncoupled thermal mechanical formulation is usually employed to examine the thermal mechanical response during welding process wang et al 2015 in which the contribution of transient temperature field to stress through linear thermal expansion as well as temperature dependent thermal physical and mechanical properties as demonstrated in fig 3 since the region away from the welding arc has weakly non linear feature only region moving together with the welding arc is considered and solved as strongly non linear problem by means of iterative substructure method wang et al 2012 moreover in order to utilize the high performance computer with multi threads to enhance the computational efficiency parallel computation with open multi processing is employed to deal with the operation of large range matrix during computational welding mechanics ma 2016 in detail heat flux matrix during thermal analysis and mechanical stiffness matrix during mechanical analysis will be divided into sub matrices and is arranged for different thread for parallel computation thus much more threads can be employed for one computation and computing time can be significantly reduced in addition an in house fortran code was programmed and compiled with intel parallel studio xe 2011 based on the platform of ubuntu 14 04 os and dell poweredge t420 server 2 2 inherent deformation and its evaluation with lots of experimental observations and thermal elastic plastic fe computations ueda et al 2012 pointed out that welding inherent strain is the main reason to generate residual stress and welding distortion welding inherent strain considered as all strain components except the elastic strain during the welding process is defined as a summation of thermal strain plastic strain creep strain and that caused by the phase transformation as given by eq 1 1 Îµ i n h e r e n t Îµ t o t a l Îµ e l a s t i c Îµ t h e r m a l Îµ p l a s t i c Îµ c r e e p Îµ p h a s e welding inherent strain has mechanical feature of welded joint which is determined by welding heat input temperature dependent material properties configuration of welded joint and regardless of length and width of welded joint among the all components of inherent strain the plastic strain is the dominant component which can be measured by experiment or evaluated by the thermal elastic plastic fe analysis theoretically welding plastic strain of examined point is determined by the maximal temperature reached at this position during welding process and the self constraint supported by the surrounding material luo et al 1997 in order to conveniently achieve industrial application inherent deformation is later proposed which bases on the assumption that a welded joint in plate structure has an inherent amount of deformation on each cross section normal to the welding line during the welding process thus inherent deformation is an integration of the inherent strain as given by eq 2 and can be evaluated by means of the integration of inherent strain on a cross section normal to the welding line wang et al 2017a 2 Î´ lo n g i t u d i n a l 1 h Îµ l o n g i t u d i n a l d y d z Î¸ l o n g i t u d i n a l 12 h 3 z h 2 Îµ l o n g i t u d i n a l d y d z Î´ t r a n s v e r s e 1 h Îµ t r a n s v e r s e d y d z Î¸ t r a n s v e r s e 12 h 3 z h 2 Îµ t r a n s v e r s e d y d z where Î´ lo n g i t u d i n a l and Î´ t r a n s v e r s e are the inherent deformation in the longitudinal and the transverse directions Î¸ l o n g i t u d i n a l and Î¸ t r a n s v e r s e mean the inherent bending deformation in the longitudinal and the transverse directions h is the thickness of the welded joint and x y z are the welding direction transverse direction and thickness direction respectively moreover the influence of the length and the width of a welded joint are small when the size of welded plate is large enough and the magnitudes of inherent deformation can be approximated to be constant values along the welding line when the end effect is ignored wang et al 2013b 2018 these constant values are applied into the elastic shell elements model as loads forces displacements and moments to predict welding distortion without accuracy loss in additional the magnitudes of inherent strains as well as inherent deformations are significantly influenced by self constraint supported by surrounding base materials wang et al 2015 therefore longitudinal inherent shrinkage can be converted to tendon force as a result of the strong self constraint in longitudinal direction which is much more rational to represent the actual mechanical behavior of longitudinal welding distortion due to the weak self constraint in transverse direction the transverse inherent shrinkage and bending moment can be evaluated directly by welding displacement and the longitudinal bending moment is usually neglected because of its much smaller magnitude 2 3 elastic fe analysis with interface element when the welding inherent deformations considered as mechanical response of welded joint were evaluated elastic fe analysis with shell elements model can be employed for welding distortion prediction during the fabrication of large scale welded structure such as ship and naval architecture wang et al 2015 however the fitting procedure and tack welding also influence the welding distortion and final dimensional precision in actual manufacturing since all pieces and components of large scale welded structure are assembled sequentially by welding it is inevitable to generate intermediate welding distortion and geometrical errors comparing to designed dimensions thus interface element was proposed to consider the influence of fitting procedure on the final dimensional precision which is non linear spring element and arranged between the plates to be welded the evolution of mechanical interaction between parts to be assembled from free to fitting tack welding and fully welded states then can be considered and examined murakawa et al 2009 in detail opening in transverse direction as well as misalignments in longitudinal or thickness direction should be corrected with fitting procedure before full welding when the gap or the misalignment between two parts to be welded exceeds the tolerable limitation 3 examined structures and welding experiment the watertight transverse bulkhead structure which is important for teu delivery and fixation is usually assembled by angle steel stiffener frame girders and slideway structures the examined structure as shown in fig 4 is a typical watertight transverse bulkhead structure of ultra large container ship with 20 000teu which is 29 79m in length 16 50m in width and 1 95m in height in detail this examined structure is a two layer stiffened structure bulkhead structure was joined by 11 rectangle steel plates 38 angle steel structures and 17 frame girders was then welded to bulkhead structure with fillet welding along the length direction 24 stiffeners were also welded to bulkhead structure with fillet welding along the width direction additionally some stiffeners and frame girders were designed with hole for piping due to the complicated welding procedure of different thickness plates welding distortion will be generated obviously which will influence the dimensional precision and subsequent fitting procedure with other block from the measurement out of plane welding distortion has a large magnitude with almost 20 mm meanwhile torsion box structure as shown in fig 5 is totally two layers structure which has 18 50m in length 7 31m in width and 3 50m in height there are lots of longitudinal and transverse stiffeners as support component in the center region and thick plates with 60 85 mm were applied for hatch coaming structure in addition 2 skin plates as outside and inside bulkheads are assembled by four rectangular plates with different thicknesses and six longitudinal stiffeners with continuous geometry are welded to skin plates in transverse direction there are five frame girders which are all perforated to ensure continuity of longitudinal stiffener and reduce the weight with rectangular form in addition deck is fabricated by 3 thick plates with 85 mm thickness and joined to skin plates by 4 longitudinal and continuous stiffeners with large size based on the diversity of welding condition material plate thickness and welded joint form table 1 and table 2 summarized the typical butt and fillet welded joints in both watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure of examined ultra large container with 20000teu in addition fys means y type groove with fcb flux copper backing welding axs means x type groove with double sides gmaw gas metal arc welding or saw submerged arc welding covn means v type groove with gmaw gas metal arc welding ai means i type groove with double sides saw submerged arc welding for fillet welded joint fp means welded joint with full penetration pp means partial penetration of web plate meanwhile welding conditions of fcaw flux cored arc welding and saw submerged arc welding during ship structure fabrication were also summarized as listed in tables 3 and 4 respectively where different welding processes such as root welding fill welding and cap welding were individually carried out with corresponding welding conditions during the fabrication of watertight transverse bulkhead structure and torsion box structure out of plane welding distortion was also measured with total station as shown in fig 6 in shipyard which will be applied to validate the accuracy of computed results later 4 establishment of inherent deformation database for the large and complex welded structure it is challenge to predict the welding distortion with conventional thermal elastic plastic fe computation because of large consumption of computer resource and computing time wang et al 2015 elastic fe computation with welding inherent deformation is an ideal and practical numerical approach for welding mechanical response investigation in advance magnitude of welding inherent deformation is desired for elastic fe analysis there are generally two methods for inherent deformation evaluation one is inverse analysis with measurement of welding distortion liang and murakawa 2012 the other is integration method with computed inherent strain which is based on the definition of inherent deformation wang et al 2015 2017a based on tables 1 and 2 typical welded joints with different joint forming material and plate thickness were created with solid elements model then fast thermal elastic plastic fe computation was employed to investigate the thermal and mechanical responses during the multi pass welding procedure for each typical welded joints with computed results welding inherent deformations were evaluated by inverse method with computed welding distortion and integration method with computed plastic strain respectively the accuracy was also validated by comparing computed result of elastic fe analysis with welding inherent deformation as input loading to thermal elastic plastic fe analysis 4 1 solid elements model of welded joints as mentioned above welding inherent deformation can be employed for welding distortion prediction of large ship structure with elastic fe computation thus welding inherent deformation should be evaluated beforehand and integration method with computed inherent strain is selected while thermal elastic plastic fe computation for typical welded joints will be carried out later in order to clarify the difference of typical welded joints there are six welded joints with solid elements model to be introduced and considered for welding inherent deformation evaluation in detail 1 fig 7 shows welded joint fys 16 16 which is y type groove with fcb welding and plate thicknesses are both 16 mm 2 fig 8 shows ai 14 22 which is i type groove with double sides saw and different plate thicknesses are 14 mm and 22 mm respectively 3 fig 9 shows axs 85 85 which is x type groove with double sides gmaw or saw and plate thicknesses are both 85 mm 4 fig 10 shows covn 14 14 which is v type groove with gmaw and plate thicknesses are both 14 mm 5 fig 11 shows fp 22 16 which is full penetration joint with single side gmaw and web thicknesses is 22 mm and flange thickness is 16 mm 6 fig 12 shows c 85 85 which is partial penetration joint with double side gmaw and flange and web thicknesses are both 85 mm 4 2 fast tep fe computation with the in house code which was programmed and implemented depending on theorem of heating conduction elastic plastic mechanics and finite element method thermal analysis was carried out to represent the transient temperature distribution during welding process and predict the shape of welded pool for above mentioned 6 welded joints as illustrated from figss 7 12 in addition dummy element technology was employed to consider the un welded pass for multi pass welding procedure body heat source with uniform power density q w m3 welding arc energy volume was applied to model the welding arc moreover heat losses as well as surface heat flux due to thermal convection and radiation were also taken into account with a combined convection and radiation boundary flux q w m2 as given by eq 3 on all external surfaces ma et al 2016 3 q q c q r h t t r o o m Îµ c t 273 4 t r o o m 273 4 h Îµ c t 273 2 t r o o m 273 2 t 273 t r o o m 273 t t r o o m h t t t r o o m where q c and q r are heat convection and radiation respectively h is coefficient of heat convection Îµ is emissivity of the objective which will be equal to one for ideal radiator c is the stefan boltzmann constant also h t means the combined convection and radiation boundary flux coefficient which value is fixed to be 5 7 10 6 w oc m2 regardless of temperature variation during fe computation t t room is elevated temperature magnitude then transient temperature distributions were considered as input thermal loading to investigate mechanical response as welding distortion plastic strain and others while rigid body motion is fixed to be mechanical boundary condition as illustrated from figss 7 12 fig 13 shows the temperature dependent thermal and mechanical material properties of ah32 fig 14 shows the computed transient temperature distribution of cap welding and shape profile of welded pool while the region with temperature above steel molten point is close to the welded groove meanwhile fig 15 illustrates the predicted out of plane welding distortion after welding of fys 16 16 welded joint in which the deformed rate is 5 as well as the deformed shape is amplified with 5 times for clear observation and analysis of deformed tendency during post process of welding computation in addition distribution of transverse plastic strain after welding of fys 16 16 welded joint is shown in fig 16 for the other typical welded joints mentioned above temperature field out of plane welding distortion and residual plastic strain were also examined with thermal mechanical coupling computational approach computed results were illustrated in fig 17 for ai 14 22 fig 18 for axs 85 85 fig 19 for covn 14 14 fig 20 for fp 22 16 and fig 21 for c 85 85 in which transient temperature distribution shape of welded pool out of plane welding distortion and transverse plastic strain can be all observed during the thermal elastic plastic fe analysis for multi pass welded joint parallel computation with openmp technology was employed to enhance the computational efficiency and less computational time was consumed obviously in addition the computing times of thermal elastic plastic fe computation for each typical welded joint were summarized in table 5 when parallel computation technology with openmp was employed computing time of axs 85 85 6 55 h is reduced to be 30 of computing time of covn 14 14 23 08 h while axs 85 85 has much more nodes and elements than that of covn 14 14 even axs 85 85 has three times of welding passes comparing with covn 14 14 in particular computation of c 85 85 with 50 welding passes can be achieved with 17 22 h with openmp which can be accepted for engineering application 4 3 inherent deformation evaluation and its validation as mentioned above there are two methods to evaluate the welding inherent deformation of examined welded joints one is inverse analysis with welding distortion liang and murakawa 2012 the other is integration method with residual plastic strain based on definition of welding inherent deformation wang et al 2015 2017a later two methods are both employed to evaluate welding inherent deformations of butt and fillet welded joints and elastic fe analysis with evaluated welding inherent deformation was carried out to predict welding distortion results of elastic fe analysis with evaluated welding inherent deformation was then compared with computed results of thermal elastic plastic fe computation to confirm the precision of evaluated inherent deformation with different methods in particular longitudinal inherent shrinkage is usually converted to longitudinal shrinkage force tendon force as given in eq 4 during the elastic fe analysis due to strong self constraint and un uniform distribution of shrinkage in longitudinal direction wang et al 2017b zhou and wang 2019 table 6 and table 7 summarized the evaluated welding inherent deformations with both inverse analysis and integration method for butt and fillet welded joints respectively 4 f l o n g i t u d i n a l Îµ l o n g i t u d i n a l p l a s t i c e d a e Îµ l

validate the accuracy of evaluated inherent deformations with inverse analysis and integration method butt welded joint of ai 10 14 was modeled with solid elements and shell elements as show in fig 22 a and fig 23 a respectively from the plotting contour of out of plane welding distortion as shown in figs 22 b fig 23 b and fig 23 c deformed tendency are almost the identical with each other considering the points on line 1 as indicated in fig 23 a the magnitudes of out of plane welding distortions were compared as shown in fig 24 it can be seen that computed out of plane welding distortion by means of elastic fe computation with welding inherent deformation evaluated by inverse analysis has a good agreement to that of tep fe computation 4 3 2 validation for fillet welded joint fillet welded joint as typical welding in shipbuilding was also examined for welding inherent deformation validation as shown in fig 25 a and fig 26 a solid elements and shell elements models were employed for tep and elastic fe computations computed out of plane welding distortions have similar deformed tendency as indicated in figs 25 b fig 26 b and fig 26 c for fillet welding both flange and web have bending deformation therefore points on line 1 of flange edge an points on line 2 of web top edge as indicated in fig 26 were selected for welding inherent deformation validation as shown in fig 27 bending deformations of points on line 1 as indicated in fig 26 have consistent feature with each other however a little bit difference of bending deformations of points on line 2 computed by tep and elastic fe computations can be also observed from the above comparisons inherent deformations evaluated by inverse analysis may be better choice for typical welding joints in shipbuilding 4 4 database and empirical formulae of inherent deformation in general longitudinal bending is ignored due to its less magnitude welding inherent deformations are dominantly determined by welding heat input when the welded joint and material properties are both fixed in order to avoid the influence of plate thickness inherent deformations are uniformly considered regardless of plate thickness and then converted to tendon force and parameters for all examined welded joints which are calculated by multiplication with thickness then evaluated welding inherent deformations for sequential elastic fe analysis were summarized in table 8 for butt welded joints and table 9 for fillet welded joints based on database as summarized in tables 8 and 9 welding inherent deformations of other welded joints in the examined ship structure also can be obtained without lots of tep fe computation to decrease complexity of fe analysis moreover linear regression approach was employed as shown in fig 28 to establish the relationships between inherent deformation parameters and welding heat input and these formulae were obtained as listed in table 10 5 prediction and validation of out of plane welding distortion with the welding inherent deformation as loading for mechanical response of welded joints elastic fe computation can be carried out to efficiently predict welding distortion without precision loss which is considered as a practical engineering tool for precision fabrication of large ship structures 5 1 watertight transverse bulkhead structure as shown in fig 29 geometrical model of examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure was introduced in which the plate stiffeners l section steel and even opening hole for pipeline system continuous in plate stiffeners are all considered in addition dimensional size of skin plate l section steel plate stiffeners and their spacing distances are also illustrated in fig 29 with shell elements identical dimensions as mentioned above were utilized and the plate thicknesses are also identical to the actual ship structure fe mesh model was then created as shown in fig 30 the total number of nodes and elements are 10 631 and 10 478 respectively the total number of parts is 92 which are distinguished with different colors as indicated in fig 30 the welding lines exist between the adjacent parts with different color and then were used to load welding inherent deformations for elastic fe computation considering the rigidity of section steel and plate stiffener boundary condition as indicated in fig 30 was employed to prevent rigid body motion points on line1 4 with different colors were marked in fig 30 to validate magnitude of computed welding distortions comparing to measurement later comparing to in plane shrinkage distortion out of plane welding distortion has much more significant influence on the dimensional precision of ship structure as shown in fig 31 distribution of computed out of plane welding distortion was illustrated while deformed shape with overall middle hogging was observed and maximal magnitude about 20 87 mm appears in the center region this kind of welding distortion may result from the different plate thickness density of welding line and corresponding welding heat inputs as mentioned above points on line 1 and line2 as indicated in fig 30 were selected to validate the accuracy of computed out of plane welding distortion fig 32 shows the comparison of points on line 1 and line 2 between computed out of plane welding distortions and experimental results not only the tendency but also the magnitude of welding distortion has good agreement with each other while their distributions can be understood due to structural feature and corresponding welding heat input 5 2 torsion box structure since fe mesh will influence the computed accuracy and computer consumption ship structure modeling as engineering application should ensure the identical geometrical profile and utilize fine mesh for the region near the welding line according to the actual torsion box structure fig 33 gives the geometrical dimension and 60 parts are marked with different colors fe mesh with shell elements is illustrated in fig 34 in which the number of nodes and elements are 10 554 and 8 741 respectively in addition welding lines are automatically generated between the adjacent parts with different colors boundary condition considering structural stiffness was employed to prevent rigid body motion as also shown in fig 34 line 1 to line 4 were also marked and selected for computed accuracy validation by comparing predicted out of plane welding distortion to measurements fig 35 shows plotting contour of computed out of plane welding distortion with five times deformed rate it can be seen that minimal out of plane welding distortion with 7 00 mm magnitude appears in the middle region due to the angular distortion of thick plates welding with 85 mm and 60 mm in thickness due to the weak stiffness maximal out of plane welding distortion with magnitude of 9 68 mm was generated at the edge region in order to exactly compare the computed results welding distortion of points on line1 and line2 as indicated in fig 34 was picked up and compared with measurement as shown in fig 36 good agreement can be obviously observed not only for deformed tendency but also for magnitudes 6 influence of welding sequence on precision fabrication for complicated welded structure with lots of parts the final dimensional precision was determined not only by mechanical response of welded joints but also by welding sequence and fitting configuration the application of welding sequence influence was practiced in fabrication of watertight transverse bulkhead structure by elastic fe computation for actual fabrication in shipbuilding ship block such as examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure of ultra large container was assembled sequentially through steel pieces parts and segments welding distortion during steel pieces joining can be reduced significantly with lots of mitigation practices and then dimensional precision of segments can be guaranteed however the welding distortion in the fabrication of segments to be block may be difficult to control due to the large structure stiffness of assembled segments watertight transverse bulkhead structure was selected to examine the influence of segments welding sequence on dimensional precision as shown in fig 37 watertight transverse bulkhead structure was assembled by two segments tb11a and tb11b in conventional fabrication in addition tb11a and tb11b were fabricated separately and then were assembled together due to the high productivity however the tb11b segment is too huge to control and reduce the welding distortion during its fabrication and it will influence the fitting precision and final dimensional quality when tb11b is assembled with tb11a segment it is better to separate the examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure to be five segments for fabrication as shown in fig 38 considering the structural continuity with the proposed fabrication plan welding distortion not only during each segment joining but also during segments assemble together can be easily reduced with a little bit longer working hours moreover the requirement of lifting capacity can be reduced and coefficient of utilization of workshop even shipway can be obviously improved in detail the weight of segment of tb11b structure in conventional fabrication plan is about 71 190 kg among all segments in proposed fabrication plan the largest segment is 3rd structure and its weight is reduced by 43 7 to be 40 081 kg which is convenient for utilization of lifting equipment the segments its parts and weights of conventional and proposed fabrication plans were summarized as listed in table 11 due to the proposed segments of examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure as listed in table 11 the influence of segments welding sequence on overall out of plane welding distortion was then examined as summarized in table 11 four different welding sequences of sequential assembly were considered which are conventional welding sequential welding symmetrical welding and intermittent welding in addition conventional welding means two segments so called tb11a and tb11b as shown in fig 37 were directly welded together moreover there are five components of examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure as indicated in fig 38 which are called s1 s5 sequential welding means that s1 is welded with s2 s2 then is welded with s3 and s3 is welded with s4 eventually s4 is welded with s5 symmetrical welding means s1 and s2 is welded simultaneously with that s4 and s5 is welded together then s4 and s2 are welded with s3 at the same time intermittent welding means that s1 is welded with s2 and s3 is then welded with s4 later s2 is welded with s3 and s4 is welded with s5 the overall maximal out of plane welding distortion were also summarized in table 12 with different welding sequences out of plane welding distortions of points on line 3 and line 4 as indicated in fig 30 were illustrated in fig 39 it can be seen that out of plane welding distortion can be significantly reduced with proposed fabrication plan however their distributions can not be easily compared to analyze which welding sequence is the optimal case quantitatively therefore relative deflection was presented which is defined with eq 5 as follows 5 r e l a t i v e d e f l e c t i o n i 1 p o int n o d e f l e c t i o n i in addition relative deflections of points on line1 and line2 as indicated in fig 30 were also summarized in table 12 among the considered welding sequences it can be concluded that the best welding sequence to reduce out of plane welding distortion of examined watertight transverse bulkhead structure is symmetrical welding from center to edge which can be clarified with stiffness prior theory spt total relative deflection by symmetrical welding from center to edge is about 1096 49 mm which is reduced about 40 from 1842 98 mm by conventional welding and its maximal out of plane welding distortion is about 17 43 mm which is reduced about 20 from 20 87 mm 7 x groove optimization of butt welded joint with thick plates currently in shipbuilding there are two practical techniques for out of plane welding distortion mitigation during the butt welding of thick plates with x type groove symmetrical welding and inverse deformation application c wang et al 2019 however they both have engineering limitation in detail symmetrical welding requires the frequent turnover of welded joint during assemble procedure which will significantly reduce the fabrication efficiency require much more equipment and even improve the probability of safety accident inverse deformation application can ensure the welding productivity without many turnover of welded joint but magnitudes of inverse deformations are not easy to obtain which requires lots of experimental measurements or tep fe computations due to their dependence on material properties and plate thickness moreover mould weight may require to support mechanical constrain during the inverse deformation application therefore design optimization of welding groove with x type was proposed and examined in addition out of plane welding distortion generated by upper welding can be reduced by lower welding in the butt welding of thick plates with asymmetrical groove which has the advantages of high productivity less out of plane welding distortion comparing with the current mitigation practices actually symmetrical groove design for butt welding with thick plates as shown in fig 40 was employed while the groove angle is about 32 gap is about 8 mm and the length of truncated edge is about 3 mm with experimental measurement out of plane welding distortion using above mentioned groove design will extend the fabrication tolerance while the upper welding passes were finished and then turnover the welding joint once for lower welding passes the underlying mechanism is that almost same transverse plastic strains were generated during both upper and lower welding however bending moment caused by transverse plastic strains and structural stiffness were altered during the entire welding procedure with wire fusion and filling asymmetrical x groove can provide a particular depth ratio of upper and lower welding passes defined by eq 6 to mitigate out of plane welding distortion with only once turnover moreover that the groove angle will not be less than 32 due to actual welding procedure should be guaranteed 6 d e p t h r a t i o h 1 d e p t h o f u p p e r w e l d i n g h 2 d e p t h o f l o w e r w e l d i n g taking the butt welding of thick plate with 60 mm in thickness as example fig 41 shows the solid elements model and a series of tep fe computations were carried out to optimize the asymmetrical groove design with less out of plane welding distortion in detail the considered solid elements model is 300 mm in length 300 mm in width and 60 mm in thickness the total number of elements and points are 27 360 and 29 264 respectively in order to improve the computational efficiency an in house code for auto bead technique abt was proposed c wang et al 2019 and employed to confirm the number and position of welding pass for asymmetrical groove design with different depth ratio while the cross sectional area of each welding pass will be identical due to the same welding condition in detail one solid elements model is required in which fine mesh was created near the welding region and coarse mesh can be used for the region far away welding pass geometrical feature of welding pass can be described by origin coordinate as well as width depth and height of heated region with a double ellipsoid model goldak et al 1986 then groove design can be subsequently modified according to the welding pass arrangement as illustrated in fig 42 at first the case that depth of upper welding groove h1 equals to depth of lower welding groove h2 as well as that depth ratio is one was examined according to the saw welding condition as summarized in table 4 and its corresponding deposition amount arrangement of welding pass for butt welding with 60 mm thick pates was designed as shown in fig 41 essentially welding pass in lower groove will start when all welding passes in upper groove are finished and welded joint was already turnover with the in house tep fe programming thermal analysis was carried out and then its computed temperature profile was applied as thermal loading to examine the mechanical response distribution of maximal temperature as well as geometrical profile of molten pool was illustrated in fig 43 in addition plotting contour of final out of plane welding distortion in the view of cross section was drawn in fig 43 it can be seen that predicted geometrical profile of welding molten pool is agree with the dimension of designed groove and out of plane welding distortion with about 4 5 mm magnitude was observed which is not easy to mitigate therefore it can be inferred that current welding groove when depth ratio is one is not appropriate to reduce out of plane welding distortion as mentioned above bending moment caused by welding plastic strain in transverse direction and structural stiffness due to filler deposition will both developed during entire welding procedure which will together determine the eventual out of plane welding distortion moreover a series of tep fe computations with different depth ratios were carried out then distribution of maximal temperature and plotting contour of out of plane welding distortion were demonstrated in fig 44 in which squeeze theorem for domain approximation was employed and implemented as illustrated in fig 45 in addition if the welded joint bends downward with negative magnitude of out of plane welding distortion the depth of lower groove should be increase otherwise the depth of lower groove should be decrease with upward bending deformation in detail table 13 summarized the computed results with different depth ratio such as temperature profile number of welding pass maximal deflection and flatness of top surface when the depth ratio is 1 1 9 computed temperature profile and out of plane welding distortion were illustrated in fig 46 in addition there are 5 and 8 welding passes for upper and lower groove respectively it can be seen that the final out of plane welding distortions are reduced to be less than 1 0 mm due to the effect of transverse plastic strain generated by lower welding not only magnitude of out of plane welding distortion but also flatness of top surface are employed to evaluate the welding groove as summarized in table 13 flatness of top surface can be understood with the value of welding angle respected to the initial configuration as well as welding inherent transverse bending moreover the points on cross sectional line of bottom surface are examined and fig 47 shows the comparison of the out of plane welding distortions with different depth ratios obviously it can be seen that less magnitude of out of plane welding distortion was generated when depth ratio is 1 1 9 comparing to that with other depth ratios in detail large magnitude of out of plane welding distortion was generated by upper welding with current groove design and which can not be completely reduced by lower welding and its generated bending moment due to the strong structural stiffness point of truncated edge was also examined comparing the welding procedure of current groove design with that of optimized groove fig 48 shows the evolution of out of plane welding distortion of examined point with different groove design in addition out of plane welding distortion can be well controlled with optimized groove design as shown in fig 48 then the above tep fe computational analysis was carried out to examine groove optimization for butt welding with different plate thicknesses as a result table 14 summarized the optimized depth ratios for plate thicknesses with 40 mm 50 mm 60 mm 65 mm 70 mm 85 mm which all utilize the identical welded joint type as shown in fig 40 based on the results summarized in table 14 the relation between optimized depth ratio and plate thickness can be evaluated with regression analysis as shown in fig 49 non linear numerical fitting with boltzmann function can be employed welding joint with less and larger thicknesses has almost constant depth ratio of optimized groove which can be clarified as the balance of welding bending moment and structural stiffness with this empirical formula depth ratio of optimized groove for other thickness can be conveniently obtained to mitigate the out of plane welding distortion which will improve investigation efficiency without numerous consumption of computer resource from the database of welding inherent deformation of butt welding as summarized in tables 8 and 10 welding groove of thick plate 40 85 mm can be optimized with less out of plane welding distortion and the corresponding transverse bending will also be reduced

22048,the prediction of the structural stochastic response under strong winds and waves is important in the design of cross sea bridges with longer spans while the non stationary characteristics of winds and waves may affect the accuracy this paper investigates the effects of non stationary winds and waves on the stochastic response of a cable stayed bridge based on a wind wave bridge wwb system in order to improve the computational efficiency three surrogate models i e the support vector regression svr the bp neural network bpn and the gaussian process regression gpr are established by

wave fields different surrogate models are applicable to different parts of the bridge the svr bpn and gpr models are recommended for predicting the response of the tower the foundation and the girder respectively and the sensitivity analysis reveals the effects of non stationary winds and waves keywords a cable stayed bridge coupled winds and waves non stationary characteristics wind wave bridge system stochastic response surrogate models 1 introduction with the continuous development of construction technology a great number of cross sea bridges have been constructed in recent decades in global coastal communities e g the akashi kaikyo bridge the oresund bridge and the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge with the increases in spans of the girders and heights of the foundations cross sea bridges show flexible dynamic characteristics and are vulnerable to stochastic environmental conditions such as wind and wave loads zhu and zhang 2017 many efforts have been made to investigate the wind induced response of long span bridges by field observations wind tunnel tests or numerical simulations e g fujino 2002 li et al 2018 ma et al 2018 siringoringo and fujino 2012 tang et al 2019 these studies indicated that the wind load plays an essential role in the performance evaluation and the structural safety for the bridges meanwhile the interaction between the wave load and the cross sea bridge has been investigated but the corresponding studies mainly focused on low lying cases e g xu et al 2017 xu and cai 2015 or foundations e g chen et al 2016 wei et al 2013 which shows that huge waves may cause the significant response or even the catastrophic failure of the bridges in both the construction and the service stages recent studies showed that coupled winds and waves possess greater threats to coastal structures and the two loads should be treated simultaneously when predicting the structural stochastic response compared with other coastal structures like tower platforms offshore wind turbines and floating foundations wei et al 2014 zaheer and islam 2017 zhang et al 2013 coastal cable stayed bridges have higher towers and longer girders so the wind and wave loads on the bridges show the following two differences first the fluctuating wind loads on the girders and the towers which have bluff aerodynamic shapes with low natural frequencies in general need to be considered second the wave loads on the foundations with densely arranged piles are difficult to determine due to the interference among the piles and the dynamic response of the foundations also becomes complex in the authors previous studies fang et al 2019a li et al 2019 the time domain and the frequency domain response of a freestanding bridge tower subjected to correlated winds and waves is carefully discussed zhu and zhang 2017 proposed a numerical method to simulate the non stationary wind and wave fields around a coastal slender bridge which provides a feasible framework for investigating stochastic response of bridge under winds and waves meng et al 2018 analyzed the stochastic buffeting response of a coastal bridge under correlated winds and waves five representative cases were used to discuss the dynamic response of the bridge the calculation results showed the significant effects of the correlated winds and waves on the bridge it can be seen from these studies that both the factors should be taken into account when analyzing the dynamic response of coastal structures due to the complex coupling effects among winds waves and long span bridges however the understanding of the bridge stochastic response under extreme conditions is still limited which affects the prediction of the structural stochastic response another issue is how to accurately determine the parameters of winds and waves which are closely related to the stochastic response of bridges generally the environmental parameters for the design of a bridge represent the mean condition for instance the reference wind speed for a bridge is determined by the annual maximum value within 10 min and with a return period of 100 years in china however strong winds and huge waves in real conditions may be non stationary the mean values may change obviously which affect the structural stochastic response some studies concentrated in the non stationary wind field and the effect on bridges hu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 the results showed that the mean wind speed followed a slow changing process during which the maximum wind speed lasts only a short time to predict the structural stochastic response accurately the effects of non stationary winds and waves should be studied the finite element analysis fea is a feasible way but it is time consuming especially when analyzing a long span bridge and a large number of degrees of freedom in some recent studies fea was used for deterministic analyses only to save the cost meng et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 due to the limited results obtained by deterministic analyses it is necessary to develop an efficient and accurate approach to fully compare the stochastic response of bridges under stationary and non stationary environmental conditions nowadays the machine learning has become particularly important for solving such problems in numerical prediction a variety of machine learning algorithms like the support vector machine figueiredo et al 2011 lu et al 2017 shafaei and kisi 2016 the neural network guo et al 2011 shi et al 2019 xu et al 2018 and the gaussian process regression e g zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 have been developed in various research fields these successful applications correlate multiple stochastic inputs and a single output using different algorithms to improve computing efficiency however determining a reasonable algorithm is critical to the accuracy of the prediction and a comparative study of different surrogate models is necessary to obtain the optimal algorithm in this study a framework for calculating the stochastic response of a coastal cable stayed bridge under non stationary winds and waves is proposed deterministic analyses are first performed based on a wind wave bridge wwb model to investigate the effects of non stationary wind fields non stationary wave fields and both the factors on the stochastic response respectively the results of the deterministic analyses are then treated as the train samples and three surrogate models i e the svr the bpn and the gpr models are established and further optimized the accuracy of the three models is compared to determine which one is the most suitable to predict the stochastic response of the girder the tower and the foundation respectively finally the stochastic response of the bridge with stationary and non stationary environmental parameters including the mean wind speed the significant wave height and the peak wave period is computed based on the optimal surrogate model and the difference is fully discussed 2 wind wave bridge system 2 1 engineering background a 90 145 560 145 90 m cable stayed bridge which is one of the channel bridges of a cross sea bridge in the nearshore region of the east china sea is taken as the example around the bridge site there are lots of hills see fig 1 with a marine monsoon climate and the bridge will be easy to attack by strong winds or waves which however may show non stationary characteristics the bridge is composed of a girder two towers four auxiliary piers and a large number of cables the steel truss girder with a width of 22 m and a height of 6 m is adopted each tower with a height of 206 m includes two columns supported by a cap pile foundation which has 38 piles with the radius of 3 4 m and the length of 30 m below the still water level swl the auxiliary piers are built on artificial reefs above the swl 2 2 establishment of the bridge the finite element model of the bridge is established with a total of 5 622 degrees of freedom the girder the towers and the piers are modeled by spatial beam elements the steel truss girder is simplified as a single girder the cables are modeled by uniaxial tension compression link elements a total of 216 cables are built and their initial stress and sag effects are all considered the secondary loads are applied to the corresponding nodes of the bridge by adding mass elements the towers and the auxiliary piers are fixed at the bottom the rayleigh damping as a function of mass and stiffness matrices is utilized to build the bridge damping matrix the damping ratio is 0 5 for steel truss girder the natural frequencies of the first ten modes of the bridge and the corresponding modal shapes are listed in table 1 comparing the first 10 natural frequencies of the bridge with the bridge design institute the maximum absolute error is 2 which implies that the fe model is in good agreement with the design bridge the lateral bending fundamental frequency of the bridge is less than its vertical bending fundamental frequency indicating the lateral response of the girder is more sensitive to external excitation in comparison with vertical response 2 3 simulations of winds and waves after establishing the model wind and wave loads are added on the bridge and the governing equation of the coupled wind wave bridge system can be written as 1 m b u b c b u b k b u b f sb f bub f seb f wb where u b u b u b are the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors of the bridge respectively m b c b k b are the mass damping and stiffness matrixes of the bridge respectively f sb f bub f seb are the static wind forces the buffeting forces and the self excited forces respectively and f wb is the wave forces on the girder of the bridge the static wind forces the buffeting wind forces and the self excited wind forces are considered each wind force components can be divided into drag lift and moment the static wind forces per unit length are computed by 2 f s t d 0 5 Ï u d 2 c d h f s t l 0 5 Ï u d 2 c l b f s t m 0 5 Ï u d 2 c m b 2 where f s t d f s t l f s t m are the static wind drag force the static wind lift force and the static wind moment force respectively Ï is the air density u d is the mean wind speed at the height of the bridge girder h and b are the height and the width of the girder c d c l c m are the drag coefficient the lift coefficient and the moment coefficient of the cross section of the girder and they are taken as 1 026 0 167 and 0 107 determined by sectional model wind tunnel tests details about the tests can be found in fang et al 2019b the buffeting wind forces per unit length are given by 3 f b u d t 0 5 Ï u d 2 b 2 h b c d v t u d 4 f b u l t 0 5 Ï u d 2 b 2 c l v t u d c l h b c d w t u d 5 f b

the self excited lift force and the self excited moment respectively p Ï h Ï Î± Ï are the lateral the vertical and the torsional displacement response of the bridge respectively f i j i d l m j p h Î± are the impulse functions determined by flutter derivatives based on the rational approximation approach since the flutter derivatives are normally experimentally determined at discrete values of the reduced frequency k thus approximate expressions are often applied to describe these as continuous functions of k by the rational approximation approach which is widely used in the aerodynamic characteristics i e the flutter derivatives spanwise coherence and admittance function detailed derivation of self excited wind forces on the bridge can be found in chen et al 2000 lin and yang 1983 therefore the total wind induced load f g acting on the girder are given by 9 f g t 0 l g f d t d z 0 l g f l t d z 0 l g f m t d z 0 l g f s t d f b u d t f s e d t d z 0 l g f s t l f b u l t f s e l t d z 0 l g f s t m f b u m t f s e m t d z where f d f l f m are the drag the lift and the moment respectively l g is the length of the girder on the towers of the bridge the static wind forces and the buffeting forces are considered and computed in the same way with the girder as the tower is a typical blunt structure so the self excited forces acting on it are ignored zhu and zhang 2017 on the cap pile foundations of the bridge the wave forces are considered because the size of a pile meets the validity criterion that the ratio of the pile diameter d p to the wave length l is smaller than 0 2 morison equation is used to calculate the wave forces the horizontal wave force per unit length on a pile f w 0 at any instant of time can be expressed as 10 f w 0 0 5 Ï w c d d p u w u b u w u b Ï w a u w c m 1 Ï w a u w u b where Ï w is the water density u w u w are the velocity and acceleration of water quality point u b u b are the velocity and acceleration of a pile a is the cross sectional area of a pile c d c m are the drag coefficient and the inertia coefficient which are taken as 1 2 and 2 0 according to the chinese code jts 145 2015 2015 considering that the wave loads acting on the pile group are significantly different from that on a single isolated pile due to the interference and the shelter effects the total horizontal wave force per unit length on all piles f w at any instant of time is given by 11 f w t j 1 n k 1 m k g j k f w j k t where f w j k is the horizontal wave force of the j kth pile n is the number of columns of piles in the direction of wave propagation m is the number of rows of piles in the perpendicular direction of wave propagation and k g j k is the pile group coefficient of the j kth pile when the wave period is long some pile foundations along the wave direction may be at the wave crest and others at the wave trough at this time the cancellation effect of waves for the pile group foundation may occur and it can be calculated according to eq 11 the experimentally determined coefficients are adopted to determine the pile group coefficients mindao et al 1987 stated that the pile group can be simplified into a side by side arrangement and a tandem arrangement and the interference coefficient and the shelter coefficient are proposed for the two arrangements bonakdar et al 2015 studied the pile group effect by laboratory tests and stated that the shelter coefficient can be taken as 1 0 therefore only the interference effect among the piles is considered k g j k is set to 1 0 for the side piles and computed by 1 265 0 225 ln a d p for the middle piles where a is the distance between two neighbouring piles in the wwb system all forces and moments are exerted on nodes which represent the exact locations of the geometric centroid of the bridge as shown in fig 2 and the simulated loads are equivalent to the actual wind and wave loads considering that the self excited forces and the wave forces are motion dependent the convergence control items are selected for the nodes of the girder and the foundations specifically the newmark Î² method is used to reach the prescribed convergence at each time step the girder is divided into 116 elements and the wind loads are applied on the 117 nodes marked from g1 to g117 each tower column consists of an upper part and a lower part the column is divided into 34 elements and the wind loads are applied on all nodes marked from t1 at the bottom to t21 at the top for the cap pile foundations which support the towers the caps exceed the swl so wave loads only act on the piles each pile has 6 nodes along the height direction and the wave load is applied on all nodes below the swl after establishing the wwb system the structural dynamic response under the stochastic winds and waves could be computed in time domain with the following major procedures the first step is to generate the stochastic wind and wave fields at each of the positions including the fluctuating wind speed the water point velocity and acceleration the second step is to compute the corresponding time varying wind and wave loads the third step is to solve the bridge response through equilibrium iterations until the convergence control items satisfies specific limits at a certain time step t the node forces f old of convergent items are saved from the previous iteration and then the force matrix is updated to obtain new node forces f new at the current iteration the limits of convergence is that the absolute value of relative error of the node forces in two steps f old and f new is less than 1 repeat the above three steps until the computation is completed 3 stochastic response of the bridge non stationary winds and waves are considered individually and simultaneously and the dynamic response of the bridge is computed based on the wwb system there are many variables that have significant influences on the dynamic responses of the bridge such as winds waves vehicles the geometry of the bridge the temperature the earthquake etc however the possibility that some variables affect the bridge simultaneously is very low for instance strong winds and earthquake 3 1 effects of non stationary winds the wind field is composed of the mean wind static wind component plus the fluctuating wind component the mean wind velocity u z changes along the height direction and its expression at a certain height z above the swl is given by 12 u z u 10 ln z z 0 ln 10 z 0 where u 10 is the mean wind speed at 10 m height above the swl and z 0 is the sea surface roughness which is approximately 0 01 m for a rough sea surface specially u z is expressed as u d at the height of the bridge girder for the long span bridge the single point wind field representation may cause the conservative results due to the unrealistic assumption of fully correlated wind field while the multi point wind field representation is more suitable as it considers the effects of partial correlations the multi point wind fields can be generated as a uniformly modulated process the cross spectral density matrix is defined as 13 s 0 w s 11 0 w s 12 0 w s 21 0 w s 22 0 w s 1 n 0 w s 2 n 0 w s n 1 0 w s n 2 0 w s n n 0 w where s k k 0 w s z k w k 1 2 n and s z k w represents the normalized wind spectrum s j k 0 w coh z j z k w s z j w s z k w j k 1 2 n j k the multi point wind speeds consist of the amplitude modulating the sample functions u t u z 1 t u z 2 t u z n t t which is described by its cross spectral density matrix s 0 w the sample functions can be simulated by the spectral representation method srm li et al 2004 let t p Î´ t and the sample functions u t can be rewritten for the application fast fourier transform fft the main equations are summarized as follows 14 f p Î´ t re m 1 j h j m q Î´ t exp i m Î´ w n p Î´ t 15 h j m q Î´ t l 0 2 n 1 b j m l Î´ w exp i l Î´ w q Î´ t 16 b j m l Î´ w 2 Î´ w h j m l Î´ w m Î´ w n exp i Î´ m l 0 0 l n n l m 1 where p 0 1 2 m n 1 q 0 1 2 2 n 1 m 2 n Î´ w w u n w u is upper cutoff frequency and h j m q Î´ t and b j m l Î´ w is a fft pair for the given j and m the kaimal and the lumley panofsky spectra are selected to simulate the fluctuating wind field on the girder and the tower respectively and the davenport coherence function is adopt to simulate the correlation among the different wind speed points li et al 2004 the stationary wind field follows the assumption of an ergodic or stationary random process however the wind field in extreme environment like typhoons hurricanes and tropical cyclones may be a non stationary process as it may change during an extreme case the mean wind component is not suitable to be described as a single value any more vickery et al 2000 studied the observed wind speed based on 90 full scale hurricane wind speed measurements and found that the mean speed within 10 min showed a single peak distribution that is to say the mean wind speed increased first and then decreased in order to simulate the time history of non stationary fluctuating wind speed it is necessary to rewrite the mean wind speed to a time varying value as follows li et al 2017 17 u z t u max d m t 18 d m t exp t t 0 2 2 d t 2 where u z t is the time varying mean wind speed at the height z u max is the maximum mean wind speed during the process d m t is a time varying function t 0 is the time when the wind speed reaches its maximum which is treated as 100 s for the simulation d t is the storm duration once the wind fields of the girder and the tower are simulated the wind loads i e static wind forces resulting from mean wind buffeting forces resulting from wind turbulence and self excited forces resulting from wind bridge interaction can be calculated according to section 2 3 in order to study the influence of non stationary wind field on bridge response two situations are considered first the u max within the non stationary process are set to 10 m s 15 m s and 20 m s respectively for each of the three u max different storm durations d t ranging from 20 s to 400 s with an interval of 20 s are selected without loss of generality the time varying mean wind speeds of partial cases are shown in fig 3 a it is observed that a smaller d t means a steeper change in the non stationary wind fluctuation due to a short non stationarity with the increase in d t the mean wind speed is closer to the u max second the mean of the time varying mean wind speed u mean within the non stationary process keeps constant also three different values of u mean with twenty different d t are considered the time varying mean wind speeds of partial cases are shown in fig 3 b in this section the wave field is regarded as stationary the root mean square rms values of the lateral displacement at the mid span rms zg the lateral displacement at the top of tower rms zt and the shear at the bottom of the cap rms s under various mean wind speeds are illustrated in fig 4 in the stationary wind fields the rms values are represented as rms st and shown with the red straight lines fig 4 a shows rms st under the stationary wind fields and rms zg the non stationary wind fields the values of rms st are 0 0115 m 0 0163 m and 0 0231 m when the mean wind speeds are 10 m s 15 m s and 20 m s respectively the increasing trend of rms zg slows down gradually with the increase of the d t and finally tends to the constant value as the same as rms st this means that the greater the fluctuation of u z j t the lower rms zg for the same d t rms zg also increases with the increase of the u max or u mean the same phenomenon is found at the top of tower i e rms zt and the bottom of the cap i e rms s as shown in fig 4 b and c in comparison with the response of the bridge under the stationary and the non stationary wind fields d t is set to 20 s and u max or u mean is set to 15 m s rms zg decreases from 0 0163 m to 0 0141 m with a percentage of 13 5 for u max and to 0 0149 m with a percentage of 8 6 for u mean rms zt decreases from 0 01945 m to 0 01904 m with a percentage of 0 2 for u max and to 0 01939 m with a percentage of 0 03 for u mean rms s decreases from 6 64 10 7 n to 6 52 10 7 n with a percentage of 1 8 for u max and to 6 61 10 7 n with a percentage of 0 05 for u mean it can be seen that the non stationary wind fields have significant effects on the buffeting response of the girder rather than the tower and the foundation when u max and u mean are the same the rms value in the latter case is larger due to the larger mean wind speed with the increase of d t the rms value for u mean quickly approaches to and slightly exceeds rms st while that for u max slowly approaches to but is smaller than rms st this implies that the bridge response for u mean is closer to that in the stationary wind field compared with the bridge response for u max 3 2 effects of non stationary waves in this study the water particle velocity and acceleration have been evaluated using multidirectional wave surface which are assumed as the summation of a finite number of cosine wave components the value of wave elevation Ï z t as a function of z and t is given by 19 Ï z t m 1 m i 1 i a m i cos w m t k m z Îµ m i where w m k m are the frequency and the number of the mth wave component Îµ m i is the random initial phase of the mth and the ith wave

directional distribution function using mitsuyasu type spreading function Î´ w m w max w min m is the frequency resolution dividing wave spectra into m unequal sub ranges Î´ Î¸ i Î¸ max Î¸ min i is the direction resolution which means that each wave component comes from i different directions the double superposition method is used to generate multidirectional random waves the mitsuyasu type directional wave spectrum is given by 20 g f Î¸ g 0 cos Ï Î¸ Î¸ 0 2 Î¸ max 2 s where g 0 Ï 2 Î¸ max Î³ s 1 Î³ s 0 5 Î³ is the gamma function Î¸ 0 is the main wave direction which is perpendicular to the bridge axis in this study s is the spreading parameter determined by 21 s s max f f p 5 s max f f p 2 5 f f p f f p where f and f p are the frequency and the spectral peak frequency the value of s max is treated as 10 for wind waves proposed by goda and suzuki 1975 according to the wave spreading function it can be found that the energy in the main wave direction assumed as 0 is the largest and it decreases gradually with the wave incident direction from 0 to Ï to simulate non stationary wave fields the time varying mean wind speed is introduced into the jonswap spectrum and the stationary wave spectrum can be extended to simulate non stationary wave fields the expression of the time varying wave spectrum is given by 22 s w t Î± s t g 2 1 w 5 exp 5 4 w p w 4 r exp w w p 2 2 Ï 2 w p 2 where the coefficient Î± s t is obtained by 0 076 u z j t f g 0 22 and f is the fetch distance the peak circular frequency w p is obtained by 22 g 2 u 10 t f 1 3 r is the peak enhancement factor Ï 0 09 when w w p or Ï 0 07 when w w p f 100 km and r 3 3 are selected then the influence of the non stationary wave field on the bridge response is studied u max and u mean are set to 15 m s respectively they are used to simulate two non stationary wave fields while the wind load acting on the bridge is stationary fig 5 shows rms zg rms zt and rms s in the stationary and the non stationary wave fields in the stationary wave field the values of rms st are 0 0163 m in terms of the lateral displacement at the mid span 0 01945 m in terms of the lateral displacement at the top of tower and 6 64 10 7 n in terms of the shear at the bottom of the cap similar to the effects of the non stationary wind fields as discussed above the bridge response under the non stationary wave field simulated by u max is smaller than that by u mean the rms values of the bridge response for both u max and u mean tend to be constant value with the increase of the d t when d t is 20 s by comparing the stationary and the non stationary wave fields rms zg decreases by 1 2 and 0 06 from 0 0163 m to 0 0161 m for u max and 0 0162 m for u mean rms zt decreases by 2 0 and 0 05 from 0 01945 m to 0 01907 m for u max and 0 01935 m for u mean rms s decreases by 8 6 and 5 1 from 6 64 10 7 n to 6 07 10 7 n for u max and 6 30 10 7 n for u mean compared with the effects of the non stationary wind fields on the bridge response the non stationary wave fields have more significant effects on rms s while have slight effects on rms zg and rms zt showing that the internal force of bridge foundation is more sensitive to the wave rather than the wind 3 3 effects of both the two factors the wind and wave loads are assumed to be unidirectional and perpendicular to the bridge axis fig 6 shows the buffeting response of the bridge tower the girder and the foundation under the non stationary wind and wave field u max or u mean is set to 15 m s and d t ranges from 20 s to 400 s at an interval of 20 s when d t is equal to 20 s for instance rms zg decreases by 16 0 and 9 2 from 0 0163m to 0 0137 m for u max and 0 0148 m for u mean rms zt decreases by 4 7 and 0 08 from 0 01945 m to 0 01854 m for u max and 0 01929 m for u mean rms s decreases by 11 0 and 5 6 from 6 64 10 7 n to 5 91 10 7 n for u max and 6 27 10 7 n for u mean the bridge response is more significant in non stationary wind and wave fields than that in non stationary wind or wave fields the fluctuation amplitude of bridge response e g 16 0 for u max and 9 2 for u mean in non stationary wind and wave fields is greater than the superposition of that e g 13 5 plus 1 2 for u max and 8 6 plus 0 06 for u mean in two single non stationary wind wave fields with the non stationary situation the bridge responses caused by the combined wind and wave loads are larger than the sum of the results caused by the wind load alone and the wave load alone the coupling effect of the combined wind and wave load leads to a more significant effect on the bridge response compared with the wind load alone plus the wave load alone by comparing the response of the bridge tower the girder and the foundation it is noted that the girder and the foundation are greatly affected by the non stationary wind and wave fields while the tower is less affected nevertheless it is essential to consider non stationary wind and wave fields to evaluate bridge response more accurately 4 three surrogate models in order to study the influence of environmental parameters on bridges more systematically it is necessary to develop an efficient way to evaluate structural dynamic response the most essential aspect of the dynamic analysis of the wwb system is to establish a surrogate model to correlate the dynamic loads and the statistics of stochastic response in this study three surrogate models are briefly introduced as follows 4 1 svr the svr model is widely used technique dealing with non linear mapping relationship smola and schÃ¶lkopf 2004 yu et al 2017 the principal procedure of the svr model is to construct the correlation f x between input data x i and output data y i the input data will be conveyed into a high dimensional feature space and then solving a linear regression in this space the input output data constitute training sample set d x i y i i 1 2 n n is the total number of data the regression function of the svr is defined by 23 f x w t Ï x b where Ï represents the nonlinear mapping function w and b are the weight and the intercept of the optimal regression model which are estimated by the structural risk minimizing principle the process for finding the regression parameter of the svr model can be transformed into the primal quadratic optimization problem as follows 24 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i Î´ i Î´ i w b Î´ i Î´ i 25 subject to y i w t Ï x i b Îµ Î´ i w t Ï x i b y i Îµ Î´ i Î´ i Î´ i 0 where c represents the box constraint between the empirical and generalization errors Î´ t and Î´ t are the slack variables for the two mutually exclusive situations which are to calculate the difference between the actual value and the boundary value the constrained optimization problem can be solved by the lagrange multiplier optimal programming method moura et al 2011 finally the estimated regression function for predicting new value is derived as 26 f x i 1 m Î± i Ï x x i b where Ï x x i is the kernel function like the linear the sigmoid the polynomial and the gaussian kernels m is the total number of kernel functions Î± i is the weight of the ith kernel function 4 2 bpn as one of the most popular artificial neural network ann algorithms the bp neural network bpn and its improved algorithm are widely used to simulate mathematical equations of mapping relations between input and output data e g ding et al 2011 li et al 2012 in this study the bayesian regularised bpn model brbpn is used to train the fea results and predict the stochastic response of cross sea bridge compared with conventional neural network models brbpn can not only take advantages of high convergence speed of neural network model but also automatically optimize regularization parameters and the neural networks weights based on bayesian method the bp neural network which generally consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer is designed to minimize the total error or mean error between the actual value and the predicted value in the basis of a gradient descent method the traditional structure of a three layer bpn model is shown in fig 7 the training process of the bpn model can be illustrated as follows a initialize parameters of bpn model including the input data x i i 1 2 n the output data y k j 1 2 n the initial weights w i j linking the input and the hidden layers and w j k linking the hidden and the output layers b calculate output value h j in hidden layers and o k in output layers using the neuron activation function c adjust the weights and the thresholds by the gradient descent method until the error e k 0 5 y k o k 2 satisfies the specified limit in order to improve the generalisation ability and overcome the over fitting problem in the training process in the neural network the bayesian regularised method is introduced into the bpn model the training objective function is defined as 27 f w Î± e w Î² e d where e w e d are the sum of squared weights and the sum of errors of bpn model Î± Î² are objective parameters controlling the distribution of other parameters the bayesian method is used to derive the posterior probability distribution of weights the density function for the weights is given by 28 p w d Î± Î² m p d w Î² m p w Î± m p d Î± Î² m 1 z f Î± Î² exp f w where m is the bpn model proposed in this work p w Î± m is the prior density representing the known weights of the neural networks p d w Î² m is the likelihood function representing the probability of the data occurring and p d Î± Î² m is the normalization factor guaranteeing the total probability of 1 z f Î± Î² is the measured parameter determined by the taylor series expansion from formula 14 z f Î± Î² is unrelated to the value of w therefore the minimum value of objective function f w can be obtained at the maximum of posterior distribution which can be solved by the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and the gauss newton approximation detailed derivation process can be found in sun et al 2017 4 3 gpr gaussian process regression gpr zhang et al 2016 have convenient properties in numerical prediction which be used to specify distributions with various functional forms the gaussian process is adopted as a prior to simulate the distribution over the lateral functions suppose that a training data set d x i y i i 1 2 m is composed of m samples with p dimensional feature space where x i represents an p dimension input vector and y i represents a one dimension output vector the relationship between inputs and outputs is given by 29 y f x Îµ where f x represents the true output Îµ represents the noise in experimental data or the errors in numerical results which is assumed to be an independent identically distributed gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance Î´ n 2 in the basis of formula 15 the likelihood is given by 30 p y f n y f Î´ n 2 i where f f x 1 f x 2 f x m t i is the m m unit matrix p f n f 0 k is the marginal distribution which follows a zero mean gaussian process whose covariance defined by gram matrix k i j k x i x j because both the likelihood p y f and the prior p f follow the gaussian distribution the marginal distribution p y is deduced as 31 p y p y f p f d f n f 0 k y where k y k Î´ n 2 i the gpr model assumed to follow a multivariate gaussian distribution the input data x x consist of the training input vector x and the target value x the output data y y consist of the observed vector y and the new value y the joint probability distribution of the output data is given by 32 y y f f Îµ Îµ 0 k y k k t k Î´ n 2 where f f x is the latent function value for the training input vector x Îµ is the corresponding noise term k k x x 1 k x x m t and k k x x according to conditioning gaussians the predictive distribution p y y is also a gaussian process with its mean and covariance defined as 33 m x k t k y 1 y 34 Î´ 2 x k k t k y 1 k Î´ n 2 considering the numerical stability in computational process the covariance matrix can be solved using the cholesky decomposition 4 4 proposed method a numerical framework is developed for the stochastic response of the cross sea bridge under winds and waves integrating the deterministic wwb system and a machine learning algorithm after performed the multi scale fea in wwb system the statistics of the stochastic response are obtained as the train samples for the surrogate model all the svr brbpn and gpr models are available to predict the new value the whole process shown in fig 8 can be explained as follows step 1 preform the wwb system to obtain multi scale train samples refer to section 2 step 2 establish the three surrogate models linking the single dynamic response of bridges and multiple stochastic wind and wave parameters a svr model approximate the response functions between structural response and environmental variables the train parameters are optimized by cross validation and the kernel function is selected by trial calculation b brbpn model establish multiple sub bp neural networks corresponding to the number of output variables the train parameters are optimized by the bayesian regularization algorithm c gpr model construct the predictive gp surrogate model the most suitable covariance function is identified by the validation of the testing samples step 3 generate large amounts of loading samples to simulate wind and wave parameters by uniform design sampling uds which are orthogonal and uniformly scattered in the design domain step 4 predict bridge response through the three surrogate models in the stationary and non stationary wind and wave fields respectively 5 comparative analysis 5 1 training sample three input variables i e the mean wind speed u the significant wave height h s and the peak wave period t p are provided as random environmental variables according to the field measured data within 10 years u mainly ranges from 0 to 30 m s h s from 0 to 6 m t p from 0 to 14 s a total of 100 combinations of the three variables which are uniformly distributed in their respective measured ranges are generated to perform the wwb procedures according to the stationary theory and non stationary theory respectively after performing 200 fea simulations 200 training samples are obtained 100 samples in the stationary wind and wave fields and 100 samples in the non stationary wind and wave fields the two sets of samples are used to train three surrogate models respectively generally speaking the calculation time needs to be more than 10 times of the smallest significant natural period of the bridge in this study the largest significant natural period of the bridge is 11 2 s corresponding to the fundamental frequency 0 089 hz as a result the calculation time of 200 s is chosen based on the experience of existing literature zhu et al 2018 in addition the root mean square rms value of bridge response should remain stable according to the preliminary sensitivity analyses the calculation time of 200 s was selected in the simulation to provide the stable results for the bridge with affordable computational costs since the calculation time of each combination is 200 s d t is set as 100 s in the non stationary wind and wave fields the time varying mean wind speed is determined according to eqs 9 and 10 after running about 10 days with two workstations equipped with an intel xeon e5 2650v5 3 40 ghz cpu and 16 gb memory size the stochastic response of bridge and the corresponding rms values are obtained the three environmental variables as input data and the rms values as output data constitute training sample set d for the three surrogate models in order to validate the models three error indexes are adopted to measure the deviation between the predicted values by the surrogate models and the computed values by fea which contain the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the coefficient of determination which is also called as the squares of the regression r 2 35 rmse i 1 n 0 y i y Ë i 2 n 0 36 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y Ë i 37 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y Ë i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i and y Ë i i 1 n 0 are the ith observed and predicted values y is the mean value of observed values n 0 is the total number of output data 5 2 optimization and contrast test for the three surrogate models due to the strong nonlinear relation between input and output data it is necessary to find the appropriate parameters for the three surrogate models which can be essential to get both high quality predictions and insights into the properties of the data taking the 100 non stationary samples as an example the training parameters and the internal algorithms are optimized in the three surrogate models respectively the input data include the three environmental variables with u h s and t p the output data include the rms values of the vertical and lateral displacement at the mid span y midspan z midspan the lateral displacement at the top of tower z toptower and the shear and moment at the bottom of the cap f bottom m bottom in each training process only one of the five rms values is used as the output variable in other words five sub models are used in the training process 100 samples are divided into two groups one with 75 samples for training the surrogate models and the other with 25 samples for validation and identifying the best model without loss of generality z midspan is treated as the output variable to elaborate the optimization process for the svr model the parameter training is completed using the installation package libsvm in matlab r2014a which is widely used in solving svr optimization problems chang and lin 2011 three different kernels i e the linear the polynomial and the gaussian kernels are applied to the svr model the comparison results are shown in table 2 it is observed that compared with the svr models with the linear and the polynomial kernel functions the svr model with the gaussian kernel function has the minimum errors in terms of the rmse and the mae and the maximum in terms of the r2 meaning that the svr model with the gaussian kernel function shows the best performance in addition in order to further improve the fitting accuracy the cross validation function in the installation package is used to find the best parameters c of 0 95 and g of 0 07 which are the optimal parameters in the svr model for the bpn model the parameter training is performed by the neural network toolbox in matlab r2014a which is a powerful tool for system analyzing and designing of the neural network as there are various optimization algorithms for the bpn model the proposed brbpn algorithm is compared with other four common algorithms i e the levenberg marquardt the quasi newton the fletcher reeves and the powell beal algorithms the results of the three indexes are summarized in table 3 it is observed that the brbpn model generates the highest accuracy than the other four models indicating that the bpn model is optimized by the bayesian regulation algorithm with desirable prediction accuracy in order to avoid over optimization and improve computational efficiency different numbers of neurons are selected to train the brbpn model the corresponding errors of the brbpn models with different neurons are tabulated in table 4 it can be seen that both the rmse and the mae decrease and the r2 increases with the increase of the number of neurons form 1 to 5 when the number is greater than 5 the three error indexes remain constant since the brbpn models with 5 10 and 15 neurons have the same good performance the brbpn model with 5 neurons is selected in this study to save the computational cost for the gpr model the parameter training is implemented by the gpml gaussian processes for machine learning toolbox rasmussen and nickisch 2010 in matlab r2014a the gpml provides a variety of covariance functions for measuring similarity between data points and selecting the prior on the latent function such flexibility makes the gpr model highly desirable in predicting structural response in ocean engineering the performance evaluations of four covariance functions with ard based kernels are listed in table 5 the covariance function with ard rq which generates the highest r2 and the lowest rmse and mae outperforms the other three functions as a result the best parameters kernels or algorithms are selected to train the five rms values by the three surrogate models respectively similarly the three error indexes are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed surrogate models based on the stationary and non stationary samples as summarized in table 6 the training results using stationary samples show a similar trend with those using non stationary samples as the stochastic response at different positions of the bridge has obvious differences in amplitudes periods and phases the error indexes have significant differences among the girder the tower and the foundation even for the same surrogate model for a certain rms value these surrogate models show different computational accuracy the performance of the three models is compared to find the best choice for the five rms values respectively the lowest rmse and mae with the highest r2 indicate the best model the results show that the gpr model is recommended to predict the mid span displacement while the svr model is recommended to predict the tower displacement and the bpn model is recommended to predict the internal force of the submerged structure it is worth noting that there are six different optimal models to predict the response of the bridge with the stationary and the non stationary wind and wave fields for a certain method i e svr bpn or gpr the surrogate model itself is the same for the stationary and the non stationary case but their training parameters are different 5 3 non stationary results for multi parameter coupling to study the effects of uncertainties on the bridge response under stationary and non stationary winds and waves each of the five rms values y midspan and z midspan at the mid span z toptower at the top of tower f bottom and m bottom at the bottom of the cap is predicted with the corresponding recommended model the ranges are set as 0 m s 30 m s for u 0 m 6 m for h s and 0 s 15 s for t p the mean values of u h s and t p are 15 m s 3 m and 7 5 s respectively when the effect of one environmental factor is studied the other two environmental factors keep constant and are set to the mean values 5 3 1 mean wind speed fig 9 shows the rms values of the stochastic response at different locations of the bridge under various wind speeds the response of the bridge increases with the increase of wind speed but the variations for the girder the tower and the foundation are different for the girder as shown in fig 9 a and b the mid span displacement first increases slowly when u is small and then increases quickly as u becomes high it is interesting to see the displacement response is almost zero when u h s t p are 0 m s 6 m 7 5 s indicating the mid span displacement response is dominated by the wind speed the lateral displacement at the mid span is larger than its vertical displacement as the wind direction is mainly along the lateral direction of the bridge in comparison with the rms values between the stationary and non stationary wind and wave fields the difference increases with the increase of mean wind speed the maximum difference is 38 2 in terms of z midspan and 27 2 in terms of y midspan when u is 30 m s which indicates that the effect of the non stationary wind and wave fields on lateral displacement is greater than that on vertical displacement for the tower in the non stationary wind and wave fields as shown in fig 9 c the lateral displacement increases from 0 021 m to 0 055 m as the increasing of wind speed from 0 m s to 30 m s different from the girder the tower is still prone to vibrate when u is zero indicating the effect of wave on the displacement of the top of tower for the foundation in the non stationary wind and wave fields as shown in fig 9 d and e the base shear response increases with a percentage of 14 and the base moment response increases with a percentage of 17 with the increase in u from 0 m s to 30 m s however the increment of the internal force at the bottom of cap is smaller than that of the displacement at the girder or the tower a considerable internal force occurs in the foundation when u is zero indicating that the wave has a significant effect on the foundation on the basis of fig 9 a e it is found that the bridge response in the non stationary wind and wave fields is lower than that in the stationary wind and wave fields the influence of the non stationary wind and wave field on the girder is the most significant when compared with that on the tower and the foundation 5 3 2 significant wave height fig 10 shows the rms values of the bridge response under various wave heights the response of different parts of the bridge shows different growth trends as shown in fig 10 a y midspan only increases by 0 3 mm in the non stationary wind and wave fields with the increase in h s from 0 m to 6 m compared with the mean wind speed h s has less effect on the vertical displacement at the mid span as shown in fig 10 b z midspan increases slowly when h s is less than 3 m and then increases much faster when h s is greater than 3 m this means that z midspan is sensitive to higher wave heights while it is dominated by other factors at lower wave heights for the lateral displacement at the top of tower in the non stationary wind and wave fields as shown in fig 10 c it is observed that z toptower increases by 0 53 m from 0 01 m to 0 54 m showing that the h s also has a significant effect on z toptower in comparison with u according to fig 10 d and e both the values of f bottom and m bottom increase linearly they are close to 0 when h s is zero which is significantly different from the effect of u on the internal forces of the foundation this implies that the internal force of the foundation is controlled by wave height in addition by comparing the bridge response between stationary and non stationary wind and wave fields the similar trend observed in the previous section is found the bridge response in stationary wind and wave fields is larger than that in non stationary wind and wave fields and the difference between them increases with the increase of the significant wave height 5 3 3 peak wave period fig 11 shows the rms values of the bridge response under various wave periods the bridge response shows a downward trend with the increase in t p from 0 s to 15 s meaning that the small t p can cause relatively large bridge response in the non stationary wind and wave fields y midspan is reduced by 4 7 from 0 0085 m to 0 0081 m as shown in fig 11 a the effect of the peak wave period on y midspan is very small when compared with the effect of the mean wind speed meanwhile z midspan decreases by 28 6 from 0 021 m to 0 015 m as shown in fig 11 b for z toptower as shown in fig 11 c it first decreases rapidly at lower wave periods and then tends to a constant value at higher wave periods similarly fig 11 d and e show that both f bottom and m bottom drop quickly with the increase in t p from 0 s to 6 s and then decreases slowly as t p goes higher on the basis of fig 11 a e the t p has more significant influence on the response of the tower and the foundation than that of the girder in comparison with the bridge response between stationary and non stationary wind and wave fields the biggest difference is observe in the lowest peak wave period the difference decreases gradually with the increase of the peak wave period 5 3 4 comparison of three variables for the lateral response of the girder by comparing figs 9 a 10 a and 11 a the displacement response caused by wind load is significantly greater than that caused by wave load when the mean wind speed is zero the lateral displacement of the girder is almost zero indicating the z midspan is controlled by wind load similar phenomena are found in the vertical response of the girder showing that wind load dominates the girder response for the internal force response of the foundation on the basis of fig 9 d e 10 d 10 e 10 d and 11 e it is found that the internal force response is more sensitive to significant wave height and peak wave period rather than mean wind speed when the significant wave height is zero both the f bottom and m bottom is almost zero indicating the internal force response of the foundation is controlled by wind load for the lateral response of the tower by comparing figs 9 c 10 c and 11 c it is significantly affected by three environmental variables when the mean wind speed or significant wave height is zero the z toptower are 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively showing the lateral response of the tower is controlled by both the wind and wave loads the tower response due to the wind load is slightly smaller than that caused by the wave load 6 conclusions and remarks this study presents an efficient and reliable framework to calculate the bridge stochastic response based on wwb system under the non stationary wind fields and the non stationary wave fields in order to save computing costs the machine learning algorithms with svr bpn and gpr is adopted to link the multiple stochastic inputs of environment variables and the single output of bridge response a cable stayed bridge is presented to demonstrate the adaptability of the three models and the feasibility of the proposed framework 1 the bridge responses with stationary wind and wave fields are 0 05 16 larger than those with non stationary wind and wave fields compared with the stationary situation weak non stationarity of the wind and wave fields with longer duration d t has smaller effects on the dynamic responses of the bridge while strong non stationarity with shorter duration d t reduces the dynamic responses obviously it is concluded that it is conservative when using stationary wind field and wave field 2 with the non stationary situation the bridge responses caused by the combined wind and wave loads are 0 6 2 5 larger than the sum of the results caused by the wind load alone and the wave load alone showing the coupling effect of the wind and waves 3 all the three models can capture the nonlinear response of the bridge under winds and waves with the lowest coefficient of determination r2 of 0 85 in order to seek higher calculation accuracy the svr model could be selected for predicting the tower displacement the bpn model for predicting the internal force of the foundation and the gpr model for predicting the mid span displacement the values of r2 for the three optimal models all exceed 0 93 4 the mean wind speed the significant wave height and the peak wave period have significant effects on the dynamic responses of the bridge the wind load dominates both the lateral and the vertical displacements of the girder the wave load dominates the internal force of the submerged structure the displacement of the tower top is determined by both the wind and the wave loads this enlightens us that the aerodynamic shape of the bridge could be optimized first when the displacement response of the girder or the tower exceeds the design limit on the other hand the form of pile groups should be optimized first when the internal force of the bridge foundation cannot meet the design requirements further efforts may be pursued in the future to improve the proposed method in the following three aspects first more modeling factors such as the vehicles the geometry of the bridge the temperature the earthquake etc deserve careful consideration to improve the current model second a two dimensional model for winds and waves has been conducted in the present study and a three dimensional model for waves winds currents may provide more reliable results author contribution statement

22048,the prediction of the structural stochastic response under strong winds and waves is important in the design of cross sea bridges with longer spans while the non stationary characteristics of winds and waves may affect the accuracy this paper investigates the effects of non stationary winds and waves on the stochastic response of a cable stayed bridge based on a wind wave bridge wwb system

respectively and the sensitivity analysis reveals the effects of non stationary winds and waves keywords a cable stayed bridge coupled winds and waves non stationary characteristics wind wave bridge system stochastic response surrogate models 1 introduction with the continuous development of construction technology a great number of cross sea bridges have been constructed in recent decades in global coastal communities e g the akashi kaikyo bridge the oresund bridge and the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge with the increases in spans of the girders and heights of the foundations cross sea bridges show flexible dynamic characteristics and are vulnerable to stochastic environmental conditions such as wind and wave loads zhu and zhang 2017 many efforts have been made to investigate the wind induced response of long span bridges by field observations wind tunnel tests or numerical simulations e g fujino 2002 li et al 2018 ma et al 2018 siringoringo and fujino 2012 tang et al 2019 these studies indicated that the wind load plays an essential role in the performance evaluation and the structural safety for the bridges meanwhile the interaction between the wave load and the cross sea bridge has been investigated but the corresponding studies mainly focused on low lying cases e g xu et al 2017 xu and cai 2015 or foundations e g chen et al 2016 wei et al 2013 which shows that huge waves may cause the significant response or even the catastrophic failure of the bridges in both the construction and the service stages recent studies showed that coupled winds and waves possess greater threats to coastal structures and the two loads should be treated simultaneously when predicting the structural stochastic response compared with other coastal structures like tower platforms offshore wind turbines and floating foundations wei et al 2014 zaheer and islam 2017 zhang et al 2013 coastal cable stayed bridges have higher towers and longer girders so the wind and wave loads on the bridges show the following two differences first the fluctuating wind loads on the girders and the towers which have bluff aerodynamic shapes with low natural frequencies in general need to be considered second the wave loads on the foundations with densely arranged piles are difficult to determine due to the interference among the piles and the dynamic response of the foundations also becomes complex in the authors previous studies fang et al 2019a li et al 2019 the time domain and the frequency domain response of a freestanding bridge tower subjected to correlated winds and waves is carefully discussed zhu and zhang 2017 proposed a numerical method to simulate the non stationary wind and wave fields around a coastal slender bridge which provides a feasible framework for investigating stochastic response of bridge under winds and waves meng et al 2018 analyzed the stochastic buffeting response of a coastal bridge under correlated winds and waves five representative cases were used to discuss the dynamic response of the bridge the calculation results showed the significant effects of the correlated winds and waves on the bridge it can be seen from these studies that both the factors should be taken into account when analyzing the dynamic response of coastal structures due to the complex coupling effects among winds waves and long span bridges however the understanding of the bridge stochastic response under extreme conditions is still limited which affects the prediction of the structural stochastic response another issue is how to accurately determine the parameters of winds and waves which are closely related to the stochastic response of bridges generally the environmental parameters for the design of a bridge represent the mean condition for instance the reference wind speed for a bridge is determined by the annual maximum value within 10 min and with a return period of 100 years in china however strong winds and huge waves in real conditions may be non stationary the mean values may change obviously which affect the structural stochastic response some studies concentrated in the non stationary wind field and the effect on bridges hu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 the results showed that the mean wind speed followed a slow changing process during which the maximum wind speed lasts only a short time to predict the structural stochastic response accurately the effects of non stationary winds and waves should be studied the finite element analysis fea is a feasible way but it is time consuming especially when analyzing a long span bridge and a large number of degrees of freedom in some recent studies fea was used for deterministic analyses only to save the cost meng et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 due to the limited results obtained by deterministic analyses it is necessary to develop an efficient and accurate approach to fully compare the stochastic response of bridges under stationary and non stationary environmental conditions nowadays the machine learning has become particularly important for solving such problems in numerical prediction a variety of machine learning algorithms like the support vector machine figueiredo et al 2011 lu et al 2017 shafaei and kisi 2016 the neural network guo et al 2011 shi et al 2019 xu et al 2018 and the gaussian process regression e g zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 have been developed in various research fields these successful applications correlate multiple stochastic inputs and a single output using different algorithms to improve computing efficiency however determining a reasonable algorithm is critical to the accuracy of the prediction and a comparative study of different surrogate models is necessary to obtain the optimal algorithm in this study a framework for calculating the stochastic response of a coastal cable stayed bridge under non stationary winds and waves is proposed deterministic analyses are first performed based on a wind wave bridge wwb model to investigate the effects of non stationary wind fields non stationary wave fields and both the factors on the stochastic response respectively the results of the deterministic analyses are then treated as the train samples and three surrogate models i e the svr the bpn and the gpr models are established and further optimized the accuracy of the three models is compared to determine which one is the most suitable to predict the stochastic response of the girder the tower and the foundation respectively finally the stochastic response of the bridge with stationary and non stationary environmental parameters including the mean wind speed the significant wave height and the peak wave period is computed based on the optimal surrogate model and the difference is fully discussed 2 wind wave bridge system 2 1 engineering background a 90 145 560 145 90 m cable stayed bridge which is one of the channel bridges of a cross sea bridge in the nearshore region of the east china sea is taken as the example around the bridge site there are lots of hills see fig 1 with a marine monsoon climate and the bridge will be easy to attack by strong winds or waves which however may show non stationary characteristics the bridge is composed of a girder two towers four auxiliary piers and a large number of cables the steel truss girder with a width of 22 m and a height of 6 m is adopted each tower with a height of 206 m includes two columns supported by a cap pile foundation which has 38 piles with the radius of 3 4 m and the length of 30 m below the still water level swl the auxiliary piers are built on artificial reefs above the swl 2 2 establishment of the bridge the finite element model of the bridge is established with a total of 5 622 degrees of freedom the girder the towers and the piers are modeled by spatial beam elements the steel truss girder is simplified as a single girder the cables are modeled by uniaxial tension compression link elements a total of 216 cables are built and their initial stress and sag effects are all considered the secondary loads are applied to the corresponding nodes of the bridge by adding mass elements the towers and the auxiliary piers are fixed at the bottom the rayleigh damping as a function of mass and stiffness matrices is utilized to build the bridge damping matrix the damping ratio is 0 5 for steel truss girder the natural frequencies of the first ten modes of the bridge and the corresponding modal shapes are listed in table 1 comparing the first 10 natural frequencies of the bridge with the bridge design institute the maximum absolute error is 2 which implies that the fe model is in good agreement with the design bridge the lateral bending fundamental frequency of the bridge is less than its vertical bending fundamental frequency indicating the lateral response of the girder is more sensitive to external excitation in comparison with vertical response 2 3 simulations of winds and waves after establishing the model wind and wave loads are added on the bridge and the governing equation of the coupled wind wave bridge system can be written as 1 m b u b c

bridge respectively f sb f bub f seb are the static wind forces the buffeting forces and the self excited forces respectively and f wb is the wave forces on the girder of the bridge the static wind forces the buffeting wind forces and the self excited wind forces are considered each wind force components can be divided into drag lift and moment the static wind forces per unit length are computed by 2 f s t d 0 5 Ï u d 2 c d h f s t l 0 5 Ï u d 2 c l b f s t m 0 5 Ï u d 2 c m b 2 where f s t d f s t l f s t m are the static wind drag force the static wind lift force and the static wind

the self excited lift force and the self excited moment respectively p Ï h Ï Î± Ï are the lateral the vertical and the torsional displacement response of the bridge respectively f i j i d l m j p h Î± are the impulse functions determined by flutter derivatives based on the rational approximation approach since the flutter derivatives are normally experimentally determined at discrete values of the reduced frequency k thus approximate expressions are often applied to describe these as continuous functions of k by the rational approximation approach which is widely used in the aerodynamic characteristics i e the flutter derivatives spanwise coherence and admittance function detailed derivation of self excited wind forces on the bridge can be found in chen et al 2000 lin and yang 1983 therefore the total wind induced load f g acting on the girder are given by 9 f g t 0 l g f d t d z 0 l g f l t d z 0 l g f m t d z 0 l g f s t d f b u d t f s e d t d z 0 l g f s t l f b u l t f s e l t d z 0 l g f s t m f b u m t f s e m t d z where f d f l f m are the drag the lift and the moment respectively l g is the length of the girder on the towers of the bridge the static wind forces and the buffeting forces are considered and computed in the same way with the girder as the tower is a typical blunt structure so the self excited forces acting on it are ignored zhu and zhang 2017 on the cap pile foundations of the bridge the wave forces are considered because the size of a pile meets the validity criterion that the ratio of the pile diameter d p to the wave length l is smaller than 0 2 morison equation is used to calculate the wave forces the horizontal wave force per unit length on a pile f w 0 at any instant of time can be expressed as 10 f w 0 0 5 Ï w c d d p u w u b u w u b Ï w a u w c m 1 Ï w a u w u b where Ï w is the water density u w u w are the velocity and acceleration of water quality point u b u b are the velocity and acceleration of a pile a is the cross sectional area of a pile c d c m are the drag coefficient and the inertia coefficient which are taken as 1 2 and 2 0 according to the chinese code jts 145 2015 2015 considering that the wave loads acting on the pile group are significantly different from that on a single isolated pile due to the interference and the shelter effects the total horizontal wave force per unit length on all piles f w at any instant of time is given by 11 f w t j 1 n k 1 m k g j k f w j k t where f w j k is the horizontal wave force of the j kth pile n is the number of columns of piles in the direction of wave propagation m is the number of rows of piles in the perpendicular direction of wave propagation and k g j k is the pile group coefficient of the j kth pile when the wave period is long some pile foundations along the wave direction may be at the wave crest and others at the wave trough at this time the cancellation effect of waves for the pile group foundation may occur and it can be calculated according to eq 11 the experimentally determined coefficients are adopted to determine the pile group coefficients mindao et al 1987 stated that the pile group can be simplified into a side by side arrangement and a tandem arrangement and the interference coefficient and the shelter coefficient are proposed for the two arrangements bonakdar et al 2015 studied the pile group effect by laboratory tests and stated that the shelter coefficient can be taken as 1 0 therefore only the interference effect among the piles is considered k g j k is set to 1 0 for the side piles and computed by 1 265 0 225 ln a d p for the middle piles where a is the distance between two neighbouring piles in the wwb system all forces and moments are exerted on nodes which represent the exact locations of the geometric centroid of the bridge as shown in fig 2 and the simulated loads are equivalent to the actual wind and wave loads considering that the self excited forces and the wave forces are motion dependent the convergence control items are selected for the nodes of the girder and the foundations specifically the newmark Î² method is used to reach the prescribed convergence at each time step the girder is divided into 116 elements and the wind loads are applied on the 117 nodes marked from g1 to g117 each tower column consists of an upper part and a lower part the column is divided into 34 elements and the wind loads are applied on all nodes marked from t1 at the bottom to t21 at the top for the cap pile foundations which support the towers the caps exceed the swl so wave loads only act on the piles each pile has 6 nodes along the height direction and the wave load is applied on all nodes below the swl after establishing the wwb system the structural dynamic response under the stochastic winds and waves could be computed in time domain with the following major procedures the first step is to generate the stochastic wind and wave fields at each of the positions including the fluctuating wind speed the water point velocity and acceleration the second step is to compute the corresponding time varying wind and wave loads the third step is to solve the bridge response through equilibrium iterations until the convergence control items satisfies specific limits at a certain time step t the node forces f old of convergent items are saved from the previous iteration and then the force matrix is updated to obtain new node forces f new at the current iteration the limits of convergence is that the absolute value of relative error of the node forces in two steps f old and f new is less than 1 repeat the above three steps until the computation is completed 3 stochastic response of the bridge non stationary winds and waves are considered individually and simultaneously and the dynamic response of the bridge is computed based on the wwb system there are many variables that have significant influences on the dynamic responses of the bridge such as winds waves vehicles the geometry of the bridge the temperature the earthquake etc however the possibility that some variables affect the bridge simultaneously is very low for instance strong winds and earthquake 3 1 effects of non stationary winds the wind field is composed of the mean wind static wind component plus the fluctuating wind component the mean wind velocity u z changes along the height direction and its expression at a certain height z above the swl is given by 12 u z u 10 ln z z 0 ln 10 z 0 where u 10 is the mean wind speed at 10 m height above the swl and z 0 is the sea surface roughness which is approximately 0 01 m for a rough sea surface specially u z is expressed as u d at the height of the bridge girder for the long span bridge the single point wind field representation may cause the conservative results due to the unrealistic assumption of fully correlated wind field while the multi point wind field representation is more suitable as it considers the effects of partial correlations the multi point wind fields can be generated as a uniformly modulated process the cross spectral density matrix is defined as 13 s 0 w s 11 0 w s 12 0 w s 21 0 w s 22 0 w s 1 n 0 w s 2 n 0 w s n 1 0 w s n 2 0 w s n n 0 w where s k k 0 w s z k w k 1 2 n and s z k w represents the normalized wind spectrum s j k 0 w coh z j z k w s z j w s z k w j k 1 2 n j k the multi point wind speeds consist of the amplitude modulating the sample functions u t u z 1 t u z 2 t u z n t t which is described by its cross spectral density matrix s 0 w the sample functions can be simulated by the spectral representation method srm li et al 2004 let t p Î´ t and the sample functions u t can be rewritten for the application fast fourier transform fft the main equations are summarized as follows 14 f p Î´ t re m 1 j h j m q Î´ t exp i m Î´ w n p Î´ t 15 h j m q Î´ t l 0 2 n 1 b j m l Î´ w exp i l Î´ w q Î´ t 16 b j m l Î´ w 2 Î´ w h j m l Î´ w m Î´ w n exp i Î´ m l 0 0 l n n l m 1 where p 0 1 2 m n 1 q 0 1 2 2 n 1 m 2 n Î´ w w u n w u is upper cutoff frequency and h j m q Î´ t and b j m l Î´ w is a fft pair for the given j and m the kaimal and the lumley panofsky spectra are selected to simulate the fluctuating wind field on the girder and the tower respectively and the davenport coherence function is adopt to simulate the correlation among the different wind speed points li et al 2004 the stationary wind field follows the assumption of an ergodic or stationary random process however the wind field in extreme environment like typhoons hurricanes and tropical cyclones may be a non stationary process as it may change during an extreme case the mean wind component is not suitable to be described as a single value any more vickery et al 2000 studied the observed wind speed based on 90 full scale hurricane wind speed measurements and found that the mean speed within 10 min showed a single peak distribution that is to say the mean wind speed increased first and then decreased in order to simulate the time history of non stationary fluctuating wind speed it is necessary to rewrite the mean wind speed to a time varying value as follows li et al 2017 17 u z t u max d m t 18 d m t exp t t 0 2 2 d t 2 where u z t is the time varying mean wind speed at the height z u max is the maximum mean wind speed during the process d m t is a time varying function t 0 is the time when the wind speed reaches its maximum which is treated as 100 s for the simulation d t is the storm duration once the wind fields of the girder and the tower are simulated the wind loads i e static wind forces resulting from mean wind buffeting forces resulting from wind turbulence and self excited forces resulting from wind bridge interaction can be calculated according to section 2 3 in order to study the influence of non stationary wind field on bridge response two situations are considered first the u max within the non stationary process are set to 10 m s 15 m s and 20 m s respectively for each of the three u max different storm durations d t ranging from 20 s to 400 s with an interval of 20 s are selected without loss of generality the time varying mean wind speeds of partial cases are shown in fig 3 a it is observed that a smaller d t means a steeper change in the non stationary wind fluctuation due to a short non stationarity with the increase in d t the mean wind speed is closer to the u max second the mean of the time varying mean wind speed u mean within the non stationary process keeps constant also three different values of u mean with twenty different d t are considered the time varying mean wind speeds of partial cases are shown in fig 3 b in this section the wave field is regarded as stationary the root mean square rms values of the lateral displacement at the mid span rms zg the lateral displacement at the top of tower rms zt and the shear at the bottom of the cap rms s under various mean wind speeds are illustrated in fig 4 in the stationary wind fields the rms values are represented as rms st and shown with the red straight lines fig 4 a shows rms st under the stationary wind fields and rms zg the non stationary wind fields the values of rms st are 0 0115 m 0 0163 m and 0 0231 m when the mean wind speeds are 10 m s 15 m s and 20 m s respectively the increasing trend of rms zg slows down gradually with the increase of the d t and finally tends to the constant value as the same as rms st this means that the greater the fluctuation of u z j t the lower rms zg for the same d t rms zg also increases with the increase of the u max or u mean the same phenomenon is found at the top of tower i e rms zt and the bottom of the cap i e rms s as shown in fig 4 b and c in comparison with the response of the bridge under the stationary and the non stationary wind fields d t is set to 20 s and u max or u mean is set to 15 m s rms zg decreases from 0 0163 m to 0 0141 m with a percentage of 13 5 for u max and to 0 0149 m with a percentage of 8 6 for u mean rms zt decreases from 0 01945 m to 0 01904 m with a percentage of 0 2 for u max and to 0 01939 m with a percentage of 0 03 for u mean rms s decreases from 6 64 10 7 n to 6 52 10 7 n with a percentage of 1 8 for u max and to 6 61 10 7 n with a percentage of 0 05 for u mean it can be seen that the non stationary wind fields have significant effects on the buffeting response of the girder rather than the tower and the foundation when u max and u mean are the same the rms value in the latter case is larger due to the larger mean wind speed with the increase of d t the rms value for u mean quickly approaches to and slightly exceeds rms st while that for u max slowly approaches to but is smaller than rms st this implies that the bridge response for u mean is closer to that in the stationary wind field compared with the bridge response for u max 3 2 effects of non stationary waves in this study the water particle velocity and acceleration have been evaluated using multidirectional wave surface which are assumed as the summation of a finite number of cosine wave components the value of wave elevation Ï z t as a function of z and t is given by 19 Ï z t m 1 m i 1 i a m i cos w m t k m z Îµ m i where w m k m are the frequency and the number of the mth wave component Îµ m i is the random initial phase of the mth and the ith wave

directional distribution function using mitsuyasu type spreading function Î´ w m w max w min m is the frequency resolution dividing wave spectra into m unequal sub ranges Î´ Î¸ i Î¸ max Î¸ min i is the direction resolution which means that each wave component comes from i different directions the double superposition method is used to generate multidirectional random waves the mitsuyasu type directional wave spectrum is given by 20 g f Î¸ g 0 cos Ï Î¸ Î¸ 0 2 Î¸ max 2 s where g 0 Ï 2 Î¸ max Î³ s 1 Î³ s 0 5 Î³ is the gamma function Î¸ 0 is the main wave direction which is perpendicular to the bridge axis in this study s is the spreading parameter determined by 21 s s max f f p 5 s max f f p 2 5 f f p f f p where f and f p are the frequency and the spectral peak frequency the value of s max is treated as 10 for wind waves proposed by goda and suzuki 1975 according to the wave spreading function it can be found that the energy in the main wave direction assumed as 0 is the largest and it decreases gradually with the wave incident direction from 0 to Ï to simulate non stationary wave fields the time varying mean wind speed is introduced into the jonswap spectrum and the stationary wave spectrum can be extended to simulate non stationary wave fields the expression of the time varying wave spectrum is given by 22 s w t Î± s t g 2 1 w 5 exp 5 4 w p w 4 r exp w w p 2 2 Ï 2 w p 2 where the coefficient Î± s t is obtained by 0 076 u z j t f g 0 22 and f is the fetch distance the peak circular frequency w p is obtained by 22 g 2 u 10 t f 1 3 r is the peak enhancement factor Ï 0 09 when w w p or Ï 0 07 when w w p f 100 km and r 3 3 are selected then the influence of the non stationary wave field on the bridge response is studied u max and u mean are set to 15 m s respectively they are used to simulate two non stationary wave fields while the wind load acting on the bridge is stationary fig 5 shows rms zg rms zt and rms s in the stationary and the non stationary wave fields in the stationary wave field the values of rms st are 0 0163 m in terms of the lateral displacement at the mid span 0 01945 m in terms of the lateral displacement at the top of tower and 6 64 10 7 n in terms of the shear at the bottom of the cap similar to the effects of the non stationary wind fields as discussed above the bridge response under the non stationary wave field simulated by u max is smaller than that by u mean the rms values of the bridge response for both u max and u mean tend to be constant value with the increase of the d t when d t is 20 s by comparing the stationary and the non stationary wave fields rms zg decreases by 1 2 and 0 06 from 0 0163 m to 0 0161 m for u max and 0 0162 m for u mean rms zt decreases by 2 0 and 0 05 from 0 01945 m to 0 01907 m for u max and 0 01935 m for u mean rms s decreases by 8 6 and 5 1 from 6 64 10 7 n to 6 07 10 7 n for u max and 6 30 10 7 n for u mean compared with the effects of the non stationary wind fields on the bridge response the non stationary wave fields have more significant effects on rms s while have slight effects on rms zg and rms zt showing that the internal force of bridge foundation is more sensitive to the wave rather than the wind 3 3 effects of both the two factors the wind and wave loads are assumed to be unidirectional and perpendicular to the bridge axis fig 6 shows the buffeting response of the bridge tower the girder and the foundation under the non stationary wind and wave field u max or u mean is set to 15 m s and d t ranges from 20 s to 400 s at an interval of 20 s when d t is equal to 20 s for instance rms zg decreases by 16 0 and 9 2 from 0 0163m to 0 0137 m for u max and 0 0148 m for u mean rms zt decreases by 4 7 and 0 08 from 0 01945 m to 0 01854 m for u max and 0 01929 m for u mean rms s decreases by 11 0 and 5 6 from 6 64 10 7 n to 5 91 10 7 n for u max and 6 27 10 7 n for u mean the bridge response is more significant in non stationary wind and wave fields than that in non stationary wind or wave fields the fluctuation amplitude of bridge response e g 16 0 for u max and 9 2 for u mean in non stationary wind and wave fields is greater than the superposition of that e g 13 5 plus 1 2 for u max and 8 6 plus 0 06 for u mean in two single non stationary wind wave fields with the non stationary situation the bridge responses caused by the combined wind and wave loads are larger than the sum of the results caused by the wind load alone and the wave load alone the coupling effect of the combined wind and wave load leads to a more significant effect on the bridge response compared with the wind load alone plus the wave load alone by comparing the response of the bridge tower the girder and the foundation it is noted that the girder and the foundation are greatly affected by the non stationary wind and wave fields while the tower is less affected nevertheless it is essential to consider non stationary wind and wave fields to evaluate bridge response more accurately 4 three surrogate models in order to study the influence of environmental parameters on bridges more systematically it is necessary to develop an efficient way to evaluate structural dynamic response the most essential aspect of the dynamic analysis of the wwb system is to establish a surrogate model to correlate the dynamic loads and the statistics of stochastic response in this study three surrogate models are briefly introduced as follows 4 1 svr the svr model is widely used technique dealing with non linear mapping relationship smola and schÃ¶lkopf 2004 yu et al 2017 the principal procedure of the svr model is to construct the correlation f x between input data x i and output data y i the input data will be conveyed into a high dimensional feature space and then solving a linear regression in this space the input output data constitute training sample set d x i y i i 1 2 n n is the total number of data the regression function of the svr is defined by 23 f x w t Ï x b where Ï represents the nonlinear mapping function w and b are the weight and the intercept of the optimal regression model which are estimated by the structural risk minimizing principle the process for finding the regression parameter of the svr model can be transformed into the primal quadratic optimization problem as follows 24 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i Î´ i Î´ i w b Î´ i Î´ i 25 subject to y i w t Ï x i b Îµ Î´ i w t Ï x i b y i Îµ Î´ i Î´ i Î´ i 0 where c represents the box constraint between the empirical and generalization errors Î´ t and Î´ t are the slack variables for the two mutually exclusive situations which are to calculate the difference between the actual value and the boundary value the constrained optimization problem can be solved by the lagrange multiplier optimal programming method moura et al 2011 finally the estimated regression function for predicting new value is derived as 26 f x i 1 m Î± i Ï x x i b where Ï x x i is the kernel function like the linear the sigmoid the polynomial and the gaussian kernels m is the total number of kernel functions Î± i is the weight of the ith kernel function 4 2 bpn as one of the most popular artificial neural network ann algorithms the bp neural network bpn and its improved algorithm are widely used to simulate mathematical equations of mapping relations between input and output data e g ding et al 2011 li et al 2012 in this study the bayesian regularised bpn model brbpn is used to train the fea results and predict the stochastic response of cross sea bridge compared with conventional neural network models brbpn can not only take advantages of high convergence speed of neural network model but also automatically optimize regularization parameters and the neural networks weights based on bayesian method the bp neural network which generally consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer is designed to minimize the total error or mean error between the actual value and the predicted value in the basis of a gradient descent method the traditional structure of a three layer bpn model is shown in fig 7 the training process of the bpn model can be illustrated as follows a initialize parameters of bpn model including the input data x i i 1 2 n the output data y k j 1 2 n the initial weights w i j linking the input and the hidden layers and w j k linking the hidden and the output layers b calculate output value h j in hidden layers and o k in output layers using the neuron activation function c adjust the weights and the thresholds by the gradient descent method until the error e k 0 5 y k o k 2 satisfies the specified limit in order to improve the generalisation ability and overcome the over fitting problem in the training process in the neural network the bayesian regularised method is introduced into the bpn model the training objective function is defined as 27 f w Î± e w Î² e d where e w e d are the sum of squared weights and the sum of errors of bpn model Î± Î² are objective parameters controlling the distribution of other parameters the bayesian method is used to derive the posterior probability distribution of weights the density function for the weights is given by 28 p w d Î± Î² m p d w Î² m p w Î± m p d Î± Î² m 1 z f Î± Î² exp f w where m is the bpn model proposed in this work p w Î± m is the prior density representing the known weights of the neural networks p d w Î² m is the likelihood function representing the probability of the data occurring and p d Î± Î² m is the normalization factor guaranteeing the total probability of 1 z f Î± Î² is the measured parameter determined by the taylor series expansion from formula 14 z f Î± Î² is unrelated to the value of w therefore the minimum value of objective function f w can be obtained at the maximum of posterior distribution which can be solved by the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and the gauss newton approximation detailed derivation process can be found in sun et al 2017 4 3 gpr gaussian process regression gpr zhang et al 2016 have convenient properties in numerical prediction which be used to specify distributions with various functional forms the gaussian process is adopted as a prior to simulate the distribution over the lateral functions suppose that a training data set d x i y i i 1 2 m is composed of m samples with p dimensional feature space where x i represents an p dimension input vector and y i represents a one dimension output vector the relationship between inputs and outputs is given by 29 y f x Îµ where f x represents the true output Îµ represents the noise in experimental data or the errors in numerical results which is assumed to be an independent identically distributed gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance Î´ n 2 in the basis of formula 15 the likelihood is given by 30 p y f n y f Î´ n 2 i where f f x 1 f x 2 f x m t i is the m m unit matrix p f n f 0 k is the marginal distribution which follows a zero mean gaussian process whose covariance defined by gram matrix k i j k x i x j because both the likelihood p y f and the prior p f follow the gaussian distribution the marginal distribution p y is deduced as 31 p y p y f p f d f n f 0 k y where k y k Î´ n 2 i the gpr model assumed to follow a multivariate gaussian distribution the input data x x consist of the training input vector x and the target value x the output data y y consist of the observed vector y and the new value y the joint probability distribution of the output data is given by 32 y y f f Îµ Îµ 0 k y k k t k Î´ n 2 where f f x is the latent function value for the training input vector x Îµ is the corresponding noise term k k x x 1 k x x m t and k k x x according to conditioning gaussians the predictive distribution p y y is also a gaussian process with its mean and covariance defined as 33 m x k t k y 1 y 34 Î´ 2 x k k t k y 1 k Î´ n 2 considering the numerical stability in computational process the covariance matrix can be solved using the cholesky decomposition 4 4 proposed method a numerical framework is developed for the stochastic response of the cross sea bridge under winds and waves integrating the deterministic wwb system and a machine learning algorithm after performed the multi scale fea in wwb system the statistics of the stochastic response are obtained as the train samples for the surrogate model all the svr brbpn and gpr models are available to predict the new value the whole process shown in fig 8 can be explained as follows step 1 preform the wwb system to obtain multi scale train samples refer to section 2 step 2 establish the three surrogate models linking the single dynamic response of bridges and multiple stochastic wind and wave parameters a svr model approximate the response functions between structural response and environmental variables the train parameters are optimized by cross validation and the kernel

regularization algorithm c gpr model construct the predictive gp surrogate model the most suitable covariance function is identified by the validation of the testing samples step 3 generate large amounts of loading samples to simulate wind and wave parameters by uniform design sampling uds which are orthogonal and uniformly scattered in the design domain step 4 predict bridge response through the three surrogate models in the stationary and non stationary wind and wave fields respectively 5 comparative analysis 5 1 training sample three input variables i e the mean wind speed u the significant wave height h s and the peak wave period t p are provided as random environmental variables according to the field measured data within 10 years u mainly ranges from 0 to 30 m s h s from 0 to 6 m t p from 0 to 14 s a total of 100 combinations of the three variables which are uniformly distributed in their respective measured ranges are generated to perform the wwb procedures according to the stationary theory and non stationary theory respectively after performing 200 fea simulations 200 training samples are obtained 100 samples in the stationary wind and wave fields and 100 samples in the non stationary wind and wave fields the two sets of samples are used to train three surrogate models respectively generally speaking the calculation time needs to be more than 10 times of the smallest significant natural period of the bridge in this study the largest significant natural period of the bridge is 11 2 s corresponding to the fundamental frequency 0 089 hz as a result the calculation time of 200 s is chosen based on the experience of existing literature zhu et al 2018 in addition the root mean square rms value of bridge response should remain stable according to the preliminary sensitivity analyses the calculation time of 200 s was selected in the simulation to provide the stable results for the bridge with affordable computational costs since the calculation time of each combination is 200 s d t is set as 100 s in the non stationary wind and wave fields the time varying mean wind speed is determined according to eqs 9 and 10 after running about 10 days with two workstations equipped with an intel xeon e5 2650v5 3 40 ghz cpu and 16 gb memory size the stochastic response of bridge and the corresponding rms values are obtained the three environmental variables as input data and the rms values as output data constitute training sample set d for the three surrogate models in order to validate the models three error indexes are adopted to measure the deviation between the predicted values by the surrogate models and the computed values by fea which contain the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the coefficient of determination which is also called as the squares of the regression r 2 35 rmse i 1 n 0 y i y Ë i 2 n 0 36 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y Ë i 37 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y Ë i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i and y Ë i i 1 n 0 are the ith observed and predicted values y is the mean value of observed values n 0 is the total number of output data 5 2 optimization and contrast test for the three surrogate models due to the strong nonlinear relation between input and output data it is necessary to find the appropriate parameters for the three surrogate models which can be essential to get both high quality predictions and insights into the properties of the data taking the 100 non stationary samples as an example the training parameters and the internal algorithms are optimized in the three surrogate models respectively the input data include the three environmental variables with u h s and t p the output data include the rms values of the vertical and lateral displacement at the mid span y midspan z midspan the lateral displacement at the top of tower z toptower and the shear and moment at the bottom of the cap f bottom m bottom in each training process only one of the five rms values is used as the output variable in other words five sub models are used in the training process 100 samples are divided into two groups one with 75 samples for training the surrogate models and the other with 25 samples for validation and identifying the best model without loss of generality z midspan is treated as the output variable to elaborate the optimization process for the svr model the parameter training is completed using the installation package libsvm in matlab r2014a which is widely used in solving svr optimization problems chang and lin 2011 three different kernels i e the linear the polynomial and the gaussian kernels are applied to the svr model the comparison results are shown in table 2 it is observed that compared with the svr models with the linear and the polynomial kernel functions the svr model with the gaussian kernel function has the minimum errors in terms of the rmse and the mae and the maximum in terms of the r2 meaning that the svr model with the gaussian kernel function shows the best performance in addition in order to further improve the fitting accuracy the cross validation function in the installation package is used to find the best parameters c of 0 95 and g of 0 07 which are the optimal parameters in the svr model for the bpn model the parameter training is performed by the neural network toolbox in matlab r2014a which is a powerful tool for system analyzing and designing of the neural network as there are various optimization algorithms for the bpn model the proposed brbpn algorithm is compared with other four common algorithms i e the levenberg marquardt the quasi newton the fletcher reeves and the powell beal algorithms the results of the three indexes are summarized in table 3 it is observed that the brbpn model generates the highest accuracy than the other four models indicating that the bpn model is optimized by the bayesian regulation algorithm with desirable prediction accuracy in order to avoid over optimization and improve computational efficiency different numbers of neurons are selected to train the brbpn model the corresponding errors of the brbpn models with different neurons are tabulated in table 4 it can be seen that both the rmse and the mae decrease and the r2 increases with the increase of the number of neurons form 1 to 5 when the number is greater than 5 the three error indexes remain constant since the brbpn models with 5 10 and 15 neurons have the same good performance the brbpn model with 5 neurons is selected in this study to save the computational cost for the gpr model the parameter training is implemented by the gpml gaussian processes for machine learning toolbox rasmussen and nickisch 2010 in matlab r2014a the gpml provides a variety of covariance functions for measuring similarity between data points and selecting the prior on the latent function such flexibility makes the gpr model highly desirable in predicting structural response in ocean engineering the performance evaluations of four covariance functions with ard based kernels are listed in table 5 the covariance function with ard rq which generates the highest r2 and the lowest rmse and mae outperforms the other three functions as a result the best parameters kernels or algorithms are selected to train the five rms values by the three surrogate models respectively similarly the three error indexes are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed surrogate models based on the stationary and non stationary samples as summarized in table 6 the training results using stationary samples show a similar trend with those using non stationary samples as the stochastic response at different positions of the bridge has obvious differences in amplitudes periods and phases the error indexes have significant differences among the girder the tower and the foundation even for the same surrogate model for a certain rms value these surrogate models show different computational accuracy the performance of the three models is compared to find the best choice for the five rms values respectively the lowest rmse and mae with the highest r2 indicate the best model the results show that the gpr model is recommended to predict the mid span displacement while the svr model is recommended to predict the tower displacement and the bpn model is recommended to predict the internal force of the submerged structure it is worth noting that there are six different optimal models to predict the response of the bridge with the stationary and the non stationary wind and wave fields for a certain method i e svr bpn or gpr the surrogate model itself is the same for the stationary and the non stationary case but their training parameters are different 5 3 non stationary results for multi parameter coupling to study the effects of uncertainties on the bridge response under stationary and non stationary winds and waves each of the five rms values y midspan and z midspan at the mid span z toptower at the top of tower f bottom and m bottom at the bottom of the cap is predicted with the corresponding recommended model the ranges are set as 0 m s 30 m s for u 0 m 6 m for h s and 0 s 15 s for t p the mean values of u h s and t p are 15 m s 3 m and 7 5 s respectively when the effect of one environmental factor is studied the other two environmental factors keep constant and are set to the mean values 5 3 1 mean wind speed fig 9 shows the rms values of the stochastic response at different locations of the bridge under various wind speeds the response of the bridge increases with the increase of wind speed but the variations for the girder the tower and the foundation are different for the girder as shown in fig 9 a and b the mid span displacement first increases slowly when u is small and then increases quickly as u becomes high it is interesting to see the displacement response is almost zero when u h s t p are 0 m s 6 m 7 5 s indicating the mid span displacement response is dominated by the wind speed the lateral displacement at the mid span is larger than its vertical displacement as the wind direction is mainly along the lateral direction of the bridge in comparison with the rms values between the stationary and non stationary wind and wave fields the difference increases with the increase of mean wind speed the maximum difference is 38 2 in terms of z midspan and 27 2 in terms of y midspan when u is 30 m s which indicates that the effect of the non stationary wind and wave fields on lateral displacement is greater than that on vertical displacement for the tower in the non stationary wind and wave fields as shown in fig 9 c the lateral displacement increases from 0 021 m to 0 055 m as the increasing of wind speed from 0 m s to 30 m s different from the girder the tower is still prone to vibrate when u is zero indicating the effect of wave on the displacement of the top of tower for the foundation in the non stationary wind and wave fields as shown in fig 9 d and e the base shear response increases with a percentage of 14 and the base moment response increases with a percentage of 17 with the increase in u from 0 m s to 30 m s however the increment of the internal force at the bottom of cap is smaller than that of the displacement at the girder or the tower a considerable internal force occurs in the foundation when u is zero indicating that the wave has a significant effect on the foundation on the basis of fig 9 a e it is found that the bridge response in the non stationary wind and wave fields is lower than that in the stationary wind and wave fields the influence of the non stationary wind and wave field on the girder is the most significant when compared with that on the tower and the foundation 5 3 2 significant wave height fig 10 shows the rms values of the bridge response under various wave heights the response of different parts of the bridge shows different growth trends as shown in fig 10 a y midspan only increases by 0 3 mm in the non stationary wind and wave fields with the increase in h s from 0 m to 6 m compared with the mean wind speed h s has less effect on the vertical displacement at the mid span as shown in fig 10 b z midspan increases slowly when h s is less than 3 m and then increases much faster when h s is greater than 3 m this means that z midspan is sensitive to higher wave heights while it is dominated by other factors at lower wave heights for the lateral displacement at the top of tower in the non stationary wind and wave fields as shown in fig 10 c it is observed that z toptower increases by 0 53 m from 0 01 m to 0 54 m showing that the h s also has a significant effect on z toptower in comparison with u according to fig 10 d and e both the values of f bottom and m bottom increase linearly they are close to 0 when h s is zero which is significantly different from the effect of u on the internal forces of the foundation this implies that the internal force of the foundation is controlled by wave height in addition by comparing the bridge response between stationary and non stationary wind and wave fields the similar trend observed in the previous section is found the bridge response in stationary wind and wave fields is larger than that in non stationary wind and wave fields and the difference between them increases with the increase of the significant wave height 5 3 3 peak wave period fig 11 shows the rms values of the bridge response under various wave periods the bridge response shows a downward trend with the increase in t p from 0 s to 15 s meaning that the small t p can cause relatively large bridge response in the non stationary wind and wave fields y midspan is reduced by 4 7 from 0 0085 m to 0 0081 m as shown in fig 11 a the effect of the peak wave period on y midspan is very small when compared with the effect of the mean wind speed meanwhile z midspan decreases by 28 6 from 0 021 m to 0 015 m as shown in fig 11 b for z toptower as shown in fig 11 c it first decreases rapidly at lower wave periods and then tends to a constant value at higher wave periods similarly fig 11 d and e show that both f bottom and m bottom drop quickly with the increase in t p from 0 s to 6 s and then decreases slowly as t p goes higher on the basis of fig 11 a e the t p has more significant influence on the response of the tower and the foundation than that of the girder in comparison with the bridge response between stationary and non stationary wind and wave fields the biggest difference is observe in the lowest peak wave period the difference decreases gradually with the increase of the peak wave period 5 3 4 comparison of three variables for the lateral response of the girder by comparing figs 9 a 10 a and 11 a the displacement response caused by wind load is significantly greater than that caused by wave load when the mean wind speed is zero the lateral displacement of the girder is almost zero indicating the z midspan is controlled by wind load similar phenomena are found in the vertical response of the girder showing that wind load dominates the girder response for the internal force response of the foundation on the basis of fig 9 d e 10 d 10 e 10 d and 11 e it is found that the internal force response is more sensitive to significant wave height and peak wave period rather than mean wind speed when the significant wave height is zero both the f bottom and m bottom is almost zero indicating the internal force response of the foundation is controlled by wind load for the lateral response of the tower by comparing figs 9 c 10 c and 11 c it is significantly affected by three environmental variables when the mean wind speed or significant wave height is zero the z toptower are 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively showing the lateral response of the tower is controlled by both the wind and wave loads the tower response due to the wind load is slightly smaller than that caused by the wave load 6 conclusions and remarks this study presents an efficient and reliable framework to calculate the bridge stochastic response based on wwb system under the non stationary wind fields and the non stationary wave fields in order to save computing costs the machine learning algorithms with svr bpn and gpr is adopted to link the multiple stochastic inputs of environment variables and the single output of bridge response a cable stayed bridge is presented to demonstrate the adaptability of the three models and the feasibility of the proposed framework 1 the bridge responses with stationary wind and wave fields are 0 05 16 larger than those with non stationary wind and wave fields compared with the stationary situation weak non stationarity of the wind and wave fields with longer duration d t has smaller effects on the dynamic responses of the bridge while strong non stationarity with shorter duration d t reduces the dynamic responses obviously it is concluded that it is conservative when using stationary wind field and wave field 2 with the non stationary situation the bridge responses caused by the combined wind and wave loads are 0 6 2 5 larger than the sum of the results caused by the wind load alone and the wave load alone showing the coupling effect of the wind and waves 3 all the three models can capture the nonlinear response of the bridge under winds and waves with the lowest coefficient of determination r2 of 0 85 in order to seek higher calculation accuracy the svr model could be selected for predicting the tower displacement the bpn model for predicting the internal force of the foundation and the gpr model for predicting the mid span displacement the values of r2 for the three optimal models all exceed 0 93 4 the mean wind speed the significant wave height and the peak wave period have significant effects on the dynamic responses of the bridge the wind load dominates both the lateral and the vertical displacements of the girder the wave load dominates the internal force of the submerged structure the displacement of the tower top is determined by both the wind and the wave loads this enlightens us that the aerodynamic shape of the bridge could be optimized first when the displacement response of the girder or the tower exceeds the design limit on the other hand the form of pile groups should be optimized first when the internal force of the bridge foundation cannot meet the design requirements further efforts may be pursued in the future to improve the proposed method in the following three aspects first more modeling factors such as the vehicles the geometry of the bridge the temperature the earthquake etc deserve careful consideration to improve the current model second a two dimensional model for winds and waves has been conducted in the present study and a three dimensional model for waves winds currents may provide more reliable results author contribution statement

22049,numerical study is conducted on flow induced vibrations fivs of three circular cylinders arranged in tandem with spacing ratio l d 5 5 in planar shear flow the cylinders are free to vibration in both in line and transverse directions a four step semi implicit characteristic based split 4 sicbs finite element method is adopted to solve the governing navier stokes equations the mass ratio of each cylinder is set as m r 2 0 and the structural damping ratio as zero to maximize the flow induced responses of the cylinders the effects of three main parameters such as the reynolds number re 80 120 160 the shear ratio k 0 0 0 05 0 1 and the reduced velocity u r 3 21 are considered the changes of vibration amplitudes frequency characteristics motion trajectories and flow characteristics are analyzed the results show that the dynamic responses of the upstream cylinder are similar to those of an isolated cylinder the re k and u r play a more important role in the fivs of the midstream and downstream cylinders as re 120 the dynamic responses of the cylinders change slightly with the increasing of re while they present a dramatic increase because of the unstable flow characteristic at re 160 additionally with the increasing of re the vibration response mechanism of the cylinders in the in line direction will change from resonance phenomenon into the vortex interference for the motion orbits of the circular cylinders in additional to the eight figure raindrop oval and irregular shape the dual raindrop dual eight and dual oval sharp are observed finally regarding the flow field it is found that the interference of the wake vortex is highly affected by the shear ratio of the incoming flow resulting in great changes on the wake pattern and dynamic responses especially the 2t wake pattern is observed keywords flow induced vibration three tandem circular cylinders dynamic response wake characteristics finite element method 1 introduction when the flow passes through cylinder structures flow induced vibration fiv will occur causing vortex shedding and force fluctuations which may bring severe structural damages and even catastrophic consequences in practical engineering such as marine risers marine platforms and heat exchanger tubes therefore during the last two decades the problem of fiv has always been one of the research hotspots as has been demonstrated in a series of review papers chen 1986 paÃ¯doussis and price 1988 williamson and govardhan 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 wu et al 2012 in practical engineering offshore and ocean structures always have components with multiple cylinder shapes for multiple cylinders arranged in tandem the dynamic responses and interference mechanisms are expected to be more intricate in comparison with an isolated cylinder which will attribute to weak strong interference between wake and structure according to the previous researches papaioannou et al 2008 bao et al 2012 carmo et al 2013 zhu et al 2019 yu et al 2016 a number of basic parameters such as the spacing ratio l d l being the center to center distance and d the cylinder diameter the natural frequency ratio f n x f n y f n x is the in line natural frequency of the cylinder and f n y the transverse one the reynolds number re re Ïu c d Î½ with u c defined as the inlet flow velocity Ï the flow density and Î½ the fluid kinematic viscosity the cylinder section shape and the total cylinder number etc are considered to influence significantly the fiv responses of the tandem cylinders fivs of two cylinders arranged in tandem have been investigated extensively papaioannou et al 2008 numerically studied the vortex induced vibration viv responses of two tandem circular cylinders with various spacing ratios the single cylinder case was also examined for reference and comparison it was found that the maximum oscillation amplitude was larger and the corresponding range was wider for the upstream cylinder in reattachment regime l d 2 5 and 3 5 mittal and his team members suggested that the downstream circular cylinder oscillated in both in line and transverse directions with a large amplitude for the case of re 100 and l d 5 5 prasanth and mittal 2009 mittal and kumar 2001 and the transverse response outside the laminar flow region was very similar to that of an isolated circular cylinder at higher re in addition the influence of the spacing ratio 1 5 3 4 5 6 on the viv of a circular cylinder with a c shape plate arranged in its wake for re 100 was analyzed by zhu and wang 2019 five flow regimes i e the extended body regime the front face reattachment regime the shear layer combination regime the one row co shedding regime and the two row co shedding regime were identified bao et al 2012 analyzed the influences of the natural frequency ratio of two tandem circular cylinders for re 150 the dual resonant response and p s wake pattern p stands for a pair of vortices and s a single vortex were observed additionally their results showed that for the downstream cylinder the natural frequency ratio influenced on the dynamic characteristics more in the in line direction than the transverse one carmo et al 2013 investigated a circular cylinder using both two and three dimensional simulations for fivs when subjected to wake interference with re ranging from 100 to 645 mysa et al 2017 numerically examined the downstream circular cylinder arranged in an in line pattern with subcritical reynolds numbers 5000 re 10 000 for its transverse wake induced vibration wiv there were two different response regimes the viv resonance dominated and the combined viv and wiv could be observed on the other hand qin et al 2018 experimentally investigated fiv s characteristics of two tandem circular cylinders the effects of six different natural frequency ratios were analyzed and three regimes namely no lock in vortex excitation galloping regimes were distinguished meanwhile xu et al 2019 observed through experiments the galloping phenomenon when the maximum amplitudes were reached by upstream and downstream circular cylinders to examine the effect of the section shape of the upstream structure on the wake interference and wiv three different shapes square rectangular and triangular prism were applied by zhu et al 2019 their results showed that the maximum lift force and transverse amplitude could be observed when the circular cylinder was behind a square prism as the cylinder number continues to increase up to three the dynamic responses and flow characteristics of the cylinders in tandem arrangement would get more complex among others the fivs of three circular cylinders arranged in tandem were carried out by yu et al 2016 a chaotic response was observed in the free oscillations in both directions of three tandem cylinders even at low re 100 and 150 compared to the two cylinders there was about a 25 increase in the transverse amplitude and the vibration trajectories of the triple cylinder case were dominated by bounded random movements hence they suggested that it would be dangerous to predict the fiv responses of multiple tandem cylinders mahmoud and atef 2018 numerically investigated the effects of the spacing ratio between the two upstream stationary cylinders on the fiv response and wake pattern of the downstream cylinder it was found that a higher harmonic was caused in the spectrum of the lift force because of the appearance of reattachment and the vortices in the gap between the cylinders interacted with the downstream structure which created a driving force that maintained a high vibration amplitude at higher reduced velocities chen et al 2018 further studied the spacing effect l d 1 2 5 0 on vivs of three tandem cylinders vibrating in the transverse direction large vibration amplitudes of the cylinders were observed to be excited under different spacing ratios at re 100 while the interference mechanism changed from wake induced galloping wg l d 1 2 to viv l d 1 5 5 0 by increasing l d wang et al 2019 experimentally investigated the fiv response of three flexible tandem cylinders with comparison with the single and two tandem cylinders cases the results suggested that the upstream cylinder s shielding effects and the downstream cylinder s vibration induced the suppression of the amplitude of the midstream cylinder in certain reduced velocity ranges however in engineering applications the fluid velocity changes significantly with the variation of space and time which gives rise to the results obtained under uniform flow condition not exactly applicable in practical cases therefore numerous studies have been carried out on fivs of cylinder systems subjected to non uniform flows which can be mainly summarized on poiseuille flow lin et al 2013 jiang and lin 2016 oscillatory flow zhao et al 2012 munir et al 2018 and shear flow zhang et al 2014 tu et al 2014 2015 gsell et al 2017 sun et al 2017 in comparison with uniform flow the presence of the inflow velocity gradient would affect the wake distribution between both sides of the cylinder which might make the dynamic responses even more complicate to predict at present the researches on the planar shear flow cylinder are mostly focusing on the single cylinder case such as the work by zhang et al 2014 and tu et al 2014 they suggested that the lock in region widened with the increase of shear ratio gsell et al 2017 numerically investigated the fivs of a circular cylinder subjected to the linear planar shear flow at re 100 it was found that the maximum amplitude in in line direction reached as high as 2d which was larger than that of the transverse direction meanwhile sun et al 2017 numerically investigated the vivs of a square cylinder immersed in the planar shear flow at re 80 and 160 the wake pattern were dominated by 2s and p s modes in the shear flow in addition the fivs of two tandem circular cylinders immersed in planar shear flow were numerically studied by tu et al 2015 it was demonstrated that three different parameters namely shear ratio k reduced velocity u r and spacing ratio l d had significant influences they pointed out that the in line response would be more sensitive to the variation of shear ratio than the transverse one the motion orbit of the cylinder transformed from the figure eight to the raindrop and irregular shape with the increasing of shear ratio moreover the wake pattern t p was observed and the corresponding mechanism was analyzed many engineering applications such as the bridge cables submarine pipelines are often arranged in a series of three or more circular cylinders however to the best of the author knowledge the investigations of fivs of three tandem circular cylinders in planer shear flow is very limited while the dynamic responses and mechanisms are still unclear this study will numerically investigate such a topic and some questions should be considered 1 compared to the isolated and two cylinders cases how the vibration amplitudes frequencies and tracjectories of three tandem circular cylinders subjected to the shear flow change 2 how the shear ratio impact on the dynamic responses of midstream and downstream cylinders 3 what the internal mechanism of the effect of shear rate on structures is in addtion it can be summarized from yu et al 2016 that the variation from re 100 to 150 in the laminar flow range has an effect on the vibration responses of three cylinders arranged in tandem immersed in uniform flow then how about the shear flow case hence the object of this work is to investigate the influences of fundamental parameters like re k and u r on the fiv responses and to provide a theoretical basis for comprehending the mechanism of fivs for three cylinders immersed in shear flow this paper is organized as follows the second section will introduce the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale forms of the fluid governing equations the solid dynamic equations and the corresponding four step semi implicit characteristic based split 4 sicbs algorithm in order to verify the correctness of the computational code the fivs of the two tandem cylinders was carried out and compared with the existing literature the simulation model and basic parameters are introduced in the third section and the mesh independence test is performed as well in the fourth section the fivs of three tandem cylinders immersed in shear flow are elaborated the fiv responses and mechanism of the cylinders are described finally some main findings are summarized in the last section 2 governing equation and numerical method 2 1 governing equation the non dimensional ale scheme of navier stokes equations reported by hughes et al 1981 and

the fluid solid interaction fsi system can be found in tu et al 2015 and han et al 2018 2 4 validation studies in order to verify the accuracy of the calculation algorithm the fivs of two tandem circular cylinders within the two dimensional uniform flow are firstly solved this example was also referred by prasanth and mittal 2009 the flow field size model geometry and boundary conditions are shown in fig 1 the centers of the two cylinders are located at point 0 0 and point 5 5d 0 respectively and the characteristic length d is equal to 1 0 the entire computational domain Ï is defined as 30d 60d 20d 20d the flow is imposed on the surface of the cylinder as u 1 x t u 2 y t and a uniform flow at the inlet of the computational domain is prescribed as u 1 u 0 1 0 and u 2 0 0 the pressure is set to zero at the outlet at the lateral boundaries the symmetrical conditions are adopted as u 1 y 0 0 and u 2 0 0 the following system parameters are utilized the re 100 the m r 10 and the Î¾ 0 0 the proposed results herein and the existing data from prasanth and mittal 2009 are plotted in fig 2 in terms of the dimensionless rms value of the in line vibration amplitude x rms d and the maximum value of the transverse one y max d of two cylinders these results show good agreement with each other which validates the reliability and accuracy of our numerical scheme for further validation study of the cbs scheme some references bao et al 2012 tu et al 2014 2015 sun et al 2017 han et al 2018 can be referred to 3 description of the problem 3 1 simulation parameters in this paper the fivs of the tandem three cylinders system in a two dimensional planar shear flow are numerically simulated the mass spring system s non dimensional parameters are as follows the reduced mass m r 2 0 and the reduced velocity in the range of 3 u r 21 as the influences of the wake of the upstream cylinder on the structural dynamic responses of the rear cylinder are mainly analyzed in this paper the spacing ratio is fixed to 5 5 where the vortices shed from the front cylinder develop fully and have a strong action to the rear cylinder mittal and kumar 2001 prasanth and mittal 2009 bao et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the reynolds numbers are set as 80 120 and 160 respectively which are classified into the laminar flow region re 160 210 and is in accordance with the two dimensional assumption in this study it could shed valuable light on the more complex viv phenomena which is also of interest from the standpoint of flow physics bao et al 2012 the blockage ratio is fixed to b 0 05 to keep the positive velocity at the inlet the shear ratio k varies from 0 0 to 0 1 kang 2006 prasanth et al 2006 the computational model is pictured in fig 3 three cylinders are positioned with an in line configuration in the fluid domain the fluid domain is set as 30d 60d 10d 10d the centers of the three cylinders are located at 5 5d 0 0 0 and 5 5d 0 respectively comparing with the two tandem cylinders case the shear flow which is set as u 1 u c ky u c 1 0 and u 2 0 is applied as a boundary condition at the computational domain s inlet the remaining boundary conditions are the same 3 2 grid and time step independence tests the case of re 120 k 0 1 and u r 7 0 is selected to test the grid and the time step independencies the grid of the computational domain of three circular cylinders is shown in fig 4 a with the fine grid near the cylinders surface in fig 4 b the parameters of three selected grid systems are listed in table 1 which indicates the influence of grid parameters by the percentage changes listed inside the bracket it can be seen that the differences of the maximum amplitude results between grids i and ii including x max d and y max d are 3 50 and 3 90 respectively however they decrease to 1 75 and 0 92 respectively comparing grid ii with grid iii the simulated results show that grid ii can provide a satisfactory computational accuracy for the two dimensional fivs of three tandem circular cylinders therefore the grid ii characteristics are adopted for all the cases in present paper additionally the influence of the non dimensional time step Î´t 0 005 0 002 and 0 001 on the maximum amplitudes of three circular cylinders can be observed from table 2 it can be seen that the differences of the maximum amplitude results between three kinds of time steps including x max d and y max d are 6 56 and 3 08 respectively the simulated results show that the time step of Î´t 0 002 which was also applied in our published literatures bao et al 2012 tu et al 2014 2015 sun et al 2017 han et al 2018 is utilized for further computations 4 fivs of three circular cylinders in tandem 4 1 amplitude responses in this section the fiv amplitude characteristics of three two dimensional circular cylinders in tandem are analyzed as a function of re k and u r because of the complicated dynamic responses of the midstream and downstream cylinders the common vibration branches initial branch upper branch and lower branch are difficult to distinguish and show therefore for the convenience of analysis the whole range of u r is classified into some sub regions according to the variation tendency and the position of the extreme points in vibration amplitude of three cylinders additionally the reynolds number ranges are divided into re 120 and re 160 based on the maximum amplitude variation in both in line and transverse directions 4 1 1 re 120 fig 5 illustrates the non dimensional maximum amplitudes x max d and y max d versus the reduced velocity at different shear ratios with reynolds number re equal to 80 and 120 it is found that there is a slight difference in their trend and maximum values at different re with the increase of the shear ratio the resonance range expands in both in line and transverse directions meanwhile the shear ratio impacts significantly on the vibration amplitude of three cylinders in the in line direction while negligible in the transverse one the same phenomenon was observed in our previous work tu et al 2014 additionally the resonance ranges of the midstream and downstream circular cylinders are obviously broadened compared to the upstream one the variations in different regions of maximum amplitudes for three cylinders in both directions can be summarized as follows region a the in line vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder uc increases with the shear ratio k at all different re however a negligible impact of the shear ratio is observed on its transverse dynamic response meanwhile as u r increases vibration amplitudes of the midstream cylinder mc in both directions may demonstrate a gradual increase to a peak which is not a monotonic increase as those in the uc case as seen in fig 6 the dynamic response in in line direction for mc is weak at u r 5 and the phase difference between the in line displacement and drag coefficient is 178 in the uniform flow case however for the shear flow case there is a significant change in the in line amplitude of the mc and the phase difference changes to 7 indicating that the oscillation of the displacement and the drag is close to in phase and the kinetic energy transfers from fluid to the mc on the other hand the flow velocity around the cylinder have a great influence on the motion feature of it at k 0 0 the flow velocity around the mc is evenly distributed as show in fig 6 a with the change of k the velocity difference on the mc may cause the change of the pressure giving rise to intensifying the vibration of it it can be observed from fig 6 b that the flow velocity at the upper left surface of the mc is relatively larger in the shear flow case resulting in the pressure weaken while it is exactly opposite at the lower right one intensifying the vibration of the mc for the downstream cylinder dc maximum amplitudes in both directions are small because of the shielding effect of the wake of the uc and mc region b as re increases the dynamic response of the uc increases in the in line direction while the transverse oscillation amplitude does not change much additionally maximum amplitudes in both directions decrease as u r increases compared with that of the uc the transverse amplitude of the mc shows an obvious drop with the increase of k meanwhile there is a significant irregularity in the in line amplitude with the increase of u r as re 80 and u r 5 6 the mc exposed to the uniform flow oscillates with a very small amplitude the possible reason is that the vortex street which is shed from the uc passes through both sides of the mc resulting in the suppression of the wake development of the mc which leads to the weakened force and amplitude as seen in fig 7 however with the increase of re it is found from fig 8 that the in line oscillation amplitude is obviously enhanced as the vortices shed from three cylinders gradually develop downstream and merge with each other the wake mode will transform significantly resulting in the vibration of the mc appear as a modulation period mode the strong coupling between the vortex shed from the uc and mc makes the phase difference between the drag force and in line displacement reduce from 172 re 80 to 14 re 120 increasing the kinetic energy of the mc on the other hand a valley is appeared in in line vibration amplitude of the mc subjected to the shear flow when u r 9 re 80 and u r 8 re 120 in order to explain the mechanism of this phenomenon the flow characteristic of the system was studied the instantaneous vorticity and pressure contours for the case of re 120 k 0 1 and u r 8 are illustrated in fig 9 the specific time steps of the pressure contours are marked with letters i ii iii and red dots on the corresponding time histories of the in line displacement for the mc at the upper right corner it is observed that at each instant a positive pressure zone is formed at the anterior surface of the mc meanwhile a much stronger suction occurs in the posterior one which exclusively amplifies the accelerated movement from left to right also the spring with large stiffness limits the sustainable amplitude development to the right of the mc at u r 8 compared with the mc there is a greater difference in terms of the maximum amplitude variation of the dc in the transverse direction with the change of k especially in the uniform flow case the amplitude reaches a peak of 0 69 at re 120 and u r 6 which is much larger than that of the shear flow case a possible explanation for this observation is the timing difference between the transverse oscillation of the dc and the vortex shedding of the uc and mc on the other hand the amplitude variations of the dc are similar to that of the mc with the increase of u r region c with the increase of u r the amplitude of the uc gradually decreases and then tends to be unchanged for the mc an obvious increase of the oscillation amplitude is observed in both in line and transverse directions with the increase of k moreover with the increase of u r the x max d increases until reaching a peak and then decreases however the y max d decreases in the whole region with the increase of re the dynamic response of the mc in the in line direction is intensified gradually and close to that of the u r 7 case additionally the oscillation of the dc is in resonance state and reaches a peak in the transverse direction hence the reynolds number shows a significant influence on the resonance regime and the maximum amplitude of the dc especially there is an abrupt decrease in the amplitude of the dc exposed to the shear flow in the in line direction at re 120 and u r 12 it is because that he period of each cycle of the dc is longer and presented as a modulation period along with an irregular wake mode region d1 d2 the effect of u r on the dynamic characteristics of three tandem cylinders is not significant it should pay attention to that the wake of the uc plays an important role in the dynamic responses of the mc and dc which causes both cylinders to undergo larger transverse vibration amplitude 4 1 2 re 160 as re further increases the interference between structure and fluid becomes stronger and more intricate which intensifies the dynamic responses of both the mc and dc in comparison to the cases of re 120 the maximum amplitude of both cylinders increase greatly as can be seen in fig 10 actually the change of in line one for the dc is even more obvious the vibration of the uc has a great impact on the dynamic characteristics of the tandem circular cylinders resulting in widening the resonance regimes at different shear ratios the trend of the maximum amplitude of the uc is very similar to that of the re 120 case however as re increases the oscillation amplitudes of the mc and dc influenced greatly by the wake interference show a higher level of fluctuation region a with the increase of u r the amplitudes of the mc in both directions gradually increase especially as k 0 05 and u r 5 the in line amplitude of the mc reaches a maximum value moreover for the dc there is an obvious increase in the vibration amplitude in both directions compared with those of the re 120 case as can also be observed the shear ratio has a great effect on the vibration amplitude at u r 5 region b c the motion of the mc is in an unstable state in this regime resulting in multiple peaks in the in line amplitude however in the transverse direction it is similar to that of the re 120 case in the region b vibration amplitudes of the mc are greatly affected by the shear ratio at u r 6 in the uniform flow the transverse amplitude of the mc y max d is as high as 1 07 which is much larger than that of the k 0 1 case y max d 0 23 the possible reason for this detection is the flow characteristics change due to the shear ratio as shown in fig 11 for the uniform flow case when the mc moves down from stages i to ii the counter clockwise vortex shed from the uc surface attacks the lower side of the mc and merges with its wake as shown in fig 11 a which results in the formation of the suction in the motion direction of the mc and the downward acceleration motion similarly from stages ii to iii the counter clockwise vortex of the mc is fully developed and will shed from it at the same time the developing clockwise vortex merges into the wake of the uc and a suction region occurs at the upper surface of the mc which leads the mc to decelerate downward to the maximum displacement and then accelerate upward the flow velocity gradient due to the shear ratio has a great impact on the development of the vortex structure at the upper and lower surfaces of three cylinders when subjected to the shear flow the clockwise vortex shed from the uc passes through the upper surface of the mc which induces the suppression of the vortex formation behind the mc as pictured in fig 11 b meanwhile the lower vortex shed from the uc will be biased and pass far away from the lower surface of the mc under the extrusion of the upper strong vortex two separate vortices are formed in the wake region which has an ignorable effect on the vortex formation and dynamic responses of the mc therefore the oscillation amplitude of the mc is greatly weakened at k 0 1 for the dc the maximum value of the non dimensional in line amplitude of the k 0 05 case is smaller than those of other shear ratios it can also be observed that there is a valley in the in line oscillation amplitude of the mc and dc at k 0 05 and u r 8 from fig 12 the time history of displacements of the dc is similar to that of a standard sine function in both in line and transverse directions which indicates a relatively stable oscillation however with the increase of k it changes into an irregular shape which leads to the reinforcement of the in line motion for the dc additionally the trend of the transverse amplitude with u r for the dc is consistent with those of the re 120 cases however the effect of the shear ratio is different region d1 d2 the amplitudes in two directions for the mc stay stable at a larger value for all shear ratios with the increase of u r the in line amplitude of the dc processes a second peak and it occurs at u r 16 k 0 0 and 0 05 and u r 18 k 0 1 respectively meanwhile the phenomenon of two peaks is also observed in transverse amplitude of the dc at k 0 1 however at other shear ratios y max d decreases gradually as u r increases 4 2 frequency characteristics in this section the two dimensional fiv frequency responses of the tandem three cylinders system in shear flow will be described the cylinder s structural responses referred to as fivs are mainly affected by the natural frequency and the vortex shedding frequency it involves a mechanism of synchronization or lock in which leads each cylinder to oscillating at a very great amplitude as described by de langre 2006 and mittal and kumar 1999 based on the analysis on the variations of frequency ratios it is found that the lock in range expands with the increase of re and k and the same conclusion was reported by zhang et al 2014 and tu et al 2014 in the in line direction the dynamic responses of each structure in the state of lock in will inevitably increase while the excitation mechanism changes gradually with the increase of re when u r is large there is no change in the in line amplitude even though the lock in phenomenon occurs in addition the resonance phenomenon of the upstream cylinder subjected to the uniform flow occurs as the vibration frequencies are close to the twice of the natural frequency in the transverse direction the strong oscillation responses of cylinders are dominated by its natural frequency the vibration frequencies i e f x and f y and the fluid force coefficient frequencies i e st x and st y in both in line and transverse directions of the tandem three cylinder as a function of u r at different reynolds numbers and shear ratios are presented in fig 13 15 respectively 4 2 1 re 80 for the case of re 80 the uc in the uniform flow shows lock in state only in the transverse direction while the dual lock in phenomenon can be observed in the shear flow cases besides the structure s natural frequency the dynamic response in the transverse direction is also affected by the vortex shed from its surface the transverse amplitude of the uc reaches a peak value in the lock in state and decreases when the u r is out of it even though the vibration frequencies are close to the vortex shedding frequencies i e the lift coefficient frequency at this time hence this indicates that the natural frequencies play a more important role in the vibration responses of the uc than the vortex shedding one for the mc it can be seen in fig 13 b that the lock in range is consistent with that of the uc and the dynamic characteristics in the in line direction is also affected by the drag coefficient frequency specifically it is found from fig 5 a that the in line amplitude of the mc increases and reaches a peak because of the wake interference besides the vibration frequencies of the mc exposed the shear flow are almost coincide with its natural frequencies at u r 7 which results in an abrupt increase to a maximum in line amplitude compared with the mc the dual lock in regimes expand to the region b and c for the dc as described in fig 13 c the vortex shedding in the wake of the mc has little effect on the transverse amplitude of the dc and the dynamic response is mainly related to its own natural frequency especially the transverse amplitude of the mc and dc will eventually be stabilized to a large value a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the wake of the uc is attractive to the mc and dc 4 2 2 re 120 for the case of re 120 although the variations of oscillation amplitudes of three cylinders are similar to the re 80 case the frequency characteristics change significantly as can be seen in fig 14 the excitation mechanism of fiv changes in some regions due to the occurrence of unsteady wake in the regions c d2 the in line amplitude of the uc is not sensitive to the occurrence of the lock in phenomenon the response mechanism of the in line oscillation of the uc transitions from synchronization to the vortex interference with the increase of u r this phenomenon is also observed in the regions d1 d2 for the mc and d2 for the dc it should be noted that when u r is about 4 the soft lock in phenomenon appears because of the ratio of the vibration frequency to the natural frequency is less than one which induces a peak value in the amplitude of the cylinders the definition can refer to mittal and kumar 2001 and was also mentioned in other published literature borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 bao et al 2012 4 2 3 re 160 for the case of re 160 the lock in regimes obviously expand and the in line vibration frequencies are close to the natural frequencies at most conditions as can be seen in fig 15 for the mc and dc the dual lock in regions are further broadened and the vibration amplitude increases significantly in particular when u r 5 the in line amplitude of the mc subjected to the shear flow reaches a peak which is attributed to the lock in phenomenon however in the uniform flow case it is the contrary to that of the shear flow case meanwhile in the regions d1 d2 the vibration frequencies are close to the corresponding fluid force coefficient frequencies hence the amplitudes of the dc present a second peak in both in line and transverse directions at certain shear ratios as presented in fig 10 4 3 motion orbits of circular cylinders the variations of motion orbits of three tandem circular cylinders with reduced velocities at different shear ratios and reynolds numbers are described in fig 16 18 respectively only the cases of k 0 0 and 0 1 are selected to show the motion orbit of each cylinder in this section it is found that the trajectories of three cylinders subjected to the uniform flow are mostly symmetrical about the center line however for the planar shear flow case they are not symmetrical any more which is attributed to the asymmetrical distribution of the wake on the both sides of the cylinders when re 120 the variations of the trajectories of three cylinders can be summarized into three different stages 1 three cylinders mainly oscillate with a regular shape for the case of small u r 2 in the resonance region the effects of the coupling between flow field and structures on the amplitude development are significant resulting in the appearance of the irregular orbits 3 beyond the resonance regime the motion of each cylinder tends to be stable and returns to a regular shape at re 160 the flow field is more complex than other cases and the motion orbits of three cylinders are mainly dominated by irregular shapes when the spacing ratio is beyond the critical value the trajectory of the uc is analogy to that of the single cylinder case it can be referred to the conclusions described by tu et al 2014 due to the presence of the uc the motion orbits of the midstream and downstream cylinders mc and dc are more intricate the prominent trajectories of the mc are mainly figure eight and irregular shapes in the uniform flow case while they are diversified for the shear flow case besides the oval raindrop and irregular shapes the motion orbit of the mc resembles a dual oval shape at re 120 and u r 6 meanwhile the dual eight figure is also observed at re 160 u r 3 the formation mechanism of these two special trajectories will be explained later on the other hand the dc undergoes a larger amplitude compared with that of the mc which is induced by the wake interference the shapes resembling a round table and dual raindrop are respectively observed in the trajectories of the dc when re 80 u r 14 and re 120 u r 3 from fig 17 a the transverse amplitude of the left half in the trajectory of dc is significantly larger than the other half for the case of re 120 k 0 0 and u r 14 a possible explanation of this phenomenon is that the time history of the transverse displacement presents as a modulation period and leads the dc to motion in alternating ways of large and small amplitudes within one cycle to understand the underlying mechanism of the particular trajectories dual oval and dual eight figure for the shear flow case the time histories of the displacements x d y d and flow force coefficients c d c l and the corresponding power spectral density psd with two representative cases are presented in figs 19 and 20 respectively for the case of re 120 k 0 1 u r 6 the dual oval figure can be observed in the trajectory of the dc as seen in fig 19 each period of the displacements and force coefficients time histories for the dc which can also known as a simple modulation period consists of two or three small cycles in both in line and transverse directions the phase differences between the displacements and force coefficients are 55 in line direction and 54 transverse direction respectively and there is a significant variation in the energy transfer between structure and fluid in one cycle which influences the dynamic responses of the dc on the other hand the psd of the displacements and force coefficients in both two directions agree well with each other and dominated by the first order and second order frequencies meanwhile the energy difference between the two main frequencies makes the trajectory of the dc composed of two ovals with different sizes for the case of re 160 k 0 1 u r 3 the wake distribution on both sides of the cylinder is asymmetrical which leads to an asymmetric dual eight figure in the mc trajectory as seen in fig 20 in addition to the in line displacement time history which is the simple modulation mode mentioned in the last paragraph the other displacement and force coefficients time histories for the mc are analogy to those of a standard sine function although the phase differences between the displacements and force coefficients are 39 in line direction and 3 transverse direction respectively approximately in a in phase state the structural stiffness is so large that it is difficult to vibrate with a strong amplitude on the other hand it can be found from the psd that the first order frequencies of the displacements x d and y d and force coefficients c d and c l basically coincide which is quite different from the psd of the figure eight trajectory dahl et al 2007 prasanth and mittal 2009 tu et al 2014 however a second order frequency observed in the psd of the x d and c d is two times of the main one of the y d and c l which brings out an asymmetric dual eight figure in the mc trajectory 5 vortex dynamics of the fiv the mechanism of fiv responses and the change of the wake modes of the cylinders can be revealed from the instantaneous pressure and the vorticity fields fig 21 shows the time history curves of displacements of the midstream and downstream cylinders mc and dc and the corresponding instantaneous pressure and vorticity contours for the case of re 120 u r 7 with two different shear ratios k 0 0 and k 0 1 the plot with letters i ii iii iv and v are used to indicate the specific time steps it can be seen in fig 21 that the dynamic responses and flow distribution around the upstream cylinder uc are very similar to those of the single cylinder case moreover the flow field around the mc and dc is much more complicated under the effect of the uc wake the interaction between the three cylinders and the flow field changes as the inflow characteristics change for the uniform flow case the vortex of the uc is fully developed in the cylinder gap region and merges with the vortex of the mc which creates a strong suction at the surface of the mc and induces a large amplitude oscillation as seen in fig 21 a meanwhile the wake of the uc and mc merges with the vortex of the dc which cause the flow around the dc much more complicated a wake mode 2t t as a triple of vortices appears note that for the two tandem cylinders in tu et al 2015 the t p pattern p as a pair of vortices was observed instead the surface of the dc and its far wake region appears a plurality of pressure zones which greatly affect the motion state of the dc and the time history curve of displacement exhibits a modulation pattern the process of the interaction between the three cylinders and the flow field are described in details as follows as shown in stage i the mc is moving downwards to the equilibrium position and the vortices a1 and b1 on both sides of the uc are completely developed which are about to shed the upward vortex shed from the mc merges with the wake of the uc into a new vortex c1 and completely shed from the upper surface of the mc meanwhile the downward vortex shed from the mc merges with the vortex shed from the lower surface of the uc into a new vortex d1 and creates a strong suction at the lower rear region of the mc which pulls the cylinder to accelerate towards it on the other hand the upward vortex e1 starts to shed from the dc with the downward vortex f1 gradually developing hence a strong suction occurs at the lower rear region of the dc which causes the dc to vibrate violently in the transverse direction at stage ii when the mc starts to move upward from the bottom position vortex a1 has completely shed from the cylinder surface a new vortex a2 is then generated from the tail of a1 a positive pressure zone appears in the upper left of the mc while the vortex a1 reaches the upper surface of the mc then the interaction of vortex a1 with the suction zone created by the vortex c2 induces the mc to accelerate upward and decelerate to the left moreover vortex c1 impinges on the dc and splits into two vortices c11 and c12 respectively creating a positive pressure zone in the lower left side of the dc meanwhile vortex f1 is fully developed and shed from the lower surface of the dc and a weak suction appears on the right side which pulls the cylinder to decelerate downward and accelerate to the right at stage iii b1 is gradually developing and a new vortex b2 is formed from the lower surface of the uc two vortices c2 and a1 merge into a big vortex a1c2 and then shed from the mc a new vortex d2 is generated from the lower side of the mc under the interaction between the surface eddies a positive pressure zone is generated in the upper left of the mc and it is opposite in the remaining surfaces which pushes the mc to decelerate upward and accelerate to the right on the other hand vortex e2 creates a suction zone in the upper right of the dc which leads to the dc accelerate upward at stage iv the vortices are ready to be shed from the upper part of cylinders and the strength of downward one is gradually increasing which causes the motion and wake flow field distribution around the cylinder opposite to the stage ii notably vortex d1 is similar to vortex c1 which then impinges on the dc and splits into two vortices d11 and d12 at stage v the formation of vortex streets exhibits a complete 2t pattern and the motion of the mc and dc are consistent with that of the stage i for the planar shear flow case the pressure distributions around the cylinders are quite different compared with the uniform flow due to the asymmetrical distribution of the wakes on both sides of the cylinder in addition the coupling between the cylinders and the flow is significantly weakened it can be observed from fig 21 b that the pattern is transformed into the regular p s s a single vortex or 2s which leads to a significant change in the motion characteristics of the cylinders the wake of the uc develops backward and merges with vortex of the mc which promotes a drastic fluctuation of the mc the interference between the wake of the mc and dc is opposite to the uc the wake of the mc does not impinges on the dc but passes through both sides of the dc this leads to a significant decrease of the amplitude oscillation of the dc in the transverse direction however compared with the uniform flow case the amplitude values of the mc and dc in the in line direction are significantly increased the interaction process between the three cylinders and flows are described as follows when the mc is moving upward at stage i vortex a2 shed from the upper surface of the uc is gradually developing while b1 has completely shed from the uc meanwhile vortex a1 reaches the upper side of the mc and merges with c1 into a new vortex a1c1 then a strong suction is created at the upper right side of the mc which leads the cylinder to accelerate towards it additionally vortex e1 also reaches the upper side of the dc and restrains the wake development of the dc they creates a small suction at the upper right side of the dc but the impact is insignificant due to the large distance in stage ii when the mc reaches the upper position vortex b1 impinges on the mc and develops into two vortices b11 and b12 at the same time vortex b2 is also gradually developing furthermore vortex a1c1 is about to be shed from the upper side of the mc while vortex d1 is gradually developing a positive pressure zone and a suction pressure zone occur at the left side and lower right of the mc respectively which causes the mc to accelerate to the lower and right directions for the dc the wake of the mc passes through the upper and lower sides of the dc thus two small suction regions are formed at the far wake flow regime which induces the suppression of the amplitude development of the dc at stage iii the mc moves from top to bottom and reaches the equilibrium position vortex a2 has completely shed from the uc and a new vortex a3 appears around the cylinder two vortices b12 and d1 merge into a new vortex b12d1 and a suction is created at the lower rear region of the mc resulting in a significant increase in the amplitudes of the mc at the ending stage iv v the flow distribution and motion of the mc and dc are consistent with i ii 6 conclusion in this study fivs of three tandem circular cylinders immersed in the planar shear flow of varying shear ratios k 0 0 0 05 and 0 1 are investigated by applying a 4 sicbs finite element method the cylinders are allowed to vibrate in both in line and transverse directions the center to center distance of each cylinder is set as 5 5d and the ranges of the reynolds number and reduced velocity are 80 160 and 3 21 respectively it is focused on how the parameters re k and u r would affect vibration amplitudes frequency characteristics motion trajectories flow characteristics and interference mechanisms of the three cylinders tandem system some main findings are summarized as follows 1 at a spacing ratio of 5 5 the tandem three cylinders system is in a binary vortex state where the fivs of the uc are analogy to that of the single cylinder case the effects of three key parameters on the oscillation responses of the midstream and downstream cylinders are more significant for the case of re 120 the vibration amplitude changes slightly with the change of re in the resonance regime as u r increasing the shear ratio impacts differently the amplitudes in transverse direction for the midstream and downstream cylinders for the case of re 160 the flow field gets more intricate which leads to an irregular shape in the amplitude of the cylinders meanwhile there is an obvious increase in the non dimensional maximum amplitudes additionally the in line amplitude of the cylinders is affected by the change of re and k more than the transverse one 2 for the case of re 80 the occurrence of the lock in phenomenon will inevitably strengthen the dynamic responses of the cylinders at the most condition however for the case of re 120 and 160 as u r increases the vibration response mechanism of the cylinders in the in line direction will change into the vortex interference additionally the increases of re and k cause the extension of lock in regions there is a dual lock phenomenon in the shear flow 3 for the case of re 120 the trend of the variation with u r in the trajectories for three cylinders is coincident for the case of re 160 three cylinders mainly oscillate with an irregular shape the change of k has a great impact on the trajectories of three cylinders in the uniform flow case the motion orbits are dominated by the figure eight and irregular shape while the figure eight one transforms into the shape of raindrop oval dual raindrop or dual oval when the cylinder undergoes the shear flow it should pay attention to that the dual eight figure is observed in the motion orbit of the mc 4 the analysis on the instantaneous pressure and the vorticity fields for the case of re 120 k 0 0 and u r 7 is described in detail to reveal the mechanism of fiv response and the change of the wake mode of the cylinders immersing in the uniform and shear flow respectively when the cylinders are subjected to the uniform flow the wake pattern 2t is formed due to the strong interaction between the vortex shedding from the cylinders however for the shear flow case the wake of the uc and mc does not impinge on the dc and passes through both sides of it resulting in a change for the wake mode into the p s and 2s pattern additionally the formation mechanism of the 2t wake pattern is analyzed authors contribution statement jiahuang tu conceptualization

22049,numerical study is conducted on flow induced vibrations fivs of three circular cylinders arranged in tandem with spacing ratio l d 5 5 in planar shear flow the cylinders are free to vibration in both in line and transverse directions a four step semi implicit characteristic based split 4 sicbs finite element method is adopted to solve the governing navier stokes equations the mass ratio of each cylinder is set as m r 2 0 and the structural damping ratio as zero to maximize the flow induced responses of the cylinders the effects of three main parameters such as the reynolds number re 80 120 160 the shear ratio k 0 0 0 05 0 1 and the reduced velocity u r 3 21 are considered the changes of vibration amplitudes frequency characteristics motion trajectories and flow characteristics are analyzed the results show that the dynamic responses of the upstream cylinder are similar to those of an isolated cylinder the re k and u r play a more important role in the fivs of the midstream and downstream cylinders as re 120 the dynamic responses of the cylinders change slightly with the increasing of re while they present a dramatic increase because of the unstable flow characteristic at re 160 additionally with the increasing of re the vibration response mechanism of the cylinders in the in line direction will change from resonance phenomenon into the vortex interference for the motion orbits of the circular cylinders in additional to the eight figure raindrop oval and irregular shape the dual raindrop dual eight and dual oval sharp are observed finally regarding the flow field it is found that the interference of the wake vortex is highly affected by the shear ratio of the incoming flow resulting in great changes on the wake pattern and dynamic responses especially the 2t wake pattern is observed keywords flow induced vibration three tandem circular cylinders dynamic response wake characteristics finite element method 1 introduction when the flow passes through cylinder structures flow induced vibration fiv will occur causing vortex shedding and force fluctuations which may bring severe structural damages and even catastrophic consequences in practical engineering such as marine risers marine platforms and heat exchanger tubes therefore during the last two decades the problem of fiv has always been one of the research hotspots as has been demonstrated in a series of review papers chen 1986 paÃ¯doussis and price 1988 williamson and govardhan 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 wu et al 2012 in practical engineering offshore and ocean structures always have components with multiple cylinder shapes for multiple cylinders arranged in tandem the dynamic responses and interference mechanisms are expected to be more intricate in comparison with an isolated cylinder which will attribute to weak strong interference between wake and structure according to the previous researches papaioannou et al 2008 bao et al 2012 carmo et al 2013 zhu et al 2019 yu et al 2016 a number of basic parameters such as the spacing ratio l d l being the center to center distance and d the cylinder diameter the natural frequency ratio f n x f n y f n x is the in line natural frequency of the cylinder and f n y the transverse one the reynolds number re re Ïu c d Î½ with u c defined as the inlet flow velocity Ï the flow density and Î½ the fluid kinematic viscosity the cylinder section shape and the total cylinder number etc are considered to influence significantly the fiv responses of the tandem cylinders fivs of two cylinders arranged in tandem have been investigated extensively papaioannou et al 2008 numerically studied the vortex induced vibration viv responses of two tandem circular cylinders with various spacing ratios the single cylinder case was also examined for reference and comparison it was found that the maximum oscillation amplitude was larger and the corresponding range was wider for the upstream cylinder in reattachment regime l d 2 5 and 3 5 mittal and his team members suggested that the downstream circular cylinder oscillated in both in line and transverse directions with a large amplitude for the case of re 100 and l d 5 5 prasanth and mittal 2009 mittal and kumar 2001 and the transverse response outside the laminar flow region was very similar to that of an isolated circular cylinder at higher re in addition the influence of the spacing ratio 1 5 3 4 5 6 on the viv of a circular cylinder with a c shape plate arranged in its wake for re 100 was analyzed by zhu and wang 2019 five flow regimes i e the extended body regime the front face reattachment regime the shear layer combination regime the one row co shedding regime and the two row co shedding regime were identified bao et al 2012 analyzed the influences of the natural frequency ratio of two tandem circular cylinders for re 150 the dual resonant response and p s wake pattern p stands for a pair of vortices and s a single vortex were observed additionally their results showed that for the downstream cylinder the natural frequency ratio influenced on the dynamic characteristics more in the in line direction than the transverse one carmo et al 2013 investigated a circular cylinder using both two and three dimensional simulations for fivs when subjected to wake interference with re ranging from 100 to 645 mysa et al 2017 numerically examined the downstream circular cylinder arranged in an in line pattern with subcritical reynolds numbers 5000 re 10 000 for its transverse wake induced vibration wiv there were two different response regimes the viv resonance dominated and the combined viv and wiv could be observed on the other hand qin et al 2018 experimentally investigated fiv s characteristics of two tandem circular cylinders the effects of six different natural frequency ratios were analyzed and three regimes namely no lock in vortex excitation galloping regimes were distinguished meanwhile xu et al 2019 observed through experiments the galloping phenomenon when the maximum amplitudes were reached by upstream and downstream circular cylinders to examine the effect of the section shape of the upstream structure on the wake interference and wiv three different shapes square rectangular and triangular prism were applied by zhu et al 2019 their results showed that the maximum lift force and transverse amplitude could be observed when the circular cylinder was behind a square prism as the cylinder number continues to increase up to three the dynamic responses and flow characteristics of the cylinders in tandem arrangement would get more complex among others the fivs of three circular cylinders arranged in tandem were carried out by yu et al 2016 a chaotic response was observed in the free oscillations in both directions of three tandem cylinders even at low re 100 and 150 compared to the two cylinders there was about a 25 increase in the transverse amplitude and the vibration trajectories of the triple cylinder case were dominated by bounded random movements hence they suggested that it would be dangerous to predict the fiv responses of multiple tandem cylinders mahmoud and atef 2018 numerically investigated the effects of the spacing ratio between the two upstream stationary cylinders on the fiv response and wake pattern of the downstream cylinder it was found that a higher harmonic was caused in the spectrum of the lift force because of the appearance of reattachment and the vortices in the gap between the cylinders interacted with the downstream structure which created a driving force that maintained a high vibration amplitude at higher reduced velocities chen et al 2018 further studied the spacing effect l d 1 2 5 0 on vivs of three tandem cylinders vibrating in the transverse direction large vibration amplitudes of the cylinders were observed to be excited under different spacing ratios at re 100 while the interference mechanism changed from wake induced galloping wg l d 1 2 to viv l d 1 5 5 0 by increasing l d wang et al 2019 experimentally investigated the fiv response of three flexible tandem cylinders with comparison with the single and two tandem cylinders cases the results suggested that the upstream cylinder s shielding effects and the downstream cylinder s vibration induced the suppression of the amplitude of the midstream cylinder in certain reduced velocity ranges however in engineering applications the fluid velocity changes significantly with the variation of space and time which gives rise to the results obtained under uniform flow condition not exactly applicable in practical cases therefore numerous studies have been carried out on fivs of cylinder systems subjected to non uniform flows which can be mainly summarized on poiseuille flow lin et al 2013 jiang and lin 2016 oscillatory flow zhao et al 2012 munir et al 2018 and shear flow zhang et al 2014 tu et al 2014 2015 gsell et al 2017 sun et al 2017 in comparison with uniform flow the presence of the inflow velocity gradient would affect the wake distribution between both sides of the cylinder which might make the dynamic responses even more complicate to predict at present the researches on the planar shear flow cylinder are mostly focusing on the single cylinder case such as the work by zhang et al 2014 and tu et al 2014 they suggested that the lock in region widened with the increase of shear ratio gsell et al 2017 numerically investigated the fivs of a circular cylinder subjected to the linear planar shear flow at re 100 it was found that the maximum amplitude in in line direction reached as high as 2d which was larger than that of the transverse direction meanwhile sun et al 2017 numerically investigated the vivs of a square cylinder immersed in the planar shear flow at re 80 and 160 the wake pattern were dominated by 2s and p s modes in the shear flow in addition the fivs of two tandem circular cylinders immersed in planar shear flow were numerically studied by tu et al 2015 it was demonstrated that three different parameters namely shear ratio k reduced velocity u r and spacing ratio l d had significant influences they pointed out that the in line response would be more sensitive to the variation of shear ratio than the transverse one the motion orbit of the cylinder transformed from the figure eight to the raindrop and irregular shape with the increasing of shear ratio moreover the wake pattern t p was observed and the corresponding mechanism was analyzed many engineering applications such as the bridge cables submarine pipelines are often arranged in a series of three or more circular cylinders however to the best of the author knowledge the investigations of fivs of three tandem circular cylinders in planer shear flow is very limited while the dynamic responses and mechanisms are still unclear this study will numerically investigate such a topic and some questions should be considered 1 compared to the isolated and two cylinders cases how the vibration amplitudes frequencies and tracjectories of three tandem circular cylinders subjected to the shear flow change 2 how the shear ratio impact on the dynamic responses of midstream and downstream cylinders 3 what the internal mechanism of the effect of shear rate on structures is in addtion it can be summarized from yu et al 2016 that the variation from re 100 to 150 in the laminar flow range has an effect on the vibration responses of three cylinders arranged in tandem immersed in uniform flow then how about the shear flow case hence the object of this work is to investigate the influences of fundamental parameters like re k and u r on the fiv responses and to provide a theoretical basis for comprehending the mechanism of fivs for three cylinders immersed in shear flow this paper is organized as follows the second section will introduce the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale forms of the fluid governing equations the solid dynamic equations and the corresponding four step semi implicit characteristic based split 4 sicbs algorithm in order to verify the correctness of the computational code the fivs

the fluid solid interaction fsi system can be found in tu et al 2015 and han et al 2018 2 4 validation studies in order to verify the accuracy of the calculation algorithm the fivs of two tandem circular cylinders within the two dimensional uniform flow are firstly solved this example was also referred by prasanth and mittal 2009 the flow field size model geometry and boundary conditions are shown in fig 1 the centers of the two cylinders are located at point 0 0 and point 5 5d 0 respectively and the characteristic length d is equal to 1 0 the entire computational domain Ï is defined as 30d 60d 20d 20d the flow is imposed on the surface of the cylinder as u 1 x t u 2 y t and a uniform flow at the inlet of the computational domain is prescribed as u 1 u 0 1 0 and u 2 0 0 the pressure is set to zero at the outlet at the lateral boundaries the symmetrical conditions are adopted as u 1 y 0 0 and u 2 0 0 the following system parameters are utilized the re 100 the m r 10 and the Î¾ 0 0 the proposed results herein and the existing data from prasanth and mittal 2009 are plotted in fig 2 in terms of the dimensionless rms value of the in line vibration amplitude x rms d and the maximum value of the transverse one y max d of two cylinders these results show good agreement with each other which validates the reliability and accuracy of our numerical scheme for further validation study of the cbs scheme some references bao et al 2012 tu et al 2014 2015 sun et al 2017 han et al 2018 can be referred to 3 description of the problem 3 1 simulation parameters in this paper the fivs of the tandem three cylinders system in a two dimensional planar shear flow are numerically simulated the mass spring system s non dimensional parameters are as follows the reduced mass m r 2 0 and the reduced velocity in the range of 3 u r 21 as the influences of the wake of the upstream cylinder on the structural dynamic responses of the rear cylinder are mainly analyzed in this paper the spacing ratio is fixed to 5 5 where the vortices shed from the front cylinder develop fully and have a strong action to the rear cylinder mittal and kumar 2001 prasanth and mittal 2009 bao et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the reynolds numbers are set as 80 120 and 160 respectively which are classified into the laminar flow region re 160 210 and is in accordance with the two dimensional assumption in this study it could shed valuable light on the more complex viv phenomena which is also of interest from the standpoint of flow physics bao et al 2012 the blockage ratio is fixed to b 0 05 to keep the positive velocity at the inlet the shear ratio k varies from 0 0 to 0 1 kang 2006 prasanth et al 2006 the computational model is pictured in fig 3 three cylinders are positioned with an in line configuration in the fluid domain the fluid domain is set as 30d 60d 10d 10d the centers of the three cylinders are located at 5 5d 0 0 0 and 5 5d 0 respectively comparing with the two tandem cylinders case the shear flow which is set as u 1 u c ky u c 1 0 and u 2 0 is applied as a boundary condition at the computational domain s inlet the remaining boundary conditions are the same 3 2 grid and time step independence tests the case of re 120 k 0 1 and u r 7 0 is selected to test the grid and the time step independencies the grid of the computational domain of three circular cylinders is shown in fig 4 a with the fine grid near the cylinders surface in fig 4 b the parameters of three selected grid systems are listed in table 1 which indicates the influence of grid parameters by the percentage changes listed inside the bracket it can be seen that the differences of the maximum amplitude results between grids i and ii including x max d and y max d are 3 50 and 3 90 respectively however they decrease to 1 75 and 0 92 respectively comparing grid ii with grid iii the simulated results show that grid ii can provide a satisfactory computational accuracy for the two dimensional fivs of three tandem circular cylinders therefore the grid ii characteristics are adopted for all the cases in present paper additionally the influence of the non dimensional time step Î´t 0 005 0 002 and 0 001 on the maximum amplitudes of three circular cylinders can be observed from table 2 it can be seen that the differences of the maximum amplitude results between three kinds of time steps including x max d and y max d are 6 56 and 3 08 respectively the simulated results show that the time step of Î´t 0 002 which was also applied in our published literatures bao et al 2012 tu et al 2014 2015 sun et al 2017 han et al 2018 is utilized for further computations 4 fivs of three circular cylinders in tandem 4 1 amplitude responses in this section the fiv amplitude characteristics of three two dimensional circular cylinders in tandem are analyzed as a function of re k and u r because of the complicated dynamic responses of the midstream and downstream cylinders the common vibration branches initial branch upper branch and lower branch are difficult to distinguish and show therefore for the convenience of analysis the whole range of u r is classified into some sub regions according to the variation tendency and the position of the extreme points in vibration amplitude of three cylinders additionally the reynolds number ranges are divided into re 120 and re 160 based on the maximum amplitude variation in both in line and transverse directions 4 1 1 re 120 fig 5 illustrates the non dimensional maximum amplitudes x max d and y max d versus the reduced velocity at different shear ratios with reynolds number re equal to 80 and 120 it is found that there is a slight difference in their trend and maximum values at different re with the increase of the shear ratio the resonance range expands in both in line and transverse directions meanwhile the shear ratio impacts significantly on the vibration amplitude of three cylinders in the in line direction while negligible in the transverse one the same phenomenon was observed in our previous work tu et al 2014 additionally the resonance ranges of the midstream and downstream circular cylinders are obviously broadened compared to the upstream one the variations in different regions of maximum amplitudes for three cylinders in both directions can be summarized as follows region a the in line vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder uc increases with the shear ratio k at all different re however a negligible impact of the shear ratio is observed on its transverse dynamic response meanwhile as u r increases vibration amplitudes of the midstream cylinder mc in both directions may demonstrate a gradual increase to a peak which is not a monotonic increase as those in the uc case as seen in fig 6 the dynamic response in in line direction for mc is weak at u r 5 and the phase difference between the in line displacement and drag coefficient is 178 in the uniform flow case however for the shear flow case there is a significant change in the in line amplitude of the mc and the phase difference changes to 7 indicating that the oscillation of the displacement and the drag is close to in phase and the kinetic energy transfers from fluid to the mc on the other hand the flow velocity around the cylinder have a great influence on the motion feature of it at k 0 0 the flow velocity around the mc is evenly distributed as show in fig 6 a with the change of k the velocity difference on the mc may cause the change of the pressure giving rise to intensifying the vibration of it it can be observed from fig 6 b that the flow velocity at the upper left surface of the mc is relatively larger in the shear flow case resulting in the pressure weaken while it is exactly opposite at the lower right one intensifying the vibration of the mc for the downstream cylinder dc maximum amplitudes in both directions are small because of the shielding effect of the wake of the uc and mc region b as re increases the dynamic response of the uc increases in the in line direction while the transverse oscillation amplitude does not change much additionally maximum amplitudes in both directions decrease as u r increases compared with that of the uc the transverse amplitude of the mc shows an obvious drop with the increase of k meanwhile there is a significant irregularity in the in line amplitude with the increase of u r as re 80 and u r 5 6 the mc exposed to the uniform flow oscillates with a very small amplitude the possible reason is that the vortex street which is shed from the uc passes through both sides of the mc resulting in the suppression of the wake development of the mc which leads to the weakened force and amplitude as seen in fig 7 however with the increase of re it is found from fig 8 that the in line oscillation amplitude is obviously enhanced as the vortices shed from three cylinders gradually develop downstream and merge with each other the wake mode will transform significantly resulting in the vibration of the mc appear as a modulation period mode the strong coupling between the vortex shed from the uc and mc makes the phase difference between the drag force and in line displacement reduce from 172 re 80 to 14 re 120 increasing the kinetic energy of the mc on the other hand a valley is appeared in in line vibration amplitude of the mc subjected to the shear flow when u r 9 re 80 and u r 8 re 120 in order to explain the mechanism of this phenomenon the flow characteristic of the system was studied the instantaneous vorticity and pressure contours for the case of re 120 k 0 1 and u r 8 are illustrated in fig 9 the specific time steps of the pressure contours are marked with letters i ii iii and red dots on the corresponding time histories of the in line displacement for the mc at the upper right corner it is observed that at each instant a positive pressure zone is formed at the anterior surface of the mc meanwhile a much stronger suction occurs in the posterior one which exclusively amplifies the accelerated movement from left to right also the spring with large stiffness limits the sustainable amplitude development to the right of the mc at u r 8 compared with the mc there is a greater difference in terms of the maximum amplitude variation of the dc in the transverse direction with the change of k especially in the uniform flow case the amplitude reaches a peak of 0 69 at re 120 and u r 6 which is much larger than that of the shear flow case a possible explanation for this observation is the timing difference between the transverse oscillation of the dc and the vortex shedding of the uc and mc on the other hand the amplitude variations of the dc are similar to that of the mc with the increase of u r region c with the increase of u r the amplitude of the uc gradually decreases and then tends to be unchanged for the mc an obvious increase of the oscillation amplitude is observed in both in line and transverse directions with the increase of k moreover with the increase of u r the x max d increases until reaching a peak and then decreases however the y max d decreases in the whole region with the increase of re the dynamic response of the mc in the in line direction is intensified gradually and close to that of the u r 7 case additionally the oscillation of the dc is in resonance state and reaches a peak in the transverse direction hence the reynolds number shows a significant influence on the resonance regime and the maximum amplitude of the dc especially there is an abrupt decrease in the amplitude of the dc exposed to the shear flow in the in line direction at re 120 and u r 12 it is because that he period of each cycle of the dc is longer and presented as a modulation period along with an irregular wake mode region d1 d2 the effect of u r on the dynamic characteristics of three tandem cylinders is not significant it should pay attention to that the wake of the uc plays an important role in the dynamic responses of the mc and dc which causes both cylinders to undergo larger transverse vibration amplitude 4 1 2 re 160 as re further increases the interference between structure and fluid becomes stronger and more intricate which intensifies the dynamic responses of both the mc and dc in comparison to the cases of re 120 the maximum amplitude of both cylinders increase greatly as can be seen in fig 10 actually the change of in line one for the dc is even more obvious the vibration of the uc has a great impact on the dynamic characteristics of the tandem circular cylinders resulting in widening the resonance regimes at different shear ratios the trend of the maximum amplitude of the uc is very similar to that of the re 120 case however as re increases the oscillation amplitudes of the mc and dc influenced greatly by the wake interference show a higher level of fluctuation region a with the increase of u r the amplitudes of the mc in both directions gradually increase especially as k 0 05 and u r 5 the in line amplitude of the mc reaches a maximum value moreover for the dc there is an obvious increase in the vibration amplitude in both directions compared with those of the re 120 case as can also be observed the shear ratio has a great effect on the vibration amplitude at u r 5 region b c the motion of the mc is in an unstable state in this regime resulting in multiple peaks in the in line amplitude however in the transverse direction it is similar to that of the re 120 case in the region b vibration amplitudes of the mc are greatly affected by the shear ratio at u r 6 in the uniform flow the transverse amplitude of the mc y max d is as high as 1 07 which is much larger than that of the k 0 1 case y max d 0 23 the possible reason for this detection is the flow characteristics change due to the shear ratio as shown in fig 11 for the uniform flow case when the mc moves down from stages i to ii the counter clockwise vortex shed from the uc surface attacks the lower side of the mc and merges with its wake as shown in fig 11 a which results in the formation of the suction in the motion direction of the mc and the downward acceleration motion similarly from stages ii to iii the counter clockwise vortex of the mc is fully developed and will shed from it at the same time the developing clockwise vortex merges into the wake of the uc and a suction region occurs at the upper surface of the mc which leads the mc to decelerate downward to the maximum displacement and then accelerate upward the flow velocity gradient due to the shear ratio has a great impact on the development of the vortex structure at the upper and lower surfaces of three cylinders when subjected to the shear flow the clockwise vortex shed from the uc passes through the upper surface of the mc which induces the suppression of the vortex formation behind the mc as pictured in fig 11 b meanwhile the lower vortex shed from the uc will be biased and pass far away from the lower surface of the mc under the extrusion of the upper strong vortex two separate vortices are formed in the wake region which has an ignorable effect on the vortex formation and dynamic responses of the mc therefore the oscillation amplitude of the mc is greatly weakened at k 0 1 for the dc the maximum value of the non dimensional in line amplitude of the k 0 05 case is smaller than those of other shear ratios it can also be observed that there is a valley in the in line oscillation amplitude of the mc and dc at k 0 05 and u r 8 from fig 12 the time history of displacements of the dc is similar to that of a standard sine function in both in line and transverse directions which indicates a relatively stable oscillation however with the increase of k it changes into an irregular shape which leads to the reinforcement of the in line motion for the dc additionally the trend of the transverse amplitude with u r for the dc is consistent with those of the re 120 cases however the effect of the shear ratio is different region d1 d2 the amplitudes in two directions for the mc stay stable at a larger value for all shear ratios with the increase of u r the in line amplitude of the dc processes a second peak and it occurs at u r 16 k 0 0 and 0 05 and u r 18 k 0 1 respectively meanwhile the phenomenon of two peaks is also observed in transverse amplitude of the dc at k 0 1 however at other shear ratios y max d decreases gradually as u r increases 4 2 frequency characteristics in this section the two dimensional fiv frequency responses of the tandem three cylinders system in shear flow will be described the cylinder s structural responses referred to as fivs are mainly affected by the natural frequency and the vortex shedding frequency it involves a mechanism of synchronization or lock in which leads each cylinder to oscillating at a very great amplitude as described by de langre 2006 and mittal and kumar 1999 based on the analysis on the variations of frequency ratios it is found that the lock in range expands with the increase of re and k and the same conclusion was reported by zhang et al 2014 and tu et al 2014 in the in line direction the dynamic responses of each structure in the state of lock in will inevitably increase while the excitation mechanism changes gradually with the increase of re when u r is large there is no change in the in line amplitude even though the lock in phenomenon occurs in addition the resonance phenomenon of the upstream cylinder subjected to the uniform flow occurs as the vibration frequencies are close to the twice of the natural frequency in the transverse direction the strong oscillation responses of cylinders are dominated by its natural frequency the vibration frequencies i e f x and f y and the fluid force coefficient frequencies i e st x and st y in both in line and transverse directions of the tandem three cylinder as a function of u r at different reynolds numbers and shear ratios are presented in fig 13 15 respectively 4 2 1 re 80 for the case of re 80 the uc in the uniform flow shows lock in state only in the transverse direction while the dual lock in phenomenon can be observed in the shear flow cases besides the structure s natural frequency the dynamic response in the transverse direction is also affected by the vortex shed from its surface the transverse amplitude of the uc reaches a peak value in the lock in state and decreases when the u r is out of it even though the vibration frequencies are close to the vortex shedding frequencies i e the lift coefficient frequency at this time hence this indicates that the natural frequencies play a more important role in the vibration responses of the uc than the vortex shedding one for the mc it can be seen in fig 13 b that the lock in range is consistent with that of the uc and the dynamic characteristics in the in line direction is also affected by the drag coefficient frequency specifically it is found from fig 5 a that the in line amplitude of the mc increases and reaches a peak because of the wake interference besides the vibration frequencies of the mc exposed the shear flow are almost coincide with its natural frequencies at u r 7 which results in an abrupt increase to a maximum in line amplitude compared with the mc the dual lock in regimes expand to the region b and c for the dc as described in fig 13 c the vortex shedding in the wake of the mc has little effect on the transverse amplitude of the dc and the dynamic response is mainly related to its own natural frequency especially the transverse amplitude of the mc and dc will eventually be stabilized to a large value a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the wake of the uc is attractive to the mc and dc 4 2 2 re 120 for the case of re 120 although the variations of oscillation amplitudes of three cylinders are similar to the re 80 case the frequency characteristics change significantly as can be seen in fig 14 the excitation mechanism of fiv changes in some regions due to the occurrence of unsteady wake in the regions c d2 the in line amplitude of the uc is not sensitive to the occurrence of the lock in phenomenon the response mechanism of the in line oscillation of the uc transitions from synchronization to the vortex interference with the increase of u r this phenomenon is also observed in the regions d1 d2 for the mc and d2 for the dc it should be noted that when u r is about 4 the soft lock in phenomenon appears because of the ratio of the vibration frequency to the natural frequency is less than one which induces a peak value in the amplitude of the cylinders the definition can refer to mittal and kumar 2001 and was also mentioned in other published literature borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 bao et al 2012 4 2 3 re 160 for the case of re 160 the lock in regimes obviously expand and the in line vibration frequencies are close to the natural frequencies at most conditions as can be seen in fig 15 for the mc and dc the dual lock in regions are further broadened and the vibration amplitude increases significantly in particular when u r 5 the in line amplitude of the mc subjected to the shear flow reaches a peak which is attributed to the lock in phenomenon however in the uniform flow case it is the contrary to that of the shear flow case meanwhile in the regions d1 d2 the vibration frequencies are close to the corresponding fluid force coefficient frequencies hence the amplitudes of the dc present a second peak in both in line and transverse directions at certain shear ratios as presented in fig 10 4 3 motion orbits of circular cylinders the variations of motion orbits of three tandem circular cylinders with reduced velocities at different shear ratios and reynolds numbers are described in fig 16 18 respectively only the cases of k 0 0 and 0 1 are selected to show the motion orbit of each cylinder in this section it is found that the trajectories of three cylinders subjected to the uniform flow are mostly symmetrical about the center line however for the planar shear flow case they are not symmetrical any more which is attributed to the asymmetrical distribution of the wake on the both sides of the cylinders when re 120 the variations of the trajectories of three cylinders can be summarized into three different stages 1 three cylinders mainly oscillate with a regular shape for the case of small u r 2 in the resonance region the effects of the coupling between flow field and structures on the amplitude development are significant resulting in the appearance of the irregular orbits 3 beyond the resonance regime the motion of each cylinder tends to be stable and returns to a regular shape at re 160 the flow field is more complex than other cases and the motion orbits of three cylinders are mainly dominated by irregular shapes when the spacing ratio is beyond the critical value the trajectory of the uc is analogy to that of the single cylinder case it can be referred to the conclusions described by tu et al 2014 due to the presence of the uc the motion orbits of the midstream and downstream cylinders mc and dc are more intricate the prominent trajectories of the mc are mainly figure eight and irregular shapes in the uniform flow case while they are diversified for the shear flow case besides the oval raindrop and irregular shapes the motion orbit of the mc resembles a dual oval shape at re 120 and u r 6 meanwhile the dual eight figure is also observed at re 160 u r 3 the formation mechanism of these two special trajectories will be explained later on the other hand the dc undergoes a larger amplitude compared with that of the mc which is induced by the wake interference the shapes resembling a round table and dual raindrop are respectively observed in the trajectories of the dc when re 80 u r 14 and re 120 u r 3 from fig 17 a the transverse amplitude of the left half in the trajectory of dc is significantly larger than the other half for the case of re 120 k 0 0 and u r 14 a possible explanation of this phenomenon is that the time history of the transverse displacement presents as a modulation period and leads the dc to motion in alternating ways of large and small amplitudes within one cycle to understand the underlying mechanism of the particular trajectories dual oval and dual eight figure for the shear flow case the time histories of the displacements x d y d and flow force coefficients c d c l and the corresponding power spectral density psd with two representative cases are presented in figs 19 and 20 respectively for the case of re 120 k 0 1 u r 6 the dual oval figure can be observed in the trajectory of the dc as seen in fig 19 each period of the displacements and force coefficients time histories for the dc which can also known as a simple modulation period consists of two or three small cycles in both in line and transverse directions the phase differences between the displacements and force coefficients are 55 in line direction and 54 transverse direction respectively and there is a significant variation in the energy transfer between structure and fluid in one cycle which influences the dynamic responses of the dc on the other hand the psd of the displacements and force coefficients in both two directions agree well with each other and dominated by the first order and second order frequencies meanwhile the energy difference between the two main frequencies makes the trajectory of the dc composed of two ovals with different sizes for the case of re 160 k 0 1 u r 3 the wake distribution on both sides of the cylinder is asymmetrical which leads to an asymmetric dual eight figure in the mc trajectory as seen in fig 20 in addition to the in line displacement time history which is the simple modulation mode mentioned in the last paragraph the other displacement and force coefficients time histories for the mc are analogy to those of a standard sine function although the phase differences between the displacements and force coefficients are 39 in line direction and 3 transverse direction respectively approximately in a in phase state the structural stiffness is so large that it is difficult to vibrate with a strong amplitude on the other hand it can be found from the psd that the first order frequencies of the displacements x d and y d and force coefficients c d and c l basically coincide which is quite different from the psd of the figure eight trajectory dahl et al 2007 prasanth and mittal 2009 tu et al 2014 however a second order frequency observed in the psd of the x d and c d is two times of the main one of the y d and c l which brings out an asymmetric dual eight figure in the mc trajectory 5 vortex dynamics of the fiv the mechanism of fiv responses and the change of the wake modes of the cylinders can be revealed from the instantaneous pressure and the vorticity fields fig 21 shows the time history curves of displacements of the midstream and downstream cylinders mc and dc and the corresponding instantaneous pressure and vorticity contours for the case of re 120 u r 7 with two different shear ratios k 0 0 and k 0 1 the plot with letters i ii iii iv and v are used to indicate the specific time steps it can be seen in fig 21 that the dynamic responses and flow distribution around the upstream cylinder uc are very similar to those of the single cylinder case moreover the flow field around the mc and dc is much more complicated under the effect of the uc wake the interaction between the three cylinders and the flow field changes as the inflow characteristics change for the uniform flow case the vortex of the uc is fully developed in the cylinder gap region and merges with the vortex of the mc which creates a strong suction at the surface of the mc and induces a large amplitude oscillation as seen in fig 21 a meanwhile the wake of the uc and mc merges with the vortex of the dc which cause the flow around the dc much more complicated a wake mode 2t t as a triple of vortices appears note that for the two tandem cylinders in tu et al 2015 the t p pattern p as a pair of vortices was observed instead the surface of the dc and its far wake region appears a plurality of pressure zones which greatly affect the motion state of the dc and the time history curve of displacement exhibits a modulation pattern the process of the interaction between the three cylinders and the flow field are described in details as follows as shown in stage i the mc is moving downwards to the equilibrium position and the vortices a1 and b1 on both sides of the uc are completely developed which are about to shed the upward vortex shed from the mc merges with the wake of the uc into a new vortex c1 and completely shed from the upper surface of the mc meanwhile the downward vortex shed from the mc merges with the vortex shed from the lower surface of the uc into a new vortex d1 and creates a strong suction at the lower rear region of the mc which pulls the cylinder to accelerate towards it on the other hand the upward vortex e1 starts to shed from the dc with the downward vortex f1 gradually developing hence a strong suction occurs at the lower rear region of the dc which causes the dc to vibrate violently in the transverse direction at stage ii when the mc starts to move upward from the bottom position vortex a1 has completely shed from the cylinder surface a new vortex a2 is then generated from the tail of a1 a positive pressure zone appears in the upper left of the mc while the vortex a1 reaches the upper surface of the mc then the interaction of vortex a1 with the suction zone created by the vortex c2 induces the mc to accelerate upward and decelerate to the left moreover vortex c1 impinges on the dc and splits into two vortices c11 and c12 respectively creating a positive pressure zone in the lower left side of the dc meanwhile vortex f1 is fully developed and shed from the lower surface of the dc and a weak suction appears on the right side which pulls the cylinder to decelerate downward and accelerate to the right at stage iii b1 is gradually developing and a new vortex b2 is formed from the lower surface of the uc two vortices c2 and a1 merge into a big vortex a1c2 and then shed from the mc a new vortex d2 is generated from the lower side of the mc under the interaction between the surface eddies a positive pressure zone is generated in the upper left of the mc and it is opposite in the remaining surfaces which pushes the mc to decelerate upward and accelerate to the right on the other hand vortex e2 creates a suction zone in the upper right of the dc which leads to the dc accelerate upward at stage iv the vortices are ready to be shed from the upper part of cylinders and the strength of downward one is gradually increasing which causes the motion and wake flow field distribution around the cylinder opposite to the stage ii notably vortex d1 is similar to vortex c1 which then impinges on the dc and splits into two vortices d11 and d12 at stage v the formation of vortex streets exhibits a complete 2t pattern and the motion of the mc and dc are consistent with that of the stage i for the planar shear flow case the pressure distributions around the cylinders are quite different compared with the uniform flow due to the asymmetrical distribution of the wakes on both sides of the cylinder in addition the coupling between the cylinders and the flow is significantly weakened it can be observed from fig 21 b that the pattern is transformed into the regular p s s a single vortex or 2s which leads to a significant change in the motion characteristics of the cylinders the wake of the uc develops backward and merges with vortex of the mc which promotes a drastic fluctuation of the mc the interference between the wake of the mc and dc is opposite to the uc the wake of the mc does not impinges on the dc but passes through both sides of the dc this leads to a significant decrease of the amplitude oscillation of the dc in the transverse direction however compared with the uniform flow case the amplitude values of the mc and dc in the in line direction are significantly increased the interaction process between the three cylinders and flows are described as follows when the mc is moving upward at stage i vortex a2 shed from the upper surface of the uc is gradually developing while b1 has completely shed from the uc meanwhile vortex a1 reaches the upper side of the mc and merges with c1 into a new vortex a1c1 then a strong suction is created at the upper right side of the mc which leads the cylinder to accelerate towards it additionally vortex e1 also reaches the upper side of the dc and restrains the wake development of the dc they creates a small suction at the upper right side of the dc but the impact is insignificant due to the large distance in stage ii when the mc reaches the upper position vortex b1 impinges on the mc and develops into two vortices b11 and b12 at the same time vortex b2 is also gradually developing furthermore vortex a1c1 is about to be shed from the upper side of the mc while vortex d1 is gradually developing a positive pressure zone and a suction pressure zone occur at the left side and lower right of the mc respectively which causes the mc to accelerate to the lower and right directions for the dc the wake of the mc passes through the upper and lower sides of the dc thus two small suction regions are formed at the far wake flow regime which induces the suppression of the amplitude development of the dc at stage iii the mc moves from top to bottom and reaches the equilibrium position vortex a2 has completely shed from the uc and a new vortex a3 appears around the cylinder two vortices b12 and d1 merge into a new vortex b12d1 and a suction is created at the lower rear region of the mc resulting in a significant increase in the amplitudes of the mc at the ending stage iv v the flow distribution and motion of the mc and dc are consistent with i ii 6 conclusion in this study fivs of three tandem circular cylinders immersed in the planar shear flow of varying shear ratios k 0 0 0 05 and 0 1 are investigated by applying a 4 sicbs finite element method the cylinders are allowed to vibrate in both in line and transverse directions the center to center distance of each cylinder is set as 5 5d and the ranges of the reynolds number and reduced velocity are 80 160 and 3 21 respectively it is focused on how the parameters re k and u r would affect vibration amplitudes frequency characteristics motion trajectories flow characteristics and interference mechanisms of the three cylinders tandem system some main findings are summarized as follows 1 at a spacing ratio of 5 5 the tandem three cylinders system is in a binary vortex state where the fivs of the uc are analogy to that of the single cylinder case the effects of three key parameters on the oscillation responses of the midstream and downstream cylinders are more significant for the case of re 120 the vibration amplitude changes slightly with the change of re in the resonance regime as u r increasing the shear ratio impacts differently the amplitudes in transverse direction for the midstream and downstream cylinders for the case of re 160 the flow field gets more intricate which leads to an irregular shape in the amplitude of the cylinders meanwhile there is an obvious increase in the non dimensional maximum amplitudes additionally the in line amplitude of the cylinders is affected by the change of re and k more than the transverse one 2 for the case of re 80 the occurrence of the lock in phenomenon will inevitably strengthen the dynamic responses of the cylinders at the most condition however for the case of re 120 and 160 as u r increases the vibration response mechanism of the cylinders in the in line direction will change into the vortex interference additionally the increases of re and k cause the extension of lock in regions there is a dual lock phenomenon in the shear flow 3 for the case of re 120 the trend of the variation with u r in the trajectories for three cylinders is coincident for the case of re 160 three cylinders mainly oscillate with an irregular shape the change of k has a great impact on the trajectories of three cylinders in the uniform flow case the motion orbits are dominated by the figure eight and irregular shape while the figure eight one transforms into the shape of raindrop oval dual raindrop or dual oval when the cylinder undergoes the shear flow it should pay attention to that the dual eight figure is observed in the motion orbit of the mc 4 the analysis on the instantaneous pressure and the vorticity fields for the case of re 120 k 0 0 and u r 7 is described in detail to reveal the mechanism of fiv response and the change of the wake mode of the cylinders immersing in the uniform and shear flow respectively when the cylinders are subjected to the uniform flow the wake pattern 2t is formed due to the strong interaction between the vortex shedding from the cylinders however for the shear flow case the wake of the uc and mc does not impinge on the dc and passes through both sides of it resulting in a change for the wake mode into the p s and 2s pattern additionally the formation mechanism of the 2t wake pattern is analyzed authors contribution statement jiahuang tu conceptualization
