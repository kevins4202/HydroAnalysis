in modeling dependence for 3 or even higher dimensions aas et al 2009 and thus other models flexible in modeling dependence are desired to facilitate the compound extreme modeling in high dimensions we propose in this study the meta gaussian model for the statistical inference of compound extremes by transforming the individual extreme into the standardized extreme index sei the model utilizes the intrinsic nature of sei and provides an easy way to carry out the statistical modeling of dependence among different extreme indices the application of the proposed model is illustrated for the compound drought and hot extreme in the u s based on monthly precipitation soil moisture and temperature from the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 xia et al 2012 2 method the compound extreme of particular interest in this study is the combined condition of low precipitation soil moisture and high temperature or the compound drought and hot extreme this type of compound extreme is closely related to the precipitation deficit flash droughts that is also characterized by both high temperature anomalies and soil moisture deficits mo and lettenmaier 2016 the soil moisture deficit is closely related to the low precipitation and high temperature which may deplete the soil moisture leading to the occurrence of agricultural drought this phenomenon of compound extreme can be assessed based on the conditional property of soil moisture given precipitation and temperature apparently a trivariate distribution is needed to model the three variables to characterize the associated compound extreme in the following we introduce the meta gaussian model and its application for statistical assessments of compound extremes 2 1 meta gaussian model multivariate distributions are commonly employed to model the dependence between hydrologic variables or properties the meta gaussian model has been proposed to meet the need of representing a full range of association and allowing for flexible forms of marginal distributions for the modeling of bivariate variables in hydrology kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 in the context of characterizing compound extremes the joint modeling of multiple contributing variables in high dimensions is of primary interest consider a random vector x 1 x2 of two continuous random variables with marginal distribution function f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 respectively let n denote the standard normal distribution in the univariate case and n 1 its inverse by applying the normal quantile transformation nqt herr and krzysztofowicz 2005 two standard normal variates can be defined as z 1 n 1 f 1 x 1 and z 2 n 1 f 2 x 2 the meta gaussian model can be used to construct the bivariate distribution of x 1 x2 which can be expressed as kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 1 p x 1 x x 2 x 2 p z 1 z 1 z 2 z 2 z 2 z 1 1 2 π 1 ρ 2 exp t 2 2 ρ s t s 2 2 1 ρ 2 d s d t where ρ is the pearson s correlation coefficient between z1 and z2 s and t are the integral variables the basic idea of the meta gaussian model is to transform the variables under investigation into the normal variate based on the nqt and then the multivariate normal distribution can be used to model joint variations of multivariate variables e g z1 and z2 kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 montanari and brath 2004 wilks 2011 a suite of standardized extreme indices which is advantageous in the consistency and comparability of extremes has been developed based on the nqt including the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 and standardized temperature index sti zscheischler et al 2014 based on the sei the joint and conditional analysis of the extreme indices can be achieved based on meta gaussian model the meta gaussian model is closely related to or sometimes viewed as the gaussian copula renard and lang 2007 vogl et al 2012 ben alaya et al 2014 serinaldi 2016 rueda et al 2016 and has been used for the statistical modeling of hydroclimatic variables montanari and brath 2004 herr and krzysztofowicz 2005 wu et al 2011 one of our focuses in this study is to derive the explicit form of the conditional distribution and thus we introduce the multivariate modeling of compound extremes based on the framework of the meta gaussian model 2 2 conditional distribution based on the property of the multivariate normal distribution the conditional distribution of y a variable or vector conditioned on x a variable or vector is also normally distributed kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 wilks 2011 an interesting property from the proposed meta gaussian model is that the conditional distribution of a sei conditioned on other seis is normally distributed we use three variables y x 1 x 2 which represent ssi spi and sti respectively to illustrate the conditional distribution of y with respect to x x 1 x 2 specifically based on the meta gaussian model to construct the joint distribution of y x 1 x 2 the explicit form of the conditional distribution of y conditioned on x can be expressed as wilks 2011 2 y x n μ y x σ y x where μy x is the conditional mean and σ y x is the conditional covariance matrix these two parameters of the conditional distribution can be expressed as wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 3 μ y x μ y σ yx σ xx 1 x μ x 4 σ y x σ yy σ yx σ xx 1 σ xy where μ x is the means of the vector x and μy is the mean of the variable y σ xx σ xy σ yx and σ yy are covariance matric of the vector x and variable y a detailed expression of this equation for 3 variables can be found in hao et al 2016 3 data and results 3 1 data in this study the monthly precipitation 2 m air temperature meteorological forcing data of nldas 2 and root zone soil moisture with a spatial resolution of 0 125 degree for the period from 1979 to 2014 were obtained from the nldas 2 project xia et al 2012 due to the lack of the large scale and long term observations of soil moisture ford et al 2015 the simulated soil moisture from land surface model is an useful alternative sheffield et al 2004 in this study the simulated soil moisture data were obtained from the noah model which is used as the land component for several operational model systems of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep xia et al 2014 sun et al 2018 since the compound drought and hot extreme is of primary interest we perform the statistical analysis of the compound extreme in the summer season the meteorological drought is generally characterized by spi of multiple time scales based on the monthly precipitation the soil moisture condition responds to the short scale precipitation anomalies while streamflow groundwater or reservoir storage responds to the long term precipitation anomalies svoboda et al 2012 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 in this study we use the 3 month spi as the drought indicator which has been commonly employed for the assessment of drought or wetness and its interaction with hot extreme mueller and seneviratne 2012 zscheischler et al 2014 the 3 month spi is also effective in capturing available moisture conditions in primary agricultural regions e g a 3 month spi at the end of august in the u s would capture the trend of precipitation during the reproductive and early grain filling stage of certain crops svoboda et al 2012 the root zone soil moisture is a governing factor for vegetative growth and can be employed as a direct indicator of agricultural drought keyantash and dracup 2002 sheffield et al 2004 the 1 month soil moisture e g percentile is commonly used for the monitoring of the agricultural drought sheffield et al 2004 xia et al 2014 and is also employed in this study based on the ssi following the previous study zscheischler et al 2014 we characterize the hot extreme based on the sti of 1 month time scale which can be used to capture the instant response of the terrestrial flux related to the plant for deriving the spi or other standardized extreme indices a variety of parametric distributions has been proposed and validated stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano and beguería 2016 an alternative way to estimate the marginal distribution is the empirical method which does not rely on a specific form of parametric distributions in this study the empirical gringorten distribution gringorten 1963 is employed to estimate the marginal distribution to derive these standardized extreme indices including spi ssi and sti these indices for august were used for the subsequent analysis to illustrate the application of the proposed model in compound extreme analysis 3 2 dependence pattern the correlation among the three indices during august is shown in fig 1 a c and that significant at a 5 significance level is shown in fig 1 d f it can be seen that there is significant correlation among the spi ssi and sti in large regions in the u s the correlation between spi and ssi during august is positive in all regions this is intuitive in that the agricultural drought or soil moisture is generally dependent on the precipitation or meteorological drought the correlation between the spi and sti is mostly negative during august especially in the southern and southeastern u s the negative dependence between spi and sti is mainly due to the land surface interaction i e the soil moisture deficit may induce the decreased evaporative cooling and increased sensible heat flux leading to the high temperature seneviratne et al 2010 hirschi et al 2011 mueller and seneviratne 2012 berg et al 2014 whan et al 2015 for example the negative correlation between the spi and sti is even lower in the high plains with significant land atmosphere interactions the dependence between ssi and sti shows similar pattern to that between spi and sti these results highlighted significant dependence among these indices thus it is important to take into account the dependence in the assessment of compound drought and hot extremes 3 3 joint probability of compound extreme in analyzing the compound drought and hot extreme based on the precipitation soil moisture deficit and high temperature the joint probability of spi ssi lower than certain thresholds and sti higher than certain thresholds is of particular interest with the three extreme indices ssi spi and sti represented by y x 1 and x 2 the joint probability p y y x 1 x 1 and x 2 x 2 of the compound extreme based on the meta gaussian model can be obtained as 5 p y y x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 p y y x 1 x 1 p y y x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 φ 2 y x 1 φ 3 y x 1 x 2 where the function ф 2 ф 3 is the bivariate trivariate standard normal distribution function the joint percentile or probability has been commonly used for the characterization of the overall condition of multiple hydrologic variables extremes beersma and buishand 2004 kao and govindaraju 2010 chebana and ouarda 2011 in the context of multiple extreme indices the joint percentile in equation 5 summarizes the joint condition from extreme indices and can be used to measure the severity of the compound drought and hot extremes specifically the low probability indicates severe conditions of the compound extreme the joint probability estimated from equation 5 for the period august 2011 in u s is shown in fig 2 along with the other three indices spi ssi and sti the spi and ssi show severe drought conditions with index values lower than 1 in large regions in southern u s the sti shows anomaly high temperature with index value higher than 1 in these regions the extremely low spi and ssi and high sti imply compound drought and hot extreme during this period the joint percentile or probability for the period is extremely low 0 05 in the southern u s particularly in texas indicating the severe condition of the compound extreme during 2011 for the statistical assessment of compound extremes it is also of interest to assess the probability of specified thresholds of the individual component in this section we focus on the concurrent extreme of lower spi ssi and higher sti here we specify the threshold value for ssi spi as 0 0 5 0 8 and 1 2 and that for sti as 0 0 5 0 8 and 1 5 which corresponds to 50th 30th 20th and 10th percentile for spi ssi or 50th 70th 80th and 90th for sti the threshold values 0 5 0 8 and 1 2 correspond to the abnormally dry moderate drought and severe drought as defined in the u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 the joint probability of this type of compound extreme in the u s is shown in fig 3 we take the compound extreme with spi ssi 0 8 and sti 0 8 as an example it can be seen that the probability of compound drought and hot extreme is relatively high along the regions with significant negative correlations between spi or ssi and sti the is likely due to the interaction between the moisture deficit and high temperature in this region which may induce the concurrent dry and hot extremes leading to the high likelihood of compound extremes similar patterns of the low joint probability for other thresholds were also revealed from fig 3 the difference is that with thresholds of the spi and ssi get lower and that of the sti gets higher the joint probability of the compound extreme become even lower 3 4 conditional probability of compound extremes the conditional probability enables the assessment of the impact of temperature and precipitation on the occurrence of agricultural drought the conditional probability of soil moisture lower than 30th percentile or ssi 0 5 given different precipitation deficit spi 0 5 1 2 and high temperature condition sti 0 5 1 2 can be obtained from equation 2 and is shown in fig 4 a d comparing fig 4 a and b shows that the precipitation deficit significantly affects the agricultural drought in most regions in the u s which is easy to understand since meteorological drought is generally the prerequisite of the agricultural drought comparing fig 4 a and c shows the impact of the temperature on the agricultural drought it can be seen that significant changes of the probability are mainly in the high plains region and southeastern regions where the soil moisture temperature interactions are most profound koster et al 2009 the main reason is that as stated before the soil moisture deficit induces warm temperature due to the soil moisture temperature interaction during summer meanwhile the warm temperature and associated high evaporation may lead to dry soil moisture and further exacerbate the occurrence of drought leading to the co occurrence of drought and hot extreme in the western region with low correlation between ssi and sti the changes of probability from fig 4 a and c is relatively small which implies that the temperature does not play an important role compared with precipitation in affecting the agricultural drought in this region comparing fig 4 a and d shows the combined impact from the both precipitation and temperature implying that given the low precipitation and high temperature the condition of the agricultural drought is expected to be even severe 3 5 conditional return period a commonly used way to assess the likelihood of extremes is through the return period rp with respect to an exceedance or nonexceedance probability p of interest rp 1 p we use the 2011 texas drought and hot extreme as an example to estimate the conditional return period we first obtain the monthly precipitation soil moisture and temperature of texas by taking the average of all grids for the whole state the three indices are then computed based on the statewide average of each variable the scatter plot of these indices are show in fig 5 a noticeable pattern is the negative positive dependence between ssi and sti spi which implies the importance of analyzing the agricultural drought from a multivariate approach the meta gaussian model is then constructed to estimate the conditional distribution and return period to assess the performance of the mega gaussian model in modeling these three indices realizations of the random vector z1 z2 z3 are generated and compared with the observations the statistical simulation is achieved based on the conditional distribution method johnson 1987 aas et al 2009 first generate three uniform random values w 1 w 2 and w 3 between 0 1 which can be achieved with the use of the random number generator function rand in matlab the random variate z 1 can be generated by solving z 1 q 1 w 1 based on equation 2 one can derive the conditional distribution of z2 condition on z1 i e f z2 z1 the random variate z 2 can be generated by solving w 2 f 1 z 2 z 1 similarly the conditional distribution of z3 condition on z1 and z2 i e g z3 z1 z2 can be derived from equation 2 the random variate z 3 can then be generated by solving w 3 g 1 z 3 z 1 z 2 a sequence of simulations with the sample size n 150 from this procedure is shown in fig 5 a c it can be seen that this model performs relatively well in modeling the dependence among different indices the conditional distribution of the ssi conditioned on the spi and sti for august 2011 is estimated from eq 2 which is normal distribution and is shown in fig 5 d the conditional return period can be employed to assess the likelihood of the agricultural drought given meteorological drought and hot extreme we compare the univariate return period of the agricultural drought and the conditional return period given the meteorological drought and hot extreme during this period in the univariate case the empirical return period of the soil moisture or agricultural drought for august 2011 is estimated as 64 5 years based on the gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 the conditional return period of the agricultural drought with respect to the spi and sti for august 2011 is estimated as 3 0 year one can see that the conditional return period is much shorter than the univariate period the reason is that given the low precipitation and high temperature it is expected that the occurrence of the agricultural drought will be more frequently the proposed framework thus provides a useful tool in estimating the likelihood of the compound extreme in this regard 4 conclusions due to the intrinsic nature of dependence among multiple contributing variables or processes of the compound extreme statistical inference of the relationship among different extremes requires suitable dependence modeling in this study the meta gaussian model is proposed for the modeling of multiple extremes for the statistical analysis of the compound extreme in the u s based on monthly precipitation soil moisture and temperature from nldas 2 the application of the model is illustrated for statistical assessments of the compound drought with spi and ssi as the indicator and hot extreme with sti as the indicator the likelihood of the occurrence of compound drought and hot extreme is higher in regions such as high plains with significant land atmosphere interactions the compound drought and hot extreme during august 2011 in texas was used as a case study for the multivariate analysis results show the conditional return period of ssi with respect to the spi and sti is around 3 0 years which is much shorter than the univariate empirical return period 64 5 years the use of meta gaussian method bears the advantage that the multivariate distribution in the high dimension can be derived straightforward with an explicit form though extreme indices may not strictly follow the multivariate normal assumption the meta gaussian model is still a useful approximation to the parent distribution of the underlying data and many properties are robust to the departure from normality rencher and christensen 2012 this study mainly focused on the compound extreme defined by the precipitation deficit soil moisture deficit and high temperature it can be essentially applied to other types of compound extremes such as the heat wave flash droughts characterized by the low soil moisture sm induced by high temperature and evapotranspiration mo and lettenmaier 2015 otkin et al 2018 in this study the spi ssi and sti based on the monthly precipitation soil moisture and temperature are employed for characterizing the compound drought and hot extremes certain extremes such as the flash drought and heat wave may occur in a much shorter time scale thus extreme indices of shorter time scales e g daily 5 day may be used instead for the assessment of the compound extremes or impacts in addition we use the spi ssi and sti of the same month to define the compound extreme in this study in reality there may be some time lags between the meteorological drought and hydrological drought between the agricultural drought and high temperature or between extremes drivers and impacts mueller and seneviratne 2012 zscheischler et al 2014 van loon 2015 nicolai shaw et al 2017 thus the time lag between the extremes or impacts should also be taken into account in statistical characterizations of the compound extreme and its impact based on the proposed model moreover the selection of time scales of spi ssi and sti was mainly based on the common practices in previous studies for illustration purposes in this study these indices have been used to study drought or hot extremes and the relationship may vary among the indices of different time scales or regions layers of soil moisture mo 2008 mishra and singh 2010 sehgal et al 2017 thus careful assessments are needed in selecting the time scale of different indices to assess compound extremes of interest due to the limited availability of the soil moisture observations the soil moisture simulated from land surface models was used in the statistical assessments of the compound extreme this may induce uncertainties in the results e g correlation pattern and thus findings from this study should be interpreted with caveats the potential limitation of the proposed model is that it may not be quite accurate in characterizing the dependence at the extremal level e g 99 percentile wang et al 2014 for the complicated dependence modeling e g asymmetric dependence in high dimensions the vine copula or the pair copula construction pcc is a promising alternative which has been developed through decomposing the dependence structure into bivariate dependence that can be modeled with bivariate copulas aas et al 2009 brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2016 for example the compound flood event resulting from the joint storm surge and high river runoff in ravenna italy has been studied using the vine copula to construct the high dimensional distribution bevacqua et al 2017 we stress that the proposed method provides an alternative way to other tools e g vine copula for compound extreme analysis but does not mean to replace the currently used models statistical assessments of the multivariate behavior of different contributing variables of the compound extreme in this study may provide useful insights into the likelihood

distributed kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 wilks 2011 an interesting property from the proposed meta gaussian model is that the conditional distribution of a sei conditioned on other seis is normally distributed we use three variables y x 1 x 2 which represent ssi spi and sti respectively to illustrate the conditional distribution of y with respect to x x 1 x 2 specifically based on the meta gaussian model to construct the joint distribution of y x 1 x 2 the explicit form of the conditional distribution of y conditioned on x can be expressed as wilks 2011 2 y x n μ y x σ y x where μy x is the conditional mean and σ y x is the conditional covariance matrix these two parameters of the conditional distribution can be expressed as wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 3 μ y x μ y σ yx σ xx 1 x μ x 4 σ y x σ yy σ yx σ xx 1 σ xy where μ x is the means of the vector x and μy is the mean of the variable y σ xx σ xy σ yx and σ yy are covariance matric of the vector x and variable y a detailed expression of this equation for 3 variables can be found in hao et al 2016 3 data and results 3 1 data in this study the monthly precipitation 2 m air temperature meteorological forcing data of nldas 2 and root zone soil moisture with a spatial resolution of 0 125 degree for the period from 1979 to 2014 were obtained from the nldas 2 project xia et al 2012 due to the lack of the large scale and long term observations of soil moisture ford et al 2015 the simulated soil moisture from land surface model is an useful alternative sheffield et al 2004 in this study the simulated soil moisture data were obtained from the noah model which is used as the land component for several operational model systems of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep xia et al 2014 sun et al 2018 since the compound drought and hot extreme is of primary interest we perform the statistical analysis of the compound extreme in the summer season the meteorological drought is generally characterized by spi of multiple time scales based on the monthly precipitation the soil moisture condition responds to the short scale precipitation anomalies while streamflow groundwater or reservoir storage responds to the long term precipitation anomalies svoboda et al 2012 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 in this study we use the 3 month spi as the drought indicator which has been commonly employed for the assessment of drought or wetness and its interaction with hot extreme mueller and seneviratne 2012 zscheischler et al 2014 the 3 month spi is also effective in capturing available moisture conditions in primary agricultural regions e g a 3 month spi at the end of august in the u s would capture the trend of precipitation during the reproductive and early grain filling stage of certain crops svoboda et al 2012 the root zone soil moisture is a governing factor for vegetative growth and can be employed as a direct indicator of agricultural drought keyantash and dracup 2002 sheffield et al 2004 the 1 month soil moisture e g percentile is commonly used for the monitoring of the agricultural drought sheffield et al 2004 xia et al 2014 and is also employed in this study based on the ssi following the previous study zscheischler et al 2014 we characterize the hot extreme based on the sti of 1 month time scale which can be used to capture the instant response of the terrestrial flux related to the plant for deriving the spi or other standardized extreme indices a variety of parametric distributions has been proposed and validated stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano and beguería 2016 an alternative way to estimate the marginal distribution is the empirical method which does not rely on a specific form of parametric distributions in this study the empirical gringorten distribution gringorten 1963 is employed to estimate the marginal distribution to derive these standardized extreme indices including spi ssi and sti these indices for august were used for the subsequent analysis to illustrate the application of the proposed model in compound extreme analysis 3 2 dependence pattern the correlation among the three indices during august is shown in fig 1 a c and that significant at a 5 significance level is shown in fig 1 d f it can be seen that there is significant correlation among the spi ssi and sti in large regions in the u s the correlation between spi and ssi during august is positive in all regions this is intuitive in that the agricultural drought or soil moisture is generally dependent on the precipitation or meteorological drought the correlation between the spi and sti is mostly negative during august especially in the southern and southeastern u s the negative dependence between spi and sti is mainly due to the land surface interaction i e the soil moisture deficit may induce the decreased evaporative cooling and increased sensible heat flux leading to the high temperature seneviratne et al 2010 hirschi et al 2011 mueller and seneviratne 2012 berg et al 2014 whan et al 2015 for example the negative correlation between the spi and sti is even lower in the high plains with significant land atmosphere interactions the dependence between ssi and sti shows similar pattern to that between spi and sti these results highlighted significant dependence among these indices thus it is important to take into account the dependence in the assessment of compound drought and hot extremes 3 3 joint probability of compound extreme in analyzing the compound drought and hot extreme based on the precipitation soil moisture deficit and high temperature the joint probability of spi ssi lower than certain thresholds and sti higher than certain thresholds is of particular interest with the three extreme indices ssi spi and sti represented by y x 1 and x 2 the joint probability p y y x 1 x 1 and x 2 x 2 of the compound extreme based on the meta gaussian model can be obtained as 5 p y y x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 p y y x 1 x 1 p y y x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 φ 2 y x 1 φ 3 y x 1 x 2 where the function ф 2 ф 3 is the bivariate trivariate standard normal distribution function the joint percentile or probability has been commonly used for the characterization of the overall condition of multiple hydrologic variables extremes beersma and buishand 2004 kao and govindaraju 2010 chebana and ouarda 2011 in the context of multiple extreme indices the joint percentile in equation 5 summarizes the joint condition from extreme indices and can be used to measure the severity of the compound drought and hot extremes specifically the low probability indicates severe conditions of the compound extreme the joint probability estimated from equation 5 for the period august 2011 in u s is shown in fig 2 along with the other three indices spi ssi and sti the spi and ssi show severe drought conditions with index values lower than 1 in large regions in southern u s the sti shows anomaly high temperature with index value higher than 1 in these regions the extremely low spi and ssi and high sti imply compound drought and hot extreme during this period the joint percentile or probability for the period is extremely low 0 05 in the southern u s particularly in texas indicating the severe condition of the compound extreme during 2011 for the statistical assessment of compound extremes it is also of interest to assess the probability of specified thresholds of the individual component in this section we focus on the concurrent extreme of lower spi ssi and higher sti here we specify the threshold value for ssi spi as 0 0 5 0 8 and 1 2 and that for sti as 0 0 5 0 8 and 1 5 which corresponds to 50th 30th 20th and 10th percentile for spi ssi or 50th 70th 80th and 90th for sti the threshold values 0 5 0 8 and 1 2 correspond to the abnormally dry moderate drought and severe drought as defined in the u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 the joint probability of this type of compound extreme in the u s is shown in fig 3 we take the compound extreme with spi ssi 0 8 and sti 0 8 as an example it can be seen that the probability of compound drought and hot extreme is relatively high along the regions with significant negative correlations between spi or ssi and sti the is likely due to the interaction between the moisture deficit and high temperature in this region which may induce the concurrent dry and hot extremes leading to the high likelihood of compound extremes similar patterns of the low joint probability for other thresholds were also revealed from fig 3 the difference is that with thresholds of the spi and ssi get lower and that of the sti gets higher the joint probability of the compound extreme become even lower 3 4 conditional probability of compound extremes the conditional probability enables the assessment of the impact of temperature and precipitation on the occurrence of agricultural drought the conditional probability of soil moisture lower than 30th percentile or ssi 0 5 given different precipitation deficit spi 0 5 1 2 and high temperature condition sti 0 5 1 2 can be obtained from equation 2 and is shown in fig 4 a d comparing fig 4 a and b shows that the precipitation deficit significantly affects the agricultural drought in most regions in the u s which is easy to understand since meteorological drought is generally the prerequisite of the agricultural drought comparing fig 4 a and c shows the impact of the temperature on the agricultural drought it can be seen that significant changes of the probability are mainly in the high plains region and southeastern regions where the soil moisture temperature interactions are most profound koster et al 2009 the main reason is that as stated before the soil moisture deficit induces warm temperature due to the soil moisture temperature interaction during summer meanwhile the warm temperature and associated high evaporation may lead to dry soil moisture and further exacerbate the occurrence of drought leading to the co occurrence of drought and hot extreme in the western region with low correlation between ssi and sti the changes of probability from fig 4 a and c is relatively small which implies that the temperature does not play an important role compared with precipitation in affecting the agricultural drought in this region comparing fig 4 a and d shows the combined impact from the both precipitation and temperature implying that given the low precipitation and high temperature the condition of the agricultural drought is expected to be even severe 3 5 conditional return period a commonly used way to assess the likelihood of extremes is through the return period rp with respect to an exceedance or nonexceedance probability p of interest rp 1 p we use the 2011 texas drought and hot extreme as an example to estimate the conditional return period we first obtain the monthly precipitation soil moisture and temperature of texas by taking the average of all grids for the whole state the three indices are then computed based on the statewide average of each variable the scatter plot of these indices are show in fig 5 a noticeable pattern is the negative positive dependence between ssi and sti spi which implies the importance of analyzing the agricultural drought from a multivariate approach the meta gaussian model is then constructed to estimate the conditional distribution and return period to assess the performance of the mega gaussian model in modeling these three indices realizations of the random vector z1 z2 z3 are generated and compared with the observations the statistical simulation is achieved based on the conditional distribution method johnson 1987 aas et al 2009 first generate three uniform random values w 1 w 2 and w 3 between 0 1 which can be achieved with the use of the random number generator function rand in matlab the random variate z 1 can be generated by solving z 1 q 1 w 1 based on equation 2 one can derive the conditional distribution of z2 condition on z1 i e f z2 z1 the random variate z 2 can be generated by solving w 2 f 1 z 2 z 1 similarly the conditional distribution of z3 condition on z1 and z2 i e g z3 z1 z2 can be derived from equation 2 the random variate z 3 can then be generated by solving w 3 g 1 z 3 z 1 z 2 a sequence of simulations with the sample size n 150 from this procedure is shown in fig 5 a c it can be seen that this model performs relatively well in modeling the dependence among different indices the conditional distribution of the ssi conditioned on the spi and sti for august 2011 is estimated from eq 2 which is normal distribution and is shown in fig 5 d the conditional return period can be employed to assess the likelihood of the agricultural drought given meteorological drought and hot extreme we compare the univariate return period of the agricultural drought and the conditional return period given the meteorological drought and hot extreme during this period in the univariate case the empirical return period of the soil moisture or agricultural drought for august 2011 is estimated as 64 5 years based on the gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 the conditional return period of the agricultural drought with respect to the spi and sti for august 2011 is estimated as 3 0 year one can see that the conditional return period is much shorter than the univariate period the reason is that given the low precipitation and high temperature it is expected that the occurrence of the agricultural drought will be more frequently the proposed framework thus provides a useful tool in estimating the likelihood of the compound extreme in this regard 4 conclusions due to the intrinsic nature of dependence among multiple contributing variables or processes of the compound extreme statistical inference of the relationship among different extremes requires suitable dependence modeling in this study the meta gaussian model is proposed for the modeling of multiple extremes for the statistical analysis of the compound extreme in the u s based on monthly precipitation soil moisture and temperature from nldas 2 the application of the model is illustrated for statistical assessments of the compound drought with spi and ssi as the indicator and hot extreme with sti as the indicator the likelihood of the occurrence of compound drought and hot extreme is higher in regions such as high plains with significant land atmosphere interactions the compound drought and hot extreme during august 2011 in texas was used as a case study for the multivariate analysis results show the conditional return period of ssi with respect to the spi and sti is around 3 0 years which is much shorter than the univariate empirical return period 64 5 years the use of meta gaussian method bears the advantage that the multivariate distribution in the high dimension can be derived straightforward with an explicit form though extreme indices may not strictly follow the multivariate normal assumption the meta gaussian model is still a useful approximation to the parent distribution of the underlying data and many properties are robust to the departure from normality rencher and christensen 2012 this study mainly focused on the compound extreme defined by the precipitation deficit soil moisture deficit and high temperature it can be essentially applied to other types of compound extremes such as the heat wave flash droughts characterized by the low soil moisture sm induced by high temperature and evapotranspiration mo and lettenmaier 2015 otkin et al 2018 in this study the spi ssi and sti based on the monthly precipitation soil moisture and temperature are employed for characterizing the compound drought and hot extremes certain extremes such as the flash drought and heat wave may occur in a much shorter time scale thus extreme indices of shorter time scales e g daily 5 day may be used instead for the assessment of the compound extremes or impacts in addition we use the spi ssi and sti of the same month to define the compound extreme in this study in reality there may be some time lags between the meteorological drought and hydrological drought between the agricultural drought and high temperature or between extremes drivers and impacts mueller and seneviratne 2012 zscheischler et al 2014 van loon 2015 nicolai shaw et al 2017 thus the time lag between the extremes or impacts should also be taken into account in statistical characterizations of the compound extreme and its impact based on the proposed model moreover the selection of time scales of spi ssi and sti was mainly based on the common practices in previous studies for illustration purposes in this study these indices have been used to study drought or hot extremes and the relationship may vary among the indices of different time scales or regions layers of soil moisture mo 2008 mishra and singh 2010 sehgal et al 2017 thus careful assessments are needed in selecting the time scale of different indices to assess compound extremes of interest due to the limited availability of the soil moisture observations the soil moisture simulated from land surface models was used in the statistical assessments of the compound extreme this may induce uncertainties in the results e g correlation pattern and thus findings from this study should be interpreted with caveats the potential limitation of the proposed model is that it may not be quite accurate in characterizing the dependence at the extremal level e g 99 percentile wang et al 2014 for the complicated dependence modeling e g asymmetric dependence in high dimensions the vine copula or the pair copula construction pcc is a promising alternative which has been developed through decomposing the dependence structure into bivariate dependence that can be modeled with bivariate copulas aas et al 2009 brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2016 for example the compound flood event resulting from the joint storm surge and high river runoff in ravenna italy has been studied using the vine copula to construct the high dimensional distribution bevacqua et al 2017 we stress that the proposed method provides an alternative way to other tools e g vine copula for compound extreme analysis but does not mean to replace the currently used models statistical assessments of the multivariate behavior of different contributing variables of the compound extreme in this study may provide useful insights into the likelihood

6991,the frequency and intensity of drought could be increasing with global warming when drought occurs the runoff generation process and the precipitation runoff relationship might change in this study the precipitation runoff relationship in drought years was systematically investigated in the largest freshwater lake basin of china namely the poyang lake basin the results showed that the precipitation runoff relationship changed significantly p 0 05 in drought years the annual runoff coefficient in drought years decreased by 24 1 compared with that in non drought years the decreased

objective function nash sutcliffe efficiency significantly overestimated runoff in drought years three additional objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations significantly improved the accuracy of runoff simulation in drought years therefore we recommend that the selected objective functions for runoff simulation in drought years should be sensitive to low flow simulations otherwise the water resources availability will be overestimated in drought years keywords drought precipitation runoff relationship hydrological model objective function 1 introduction drought is one of the most destructive and costly natural disasters and it has far reaching negative impacts on agriculture water resources environment and human life goddard et al 2005 ghulam et al 2007 under climate change drought events are expected to increase in frequency and severity easterling et al 2000 sheffield et al 2012 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 wu et al 2018 in the 21st century the cases have been abundant such as long term drought events in the western united states westerling and swetnam 2003 dennison et al 2014 southeast australia dijk et al 2013 kirono et al 2017 and northeast dong et al 2011 faiz et al 2018 when drought occurs the precipitation runoff relationship and the runoff coefficient could be changed kiem and verdon kidd 2010 dijk et al 2013 chiew et al 2014 miao et al 2015 2016 liu et al 2018 during the 10 year drought from 1946 to 1956 in the usda ars riesel watersheds allen et al 2011 found that the annual average precipitation decreased by 27 while runoff decreased by 75 during the 9 year drought from 1991 to 1999 in the loess plateau of china zhang et al 2018 indicated that the average runoff coefficient decreased from 0 1 to 0 068 during the millennium drought in southeastern australia saft et al 2015 showed that the precipitation runoff relationship had a significant shift potter and chiew 2011 demonstrated that the annual average precipitation decreased by 15 while runoff decreased by 59 in the campaspe river basin of southeastern australia changes in the precipitation runoff relationship can be affected by the duration and severity of a drought previous studies mainly focused on the impacts of drought duration on the precipitation runoff relationship while few studies investigated the impacts of drought severity on the precipitation runoff relationship the precipitation runoff relationship is typically simulated using hydrological models some studies found that the performances of hydrological models degraded when the climate condition of catchments significantly changed vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 troin et al 2012 found that the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of runoff simulations decreased by 0 27 when the precipitation decreased by 23 in laguna mar chiquita of argentina chiew et al 2009 indicated that the accuracy of runoff simulation significantly decreased in three catchments of southeastern australia when the climate became dry saft et al 2016 investigated the performances of 6 hydrological models in runoff simulations during drought years in 124 catchments of southeastern australia they showed that the average nse of runoff simulations was below 0 2 and the average relative bias of runoff simulations was over 80 for all of the 6 models in drought years these studies indicated that the accuracy of runoff simulation decreased when drought occurred accurate hydrological simulations are important for the prediction of available water resources especially when drought occurs two methods are typically used to improve the accuracy of hydrological simulations in drought years the first method is using different split sample test schemes to acquire suitable parameters for hydrological simulations klemeš 1986 vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 li et al 2012 the second method is using objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations to calibrate the hydrological models sorooshian et al 1983 yapo et al 1998 krause et al 2005 fowler et al 2018 the objectives of this study include 1 to systematically analyze the impacts of drought on the precipitation runoff relationship in the largest freshwater lake basin of china namely the poyang lake basin and 2 to investigate how to improve runoff simulations in drought years in the poyang lake basin first we investigated the impacts of drought on the precipitation runoff relationship based on hydrological observations next we simulated runoff using two hydrological models and focused on the performances of hydrological models in drought years finally we explored how to improve the accuracy of runoff simulations in drought years 2 study area and data sources poyang lake basin 113 5 118 5 e 24 5 30 1 n is located in the middle yangtze river of china fig 1 the basin area is approximately 162 000 km2 accounting for approximately 9 of the area of the yangtze river basin the annual average flows of the basin into the yangtze river account for 15 6 of the total flows of the yangtze river the basin belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate annual precipitation ranges from 1200 to 2400 mm and 80 of precipitation occurs from march to september the basin has china s largest freshwater lake namely the poyang lake which plays an important ecological and hydrological role in the middle and lower yangtze river hu et al 2007 poyang lake receives the inflows of five main tributaries ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui in this study the poyang lake basin is divided into 18 sub catchments based on the runoff control stations and the catchment areas range from 435 to 80 948 km2 fig 1 the monthly runoff observations in 18 hydrological stations from 1960 to 2013 were provided by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resource of china monthly climate observations in 83 metrological stations from 1960 to 2013 were obtained from the national climate center of china meteorological administration including precipitation temperatures relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours http data cma cn all the climate data were spatially averaged across each of the 18 catchments by the cokriging interpolation algorithm using arcgis software which takes a digital elevation model as an additional input isaaks and srivastava 1988 3 methods 3 1 drought definition the standardized precipitation index spi was used to identify drought in this study the spi was developed by mckee et al 1993 to quantify precipitation anomaly with respect to long term normal condition from multiple time scales the spi can be computed for any time scale from 1 2 3 48 to 72 months edwards 1997 and the typically used time scales are 3 6 12 and 24 months the time scales of 3 or 6 months are typically used in agricultural management because soil moisture depletion and crop growth are sensitive to short time droughts sims and raman 2002 the time scales of 12 or 24 months are typically used in hydrological research because runoff and groundwater could be significantly influenced when long time droughts occur szalai and szinell 2000 wu et al 2001 łabędzki 2007 the spi of 12 months spi 12 was used for identifying the drought year since this study focused on hydrological responses to drought mckee et al 1993 initially divided drought severity into four categories namely mild moderate severe and extreme drought they defined that mild drought starts from the moment when the spi value is less than 0 however agnew 2000 found that it is too fast for the conversion from wet to dry if all negative values of spi are distinguished as the occurrence of drought thus some modified classifications were used for example łabędzki 2007 xu et al 2011 and thomas et al 2015 proposed that mild drought starts from the moment when spi value is less 0 5 and this classification is adopted as the national standard of china gb t 20481 2006 in this study the year was determined as a drought year when the spi 12 value of the year is less than 0 5 3 2 method for determining the significance of change in annual precipitation runoff relationship between drought years and non drought years in this study a multiple regression method was used to analyze the significance of change in annual precipitation runoff relationship between drought years and non drought years saft et al 2015 1 q a 0 a 1 i a 2 p ε where q is annual runoff p is annual precipitation i is a drought indictor set to 1 for drought years and 0 for non drought years a0 is the intercept of the multiple regression line a1 and a2 are regression coefficients and ε is the residual of the regression the method hypothesizes that the precipitation runoff relationship in drought years is different from that in non drought years then a t test was applied to test this hypothesis if a1 is equal to 0 the precipitation runoff relationship has no significant differences between drought years and non drought years if a1 is not equal to 0 the precipitation runoff relationship is significantly different between drought years and non drought years 3 3 monthly hydrological models to reduce the dependence of runoff simulation results on a single model two monthly conceptual hydrological models namely the snowmelt based water balance model swbm model wang et al 2005 and the abcd model thomas 1981 were used in this study both models have simple structures and only require precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet as inputs the swbm model has been successfully applied in various catchments of china wang et al 2005 li et al 2013 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 bai et al 2016 the abcd model has been tested in many catchments worldwide with various climatic conditions alley 1984 gupta et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 detailed information about the structures and equations of the two models are listed in fig 2 the swbm model has three parameters smax ks kg aet is calculated using a soil evapotranspiration linear formula e1 in fig 2 surface runoff rs is calculated using a linear formula related to soil moisture and precipitation based on the linear reservoir theory e2 in fig 2 base flow rg is calculated using a linear formula related to soil moisture e3 in fig 2 wang et al 2005 wang et al 2013 the abcd model has four parameters a b c d and divides the storage layer into soil moisture storage and groundwater storage the model defines two key state variables wt as available water and yt as evapotranspiration opportunity thomas 1981 available water is the sum of precipitation during month t and soil water storage at the beginning of month t and evapotranspiration opportunity is the sum of aet during month t and soil water storage at the end of month t yt is postulated as a nonlinear function of wt e5 in fig 2 aet is calculated using a nonlinear formula related to yt e8 in fig 2 rs and rg are calculated using linear formulas related to water available for runoff and groundwater storage respectively e9 and e11 in fig 2 respectively detailed descriptions of the abcd model can be found in fernandez et al 2000 and martinez and gupta 2010 3 4 model calibration validation and performance assessment the classic split sample test scheme klemeš 1986 was used for calibration and validation of the two hydrological models in this study the available data in each catchment were spilt into two sub periods with equal time series lengths namely sub period i 1960 1986 and sub period ii 1987 2013 the hydrological models were calibrated in sub period i and validated in sub period ii the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is probably the most widely used objective function worldwide was used to calibrate the two hydrological models in this study a global optimization algorithm namely the genetic algorithm wang 1991 was used to find the parameter sets of the swbm model and abcd model this algorithm is a robust and efficient search algorithm which has been widely applied to calibrate hydrological models boyle et al 2000 duan et al 1992 tolson and shoemaker 2007 to test the performances of the two hydrological models the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and relative bias rb were used as the criteria 2 kge 1 1 γ 2 1 α 2 1 β 2 with α σ s σ o β μ s μ o where μs and σs are the mean and standard deviation of the simulations respectively μo and σo are the mean and standard deviation of the observations respectively and r is the correlation coefficient between observations and simulations the value of kge ranges from negative infinity to 1 when kge is equal to 1 it indicates perfect runoff simulations 3 rb i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i i 1 n q obs i 100 where qobs i and qsim i are the observed and simulated monthly runoff respectively and n is total number of time steps the value of rb ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity when rb is equal to 0 it indicates perfect runoff simulations 3 5 different objective functions for model calibration different objective functions were used to improve the accuracy of runoff simulations in drought years krause et al 2005 recommended the nse calculated on relative flows rqnse and relative index of agreement ria for low flow simulations oudin et al 2006 found that nse calculated on log transformed flows lognse had good performance for low flow simulations in this study three additional objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations namely lognse rqnse and ria were used to calibrate the hydrological models the performances of the hydrological models calibrated by the four objective functions were compared in drought years the details of the objective functions are listed in table 1 4 results 4 1 comparisons of annual precipitation runoff relationships between drought years and non drought years for the 18 sub catchments catchment 12 had the maximum number of drought years and 18 years among the 54 years were identified as drought years catchment 13 had the minimum number of drought years with 13 years the t test showed that annual precipitation runoff relationship had a significant p 0 00 difference between drought years and non drought years for the average of the 18 catchments table 2 for the 18 individual sub catchments the annual precipitation runoff relationship between drought years and non drought years changed significantly p 0 05 in 17 catchments except for catchment 9 p 0 37 changes in the annual precipitation runoff relationship between drought years and non drought years are shown in fig 3 the red line representing annual precipitation runoff relationship in drought years shifted downward compared with the black line representing annual precipitation runoff relationship in non drought years this indicates that runoff generated by per unit of precipitation decreased in drought years runoff coefficient rc describing the runoff generated by per unit of precipitation is used to quantitatively estimate the change magnitude of the annual precipitation runoff relationship for the average of the 18 sub catchments rc decreased by 24 1 in drought years compared with non drought years for the 18 individual sub catchments the decrease magnitudes of rc range from 17 6 to 34 5 the impact of drought severity i e spi value on the change magnitude of runoff coefficient rcchange is shown in table 3 the rcchange had a significant positive relationship with the spi value for the average of the 18 sub catchments the correlation coefficient r between the rcchange and spi value is 0 65 p 0 01 for the individual 18 sub catchments r values range from 0 36 to 0 84 and the median value of r is 0 60 table 3 this indicated that the decreased magnitudes of rc significantly increased with the increase in drought severity 4 2 the runoff simulations using hydrological models in drought years generally both the abcd model and swbm model performed well in the calibration and validation periods for the 18 sub catchments table 4 in the calibration period the median kge values between the observed and simulated runoff using the abcd model and swbm model are 0 93 and 0 90 respectively the median runoff relative bias rb between observed and simulated runoff using the two models are 0 8 and 0 5 respectively in the validation period the median kge values for the two models are 0 92 and 0 89 respectively and the median runoff relative bias are 1 7 and 2 9 respectively both models have high kge value and low relative bias value the abcd model performs slightly better than the swbm model the model performances were further investigated separately in drought years and non drought years the comparisons between observed rc and simulated rc showed that both models accurately simulated rc in non drought years but overestimated rc in drought years fig 4 for the abcd model the median kge values of runoff simulations in the calibration period and validation period were 0 91 and 0 92 in non drought years respectively while the values were 0 86 and 0 74 in drought years respectively the median values of runoff relative bias in the calibration period and validation period were 2 3 and 0 1 in non drought years respectively while the values were 11 7 and 17 3 in drought years respectively for the swbm model the median kge values of runoff simulations in both the calibration period and validation period were 0 90 in non drought years respectively while the values were 0 80 and 0 64 in drought years respectively the median values of runoff relative bias in the calibration period and validation period were 2 9 and 0 5 in non drought years respectively while the values were 15 0 and 19 0 in drought years respectively both models overestimated the runoff in drought years though they had high runoff simulation accuracy for the 54 years as a whole fig 5 4 3 model calibrations using different objective functions in drought years four objective functions namely nse logqnse rqnse and ria were used to calibrate the two hydrological models performances of the two models calibrated by different objective functions in drought years are summarized in fig 6 for the abcd model in the calibration period the median kge values between observed and simulated runoff with the objective functions nse logqnse rqnse and ria are 0 86 0 89 0 89 and 0 91 respectively the corresponding kge values in the validation period with the four objective functions are 0 74 0 81 0 87 and 0 81 respectively for the swbm model in the calibration period the median kge values with the four objective functions are 0 80 0 83 0 82 and 0 85 respectively the corresponding kge values in the validation period with the four objective functions are 0 64 0 77 0 77 and 0 83 respectively generally the median kge values of runoff simulation with the objective functions of logqnse rqnse and ria are greater than that with the objective function of nse in drought years for the abcd model in the calibration period the median values of relative bias between observed and simulated runoff with the objective functions nse logqnse rqnse and ria are 11 7 7 2 5 0 and 0 4 respectively the median values of relative bias in the validation period with the four objective functions are 17 3 10 6 4 2 and 4 1 respectively for the swbm model in the calibration period the median values of relative bias with the four objective functions are 15 0 7 6 11 9 and 1 5 respectively the median values of relative bias in the validation period with the four objective functions are 19 0 16 5 6 2 and 6 7 respectively generally the median values of relative bias with the objective function ria are significantly less than that with the other three objective functions in drought years runoff simulation accuracy in drought years was enhanced when the hydrological models were calibrated by the objective functions logqnse rqnse and ria compared with the objective function nse comparing the three objective functions logqnse rqnse and ria the kge values between the observed and simulated runoff did not have significant differences however the values of relative bias between the observed and simulated runoff had significant differences the objective function ria resulted in the lowest relative bias among the four objective functions therefore the objective function ria is a suitable approach for runoff simulations in drought years 5 discussion 5 1 changes of precipitation runoff relationship in drought years our results support the conclusion that drought can lead to significant changes in the precipitation runoff relationship a significant downward shift in the precipitation runoff relationship was found in this study which is consistent with the findings of previous studies allen et al 2011 potter and chiew 2011 saft et al 2015 previous studies mainly focused on a specific multiyear drought such as the 1946 1956 drought in texas and the millennium drought in southeastern australia this study investigated all drought years during the study period and found a similar conclusion the change magnitudes of runoff coefficient are different in previous studies allen et al 2011 found that the runoff coefficient decreased by 65 8 during the drought years of 1946 1956 in texas zhang et al 2018 showed that the average runoff coefficient decreased by 32 during the drought years of 1991 1999 in the loess plateau of china potter and chiew 2011 found that the runoff coefficient decreased by approximately 58 7 during the millennium drought of 1997 2008 in the campaspe river basin of australia in this study the annual runoff coefficient in drought years decreased by 24 1 compared with that in non drought years in poyang lake basin the decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient in drought years can be influenced by various factors such as drought characteristics and catchment characteristics saft et al 2015 for drought characteristics we found that the decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient rcchange had a significant positive relationship with the drought severity i e spi value for catchment characteristics table 5 negative correlations were found between rcchange and variables of climatic conditions such as pet p 0 01 and the aridity index p 0 05 this indicates that relatively arid catchments have larger decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient in drought years than relatively humid catchments in addition negative correlations were also found between rcchange and normalized difference vegetation index p 0 05 indicating that catchments with high vegetation coverage have relatively large decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient in drought years other variables of catchment characteristics such as catchment area elevation and slope had insignificant p greater than 0 05 correlations with rcchange 5 2 impacts of human activities on runoff coefficient changes in drought years human activities can significantly affect hydrological processes in the poyang lake basin human activities that have impacts on the precipitation runoff relationship are mainly irrigation and reservoirs the detailed information of irrigation and reservoirs in the poyang lake basin can be found in ye et al 2013 and zhang et al 2016 to investigate the impacts of irrigation and reservoirs on rcchange in drought years the 18 sub catchments were divided into two groups one group group i consists of 10 sub catchments with large reservoirs reservoir capacity larger than 1 0 108 m3 or farmland area accounting for more than 20 of the catchment area fig 7 a the other group group ii consisted of the rest of the 8 catchments with limited impacts of irrigation and reservoirs the mean median value of rcchange in drought years is 25 4 22 2 in group i sub catchments and 24 8 26 0 in group ii sub catchments fig 7b the differences in the distributions of rcchange for the two groups were tested using the kolmogorov smirnov test kolmogorov 1933 zhang et al 2006 the results showed that there were no significant p 0 19 differences of rcchange between group i and group ii this indicates that human activities have limited impacts on rcchange in drought years in the poyang lake basin the limited impacts of human activities on rcchange in the poyang lake basin could be explained in two aspects first the 18 sub catchments basically are located on the tributaries without large reservoirs thus impacts of reservoirs on rcchange in drought years could be limited second irrigation water consumption accounts for approximately 11 14 of total runoff in the poyang lake basin ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 therefore impacts of irrigation water consumption on rcchange in drought years could also be limited 5 3 improving low flow simulations the objective function nse has been widely used to calibrate hydrological models for runoff simulations in this study we found that hydrological models calibrated using the objective function nse did not have good performance in drought years this performance is mainly due to the objective function nse overemphasizing high flow simulations relative to low flow simulations thus high flows in a time series have a greater weight than low flows in the calculation of nse criss and winston 2008 legates and mccabe 1999 the key index to determine the weight of flows in nse is the squared error qsim t qobs t 2 table 1 fig 8 takes runoff simulation in catchment 2 as an example to show the impacts of low flows and high flows on the calculation of the cumulative sum of the squared error there was a significant increase in the value of the cumulative sum of the squared error when the flow was high fig 8b thus high flows had greater weights than low flows in the calculation of nse in contrast the squared relative error qsim t qobs t qobs t 2 is the key index to determine the weight of flows in ria table 1 there was no significant change in the value of the cumulative sum of the squared relative error when the flow was high fig 8c thus high flows had a similar weight as low flows in the calculation of ria therefore ria is a better objective function to calibrate the hydrological models in drought years than nse 5 4 uncertainty there are several uncertainties in the structures and parameters of the hydrological models used in this study first both hydrological models have simple structures thus they may not well represent the complex hydrological processes however some studies indicated that simple models can achieve comparable model performance as complex models refsgaard and knudsen 1996 coron et al 2012 nicolle et al 2014 bai et al 2015 2018 in addition the two hydrological models are lumped thus they cannot simulate the impacts of spatial variability in precipitation on hydrological processes second the accuracy of runoff coefficient simulations could be sensitive to some specific parameters of hydrological models thus an experiment was designed to find these specific parameters first the two hydrological models were calibrated every year during the study period to acquire the most suitable parameters for each year second the relationships between runoff coefficients and the most suitable parameters were investigated fig 9 in the abcd model parameter b and parameter c had significant p 0 05 correlation with runoff coefficients in the swbm model parameter kg and parameter smax had significant p 0 05 correlation with runoff coefficient parameter b and parameter smax are related to soil water storage while parameter c and kg are parameters related to surface runoff therefore the accuracy of runoff coefficient simulations is sensitive to parameters related to soil water storage and surface runoff suitable model parameters related to soil water storage and surface runoff can significantly improve runoff coefficient simulations 6 conclusions this study analyzed the impact of drought on the precipitation runoff relationship and investigated runoff simulations in drought years the results showed that a downward shift in the precipitation runoff relationship was found in the 18 catchments the runoff coefficients in drought years decreased by 17 6 34 5 compared with those in non drought years the decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient had a significant p 0 01 positive relationship with the drought severity i e spi values the hydrological models calibrated using the objective function nse overestimated the runoff in drought years other objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations such as logqnse rqnse and ria were used to improve the runoff simulations in drought years the results indicated that the objective function ria had the best performance for runoff simulations in drought years among the three objective functions accurate runoff simulation and prediction are important for water resources management especially in drought years this study indicated that runoff will be overestimated using the objective function nse in drought years this should be taken seriously because runoff overestimation in drought years will bring challenges to the allocation of water resources this study recommends that hydrological models calibrated with the appropriate objective functions can improve the prediction accuracy of runoff and benefit water resources management in drought years acknowledgements the observed monthly meteorological data were provided by the china meteorological administration http cdc cma gov ac

6991,the frequency and intensity of drought could be increasing with global warming when drought occurs the runoff generation process and the precipitation runoff relationship might change in this study the precipitation runoff relationship in drought years was systematically investigated in the largest freshwater lake basin of china namely the poyang lake basin the results showed that the precipitation runoff relationship changed significantly p 0 05 in drought years the annual runoff coefficient in drought years decreased by 24 1 compared with that in non drought years the decreased magnitude of runoff coefficient had a significant positive relationship p 0 01 with the drought severity i e the standardized precipitation index of the year two hydrological models calibrated by the objective function nash sutcliffe efficiency significantly overestimated runoff in drought years three additional objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations significantly improved the accuracy of runoff simulation in drought years therefore we recommend that the selected objective functions for runoff simulation in drought years should be sensitive to low flow simulations otherwise the water resources availability will be overestimated in drought years keywords drought precipitation runoff relationship hydrological model objective function 1 introduction drought is one of the most destructive and costly natural disasters and it has far reaching negative impacts on agriculture water resources environment and human life goddard et al 2005 ghulam et al 2007 under climate change drought events are expected to increase in frequency and severity easterling et al 2000 sheffield et al 2012 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 wu et al 2018 in the 21st century the cases have been abundant such as long term drought events in the western united states westerling and swetnam 2003 dennison et al 2014 southeast australia dijk et al 2013 kirono et al 2017 and northeast dong et al 2011 faiz et al 2018 when drought occurs the precipitation runoff relationship and the runoff coefficient could be changed kiem and verdon kidd 2010 dijk et al 2013 chiew et al 2014 miao et al 2015 2016 liu et al 2018 during the 10 year drought from 1946 to 1956 in the usda ars riesel watersheds allen et al 2011 found that the annual average precipitation decreased by 27 while runoff decreased by 75 during the 9 year drought from 1991 to 1999 in the loess plateau of china zhang et al 2018 indicated that the average runoff coefficient decreased from 0 1 to 0 068 during the millennium drought in southeastern australia saft et al 2015 showed that the precipitation runoff relationship had a significant shift potter and chiew 2011 demonstrated that the annual average precipitation decreased by 15 while runoff decreased by 59 in the campaspe river basin of southeastern australia changes in the precipitation runoff relationship can be affected by the duration and severity of a drought previous studies mainly focused on the impacts of drought duration on the precipitation runoff relationship while few studies investigated the impacts of drought severity on the precipitation runoff relationship the precipitation runoff relationship is typically simulated using hydrological models some studies found that the performances of hydrological models degraded when the climate condition of catchments significantly changed vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 troin et al 2012 found that the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of runoff simulations decreased by 0 27 when the precipitation decreased by 23 in laguna mar chiquita of argentina chiew et al 2009 indicated that the accuracy of runoff simulation significantly decreased in three catchments of southeastern australia when the climate became dry saft et al 2016 investigated the performances of 6 hydrological models in runoff simulations during drought years in 124 catchments of southeastern australia they showed that the average nse of runoff simulations was below 0 2 and the average relative bias of runoff simulations was over 80 for all of the 6 models in drought years these studies indicated that the accuracy of runoff simulation decreased when drought occurred accurate hydrological simulations are important for the prediction of available water resources especially when drought occurs two methods are typically used to improve the accuracy of hydrological simulations in drought years the first method is using different split sample test schemes to acquire suitable parameters for hydrological simulations klemeš 1986 vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 li et al 2012 the second method is using objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations to calibrate the hydrological models sorooshian et al 1983 yapo et al 1998 krause et al 2005 fowler et al 2018 the objectives of this study include 1 to systematically analyze the impacts of drought on the precipitation runoff relationship in the largest freshwater lake basin of china namely the poyang lake basin and 2 to investigate how to improve runoff simulations in drought years in the poyang lake basin first we investigated the impacts of drought on the precipitation runoff relationship based on hydrological observations next we simulated runoff using two hydrological models and focused on the performances of hydrological models in drought years finally we explored how to improve the accuracy of runoff simulations in drought years 2 study area and data sources poyang lake basin 113 5 118 5 e 24 5 30 1 n is located in the middle yangtze river of china fig 1 the basin area is approximately 162 000 km2 accounting for approximately 9 of the area of the yangtze river basin the annual average flows of the basin into the yangtze river account for 15 6 of the total flows of the yangtze river the basin belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate annual precipitation ranges from 1200 to 2400 mm and 80 of precipitation occurs from march to september the basin has china s largest freshwater lake namely the poyang lake which plays an important ecological and hydrological role in the middle and lower yangtze river hu et al 2007 poyang lake receives the inflows of five main tributaries ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui in this study the poyang lake basin is divided into 18 sub catchments based on the runoff control stations and the catchment areas range from 435 to 80 948 km2 fig 1 the monthly runoff observations in 18 hydrological stations from 1960 to 2013 were provided by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resource of china monthly climate observations in 83 metrological stations from 1960 to 2013 were obtained from the national climate center of china meteorological administration including precipitation temperatures relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours http data cma cn all the climate data were spatially averaged across each of the 18 catchments by the cokriging interpolation algorithm using arcgis software which takes a digital elevation model as an additional input isaaks and srivastava 1988 3 methods 3 1 drought definition the standardized precipitation index spi was used to identify drought in this study the spi was developed by mckee et al 1993 to quantify precipitation anomaly with respect to long term normal condition from multiple time scales the spi can be computed for any time scale from 1 2 3 48 to 72 months edwards 1997 and the typically used time scales are 3 6 12 and 24 months the time scales of 3 or 6 months are typically used in agricultural management because soil moisture depletion and crop growth are sensitive to short time droughts sims and raman 2002 the time scales of 12 or 24 months are typically used in hydrological research because runoff and groundwater could be significantly influenced when long time droughts occur szalai and szinell 2000 wu et al 2001 łabędzki 2007 the spi of 12 months spi 12 was used for identifying the drought year since this study focused on hydrological responses to drought mckee et al 1993 initially divided drought severity into four categories namely mild moderate severe and extreme drought they defined that mild drought starts from the moment when the spi value is less than 0 however agnew 2000 found that it is too fast for the conversion from wet to dry if all negative values of spi are distinguished as the occurrence of drought thus some modified classifications were used for example łabędzki 2007 xu et al 2011 and thomas et al 2015 proposed that mild drought starts from the moment when spi value is less 0 5 and this classification is adopted as the national standard of china gb t 20481 2006 in this study the year was determined as a drought year when the spi 12 value of the year is less than 0 5 3 2 method for determining the significance of change in annual precipitation runoff relationship between drought years and non drought years in this study a multiple regression method was used to analyze the significance of change in annual precipitation runoff relationship between drought years and non drought years saft et al 2015 1 q a 0 a 1 i a 2 p ε where q is annual runoff p is annual precipitation i is a drought indictor set to 1 for drought years and 0 for non drought years a0 is the intercept of the multiple regression line a1 and a2 are regression coefficients and ε is the residual of the regression the method hypothesizes that the precipitation runoff relationship in drought years is different from that in non drought years then a t test was applied to test this hypothesis if a1 is equal to 0 the precipitation runoff relationship has no significant differences between drought years and non drought years if a1 is not equal to 0 the precipitation runoff relationship is significantly different between drought years and non drought years 3 3 monthly hydrological models to reduce the dependence of runoff simulation results on a single model two monthly conceptual hydrological models namely the snowmelt based water balance model swbm model wang et al 2005 and the abcd model thomas 1981 were used in this study both models have simple structures and only require precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet as inputs the swbm model has been successfully applied in various catchments of china wang et al 2005 li et al 2013 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 bai et al 2016 the abcd model has been tested in many catchments worldwide with various climatic conditions alley 1984 gupta et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 detailed information about the structures and equations of the two models are listed in fig 2 the swbm model has three parameters smax ks kg aet is calculated using a soil evapotranspiration linear formula e1 in fig 2 surface runoff rs is calculated using a linear formula related to soil moisture and precipitation based on the linear reservoir theory e2 in fig 2 base flow rg is calculated using a linear formula related to soil moisture e3 in fig 2 wang et al 2005 wang et al 2013 the abcd model has four parameters a b c d and divides the storage layer into soil moisture storage and groundwater storage the model defines two key state variables wt as available water and yt as evapotranspiration opportunity thomas 1981 available water is the sum of precipitation during month t and soil water storage at the beginning of month t and evapotranspiration opportunity is the sum of aet during month t and soil water storage at the end of month t yt is postulated as a nonlinear function of wt e5 in fig 2 aet is calculated using a nonlinear formula related to yt e8 in fig 2 rs and rg are calculated using linear formulas related to water available for runoff and groundwater storage respectively e9 and e11 in fig 2 respectively detailed descriptions of the abcd model can be found in fernandez et al 2000 and martinez and gupta 2010 3 4 model calibration validation and performance assessment the classic split sample test scheme klemeš 1986 was used for calibration and validation of the two hydrological models in this study the available data in each catchment were spilt into two sub periods with equal time series lengths namely sub period i 1960 1986 and sub period ii 1987 2013 the hydrological models were calibrated in sub period i and validated in sub period ii the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is probably the most widely used objective function worldwide was used to calibrate the two hydrological models in this study a global optimization algorithm namely the genetic algorithm wang 1991 was used to find the parameter sets of the swbm model and abcd model this algorithm is a robust and efficient search algorithm which has been widely applied to calibrate hydrological models boyle et al 2000 duan et al 1992 tolson and shoemaker 2007 to test the performances of the two hydrological models the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and relative bias rb were used as the criteria 2 kge 1 1 γ 2 1 α 2 1 β 2 with α σ s σ o β μ s μ o where μs and σs are the mean and standard deviation of the simulations respectively μo and σo are the mean and standard deviation of the observations respectively and r is the correlation coefficient between observations and simulations the value of kge ranges from negative infinity to 1 when kge is equal to 1 it indicates perfect runoff simulations 3 rb i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i i 1 n q obs i 100 where qobs i and qsim i are the observed and simulated monthly runoff respectively and n is total number of time steps the value of rb ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity when rb is equal to 0 it indicates perfect runoff simulations 3 5 different objective functions for model calibration different objective functions were used to improve the accuracy of runoff simulations in drought years krause et al 2005 recommended the nse calculated on relative flows rqnse and relative index of agreement ria for low flow simulations oudin et al 2006 found that nse calculated on log transformed flows lognse had good performance for low flow simulations in this study three additional objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations namely lognse rqnse and ria were used to calibrate the hydrological models the performances of the hydrological models calibrated by the four objective functions were compared in drought years the details of the objective functions are listed in table 1 4 results 4 1 comparisons of annual precipitation runoff relationships between drought years and non drought years for the 18 sub catchments catchment 12 had the maximum number of drought years and 18 years among the 54 years were identified as drought years catchment 13 had the minimum number of drought years with 13 years the t test showed that annual precipitation runoff relationship had a significant p 0 00 difference between drought years and non drought years for the average of the 18 catchments table 2 for the 18 individual sub catchments the annual precipitation runoff relationship between drought years and non drought years changed significantly p 0 05 in 17 catchments except for catchment 9 p 0 37 changes in the annual precipitation runoff relationship between drought years and non drought years are shown in fig 3 the red line representing annual precipitation runoff relationship in drought years shifted downward compared with the black line representing annual precipitation runoff relationship in non drought years this indicates that runoff generated by per unit of precipitation decreased in drought years runoff coefficient rc describing the runoff generated by per unit of precipitation is used to quantitatively estimate the change magnitude of the annual precipitation runoff relationship for the average of the 18 sub catchments rc decreased by 24 1 in drought years compared with non drought years for the 18 individual sub catchments the decrease magnitudes of rc range from 17 6 to 34 5 the impact of drought severity i e spi value on the change magnitude of runoff coefficient rcchange is shown in table 3 the rcchange had a significant positive relationship with the spi value for the average of the 18 sub catchments the correlation coefficient r between the rcchange and spi value is 0 65 p 0 01 for the individual 18 sub catchments r values range from 0 36 to 0 84 and the median value of r is 0 60 table 3 this indicated that the decreased magnitudes of rc significantly increased with the increase in drought severity 4 2 the runoff simulations using hydrological models in drought years generally both the abcd model and swbm model performed well in the calibration and validation periods for the 18 sub catchments table 4 in the calibration period the median kge values between the observed and simulated runoff using the abcd model and swbm model are 0 93 and 0 90 respectively the median runoff relative bias rb between observed and simulated runoff using the two models are 0 8 and 0 5 respectively in the validation period the median kge values for the two models are 0 92 and 0 89 respectively and the median runoff relative bias are 1 7 and 2 9 respectively both models have high kge value and low relative bias value the abcd model performs slightly better than the swbm model the model performances were further investigated separately in drought years and non drought years the comparisons between observed rc and simulated rc showed that both models accurately simulated rc in non drought years but overestimated rc in drought years fig 4 for the abcd model the median kge values of runoff simulations in the calibration period and validation period were 0 91 and 0 92 in non drought years respectively while the values were 0 86 and 0 74 in drought years respectively the median values of runoff relative bias in the calibration period and validation period were 2 3 and 0 1 in non drought years respectively while the values were 11 7 and 17 3 in drought years respectively for the swbm model the median kge values of runoff simulations in both the calibration period and validation period were 0 90 in non drought years respectively while the values were 0 80 and 0 64 in drought years respectively the median values of runoff relative bias in the calibration period and validation period were 2 9 and 0 5 in non drought years respectively while the values were 15 0 and 19 0 in drought years respectively both models overestimated the runoff in drought years though they had high runoff simulation accuracy for the 54 years as a whole fig 5 4 3 model calibrations using different objective functions in drought years four objective functions namely nse logqnse rqnse and ria were used to calibrate the two hydrological models performances of the two models calibrated by different objective functions in drought years are summarized in fig 6 for the abcd model in the calibration period the median kge values between observed and simulated runoff with the objective functions nse logqnse rqnse and ria are 0 86 0 89 0 89 and 0 91 respectively the corresponding kge values in the validation period with the four objective functions are 0 74 0 81 0 87 and 0 81 respectively for the swbm model in the calibration period the median kge values with the four objective functions are 0 80 0 83 0 82 and 0 85 respectively the corresponding kge values in the validation period with the four objective functions are 0 64 0 77 0 77 and 0 83 respectively generally the median kge values of runoff simulation with the objective functions of logqnse rqnse and ria are greater than that with the objective function of nse in drought years for the abcd model in the calibration period the median values of relative bias between observed and simulated runoff with the objective functions nse logqnse rqnse and ria are 11 7 7 2 5 0 and 0 4 respectively the median values of relative bias in the validation period with the four objective functions are 17 3 10 6 4 2 and 4 1 respectively for the swbm model in the calibration period the median values of relative bias with the four objective functions are 15 0 7 6 11 9 and 1 5 respectively the median values of relative bias in the validation period with the four objective functions are 19 0 16 5 6 2 and 6 7 respectively generally the median values of relative bias with the objective function ria are significantly less than that with the other three objective functions in drought years runoff simulation accuracy in drought years was enhanced when the hydrological models were calibrated by the objective functions logqnse rqnse and ria compared with the objective function nse comparing the three objective functions logqnse rqnse and ria the kge values between the observed and simulated runoff did not have significant differences however the values of relative bias between the observed and simulated runoff had significant differences the objective function ria resulted in the lowest relative bias among the four objective functions therefore the objective function ria is a suitable approach for runoff simulations in drought years 5 discussion 5 1 changes of precipitation runoff relationship in drought years our results support the conclusion that drought can lead to significant changes in the precipitation runoff relationship a significant downward shift in the precipitation runoff relationship was found in this study which is consistent with the findings of previous studies allen et al 2011 potter and chiew 2011 saft et al 2015 previous studies mainly focused on a specific multiyear drought such as the 1946 1956 drought in texas and the millennium drought in southeastern australia this study investigated all drought years during the study period and found a similar conclusion the change magnitudes of runoff coefficient are different in previous studies allen et al 2011 found that the runoff coefficient decreased by 65 8 during the drought years of 1946 1956 in texas zhang et al 2018 showed that the average runoff coefficient decreased by 32 during the drought years of 1991 1999 in the loess plateau of china potter and chiew 2011 found that the runoff coefficient decreased by approximately 58 7 during the millennium drought of 1997 2008 in the campaspe river basin of australia in this study the annual runoff coefficient in drought years decreased by 24 1 compared with that in non drought years in poyang lake basin the decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient in drought years can be influenced by various factors such as drought characteristics and catchment characteristics saft et al 2015 for drought characteristics we found that the decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient rcchange had a significant positive relationship with the drought severity i e spi value for catchment characteristics table 5 negative correlations were found between rcchange and variables of climatic conditions such as pet p 0 01 and the aridity index p 0 05 this indicates that relatively arid catchments have larger decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient in drought years than relatively humid catchments in addition negative correlations were also found between rcchange and normalized difference vegetation index p 0 05 indicating that catchments with high vegetation coverage have relatively large decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient in drought years other variables of catchment characteristics such as catchment area elevation and slope had insignificant p greater than 0 05 correlations with rcchange 5 2 impacts of human activities on runoff coefficient changes in drought years human activities can significantly affect hydrological processes in the poyang lake basin human activities that have impacts on the precipitation runoff relationship are mainly irrigation and reservoirs the detailed information of irrigation and reservoirs in the poyang lake basin can be found in ye et al 2013 and zhang et al 2016 to investigate the impacts of irrigation and reservoirs on rcchange in drought years the 18 sub catchments were divided into two groups one group group i consists of 10 sub catchments with large reservoirs reservoir capacity larger than 1 0 108 m3 or farmland area accounting for more than 20 of the catchment area fig 7 a the other group group ii consisted of the rest of the 8 catchments with limited impacts of irrigation and reservoirs the mean median value of rcchange in drought years is 25 4 22 2 in group i sub catchments and 24 8 26 0 in group ii sub catchments fig 7b the differences in the distributions of rcchange for the two groups were tested using the kolmogorov smirnov test kolmogorov 1933 zhang et al 2006 the results showed that there were no significant p 0 19 differences of rcchange between group i and group ii this indicates that human activities have limited impacts on rcchange in drought years in the poyang lake basin the limited impacts of human activities on rcchange in the poyang lake basin could be explained in two aspects first the 18 sub catchments basically are located on the tributaries without large reservoirs thus impacts of reservoirs on rcchange in drought years could be limited second irrigation water consumption accounts for approximately 11 14 of total runoff in the poyang lake basin ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 therefore impacts of irrigation water consumption on rcchange in drought years could also be limited 5 3 improving low flow simulations the objective function nse has been widely used to calibrate hydrological models for runoff simulations in this study we found that hydrological models calibrated using the objective function nse did not have good performance in drought years this performance is mainly due to the objective function nse overemphasizing high flow simulations relative to low flow simulations thus high flows in a time series have a greater weight than low flows in the calculation of nse criss and winston 2008 legates and mccabe 1999 the key index to determine the weight of flows in nse is the squared error qsim t qobs t 2 table 1 fig 8 takes runoff simulation in catchment 2 as an example to show the impacts of low flows and high flows on the calculation of the cumulative sum of the squared error there was a significant increase in the value of the cumulative sum of the squared error when the flow was high fig 8b thus high flows had greater weights than low flows in the calculation of nse in contrast the squared relative error qsim t qobs t qobs t 2 is the key index to determine the weight of flows in ria table 1 there was no significant change in the value of the cumulative sum of the squared relative error when the flow was high fig 8c thus high flows had a similar weight as low flows in the calculation of ria therefore ria is a better objective function to calibrate the hydrological models in drought years than nse 5 4 uncertainty there are several uncertainties in the structures and parameters of the hydrological models used in this study first both hydrological models have simple structures thus they may not well represent the complex hydrological processes however some studies indicated that simple models can achieve comparable model performance as complex models refsgaard and knudsen 1996 coron et al 2012 nicolle et al 2014 bai et al 2015 2018 in addition the two hydrological models are lumped thus they cannot simulate the impacts of spatial variability in precipitation on hydrological processes second the accuracy of runoff coefficient simulations could be sensitive to some specific parameters of hydrological models thus an experiment was designed to find these specific parameters first the two hydrological models were calibrated every year during the study period to acquire the most suitable parameters for each year second the relationships between runoff coefficients and the most suitable parameters were investigated fig 9 in the abcd model parameter b and parameter c had significant p 0 05 correlation with runoff coefficients in the swbm model parameter kg and parameter smax had significant p 0 05 correlation with runoff coefficient parameter b and parameter smax are related to soil water storage while parameter c and kg are parameters related to surface runoff therefore the accuracy of runoff coefficient simulations is sensitive to parameters related to soil water storage and surface runoff suitable model parameters related to soil water storage and surface runoff can significantly improve runoff coefficient simulations 6 conclusions this study analyzed the impact of drought on the precipitation runoff relationship and investigated runoff simulations in drought years the results showed that a downward shift in the precipitation runoff relationship was found in the 18 catchments the runoff coefficients in drought years decreased by 17 6 34 5 compared with those in non drought years the decreased magnitudes of runoff coefficient had a significant p 0 01 positive relationship with the drought severity i e spi values the hydrological models calibrated using the objective function nse overestimated the runoff in drought years other objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations such as logqnse rqnse and ria were used to improve the runoff simulations in drought years the results indicated that the objective function ria had the best performance for runoff simulations in drought years among the three objective functions accurate runoff simulation and prediction are important for water resources management especially in drought years this study indicated that runoff will be overestimated using the objective function nse in drought years this should be taken seriously because runoff overestimation in drought years will bring challenges to the allocation of water resources this study recommends that hydrological models calibrated with the appropriate objective functions can improve the prediction accuracy of runoff and benefit water resources management in drought years acknowledgements the observed monthly meteorological data were provided by the china meteorological administration http cdc cma gov ac

6992,while remotely sensed data reveal enhanced vegetation growth under a warming climate how such vegetation dynamics could alter regional hydrology is not fully understood in this study we investigated how changes in leaf area index lai and climatic variability alter long term trends and seasonal variability of evapotranspiration et runoff r and soil moisture sm over the conterminous united states conus during the period 1983 2009 by using the variable infiltration capacity vic model with transient remotely sensed lai inputs factor controlled simulation experiments reveal that while precipitation is the dominant factor controlling long term trends and inter annual fluctuations of water fluxes other factors temperature lai and atmospheric co2 make significant contributions to long term trends particularly over specific regions changes in lai result in minor overall contributions to the inter annual variability of et r and sm over the conus as a whole however they do make a more significant contribution over certain regions such as the midwest furthermore changing lai is the second most important factor in controlling variability in et and sm particularly over the cool season anomalies of lai during el nino southern oscillation enso phases result in no significant correlations with anomalies in r and sm but result in positive correlations with et indicating that vegetation dynamics can have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle over continental scales keywords evapotranspiration runoff conterminous us vegetation dynamics 1 introduction the global terrestrial water cycle has been altered by environmental change and human activities especially during the last century hutjes et al 1998 jackson et al 2005 gedney et al 2006 concurrent to hydrologic changes remotely sensed data indicate an earlier greenness of vegetation and a longer growing season in the northern hemisphere during the last several decades due to warming with implications for enhanced ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration buermann et al 2003 myneni et al 1997 nemani et al 2003 zhou et al 2001 vegetation response to climate change e g long term warming and extreme climate events such as heat waves and droughts feeds back to the regional water cycle through changes in evapotranspiration et runoff r and soil moisture sm the nature of this feedback is unclear but is expected to vary by location and vegetation type feedback is known to be related to meteorology and other atmospheric variables such as the effects of increasing atmospheric co2 concentration on stomatal conductance and water use efficiency dai et al 2009 field et al 1995 gedney et al 2006a jung et al 2010 liu et al 2013b wang and dickinson 2012 previous studies have highlighted the strong correlation between terrestrial et and vegetation dynamics revealed by normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and therefore there is a clear need to explicitly include leaf area index lai or ndvi in et estimations e g mu et al 2007 suzuki et al 2007 wang et al 2010a 2010b yan et al 2012 2013 alkama et al 2010 used a modeling approach to attribute the effects of climate change co2 and lai on long term trends of global r in the 20th and 21st century they found that stomatal conductance and vegetation growth played a minor role in the 20th century while the role of stomatal conductance significantly increased during the 21th century however their study did not investigate how these factors affect the seasonality and inter annual variability of hydrologic processes shi et al 2013 2011 and lei et al 2014 investigated how these factors affect et globally and over a mountainous catchment of china respectively by using the community land model to simulate both lai and hydrologic response similar to alkama et al 2010 they conclude that elevated co2 produced negligible effects on the trend of r biases in simulated lai in these studies likely result in larger uncertainties than if observed lai had been used lei et al 2014 despite this work there are still knowledge gaps related to how climatic factors including temperature t and precipitation p interact with lai in the context of co2 fertilization effects on c3 vegetation i e increasing stomatal resistance therefore decreasing transpiration and how these factors affect spatial patterns of et r and sm at regional to continental scales in addition the seasonality and inter annual variability of these processes have yet to be addressed the variable infiltration capacity vic model is a macro scale hydrologic model that has been used widely in regional and global studies of hydrology and climate change either as an offline hydrologic model or as the land surface module within regional and global climate models adam et al 2009 hamlet et al 2007 hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 liang et al 1996 1994 liu et al 2013b vic is traditionally run with constant lai as a vegetation parameter i e no year to year variability such that the effects of changing phenology and inter annual lai variability on simulated hydrologic processes are not captured the uncertainties from neglecting these dynamics are not well known the purpose of this study is to investigate how remotely sensed vegetation changes in combination with climate change and the co2 fertilization effect affect long term and seasonal variability of terrestrial water fluxes and sm over the conterminous united states conus during the period 1983 2009 we evaluated model simulations using observed streamflow and et as is commonly done e g mote et al

the effects of vegetation phenology on canopy conductance here we enabled vic to read in transient monthly lai for each grid cell during simulation to estimate the effects of phenology on hydrologic

lai during the period 1982 2011 respectively lai affects vic simulated et through changing the amount of intercepted water in the canopy and the canopy resistance liang et al 1996 1994 the vegetation dynamics also change the seasonal patterns of et through the distribution of roots and canopy characteristics such as height and architectural resistance by altering the composition of plant species within each simulation unit i e each vic grid cell in this study however we just focused on the net effects of transient lai without considering the changes in plant species and its consequent various

design to separate out the contributions of climate change factors t and p atmospheric co2 concentration and vegetation changes lai a series of factor controlled simulation experiments are conducted table 1 they include a transient run where all factors are transient and single factor simulations where each factor t p lai or atmospheric co2 concentration is individually fixed while all other factors are transient table 1 the differences in simulation results between the transient run and single factor control experiments represent the net effects over seasonal or annual period of that single factor on hydrologic processes in the context of interactions with other factors table 2 eqs 12 15 the climate experiment represents the traditional model simulation which is driven by transient meteorological data but without changing lai and the co2 concentration the mean climate data used for fixed single factor simulation experiments are post processed from the transient climate data by removing the long term trends and monthly anomalies hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 hamlet et al 2007 liu et al 2013a all simulations start from the year of 1979 which gives us 4 years spin up runs and all current analysis are conducted for the period of 1983 2009 the combining effect of co2 and lai is estimated as the difference between transient run and climate runs eq 16 we estimated the

and snowpack content and water and energy budgets over the nldas domain liu et al 2013a lohmann et al 2004 mitchell et al 2004 nijssen et al 2003 robock et al 2003 xia et al 2012 here we reported evaluation results on river discharge both over the two largest river systems in the nldas domain and over small watersheds from the gages ii database comparisons between modeled results and remote sensing products of total water content twc and et are also used for model evaluation due to short overlapping periods between the remote sensing data and modeled results our comparisons are focused only on monthly and inter annual variability and not on the trends combinations of remotely sensed products and field observations have been collected for grid by grid or watersheds by watersheds model evaluations for this study terrestrial water storage over the land is estimated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 tapley et al 2004 and in this study we used the gridded grace tws anomaly i e relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline products at the spatial resolution of 1 1 from the spherical harmonic sh coefficients provided by the center for space research csr university of texas at austin the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and german research center for geoscience gfz centers and scaling factors derived from ncar s clm4 0 landerer and swenson 2012 this product is compared to the total changes in modeled total sm and estimated snowpack which we termed total water content twc anomaly vic does not simulate ground water dynamics and is therefore not included in the modeled twc anomaly for et evaluation we used up scaled et from eddy flux measurements via the model tree ensemble mte method jung et al 2010 for streamflow evaluation we selected 482 usgs gages reference watersheds with least disturbances from human activities e g 5 imperviousness according to the gages ii geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow classification falcone et al 2010 fig 1 each of these selected watersheds covers at least 144 km2 and their monthly r data during the period 1990 2009 come from the usgs hydro climate data network 2009 hcdn 2009 dataset lins 2012 comparisons between simulated results against remotely sensed up scaled products and or field observations are described in section 3 2 two observational datasets were selected to evaluate simulations of the inter annual variability of river discharge at the dalles station oregon usgs 14105700 outlet for the columbia river basin crb one was reconstructed by the climate impacts group at the university of washington uw that uses the bonneville power administration bpa methods crook 1993 and the other dataset was reconstructed by dai et al 2009 with a land surface model for the mississippi atchafalaya river basin marb we selected the mississippi atchafalaya river and gauge observations from usgs http toxics usgs gov hypoxia mississippi flux ests delivery index html data availability period 1968 2008 and dai et al 2009 we divided the conus domain into the following six regions according to the u s environment protection agency http www epa gov climatechange impacts adaptation to report regional differences which were also used for the third u s national climate assessment northeast ne midwest mw great plains gp northwest nw southwest sw and southeast se fig 1 melillo et al 2014 we selected the two major river systems over the conus for evaluating simulated large scale river discharge i e the crb and marb fig 1 the simulated river discharge over these two basins are accumulations of total annual water year r from contributing grid cells vic simulations were conducted for the nldas data domain from 25 n to 53 n and from 67 w to 125 w 3 results 3 1 evaluations on simulated river discharge comparisons between modeled results with observational and reconstructed historical data indicate that vic driven by the nldas 2 meteorological forcings and dynamic lai successfully captures the magnitude and inter annual variability in annual river discharge especially in the crb the nash sutcliffe ns coefficients in the crb are greater than 0 88 in comparing with both uw and dai reconstructed data fig 2 for the marb vic simulated results match well with usgs observation data ns 0 7 but they do not match well with the reconstructed historical data from dai et al 2009 fig 2 ns 0 14 we did not see significant differences between the simulations with and without dynamic lai over these two basins over the selected reference watersheds vic simulated results has strong correlations with observations with pearson s r 0 91 and p value 0 05 and the index of agreement a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error that varies between 0 and 1 1 means perfect match willmott 1981 and mean absolute error are 0 95 and 139 1 mm yr respectively according to the hydrogof analysis fig 3 zambrano bigiarini 2017 while we need to point out that the simulated results still show slight bias from the 1 1 line rsim 77 3 0 82 robs fig 3 fig 3 also reveals that by using transient lai vic provides slightly higher accuracy than traditional vic runs i e fixed lai which indicates that the widely usage of average lai in regional hydrological simulations may generate some uncertainties due to kinds of non linear responses of lai to water fluxes for inter annual variability vic achieves reasonable results in terms of correlation coefficients between simulated and observed annual r 74 of watersheds have positive pearson s r and 11 2 of total watersheds have higher r than 0 5 vic is normally calibrated at large basin scales to study macro scale hydrological processes at coarse spatial resolution as in 1 8th degree or 12 km grid cell for this study therefore we expected the model to perform less well over small watershed scales i e 400 km2 and 50 000 km2 3 2 evaluations on simulated et and total water content model data comparisons reveal that vic performs well in reconstructing the spatial patterns of multi year average annual et over the entire conus domain pearson s r 0 98 between vic simulated and mte derived et and vic also does reasonably well in reproducing inter annual variability of et r 0 67 between vic simulated anomalies in annual et and the mte derived value fig 4 a however vic substantially underestimated et for some dry years e g 1988 and 2000 fig 4a as mentioned in our previous study i e liu et al 2013a the missing mechanism of deep root and groundwater interaction and the irrigation effects over croplands in vic may be the major reasons for this underestimation although the effects of irrigation on increasing lai are partially considered in this simulation by using observed lai values but are not on the increased et that would result from additional water availability due to irrigation vic does reasonably well in reproducing monthly twc anomalies which is accounted as the difference between transient monthly twc and the multi year average of twc during the period 2004 2009 and these values represent the seasonal variability of twc in comparing with grace tws anomaly r 0 94 as to the long term changes in the variability twc i e the difference between the transient monthly twc anomalies as described above and their multi year average monthly values during the period 2004 2009 vic simulated results have strong consistencies with estimates from grace tws anomalies with the same calculation method r 0 6 fig 4b however because the vic model does not explicitly model deep groundwater dynamics nor its interactions with surface water evaluation of vic using grace tws anomalies should be treated with caution 3 3 long term trends and inter annual variability in driving forces and water fluxes the conus experienced significant increases in annual mean lai of 0 026 0 02 decade 5 6 4 3 and annual mean t of 0 26 0 23 c decade during the period 1983 2009 fig 5 a and 5 b the range indicates the 95 confidence interval the total annual p over the water year i e oct sep had no significant trend during the study period while it experienced a significant decrease p value 0 07 in the cool season i e oct mar spatial trends in climate variables and lai demonstrate substantial regional differences all regions experienced large and significant increases in lai except the western regions i e nw and sw fig 5a the ne had the largest increase in annual p and the western regions and the se experienced large decreases fig 5c however not all trends in annual p over each region are statistically significant most regions show similar warming trends during the cool and warm seasons except the mw and the gp which experienced more warming in the cool season than in the warm season apr sep fig 5b according to simulated results the transient run the environmental change including climate lai and atmospheric co2 its concentration increased by 44 8 ppm from 342 6 to 387 4 ppm or by 13 1 during the simulation period cause significant spatial variability in long term trends inter annual fluctuations and seasonal patterns of the water cycle although the conus domain as a whole shows no significant long term trend in et r and sm during this study period some sub regions exhibit statistically significant trends fig 5 and 66 for example the sw experienced a significant decrease in et fig 5d and the nw experienced a significant decrease in sm fig 5f and 6d leading to much drier soil conditions 1 9 mm year or 11 in total fig 5f and 6f the ne experienced the largest increase in r while most other regions in particular the se and the nw exhibit declining trends fig 5e and 6e the spatial patterns of sm and r trends display decreasing trends in most regions but increases in the ne over the entire conus domain decreases in annual r and sm occurred mainly during the cool season fig 5e and f there is substantial inter annual variability in climate lai and simulated water variables over the entire conus domain annual mean t p and lai fluctuated within the ranges of 12 88 0 97 c mean 95 confidence intervals 773 6 106 6 mm year or 13 8 and 1 21 0 08 m2 m2 or 6 7 respectively fig 7 a c in response the simulated water fluxes and sm also exhibited substantial inter annual variability over the conus domain which resulted in et r and sm varying within the ranges 507 6 49 8 mm year or 9 8 266 1 67 2 mm year or 25 3 and 286 8 23 4 mm or 8 2 respectively fig 7d f 3 4 contributing factors to inter annual variability and long term trends 3 4 1 ranking of their relative contributions over the entire conus domain factor controlled experiments indicate that p was the dominant factor controlling the inter annual fluctuations of r et and sm table 2 the pearson correlation coefficients r between p caused and all factor caused variability are 0 96 0 98 and 0 99 on et r and sm respectively over the conus domain fig 8 table 2 to the long term trends of these hydrological variables however other factors including lai t and co2 made virtually identical contributions as p does table 2 over the conus domain changes in annual mean lai and t increased et while changes in p and co2 reduced it the net effects of all driving forces on et resulted in a negative trend table 2 all factors except co2 had negative effects on r which decreased by 0 61 0 44 and 0 11 mm year year due to changes in p t and lai respectively table 2 p was the major factor controlling sm which decreased sm by 0 26 mm year year table 2 overall t and p together i e climate experiment can explain almost all inter annual variability and the trends of the hydrologic variables during the study period over the conus domain as a whole table 2 according to the simulation results the use of transient lai instead of the monthly static lai that does not vary from year to year as with traditional vic applications has minor overall contributions over the conus as a whole to the inter annual variability of water cycles figs 2 4 and 7 table 2 however transient lai does result in more significant effects on long term trends over the study domain and on inter annual variabilities of hydrologic variables over certain regions e g the midwest fig 8 table 2 increasing co2 had minor effects on the inter annual fluctuations and long term trends in the hydrologic variables but it almost compensated for the effects of lai on long term trends of et and r over the conus domain table 2 for example lai caused an increase in annual et by 0 11 mm per year while an increase in co2 resulted in a decrease in annual et by 0 10 mm per year table 2 3 4 2 spatial variability of the effects of contributing factors each factor s contribution to long term trends and inter annual variability was substantially different across the study domain and in different seasons figs 6 and 9 over the majority of the conus domain p was the dominant factor controlling both trends and inter annual variability in hydrologic processes figs 6 and 9 however other factors including t and lai also dominated long term trends over a large number of grid cells long term trends in annual et were dominantly driven by p 78 of grid cells while 19 and 3 of the cells were driven by t and lai respectively fig 8 in particular t had larger influences on long term trends in et over energy limited zones such as the mountainous areas of the nw se and mw and the combined effects of lai and t dominated over 57 of the se region fig 6g and 9 with regards to long term trends in r and sm p s effects were dominant for most grid cells while around 13 of the grid cells were controlled by t and lai fig 8 with respect to inter annual variability lai was the second most important controlling factor to et 9 2 of all grid cells and sm 3 3 of all grid cells fig 8 in the mw its contribution to the inter annual variability of et was 30 of the total area fig 6j and 8 3 4 3 seasonal variability of the effects of contributing factors each factor s relative contributions to hydrologic cycles varied by season t and lai s influences on the long term trend of et mainly occurred over the cool season for all regions fig 8 specifically t and lai together controlled et trends over 51 and 20 of the land surface during the cool and warm seasons respectively fig 8 relative t and lai increase more during the cool season than during warm season fig 5 which could be contributing to these results lai also played the second most dominant role in the inter annual variability of et during the cool season 32 of the total land area was controlled by lai fig 8 however contributions of t and lai to inter annual variability in sm occurred primarily during the warm season and over the western regions figs 6 and 8 in comparison to et and r the relative variability of total sm is lower because of its larger buffer or storage zone the larger contribution of t and lai on sm during the warm season compared to the cool season might be due to the higher rates of et in the warm season which lowers sm and thus the greater warm season influence is driven by et and manifested via t and lai fig 8 indicates that the major contributing region to this pattern is in the western u s which has a drier warm season soil as compared to the cool season 4 discussions 4 1 responses of vegetation to natural climate variability as expected our simulations demonstrate that lai and its dynamics in addition to climate change have important effects on hydrologic processes over certain regions while it may not be significant at continental scales we need point out that lai itself is also directly controlled by climate and it can feed back to regional climate systems and the entire hydrologic cycle zeng and neelin 2000 zhou et al 2003 2001 this is supported by figs 9 11 showing that anomalies in lai exhibit different spatial patterns during the two non neutral phases of the el niño southern oscillation enso which can be partially explained by anomalies in p and t fig 10 reveals the spatial distribution of net contribution of lai and co2 during the el nino i e 1987 1992 1994 and 2002 and la nina i e 1999 and 2000 years respectively and their correlations with the contributions of climate factors i e t and p the bubble scatter diagrams in fig 10 demonstrate the correlation or cooccurrence between the contributions of lai and co2 and of climate i e t and p to the anomalies through counting the number of grid cells per bin the rounded integer in the 2 dimension space i e 2d histogram x axis represents the anomalies due to climate factors and y axis is the contribution from lai and co2 to investigate the impact of each forcing factors on the anomalies of hydrological processes during these enso cycles 2d histogram plots are drawn over the conterminous us as fig 11 shows the proportion in percentage of each square in fig 11 represents that of all grid cells over the simulation domain how much falls in each level of the magnitude of anomalies in the driving factors i e lai t and p and how much falls in each level of the simulated magnitude of anomalies in hydrological variables i e et r and sm the numeric intervals of x axis driving forces and y axis hydrological variables are the same with the intervals as in fig 9 during el niño years it is cooler and wetter over the southern us with higher r et and wetter soil conversely it is drier and warmer over the pacific northwest with lower r and drier soil figs 9 and 10 during la niña years cooler and wetter climate dominates over the pacific northwest from december to february but it is drier in the summer the southeast experiences lower precipitation and therefore produces lower r and drier soil in these years figs 9 and 10 this relationship has also been reported by buermann et al 2003 zhou et al 2003 suzuki et al 2007 and yan et al 2013 our results corroborate those of yan et al 2013 and beer et al 2010 that p is the dominant factor controlling the spatial patterns of anomalies in water fluxes i e et and r and sm in both el niño and la niña years figs 9 and 10 on average over the conus domain anomalies of lai in these extreme years show no significant correlation with anomalies in r and sm however there is a slightly positive correlation with et indicating that vegetation dynamics can feed back to the hydrologic cycle at the continental scale figs 6 and 11 this feedback occurs when there is higher p that supports higher lai which then enhances et and ultimately reduces the magnitude of r fig 10 indicates that when t and p i e the climate simulation cause an et increase or decrease lai acts to further increase or decrease et during these enso events this response from vegetation varies significantly over different locations and lai s overall contribution over the conus domain might be cancelled out i e the lai caused plus the co2 s smaller contribution anomalies on hydrologic variables only explain about 5 of total anomalies 5 6 on et 3 1 on r and 6 4 on sm driven by climate factors during the enso cycles table 3 therefore enso events cannot be considered as the most important meteorological cycling phenomenon driving the conus as a whole in changing the sign of the changes in the water fluxes e g during both el niño and la niña phases modeled r always has negative anomalies 4 2 uncertainties in addition to p and t changes in solar radiation and relative humidity are important controls on vegetation dynamics and et nemani et al 2003 wang et al 2010b shi et al 2013 found that net radiation has a significant positive correlation with et over north america although the mt clim algorithms hungerford et al 1989 thornton et al 2000 thornton and running 1999 that are used in vic for estimating solar radiation and relative humidity from diurnal temperature range and precipitation perform reasonably well over most of the global land surface bohn et al 2013 mueller et al 2011 pierce et al 2013 more detailed sensitivity analysis is needed to investigate how vic responds to observed radiation rather than indirectly driven by temperature and precipitation liu et al 2013b mueller et al 2013b the selection of different climate forcing datasets can introduce biases and uncertainties in modeled results as also reported in other studies e g mu et al 2011 sheffield et al 2012 wang and dickinson 2012 c we did not model vegetation dynamics i e biogeochemistry or changes between biome types in this study but instead use remote sensing observations of historical plant lai this introduction of year to year changes in lai while ignoring changes in other vegetation structures such as root distributions and the maximum stomatal conductance may underestimate interactions between the climate system and the land surface response lotsch et al 2003 therefore we did not fully capture the interactions between vegetation atmospheric processes and the hydrologic cycle d odorico et al 2007 zeng and neelin 2000 a trade off exists between capturing these effects e g alkama et al 2010 liu et al 2012 shi et al 2011 and increasing the overall uncertainty of vegetation response however this study is an advance over other hydrologic response studies using the vic model which assume no inter annual variability or long term change in lai generally our simulated results indicate that increasing lai can increase et while decreasing r which is consistent with basin thinning experiments in the southwestern u s robles et al 2014 and conclusions from an empirical model over the conus domain sun et al 2014 for this study we used empirical equations to represent the response of stomatal conductance to increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations this response curve and the long term effect of co2 is biome and location specific and should be calibrated and evaluated with field observations therefore more uncertainty analysis is needed for further assessment alkama et al 2010 field et al 1995 gedney et al 2006b piao et al 2007 for example the response of stomatal conductance and effects of deep roots and water redistribution yan and dickinson 2014 to extreme drought conditions in vic should be well parameterized with field observations another limitation of this study is that this vic version does not take into account of groundwater dynamics i e the aquifer conditions liang et al 1996 some efforts have been conducted to added groundwater component to vic or linked with other ground water models such as adding simple ground model niu et al 2007 to vic by rosenberg et al 2013 considering the groundwater table dynamic by liang et al 2003 and coupling with modflos models by sridhar et al 2017 all these above mentioned improvements increase the capabilities of vic in considering interactions between surface hydrological processes and groundwater and the accuracies in simulating baseflow and et due to the complicity of characterizing the groundwater aquifers detailed model evaluations and parameterization are still needed before applying these new improvements over continental domains without doubt the development of hyper resolution models with integrated surface subsurface hydrological processes e g parflow cathy hydrogeosphere etc may enhance our knowledge and understandings on the linkages between land water and atmosphere kollet et al 2016 wood et al 2011 5 conclusions after evaluating vic simulations using satellite data upscaled et observations and reference gage streamflow records we concluded that vic can successfully capture the magnitude and inter annual variability of streamflow et and total water content over the conus by using factors control simulation experiments with vic we analyzed the relative contributions of climate factors t and p atmospheric co2 vegetation dynamics and their combining effects to long term trends and inter annual variability of hydrologic processes we also discussed how these factors partially vegetation dynamics affect hydrological cycles during extreme climate events i e enso in this paper through factor simulation experiments we found that precipitation plays the dominant role and its pearson s correlation coefficients with variability in et r and sm over this region are all higher than 0 95 while other factors made significant contributions to the long term trends particularly during the cool season and over certain regions such as the southeast the northeast the midwest and the great plains changes in lai result in minor overall contributions to the inter annual variability of the water cycle over the conus domain as a whole however they result in significant effects on the long term trends and inter annual variabilities of hydrologic variables over certain regions such as the midwest furthermore transient lai was the second most important factor controlling the variability of et and sm on average over the conus domain anomalies of lai during enso phases show no significant correlation with anomalies in r and sm however they have slight

6992,while remotely sensed data reveal enhanced vegetation growth under a warming climate how such vegetation dynamics could alter regional hydrology is not fully understood in this study we investigated how changes in leaf area index lai and climatic variability alter long term trends and seasonal variability of evapotranspiration et runoff r and soil moisture sm over the conterminous united states conus during the period 1983 2009 by using the variable infiltration capacity vic model with transient remotely sensed lai inputs factor controlled simulation experiments reveal that while precipitation is the dominant factor controlling long term trends and inter annual fluctuations of water fluxes other factors temperature lai and atmospheric co2 make significant contributions to long term trends particularly over specific regions changes in lai result in minor overall contributions to the inter annual variability of et r and sm over the conus as a whole however they do make a more significant contribution over certain regions such as the midwest furthermore changing lai is the second most important factor in controlling variability in et and sm particularly over the cool season anomalies of lai during el nino southern oscillation enso phases result in no significant correlations with anomalies in r and sm but result in positive correlations with et indicating that vegetation dynamics can have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle over continental scales keywords evapotranspiration runoff conterminous us vegetation dynamics 1 introduction the global terrestrial water cycle has been altered by environmental change and human activities especially during the last century hutjes et al 1998 jackson et al 2005 gedney et al 2006 concurrent to hydrologic changes remotely sensed data indicate an earlier greenness of vegetation and a longer growing season in the northern hemisphere during the last several decades due to warming with implications for enhanced ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration buermann et al 2003 myneni et al 1997 nemani et al 2003 zhou et al 2001 vegetation response to climate change e g long term warming and extreme climate events such as heat waves and droughts feeds back to the regional water cycle through changes in evapotranspiration et runoff r and soil moisture sm the nature of this feedback is unclear but is expected to vary by location and vegetation type feedback is known to be related to meteorology and other atmospheric variables such as the effects of increasing atmospheric co2 concentration on stomatal conductance and water use efficiency dai et al 2009 field et al 1995 gedney et al 2006a jung et al 2010 liu et al 2013b wang and dickinson 2012 previous studies have highlighted the strong correlation between terrestrial et and vegetation dynamics revealed by normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and therefore there is a clear need to explicitly include leaf area index lai or ndvi in et estimations e g mu et al 2007 suzuki et al 2007 wang et al 2010a 2010b yan et al 2012 2013 alkama et al 2010 used a modeling approach to attribute the effects of climate change co2 and lai on long term trends of global r in the 20th and 21st century they found that stomatal conductance and vegetation growth played a minor role in the 20th century while the role of stomatal conductance significantly increased during the 21th century however their study did not investigate how these factors affect the seasonality and inter annual variability of hydrologic processes shi et al 2013 2011 and lei et al 2014 investigated how these factors affect et globally and over a mountainous catchment of china respectively by using the community land model to simulate both lai and hydrologic response similar to alkama et al 2010 they conclude that elevated co2 produced negligible effects on the trend of r biases in simulated lai in these studies likely result in larger uncertainties than if observed lai had been used lei et al 2014 despite this work there are still knowledge gaps related to how climatic factors including temperature t and precipitation p interact with lai in the context of co2 fertilization effects on c3 vegetation i e increasing stomatal resistance therefore decreasing transpiration and how these factors affect spatial patterns of et r and sm at regional to continental scales in addition the seasonality and inter annual variability of these processes have yet to be addressed the variable infiltration capacity vic model is a macro scale hydrologic model that has been used widely in regional and global studies of hydrology and climate change either as an offline hydrologic model or as the land surface module within regional and global climate models adam et al 2009 hamlet et al 2007 hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 liang et al 1996 1994 liu et al 2013b vic is traditionally run with constant lai as a vegetation parameter i e no year to year variability such that the effects of changing phenology and inter annual lai variability on simulated hydrologic processes are not captured the uncertainties from neglecting these dynamics are not well known the purpose of this study is to investigate how remotely sensed vegetation changes in combination with climate change and the co2 fertilization effect affect long term and seasonal variability of terrestrial water fluxes and sm over the conterminous united states conus during the period 1983 2009 we evaluated model simulations using observed streamflow and et as is commonly done e g mote et al

the effects of vegetation phenology on canopy conductance here we enabled vic to read in transient monthly lai for each grid cell during simulation to estimate the effects of phenology on hydrologic

lai during the period 1982 2011 respectively lai affects vic simulated et through changing the amount of intercepted water in the canopy and the canopy resistance liang et al 1996 1994 the vegetation

single factor on hydrologic processes in the context of interactions with other factors table 2 eqs 12 15 the climate experiment represents the traditional model simulation which is driven by transient meteorological data but without changing lai and the co2 concentration the mean climate data used for fixed single factor simulation experiments are post processed from the transient climate

and snowpack content and water and energy budgets over the nldas domain liu et al 2013a lohmann et al 2004 mitchell et al 2004 nijssen et al 2003 robock et al 2003 xia et al 2012 here we reported evaluation results on river discharge both over the two largest river systems in the nldas domain and over small watersheds from the gages ii database comparisons between modeled results and remote sensing products of total water content twc and et are also used for model evaluation due to short overlapping periods between the remote sensing data and modeled results our comparisons are focused only on monthly and inter annual variability and not on the trends combinations of remotely sensed products and field observations have been collected for grid by grid or watersheds by watersheds model evaluations for this study terrestrial water storage over the land is estimated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 tapley et

ncar s clm4 0 landerer and swenson 2012 this product is compared to the total changes in modeled total sm and estimated snowpack which we termed total water content twc anomaly vic does not simulate ground water dynamics and is therefore not included in the modeled twc anomaly for et evaluation we used up scaled et from eddy flux measurements via the model tree ensemble mte method jung et al 2010 for streamflow evaluation we selected 482 usgs gages reference watersheds with least disturbances from human activities e g 5 imperviousness according to the gages ii geospatial attributes of gages

was reconstructed by the climate impacts group at the university of washington uw that uses the bonneville power administration bpa methods crook 1993 and the other dataset was reconstructed by dai et al 2009 with a land surface model for the mississippi atchafalaya river basin marb we selected the mississippi atchafalaya river and gauge observations from usgs http toxics usgs gov hypoxia mississippi flux ests delivery index html data availability period 1968 2008 and dai et al 2009 we divided the conus domain into the following six regions according to the u s environment protection agency http www epa gov climatechange impacts adaptation to report regional differences which were also used for the third u s national climate assessment northeast ne midwest mw great plains gp northwest nw southwest sw and southeast se fig 1 melillo et al 2014 we selected the two major river systems over the conus for evaluating simulated large scale river discharge i e the crb and marb fig

53 n and from 67 w to 125 w 3 results 3 1 evaluations on simulated river discharge comparisons between modeled results with observational and reconstructed historical data indicate that vic driven by the nldas 2 meteorological forcings and dynamic lai successfully captures the magnitude and inter annual variability in annual river discharge especially in the crb the nash sutcliffe ns coefficients in the crb are greater than 0 88 in comparing with both uw and dai reconstructed data fig 2 for the marb vic simulated results match well with usgs observation data ns 0 7 but they do not match well with the reconstructed historical data from dai et al 2009 fig 2 ns 0 14 we did not see significant differences between the simulations with and without dynamic lai over these two basins over the selected reference watersheds vic simulated results has strong correlations with observations with pearson s r 0 91 and p value 0 05 and the index of agreement a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error that varies between 0 and 1 1 means perfect match willmott 1981 and mean absolute error are 0 95 and 139 1 mm yr respectively according to the hydrogof analysis fig 3 zambrano bigiarini 2017 while we need to point out that the simulated results still show slight bias from the 1 1 line rsim 77 3 0 82 robs fig 3 fig 3 also reveals that by using transient lai vic provides slightly higher accuracy than traditional vic runs i e fixed lai which indicates that the widely usage of average lai in regional hydrological simulations may generate some uncertainties due to kinds of non linear responses of lai to water fluxes for inter annual variability vic achieves reasonable results in terms of correlation coefficients between simulated and observed annual r 74 of watersheds have positive pearson s r and 11 2 of total watersheds have higher r than 0 5 vic is normally calibrated at large basin scales to study macro scale hydrological processes at coarse spatial resolution as in 1 8th degree or 12 km grid cell for this study therefore we expected the model to perform less well over small watershed scales i e 400 km2 and 50 000 km2 3 2 evaluations on simulated et and total water content model data comparisons reveal that vic performs well in reconstructing the spatial patterns of multi year average annual et over the entire conus domain pearson s r 0 98 between vic simulated and mte derived et and vic also does reasonably well in reproducing inter annual variability of et r 0 67 between vic simulated anomalies in annual et and the mte derived value fig 4 a however vic substantially underestimated et for some dry years e g 1988 and 2000 fig 4a as mentioned in our previous study i e liu et al 2013a the missing mechanism of deep root and groundwater interaction and the irrigation effects over croplands in vic may be the major reasons for this underestimation although the effects of irrigation on increasing lai are partially considered in this simulation by using observed lai values but are not on the increased et that would result from additional water availability due to irrigation vic does reasonably well in reproducing monthly twc anomalies which is accounted as the difference between transient monthly twc and the multi year average of twc during the period 2004 2009 and these values represent the seasonal variability of twc in comparing with grace tws anomaly r 0 94 as to the long term changes in the variability twc i e the difference between the transient monthly twc anomalies as described above and their multi year average monthly values during the period 2004 2009 vic simulated results have strong consistencies with estimates from grace tws anomalies with the same calculation method r 0 6 fig 4b however because the vic model does not explicitly model deep groundwater dynamics nor its interactions with surface water evaluation of vic using grace tws anomalies should be treated with caution 3 3 long term trends and inter annual variability in driving forces and water fluxes the conus experienced significant increases in annual mean lai of 0 026 0 02 decade 5 6 4 3 and annual mean t of 0 26 0 23 c decade during the period 1983 2009 fig 5 a and 5 b the range indicates the 95 confidence interval the total annual p over the water year i e oct sep had no significant trend during the study period while it experienced a significant decrease p value 0 07 in the cool season i e oct mar spatial trends in climate variables and lai demonstrate substantial regional differences all regions experienced large and significant increases in lai except the western regions i e nw and sw fig 5a the ne had the largest increase in annual p and the western regions and the se experienced large decreases fig 5c however not all trends in annual p over each region are statistically significant most regions show similar warming trends during the cool and warm seasons except the mw and the gp which experienced more warming in the cool season than in the warm season apr sep fig 5b according to simulated results the transient run the environmental change including climate lai and atmospheric co2 its concentration increased by 44 8 ppm from 342 6 to 387 4 ppm or by 13 1 during the simulation period cause significant spatial variability in long term trends inter annual fluctuations and seasonal patterns of the water cycle although the conus domain as a whole shows no significant long term trend in et r and sm during this study period some sub regions exhibit statistically significant trends fig 5 and 66 for example the sw experienced a significant decrease in et fig 5d and the nw experienced a significant decrease in sm fig 5f and 6d leading to much drier soil conditions 1 9 mm year or 11 in total fig 5f and 6f the ne experienced the largest increase in r while most other regions in particular the se and the nw exhibit declining trends fig 5e and 6e the spatial patterns of sm and r trends display decreasing trends in most regions but increases in the ne over the entire conus domain decreases in annual r and sm occurred mainly during the cool season fig 5e and f there is substantial inter annual variability in climate lai and simulated water variables over the entire conus domain annual mean t p and lai fluctuated within the ranges of 12 88 0 97 c mean 95 confidence intervals 773 6 106 6 mm year or 13 8 and 1 21 0 08 m2 m2 or 6 7 respectively fig 7 a c in response the simulated water fluxes and sm also exhibited substantial inter annual variability over the conus domain which resulted in et r and sm varying within the ranges 507 6 49 8 mm year or 9 8 266 1 67 2 mm year or 25 3 and 286 8 23 4 mm or 8 2 respectively fig 7d f 3 4 contributing factors to inter annual variability and long term trends 3 4 1 ranking of their relative contributions over the entire conus domain factor controlled experiments indicate that p was the dominant factor controlling the inter annual fluctuations of r et and sm table 2 the pearson correlation coefficients r between p caused and all factor caused variability are 0 96 0 98 and 0 99 on et r and sm respectively over the conus domain fig 8 table 2 to the long term trends of these hydrological variables however other factors including lai t and co2 made virtually identical contributions as p does table 2 over the conus domain changes in annual mean lai and t increased et while changes in p and co2 reduced it the net effects of all driving forces on et resulted in a negative trend table 2 all factors except co2 had negative effects on r which decreased by 0 61 0 44 and 0 11 mm year year due to changes in p t and lai respectively table 2 p was the major factor controlling sm which decreased sm by 0 26 mm year year table 2 overall t and p together i e climate experiment can explain almost all inter annual variability and the trends of the hydrologic variables during the study period over the conus domain as a whole table 2 according to the simulation results the use of transient lai instead of the monthly static lai that does not vary from year to year as with traditional vic applications has minor overall contributions over the conus as a whole to the inter annual variability of water cycles figs 2 4 and 7 table 2 however transient lai does result in more significant effects on long term trends over the study domain and on inter annual variabilities of hydrologic variables over certain regions e g the midwest fig 8 table 2 increasing co2 had minor effects on the inter annual fluctuations and long term trends in the hydrologic variables but it almost compensated for the effects of lai on long term trends of et and r over the conus domain table 2 for example lai caused an increase in annual et by 0 11 mm per year while an increase in co2 resulted in a decrease in annual et by 0 10 mm per year table 2 3 4 2 spatial variability of the effects of contributing factors each factor s contribution to long term trends and inter annual variability was substantially different across the study domain and in different seasons figs 6 and 9 over the majority of the conus domain p was the dominant factor controlling both trends and inter annual variability in hydrologic processes figs 6 and 9 however other factors including t and lai also dominated long term trends over a large number of grid cells long term trends in annual et were dominantly driven by p 78 of grid cells while 19 and 3 of the cells were driven by t and lai respectively fig 8 in particular t had larger influences on long term trends in et over energy limited zones such as the mountainous areas of the nw se and mw and the combined effects of lai and t dominated over 57 of the se region fig 6g and 9 with regards to long term trends in r and sm p s effects were dominant for most grid cells while around 13 of the grid cells were controlled by t and lai fig 8 with respect to inter annual variability lai was the second most important controlling factor to et 9 2 of all grid cells and sm 3 3 of all grid cells fig 8 in the mw its contribution to the inter annual variability of et was 30 of the total area fig 6j and 8 3 4 3 seasonal variability of the effects of contributing factors each factor s relative contributions to hydrologic cycles varied by season t and lai s influences on the long term trend of et mainly occurred over the cool season for all regions fig 8 specifically t and lai together controlled et trends over 51 and 20 of the land surface during the cool and warm seasons respectively fig 8 relative t and lai increase more during the cool season than during warm season fig 5 which could be contributing to these results lai also played the second most dominant role in the inter annual variability of et during the cool season 32 of the total land area was controlled by lai fig 8 however contributions of t and lai to inter annual variability in sm occurred primarily during the warm season and over the western regions figs 6 and 8 in comparison to et and r the relative variability of total sm is lower because of its larger buffer or storage zone the larger contribution of t and lai on sm during the warm season compared to the cool season might be due to the higher rates of et in the warm season which lowers sm and thus the greater warm season influence is driven by et and manifested via t and lai fig 8 indicates that the major contributing region to this pattern is in the western u s which has a drier warm season soil as compared to the cool season 4 discussions 4 1 responses of vegetation to natural climate variability as expected our simulations demonstrate that lai and its dynamics in addition to climate change have important effects on hydrologic processes over certain regions while it may not be significant at continental scales we need point out that lai itself is also directly controlled by climate and it can feed back to regional climate systems and the entire hydrologic cycle zeng and neelin 2000 zhou et al 2003 2001 this is supported by figs 9 11 showing that anomalies in lai exhibit different spatial patterns during the two non neutral phases of the el niño southern oscillation enso which can be partially explained by anomalies in p and t fig 10 reveals the spatial distribution of net contribution of lai and co2 during the el nino i e 1987 1992 1994 and 2002 and la nina i e 1999 and 2000 years respectively and their correlations with the contributions of climate factors i e t and p the bubble scatter diagrams in fig 10 demonstrate the correlation or cooccurrence between the contributions of lai and co2 and of climate i e t and p to the anomalies through counting the number of grid cells per bin the rounded integer in the 2 dimension space i e 2d histogram x axis represents the anomalies due to climate factors and y axis is the contribution from lai and co2 to investigate the impact of each forcing factors on the anomalies of hydrological processes during these enso cycles 2d histogram plots are drawn over the conterminous us as fig 11 shows the proportion in percentage of each square in fig 11 represents that of all grid cells over the simulation domain how much falls in each level of the magnitude of anomalies in the driving factors i e lai t and p and how much falls in each level of the simulated magnitude of anomalies in hydrological variables i e et r and sm the numeric intervals of x axis driving forces and y axis hydrological variables are the same with the intervals as in fig 9 during el niño years it is cooler and wetter over the southern us with higher r et and wetter soil conversely it is drier and warmer over the pacific northwest with lower r and drier soil figs 9 and 10 during la niña years cooler and wetter climate dominates over the pacific northwest from december to february but it is drier in the summer the southeast experiences lower precipitation and therefore produces lower r and drier soil in these years figs 9 and 10 this relationship has also been reported by buermann et al 2003 zhou et al 2003 suzuki et al 2007 and yan et al 2013 our results corroborate those of yan et al 2013 and beer et al 2010 that p is the dominant factor controlling the spatial patterns of anomalies in water fluxes i e et and r and sm in both el niño and la niña years figs 9 and 10 on average over the conus domain anomalies of lai in these extreme years show no significant correlation with anomalies in r and sm however there is a slightly positive correlation with et indicating that vegetation dynamics can feed back to the hydrologic cycle at the continental scale figs 6 and 11 this feedback occurs when there is higher p that supports higher lai which then enhances et and ultimately reduces the magnitude of r fig 10 indicates that when t and p i e the climate simulation cause an et increase or decrease lai acts to further increase or decrease et during these enso events this response from vegetation varies significantly over different locations and lai s overall contribution over the conus domain might be cancelled out i e the lai caused plus the co2 s smaller contribution anomalies on hydrologic variables only explain about 5 of total anomalies 5 6 on et 3 1 on r and 6 4 on sm driven by climate factors during the enso cycles table 3 therefore enso events cannot be considered as the most important meteorological cycling phenomenon driving the conus as a whole in changing the sign of the changes in the water fluxes e g during both el niño and la niña phases modeled r always has negative anomalies 4 2 uncertainties in addition to p and t changes in solar radiation and relative humidity are important controls on vegetation dynamics and et nemani et al 2003 wang et al 2010b shi et al 2013 found that net radiation has a significant positive correlation with et over north america although the mt clim algorithms hungerford et al 1989 thornton et al 2000 thornton and running 1999 that are used in vic for estimating solar radiation and relative humidity from diurnal temperature range and precipitation perform reasonably well over most of the global land surface bohn et al 2013 mueller et al 2011 pierce et al 2013 more detailed sensitivity analysis is needed to investigate how vic responds to observed radiation rather than indirectly driven by temperature and precipitation liu et al 2013b mueller et al 2013b the selection of different climate forcing datasets can introduce biases and uncertainties in modeled results as also reported in other studies e g mu et al 2011 sheffield et al 2012 wang and dickinson 2012 c we did not model vegetation dynamics i e biogeochemistry or changes between biome types in this study but instead use remote sensing observations of historical plant lai this introduction of year to year changes in lai while ignoring changes in other vegetation structures such as root distributions and the maximum stomatal conductance may underestimate interactions between the climate system and the land surface response lotsch et al 2003 therefore we did not fully capture the interactions between vegetation atmospheric processes and the hydrologic cycle d odorico et al 2007 zeng and neelin 2000 a trade off exists between capturing these effects e g alkama et al 2010 liu et al 2012 shi et al 2011 and increasing the overall uncertainty of vegetation response however this study is an advance over other hydrologic response studies using the vic model which assume no inter annual variability or long term change in lai generally our simulated results indicate that increasing lai can increase et while decreasing r which is consistent with basin thinning experiments in the southwestern u s robles et al 2014 and conclusions from an empirical model over the conus domain sun et al 2014 for this study we used empirical equations to represent the response of stomatal conductance to increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations this response curve and the long term effect of co2 is biome and location specific and should be calibrated and evaluated with field observations therefore more uncertainty analysis is needed for further assessment alkama et al 2010 field et al 1995 gedney et al 2006b piao et al 2007 for example the response of stomatal conductance and effects of deep roots and water redistribution yan and dickinson 2014 to extreme drought conditions in vic should be well parameterized with field observations another limitation of this study is that this vic version does not take into account of groundwater dynamics i e the aquifer conditions liang et al 1996 some efforts have been conducted to added groundwater component to vic or linked with other ground water models such as adding simple ground model niu et al 2007 to vic by rosenberg et al 2013 considering the groundwater table dynamic by liang et al 2003 and coupling with modflos models by sridhar et al 2017 all these above mentioned improvements increase the capabilities of vic in considering interactions between surface hydrological processes and groundwater and the accuracies in simulating baseflow and et due to the complicity of characterizing the groundwater aquifers detailed model evaluations and parameterization are still needed before applying these new improvements over continental domains without doubt the development of hyper resolution models with integrated surface subsurface hydrological processes e g parflow cathy hydrogeosphere etc may enhance our knowledge and understandings on the linkages between land water and atmosphere kollet et al 2016 wood et al 2011 5 conclusions after evaluating vic simulations using satellite data upscaled et observations and reference gage streamflow records we concluded that vic can successfully capture the magnitude and inter annual variability of streamflow et and total water content over the conus by using factors control simulation experiments with vic we analyzed the relative contributions of climate factors t and p atmospheric co2 vegetation dynamics and their combining effects to long term trends and inter annual variability of hydrologic processes we also discussed how these factors partially vegetation dynamics affect hydrological cycles during extreme climate events i e enso in this paper through factor simulation experiments we found that precipitation plays the dominant role and its pearson s correlation coefficients with variability in et r and sm over this region are all higher than 0 95 while other factors made significant contributions to the long term trends particularly during the cool season and over certain regions such as the southeast the northeast the midwest and the great plains changes in lai result in minor overall contributions to the inter annual variability of the water cycle over the conus domain as a whole however they result in significant effects on the long term trends and inter annual variabilities of hydrologic variables over certain regions such as the midwest furthermore transient lai was the second most important factor controlling the variability of et and sm on average over the conus domain anomalies of lai during enso phases show no significant correlation with anomalies in r and sm however they have slight positive correlations with et indicating that vegetation dynamics can have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle over continental scales acknowledgements we would like to thank dr martin jung

6993,reliability of flood stage and inundation extent predictions are affected by the performance of a hydraulic model however uncertainties at all times exist in the model setup process therefore prediction from a single hydraulic model implementation may be subject to huge uncertainty bayesian model averaging bma is applied in this study to combine ensemble predictions from different hydraulic model implementations and to develop a robust deterministic water stage prediction as well as the prediction distribution the bma approach is tested over the black river watershed in missouri and arkansas based on water stage predictions from 81 lisflood fp model configurations that integrate four sources of uncertainty including channel shape channel width channel roughness and flow input model ensemble simulation outputs are trained with observed water stage data during one flood event to obtain the weight and variance for each model member and bma prediction ability is then validated for another flood event the results indicate that the bma approach is able to provide consistently good and reliable deterministic flood stage prediction across the basin though it does not always outperform the best model in the ensemble the bma water stage prediction has better performance than the ensemble mean prediction additionally high chance flood inundation extent derived from a bma probabilistic flood map is more accurate than the probabilistic flood inundation extent based on the equal model weights in the black river watershed keywords bayesian model averaging uncertainty flood prediction lisflood fp water stage probabilistic flood map 1 introduction with the increasing threat of frequently occurring intense storms hydrodynamic models are expected to play a bigger role in understanding and predicting the floods and their corresponding extents there are several ongoing efforts to simulate floods at multiple spatial scales ranging from single reach to continental scale stream networks cook and merwade 2009 de paiva et al 2013 horritt and bates 2002 knebl et al 2005 schumann et al 2013 additionally all these efforts use different approaches ranging from simplistic digital elevation model dem based models such as hand nobre et al 2011 to more sophisticated 1d or 2d hydraulic models such as hec ras and lisflood fp pappenberger et al 2005a wood et al 2016 all approaches require two primary inputs including the topography to construct the river geometry and flow magnitude to simulate the hydraulics simulation of hydraulics require adjustment of model parameters which is primarily the channel roughness specified in the form of manning s n depending on the flood modeling approach the final result is affected by several sources of uncertainty including the model structure flow magnitude topography and model parameters among others bermúdez et al 2017 cook and merwade 2009 dottori et al 2013 mukolwe et al 2016 teng et al 2017 the uncertainty in flood inundation modeling can be categorized into three major types model structure model parameter and input forcing model structure broadly includes the type of the model one dimensional or two dimensional type and form of numerical equations and the assumptions in the model for a specific model structural uncertainty could also include how the river geometry including the channel cross sectional shape and planform is extracted and represented in the model liu et al 2018 pappenberger et al 2006 teng et al 2017 for instance commonly used dems do not have information on channel bed and thus assuming a shape for the channel bed could add substantial uncertainty to the model output most hydraulic models are calibrated for different flows using channel roughness parameter and thus when these models are used to simulate flows that are outside the range used during calibration the calibrated channel roughness value can add uncertainty to the model results this is typically the case when hydraulic models are used for simulating 100 year or higher return period design flows as observed data for such flows may not exist finally observed or simulated input forcing data such as streamflows and water stage used in hydraulic models also add significant uncertainty to the simulation results beven and hall 2014 demeritt et al 2007 merwade et al 2008 pappenberger et al 2005b therefore reliance on a single hydraulic model implementation for flood prediction typically increases the statistical bias of the forecast one way to handle model uncertainties is by using a multi model combination approach in which results are extracted from a group of existing model implementations to provide a robust prediction based on the model prediction ensemble multi model combining for ensemble predictions is widely used in hydrology and climate forecast using a variety of methods including sma simple model average wma weighted model average mmse multi model super ensemble and m3se a variant of mmse among others ajami et al 2006 chowdhury and sharma 2009 hamill 2001 liu et al 2014 najafi and moradkhani 2015a najafi and moradkhani 2015b shamseldin et al 1997 xiong et al 2001 additionally the performance of probabilistic ensemble merging techniques have been evaluated and compared with the deterministic model predictions for climate model and streamflow predictions najafi and moradkhani 2015a najafi and moradkhani 2015b in recent years the bayesian model averaging bma technique merlise 1999 raftery et al 2005 has been used widely in surface water hydrology ajami et al 2007 duan et al 2007 jiang et al 2017 rings et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 groundwater hydrology neuman 2003 climatology zhang et al 2016 biology yeung et al 2005 ecology wintle et al 2003 public health morales et al 2006 and economics fernandez et al 2001 the rationale behind the bma method lies in the fact that some models are superior to other models and each model should not be treated exactly the same the bma approach evaluates model implementations and assigns each of them a weight and variance based on the model performance in the training period the advantage of this approach over other model combing methods is that bma not only provides a deterministic model weighted average prediction of the interested variable but also produces the forecast distribution which reflects the uncertainty associated with the deterministic prediction raftery et al 1997 rings et al 2012 considering the wide applicability of bma in other areas of hydrology its application in flood inundation modeling can help address the issue of accounting and presenting model structure parameter and input forcing uncertainty although the bma approach is usually being used to account only for model structure uncertainty there do exist previous studies in other fields to incorporate forcing boundary condition and parameter uncertainty using the bma method chitsazan and tsai 2015 yen 2012 accordingly the objectives of this study are to 1 determine whether bma can provide accurate and reliable deterministic flood predictions for a stream network by considering various uncertainty sources 2 compare the performance of bma prediction with predictions from model members and ensemble mean and 3 quantify uncertainty associated with the bma deterministic prediction the above objectives are accomplished by applying a large scale hydraulic model for the black river watershed that is located in arkansas and missouri in the u s we acknowledge that uncertainty quantification is not a new topic in flood inundation mapping because several past studies have addressed uncertainties related to parameter input data and boundary conditions aronica et al 2002 jung and merwade 2011 pappenberger et al 2005a 2013 tiwari and chatterjee 2010 yu et al 2015 however the results from these studies are somewhat limited due to the use of isolated flood events on a single reach in the analysis with the growing need to simulate the river hydrodynamics over an entire stream network at basin to continental scales huang and hattermann 2018 jafarzadegan and merwade 2017 merwade et al 2018 schumann et al 2013 wilson et al 2007 it is expected that multiple sources of uncertainties will play different roles in different streams to contribute to the overall uncertainty in the final result hydrodynamic modeling in a stream network will involve a mix of large and small reaches many large reaches could be well described in the model in terms of their cross sectional shape roughness characterization and channel width but the same may not apply to many low order contributing streams as a result many low order streams may be affected by structural parameter and input forcing uncertainties but the large streams may only be affected by input forcing uncertainties thus there is a need to understand the cumulative effect of different uncertainty sources in flood inundation modeling over a larger stream network this study attempts to address this need by using the bma methodology once the cumulative effect of all uncertainties is accounted the hierarchical bma can then be used to understand the relative impact of individual uncertainties 2 study area and data the 20 000 km2 black river watershed located across arkansas and missouri states in the u s is selected for this study historical records indicate that this region has experienced numerous flood events in the past including the recent one that occurred in may 2017 the recorded water level data for the 2017 event are available from the united states geological survey usgs gauges fig 1 and table 1 and are used in validating the results from this study additionally the black river watershed has four major rivers including black river current river eleven point river and spring river which drain towards the watershed outlet in arkansas these four major rivers provide distinct topographical geomorphic settings as well as varying reach lengths and sinuosity thus making black river watershed a good test bed for this study the daily streamflow data input to the hydraulic model and stage data for validation used in this study are unaffected by any major hydraulic structures and are thus considered natural the topography and land use dataset are obtained in the form of national elevation dataset 90 m dem http ned usgs gov and nlcd 2011 land use data http www mrlc gov nlcd2011 php respectively a 90 m dem instead of 30 m or finer resolution dem is selected for this study to strike a balance between predication accuracy and the computational demand for a large number of simulations needed for uncertainty analysis although the prediction accuracy might be affected by using the 90 m dem many large scale models use 90 m or coarser dem for flood modeling as well neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 inundation extents for selected storms which will be used for validation of results are derived by classifying landsat images from the usgs earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov the landsat images are classified into water and non water area with a supervised classification technique using the arcgis classification tools the classification is formed using the following three steps i train the tool by delineating water and non water areas 2 use the maximum likelihood classification approach to classify the entire landsat image based on information obtained from the training areas and iii extract the water area from the classified image and treat it as observed inundation extent around the streams 3 methodology 3 1 hydraulic modeling many one two or three dimensional models exist for conducting flood simulations one dimensional 1d models use discrete cross sections to describe the rivers and assumes that water moves only longitudinally along the direction of river whereas two dimensional models 2d use continuous mesh or raster grid to define the channels and assumes water moves both longitudinally and laterally and a three dimensional 3d model adds the vertical movement to the 2d flow one of the most commonly used models in the u s is the hydrological engineering center s river analysis system hec ras usace 2015 which includes the classic 1d and the recently developed 2d versions hec ras 1d model requires manual digitization of river features such as the center line banks and cross sections using gis application of hec ras 1d model which is commonly used for simulating few reaches within a network can become tedious for a larger stream network containing hundreds of stream segments the 2d hec ras model overcomes the significant amount of digitization work however considering this version still exists at its early age and more validation work need to be done it is not used in this study a recently developed model autorapid tavakoly 2015 incorporates a continental scale river routing model known as routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid with a regional scale flood delineation model called autoroute to generate flood inundation autorapid is a computationally efficient model which is not meant for detailed hydrodynamic modelling and hence its results are less accurate compared to hec ras and other models lisflood fp model is a raster based 1d 2d coupled hydraulic model that has been widely used in the flood inundation modelling community in many parts of the world including europe north america latin america africa and asia altenau et al 2017 komi et al 2017 wilson et al 2007 wood et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the latest subgrid version of liflood fp is easy to implement for large scale flood simulations and yields accurate predictions bates and de roo 2000 neal et al 2012 considering the amount of efforts in model set up computational demand and the results from past studies lisflood fp is selected in this study lisflood fp solves continuity and momentum equations to obtain the information of streamflow and water depth in each raster cell the input data required by the lisflood fp model includes the dem flow values stream centerline and channel geometry information including average river width slope surface roughness and channel cross sectional shape the floodplain roughness values used in this study are obtained from the nlcd land use dataset homer et al 2015 nlcd is raster dataset specifying the land use for each pixel which can then be related to a specific manning s n value as described in kalyanapu et al 2010 two six month daily time step simulations are used for training 12 2007 to 05 2008 and validation 01 2011 to 06 2011 respectively these two periods are selected based on the flood events and availability of input and validation data a total number of 81 lisflood fp model configurations described in the next section are created and simulated using high performance computing hpc resources at purdue university a two month warm up period is used in the training and validation simulations to remove unrealistic predictions and thus the outputs in the warm up periods are excluded from the bma analysis 3 2 bayesian model averaging method dynamic model simulation outputs are subject to uncertainty when compared with observations for any simulation ensemble some models have relatively superior performances compared to others therefore instead of relying on the results of one specific model extracting information from the model simulation ensemble is more reliable ma et al 2018 raftery et al 2005 bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical approach to combine estimations from individual models and produce reliable prediction the bma predictive pdf of a variable such as water depth in this study is the weighted average of the pdfs associated with each model member forecast in the ensemble the weight could reflect the prediction skill of a member in the training period this method has several desirable properties one of which is that the bma approach not only provides the deterministic model weighted average prediction but also provides an associated prediction distribution in addition instead of trusting one best model the bma approach considers the performance of all model predictions in the training period to predict flood stage d on the basis of training data dt using k models the law of total probability indicates that the forecast pdf p d is given by eq 1 1 p d k 1 k p d m k p m k d t where p d mk is the forecast pdf based on model mk alone and p mk dt is the posterior probability of model mk given the observation data in the training period in the bma theory the posterior model probability p mk dt represents the weight for each model member in the ensemble and all the weights add up to one eq 2 the model prediction is associated with a conditional pdf gk d mk which can be illustrated as the conditional pdf of d conditioned on mk given that mk is the best forecast then the bma predictive pdf is obtained using eq 3 typically it is assumed that the pdf of predicted quantity follows a normal distribution centered at mk with standard deviation σ k eq 4 a deterministic water stage forecast can also be obtained through the bma method the bma deterministic prediction is the expectation of the quantity given the model predictions which can be calculated using eq 5 2 k 1 k p m k d t 1 3 p d m 1 m k k 1 k w k g k d m k 4 d m k n m k σ k 2 5 e d m 1 m k k 1 k w k m k 3 3 box cox transformation and expectation maximization em method for non gaussian data a power transformation is needed to map the variables from their original space to the gaussian space the observed and simulated water stage data are normalized using the box cox power transformation box and cox 1964 osborne 2010 this method is used to transform the skewed data into normal distribution using eq 6 when the power λ is zero the natural logarithm is applied to the data different powers are tested and the best power that yields the closest normal distribution of transformed water stage data is found and applied the transformed water stage data is used to find the bma weights for each model member in order to estimate the parameter wk and σ k on the basis of training data set the log likelihood function eq 7 is maximized 6 f t f λ 1 λ λ 0 ln f λ 0 7 l θ s t l o g k 1 k w k g k d s t m k s t where λ is the power that used to transform the data to a normal distribution f is the data in its original space and ft is the data after transformation the summation in eq 7 is over locations s and time t in the training data generally water stage data are correlated in time but the correlation in prediction errors is assumed to be weakly correlated and is not expected to have significant impact on the results additionally eq 7 computes the conditional distribution expectation for a scalar observation given forecasts rather than for several observations simultaneously raftery et al 2005 eq 7 is difficult to solve analytically or numerically vrugt and robinson 2007 zhu et al 2016 and thus an expectation maximization em algorithm is used to find out the maximum likelihood the em algorithm is iterative and alternates between two steps the e or expectation step and the m or maximization step by using a latent variable z in the e step z is estimated given the current estimates of the model weight wk and σ k eq 8 8 z k s t j w k j 1 g d s t m k s t σ k j 1 i 1 k w i j 1 g d s t m i s t σ i j 1 where the superscript j refers to the jth iteration of the em algorithm and g d st m kst σ k j 1 is a normal density with mean mkst and standard deviation σ k j 1 in the m step the weight wk and standard deviation σ k are calculated with the current estimate of zkst eqs 9 and 10 9 w k j 1 n s t z k s t j 10 σ k 2 j s t z k s t j d s t m s t 2 s t z k s t j where n is the number of observations including distinct values of locations and time the e step and m step are iterated to convergence when the changes of weight variance latent variable z and log likelihood are smaller than some small tolerances 10 6 in this study the log likelihood is guaranteed to increase at each em iteration therefore finally it converges to a local maximum wu 1983 3 4 sources of uncertainty and lisflood fp configurations epistemic uncertainty in the lisflood fp model comes from a variety of sources including the assumed cross section shape of the channel channel width channel roughness dem resolution streamflow input and exclusion of hydraulic structures bales and wagner 2009 merwade et al 2008 papaioannou et al 2017 pappenberger et al 2006 among these sources uncertainty in cross sectional shape channel width model parameter and streamflow input are considered in this study it is acknowledged that topography plays an important role in hydraulic modeling but its impact varies depending on the data source and quality fernandez et al 2016 the u s national elevation dataset ned dem used in this study is derived from lidar with relatively higher accuracy so it is excluded from this study uncertainty arising from hydraulic structures such as bridges culverts is also excluded due to the lack of detailed data at the stream network scale the uncertainty in streamflow estimates at usgs gaging stations can be as high as 10 for stable natural channels harmel et al 2006 slade 2004 thus three streamflow estimates including 0 9q q and 1 1q are used hydraulic models require the description of channel banks to separate the floodplain from the main channel in lisflood fp this is typically done by specifying the channel width along the centerline generally the channel banks or width data are obtained based on aerial images captured during non flooding conditions this process adds substantial uncertainty in estimating the channel width depending on the time of the year when the aerial images are captured and the number of locations used in getting the average channel width the uncertainty in channel width is incorporated by creating a distribution of channel widths from manually digitized banks and cross sections for four major rivers in the black river watershed and then picking the 5 mean and 95 values from this distribution table 2 both channel and floodplain roughness play an important role in the hydrodynamic simulations but it is assumed that the floodplain roughness in this study which is derived from the land use data is less uncertain compared to the channel roughness a recent study by liu et al 2018 also found the channel roughness to affect the inundation extent more than the channel roughness hence only the uncertainty from channel roughness is included in this study the uncertainty in channel roughness manning s n value is incorporated by selecting three values ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 this range is selected based on previous studies horritt 2006 yu et al 2013 2015 to reflect the roughness of most natural channels characterized from a clean straight channel to a winding grassy and graveled channel finally the uncertainty in cross sectional shape is incorporated by assuming three shapes namely triangular parabola and rectangle considering the aforementioned four uncertainty sources and three varied types for each source 81 3 3 3 3 lisflood fp model configurations are created by using different combinations of these uncertainty sources table 3 3 5 evaluation of bma prediction in training and validation periods two types of bma predictions are considered in this study in the first type named bma station bma s the simulation outputs are trained with the observed water stage data at each station separately to obtain the corresponding weights for model members specifically the bma weights are determined by maximizing the likelihood function eq 7 over time for each location separately only considering the temporal component thus one set of weights is derived separately for each of the four validation stations in the second type named bma global bma g the bma weights are determined by maximizing the likelihood function by including simulation and observed data from all four validation stations to give one set of weights considering the spatial temporal components to validate the bma predictive ability the bma s and bma g weights are applied to model simulation outputs of another flood event and the predictions are evaluated with the observed flood stage in addition bma predictions are also compared with an ensemble mean prediction for each station and the root mean square error values of the water stage eq 11 are calculated and ranked for each bma model prediction and the ensemble mean prediction besides water stage flood inundation extent is also compared with observed data using f and c indices eqs 12 and 13 horritt and bates 2001 sangwan and merwade 2015 finally a probabilistic flood map is created by applying the bma g weights to each raster grid cell eq 14 based on ensemble flood inundation extent predictions the result is compared with the probabilistic flood map derived from the ensemble mean prediction eq 15 in which all models have equal weights these two types of probabilistic flood inundation extents are also evaluated using f and c indices 11 rmse i 1 n y i y obs 2 n 12 f a om a o a m a om 13 c a om a o 14 prob b m a g i 1 k w i 1 15 prob ensemblemean k n where yi stands for model predicted water stage yobs is the observed water stage n is the total number of model configurations k is the number of model configurations that predict the cell is flooded and wi is the weight for model i aom refers to area that is both observed and simulated as inundation ao refers to the observed area of inundation am is the model simulated flood inundation area f and c indices stand for fit and correctness respectively and range from 0 worst to 1 best 4 results and discussion 4 1 convergence of expectation maximization iterations and final model weights the four indicators of the expectation maximization algorithm including the maximum absolute change of weight maximum absolute change of logarithmic variance maximum absolute change of latent variable z and maximum absolute change of logarithmic likelihood converge after about 200 iterations fig 2 the convergence time for both station based weights and global weights is comparable although global based calculations required a few more iterations the bma s and bma g weights for each model member in the ensemble at iteration convergence are shown in fig 3 the model configurations x axis in fig 3 are described in table 4 fig 3 is a stacked bar plot and it shows that several model implementations give their best predictions with higher weights for each validation station in some cases a specific model implementation may obtain a vary high weight above 0 5 compared with other model implementations at one specific validation station this indicates that this specific model implementation may mostly fit for the real condition with respect to channel geometry roughness and input forcing along the rivers comparatively global data assigns relatively evenly distributed weights to all the model configurations and no one model could acquire a very high weight bma s weights vary across the basin and one set of weights obtained from one station may not be suitable and used to find out the bma predictions for another station whereas bma g weights could be applied to predictions for the entire basin consistently including the ungauged locations fig 3 also shows that the first 40 configurations which use lower channel width have lower weights compared to the next 40 this means that selection of proper channel width is crucial and a smaller channel width will produce less accurate results in lisflood fp lisflood fp relates the channel width with channel depth in general a wider channel also results in a deeper cross section when 5 threshold low channel width value is used the channel cross sectional area is significantly underestimated thus affecting the flood inundation depth and extent 4 2 validation of bma prediction performance overall the water stage range in fig 4 provided by the model ensemble predictions at four stations includes the observed water stage ensemble mean prediction as well as bma predictions the bma s performs the best followed by bma g and ensemble mean predictions in the validation period when the same weights derived from the training period are used in fig 4b and c the simulations from the model ensemble overestimate water levels when compared with observation data at low flow condition this indicates that assuming a high flow input forcing might cause prediction bias before and after the flood peaks additionally fig 4 also points out that the quality of dem from ned that is derived from lidar could satisfy the requirement of this study and it won t cause huge bias for the predicted water stages the difference in the performance of these models is more visible in the plot of water stage rmse in fig 5 additionally the difference of rmses between these predictions varies from station to station fig 5a and fig 5c show that ensemble mean predictions in these two stations are closer to bma predictions this is because the observation data is generally in the middle of the prediction ensemble which can be found in fig 4 besides bma for these two validation stations ensemble mean can also produce desirable output however in other cases as shown in fig 5b and d observed water stage data is closer to the upper or lower bound of the prediction ensemble for these two cases bma predictions are still among those best predictions whereas ensemble mean predictions are much worse comparing with bma s bma g performance is slightly worse for each specific station and this is because bma g weights consider a wider spatial range of training data from different stations when predictions for locations other than those four validation stations needed bma g is trustworthy bma g is especially useful for those data sparse watersheds where there is not enough training data for all the locations interested as shown in fig 5 bma s may not outperform all the models in the ensemble however without knowing which model implementation will yield better outcome beforehand it is good to use bma s and bma g predictions instead of trusting only one specific model implementation or the ensemble mean prediction this is because one model may perform well for one flood event in the training period but may not perform equally well for another in order to test the impact of temporal scale a shortened period 40 days around the flood peak is used for training however bma prediction still has its advantage and performs better compared with most of the model member predictions therefore to some extent the temporal scale may affect the results but not to change the conclusions moreover the weight obtained from one station is also used as global weights to test how it works at other locations one test done by applying the bma weight trained from usgs 07 072 000 to usgs 07 069 500 from validation station on eleven point river to validation station on spring river indicates that the bma performance becomes worse more biased compared with the observations it overestimates the water level about 0 5 m over the validation period on average whereas it behaves very well when the weights obtained from usgs 07 069 500 itself is used fig 4a this also points out that the spatial dependency for this study area is not very strong additionally the bma s and bma g were not compared with the single calibrated deterministic prediction in this study dechant and moradkhani 2011 thiboult et al 2016 as the calibrated model may not be the correct model due to equifinality 4 3 comparison of probabilistic flood maps based on bma g and ensemble mean the probabilistic flood map obtained from the bma and ensemble mean is shown in fig 6 for an area where satellite image derived observed inundation extent exists although both bma and ensemble mean derived flood inundation cover the same area the probability of flooding predicted by these two methods is different especially for the areas with high probability of flooding by assigning bma g weights to all model configurations the probability of flooding is higher for the upper right region in fig 6b compared with the ensemble mean probabilistic flood map since the upper right part is observed to be flooded black outline the higher probability as shown by the bma g probabilistic flood map is more reliable compared to the ensemble mean prediction fig 7 evaluates the performances of these two types of probabilistic flood maps with observed flood extent by calculating f and c indices specifically the predicted flood extents from raster grids in which flooding probability are greater than certain thresholds are evaluated with observed inundation extent respectively it indicates that the bma g probabilistic flood map has better performance than ensemble mean based approach when higher thresholds are selected chance of flood is greater than 60 for evaluation as the threshold level decreases below 60 there is no significant difference between these two approaches this is caused by the difference in model behaviors in the ensemble considering that the observed flood region is captured by some of the models in the ensemble while missed by others bma picks better performing models capturing the flood to assign higher weights accordingly this produces higher chance of flood in this region on the contrary the ensemble mean method assigns equal weights to all the models which reduces the probability of flooding in the region 4 4 evaluation of uncertainty associated with bma deterministic prediction fig 8 shows the 95 confidence intervals of bma deterministic water stage predictions the bandwidth space between upper interval and lower interval reflects uncertainty of the deterministic prediction and it is the mean width across all time steps except warm up period the difference of bandwidths for bma s predictions among stations is caused by the different variances σ k 2 and weights wk associated with each model member varying significantly across stations fig 8a and b show that the bma prediction uncertainty of these two stations are less than the other stations one reason is that these two validation stations 8a and 8b are closer to the flow station upstream table 5 additionally the change of width along these two reaches 8a and 8b is not as significant as the other reaches 8c and 8d table 5 thus the model configurations have relatively less variance on the bma simulation output for these two stations 8a and 8b comparatively bma g prediction bands have the same width across the four stations since the same variances and weights are applied to the model ensemble moreover fig 8c and 8d indicate that though bma s deterministic water stage prediction has better performance than bma g prediction the uncertainty bounds associated with bma s prediction could be higher 5 conclusion mitigating and managing flood risk depends on reliable prediction of flood inundation and water stage considering a wide range of epistemic uncertainty sources associated with the flood inundation modeling it is important to understand the combined effects of these uncertainties on the prediction of flood inundation extents instead of trusting prediction from only one specific model implementation the ensemble prediction trajectories are generated in this study by considering the uncertainty from channel width channel cross section shape roughness and bias in flow input data the bayesian model averaging approach is applied as the multi model combing method to provide a deterministic prediction as well as its associated prediction uncertainty bounds two types of bma bma s and bma g predicted deterministic water stages are evaluated with observed water stage data at four usgs validation stations and compared with ensemble mean prediction in addition bma g based probabilistic flood map is created and compared with the ensemble mean based probabilistic inundation extent uncertainty associated with the bma deterministic prediction is also investigated the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 although bma deterministic prediction may not always outperform all the model members in the ensemble this approach is able to provide a relatively robust water stage prediction at each validation station thus the bma approach can be used as the multi model combining method for the ensemble flood inundation modeling 2 typically bma s deterministic prediction behaves better than most of the member predictions in the ensemble additionally bma s has better prediction than bma g which is better or at least similar to ensemble mean prediction 3 in spite of bma g prediction is not as good as bma s by considering a wider spatial range of training data from different stations it could provide relatively reliable and robust prediction for an ungauged location in the watershed therefore bma g is especially useful for those data sparse watersheds where the training data of the interested locations is insufficient comparatively applying the weights obtained from one station in the training period as global weights to another validation station usually yields poorer result than adopting the weights derived from bma g additionally in general models implementing 5 low channel width perform poorer due to the underestimation of channel cross sectional areas 4 in terms of probabilistic flood inundation extents bma g has better performance than ensemble mean prediction for high chance flood regions at black river watershed on the other hand there is no significant difference between two types of probabilistic flood maps for low chance flood regions 5 the uncertainty bands of prediction based on 95 confidence intervals vary from location to location for bma s prediction this reflects the change of weights and variances associated with the normal distribution for models at different locations at usgs 07 069 500 and usgs 07072000 the bandwidths of confidence interval are relatively narrower this is because these stations are closer to the upstream flow input stations and it results in less variance from different model implementations whereas the bandwidths are the same for bma g prediction at all validation stations since the weights and variances associated with the normal distribution for models remain unchanged across the basin despite bma s deterministic prediction typically performing better than bma g the uncertainty associated with bma s might be higher the overall goal of this study was to use the bma method for quantifying the combined uncertainty from different sources in flood inundation modeling to create a reliable prediction from model ensembles additionally this study sets the stage for the next phase where the hierarchical bma can be used to quantify the relative contribution from each uncertainty source while the results show that the bma method is appropriate for providing robust predictions from an ensemble of model results incorporating multiple uncertainty sources the methodology used in this study has some limitations that merit attention first this study assumed that the flow depths are independent in time and space although the data are strongly correlated in time the correlation in the prediction errors is relatively smaller while this may not change the findings of this study it would be good to investigate the relative performance of the bma methodology when the temporal dependence is taken into consideration limitations related to the assumption of normally distributed predictive pdfs of transformed data and the adoption of local optimization technique e g expectation maximization have also been mentioned in other studies madadgar and moradkhani 2014 parrish et al 2012 vrugt and robinson 2007 although expectation maximization algorithm is suggested to find out the solution for the log likelihood function it is a local optimization approach the normal distribution is only valid for limited variables such as sea level pressure and temperature but other variables e g streamflow used in this study needs to be transformed to the normal space before bma is applied raftery et al 2005 although the box cox transformation can adjust the skewness of the data the pdf still remains bounded this is especially true for this study since as the same transformation power λ is used for all the simulations in the ensemble and observation data for each validation station this may have slightly affect the pdf of the transformed data a different transformation power could be used when individual simulation is considered for analysis to take this into account in future studies sequential data assimilation could be incorporated into bma to release the gaussian assumption of the likelihood function parrish et al 2012 also a group of copula functions could be integrated with bma to estimate the posterior distribution of model forecast which removes the normal distribution

6993,reliability of flood stage and inundation extent predictions are affected by the performance of a hydraulic model however uncertainties at all times exist in the model setup process therefore prediction from a single hydraulic model implementation may be subject to huge uncertainty bayesian model averaging bma is applied in this study to combine ensemble predictions from different hydraulic model implementations and to develop a robust deterministic water stage prediction as well as the prediction distribution the bma approach is tested over the black river watershed in missouri and arkansas based on water stage predictions from 81 lisflood fp model configurations that integrate four sources of uncertainty including channel shape channel width channel roughness and flow input model ensemble simulation outputs are trained with observed water stage data during one flood event to obtain the weight and variance for each model member and bma prediction ability is then validated for another flood event the results indicate that the bma approach is able to provide consistently good and reliable deterministic flood stage prediction across the basin though it does not always outperform the best model in the ensemble the bma water stage prediction has better performance than the ensemble mean prediction additionally high chance flood inundation extent derived from a bma probabilistic flood map is more accurate than the probabilistic flood inundation extent based on the equal model weights in the black river watershed keywords bayesian model averaging uncertainty flood prediction lisflood fp water stage probabilistic flood map 1 introduction with the increasing threat of frequently occurring intense storms hydrodynamic models are expected to play a bigger role in understanding and predicting the floods and their corresponding extents there are several ongoing efforts to simulate floods at multiple spatial scales ranging from single reach to continental scale stream networks cook and merwade 2009 de paiva et al 2013 horritt and bates 2002 knebl et al 2005 schumann et al 2013 additionally all these efforts use different approaches ranging from simplistic digital elevation model dem based models such as hand nobre et al 2011 to more sophisticated 1d or 2d hydraulic models such as hec ras and lisflood fp pappenberger et al 2005a wood et al 2016 all approaches require two primary inputs including the topography to construct the river geometry and flow magnitude to simulate the hydraulics simulation of hydraulics require adjustment of model parameters which is primarily the channel roughness specified in the form of manning s n depending on the flood modeling approach the final result is affected by several sources of uncertainty including the model structure flow magnitude topography and model parameters among others bermúdez et al 2017 cook and merwade 2009 dottori et al 2013 mukolwe et al 2016 teng et al 2017 the uncertainty in flood inundation modeling can be categorized into three major types model structure model parameter and input forcing model structure broadly includes the type of the model one dimensional or two dimensional type and form of numerical equations and the assumptions in the model for a specific model structural uncertainty could also include how the river geometry including the channel cross sectional shape and planform is extracted and represented in the model liu et al 2018 pappenberger et al 2006 teng et al 2017 for instance commonly used dems do not have information on channel bed and thus assuming a shape for the channel bed could add substantial uncertainty to the model output most hydraulic models are calibrated for different flows using channel roughness parameter and thus when these models are used to simulate flows that are outside the range used during calibration the calibrated channel roughness value can add uncertainty to the model results this is typically the case when hydraulic models are used for simulating 100 year or higher return period design flows as observed data for such flows may not exist finally observed or simulated input forcing data such as streamflows and water stage used in hydraulic models also add significant uncertainty to the simulation results beven and hall 2014 demeritt et al 2007 merwade et al 2008 pappenberger et al 2005b therefore reliance on a single hydraulic model implementation for flood prediction typically increases the statistical bias of the forecast one way to handle model uncertainties is by using a multi model combination approach in which results are extracted from a group of existing model implementations to provide a robust prediction based on the model prediction ensemble multi model combining for ensemble predictions is widely used in hydrology and climate forecast using a variety of methods including sma simple model average wma weighted model average mmse multi model super ensemble and m3se a variant of mmse among others ajami et al 2006 chowdhury and sharma 2009 hamill 2001 liu et al 2014 najafi and moradkhani 2015a najafi and moradkhani 2015b shamseldin et al 1997 xiong et al 2001 additionally the performance of probabilistic ensemble merging techniques have been evaluated and compared with the deterministic model predictions for climate model and streamflow predictions najafi and moradkhani 2015a najafi and moradkhani 2015b in recent years the bayesian model averaging bma technique merlise 1999 raftery et al 2005 has been used widely in surface water hydrology ajami et al 2007 duan et al 2007 jiang et al 2017 rings et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 groundwater hydrology neuman 2003 climatology zhang et al 2016 biology yeung et al 2005 ecology wintle et al 2003 public health morales et al 2006 and economics fernandez et al 2001 the rationale behind the bma method lies in the fact that some models are superior to other models and each model should not be treated exactly the same the bma approach evaluates model implementations and assigns each of them a weight and variance based on the model performance in the training period the advantage of this approach over other model combing methods is that bma not only provides a deterministic model weighted average prediction of the interested variable but also produces the forecast distribution which reflects the uncertainty associated with the deterministic prediction raftery et al 1997 rings et al 2012 considering the wide applicability of bma in other areas of hydrology its application in flood inundation modeling can help address the issue of accounting and presenting model structure parameter and input forcing uncertainty although the bma approach is usually being used to account only for model structure uncertainty there do exist previous studies in other fields to incorporate forcing boundary condition and parameter uncertainty using the bma method chitsazan and tsai 2015 yen 2012 accordingly the objectives of this study are to 1 determine whether bma can provide accurate and reliable deterministic flood predictions for a stream network by considering various uncertainty sources 2 compare the performance of bma prediction with predictions from model members and ensemble mean and 3 quantify uncertainty associated with the bma deterministic prediction the above objectives are accomplished by applying a large scale hydraulic model for the black river watershed that is located in arkansas and missouri in the u s we acknowledge that uncertainty quantification is not a new topic in flood inundation mapping because several past studies have addressed uncertainties related to parameter input data and boundary conditions aronica et al 2002 jung and merwade 2011 pappenberger et al 2005a 2013 tiwari and chatterjee 2010 yu et al 2015 however the results from these studies are somewhat limited due to the use of isolated flood events on a single reach in the analysis with the growing need to simulate the river hydrodynamics over an entire stream network at basin to continental scales huang and hattermann 2018 jafarzadegan and merwade 2017 merwade et al 2018 schumann et al 2013 wilson et al 2007 it is expected that multiple sources of uncertainties will play different roles in different streams to contribute to the overall uncertainty in the final result hydrodynamic modeling in a stream network will involve a mix of large and small reaches many large reaches could be well described in the model in terms of their cross sectional shape roughness characterization and channel width but the same may not apply to many low order contributing streams as a result many low order streams may be affected by structural parameter and input forcing uncertainties but the large streams may only be affected by input forcing uncertainties thus there is a need to understand the cumulative effect of different uncertainty sources in flood inundation modeling over a larger stream network this study attempts to address this need by using the bma methodology once the cumulative effect of all uncertainties is accounted the hierarchical bma can then be used to understand the relative impact of individual uncertainties 2 study area and data the 20 000 km2 black river watershed located across arkansas and missouri states in the u s is selected for this study historical records indicate that this region has experienced numerous flood events in the past including the recent one that occurred in may 2017 the recorded water level data for the 2017 event are available from the united states geological survey usgs gauges fig 1 and table 1 and are used in validating the results from this study additionally the black river watershed has four major rivers including black river current river eleven point river and spring river which drain towards the watershed outlet in arkansas these four major rivers provide distinct topographical geomorphic settings as well as varying reach lengths and sinuosity thus making black river watershed a good test bed for this study the daily streamflow data input to the hydraulic model and stage data for validation used in this study are unaffected by any major hydraulic structures and are thus considered natural the topography and land use dataset are obtained in the form of national elevation dataset 90 m dem http ned usgs gov and nlcd 2011 land use data http www mrlc gov nlcd2011 php respectively a 90 m dem instead of 30 m or finer resolution dem is selected for this study to strike a balance between predication accuracy and the computational demand for a large number of simulations needed for uncertainty analysis although the prediction accuracy might be affected by using the 90 m dem many large scale models use 90 m or coarser dem for flood modeling as well neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 inundation extents for selected storms which will be used for validation of results are derived by classifying landsat images from the usgs earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov the landsat images are classified into water and non water area with a supervised classification technique using the arcgis classification tools the classification is formed using the following three steps i train the tool by delineating water and non water areas 2 use the maximum likelihood classification approach to classify the entire landsat image based on information obtained from the training areas and iii extract the water area from the classified image and treat it as observed inundation extent around the streams 3 methodology 3 1 hydraulic modeling many one two or three dimensional models exist for conducting flood simulations one dimensional 1d models use discrete cross sections to describe the rivers and assumes that water moves only longitudinally along the direction of river whereas two dimensional models 2d use continuous mesh or raster grid to define the channels and assumes water moves both longitudinally and laterally and a three dimensional 3d model adds the vertical movement to the 2d flow one of the most commonly used models in the u s is the hydrological engineering center s river analysis system hec ras usace 2015 which includes the classic 1d and the recently developed 2d versions hec ras 1d model requires manual digitization of river features such as the center line banks and cross sections using gis application of hec ras 1d model which is commonly used for simulating few reaches within a network can become tedious for a larger stream network containing hundreds of stream segments the 2d hec ras model overcomes the significant amount of digitization work however considering this version still exists at its early age and more validation work need to be done it is not used in this study a recently developed model autorapid tavakoly 2015 incorporates a continental scale river routing model known as routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid with a regional scale flood delineation model called autoroute to generate flood inundation autorapid is a computationally efficient model which is not meant for detailed hydrodynamic modelling and hence its results are less accurate compared to hec ras and other models lisflood fp model is a raster based 1d 2d coupled hydraulic model that has been widely used in the flood inundation modelling community in many parts of the world including europe north america latin america africa and asia altenau et al 2017 komi et al 2017 wilson et al 2007 wood et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the latest subgrid version of liflood fp is easy to implement for large scale flood simulations and yields accurate predictions bates and de roo 2000 neal et al 2012 considering the amount of efforts in model set up computational demand and the results from past studies lisflood fp is selected in this study lisflood fp solves continuity and momentum equations to obtain the information of streamflow and water depth in each raster cell the input data required by the lisflood fp model includes the dem flow values stream centerline and channel geometry information including average river width slope surface roughness and channel cross sectional shape the floodplain roughness values used in this study are obtained from the nlcd land use dataset homer et al 2015 nlcd is raster dataset specifying the land use for each pixel which can then be related to a specific manning s n value as described in kalyanapu et al 2010 two six month daily time step simulations are used for training 12 2007 to 05 2008 and validation 01 2011 to 06 2011 respectively these two periods are selected based on the flood events and availability of input and validation data a total number of 81 lisflood fp model configurations described in the next section are created and simulated using high performance computing hpc resources at purdue university a two month warm up period is used in the training and validation simulations to remove unrealistic predictions and thus the outputs in the warm up periods are excluded from the bma analysis 3 2 bayesian model averaging method dynamic model simulation outputs are subject to uncertainty when compared with observations for any simulation ensemble some models have relatively superior performances compared to others therefore instead of relying on the results of one specific model extracting information from the model simulation ensemble is more reliable ma et al 2018 raftery et al 2005 bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical approach to combine estimations from individual models and produce reliable prediction the bma predictive pdf of a variable such as water depth in this study is the weighted average of the pdfs associated with each model member forecast in the ensemble the weight could reflect the prediction skill of a member in the training period this method has several desirable properties one of which is that the bma approach not only provides the deterministic model weighted average prediction but also provides an associated prediction distribution in addition instead of trusting one best model the bma approach considers the performance of all model predictions in the training period to predict flood stage d on the basis of training data dt using k models the law of total probability indicates that the forecast pdf p d is given by eq 1 1 p d k 1 k p d m k p m k d t where p d mk is the forecast pdf based on model mk alone and p mk dt is the posterior probability of model mk given the observation data in the training period in the bma theory the posterior model probability p mk dt represents the weight for each model member in the ensemble and all the weights add up to one eq 2 the model prediction is associated with a conditional pdf gk d mk which can be illustrated as the conditional pdf of d conditioned on mk given that mk is the best forecast then the bma predictive pdf is obtained using eq 3 typically it is assumed that the pdf of predicted quantity follows a normal distribution centered at mk with standard deviation σ k eq 4 a deterministic water stage forecast can also be obtained through the bma method the bma deterministic prediction is the expectation of the quantity given the model predictions which can be calculated using eq 5 2 k 1 k p m k d t 1 3 p d m 1 m k k 1 k w k g k d m k 4 d m k n m k σ k 2 5 e d m 1 m k k 1 k w k m k 3 3 box cox transformation and expectation maximization em method for non gaussian data a power transformation is needed to map the variables from their original space to the gaussian space the observed and simulated water stage data are normalized using the box cox power transformation box and cox 1964 osborne 2010 this method is used to transform the skewed data into normal distribution using eq 6 when the power λ is zero the natural logarithm is applied to the data different powers are tested and the best power that yields the closest normal distribution of transformed water stage data is found and applied the transformed water stage data is used to find the bma weights for each model member in order to estimate the parameter wk and σ k on the basis of training data set the log likelihood function eq 7 is maximized 6 f t f λ 1 λ λ 0 ln f λ 0 7 l θ s t l o g k 1 k w k g k d s t m k s t where λ is the power that used to transform the data to a normal distribution f is the data in its original space and ft is the data after transformation the summation in eq 7 is over locations s and time t in the training data generally water stage data are correlated in time but the correlation in prediction errors is assumed to be weakly correlated and is not expected to have significant impact on the results additionally eq 7 computes the conditional distribution expectation for a scalar observation given forecasts rather than for several observations simultaneously raftery et al 2005 eq 7 is difficult to solve analytically or numerically vrugt and robinson 2007 zhu et al 2016 and thus an expectation maximization em algorithm is used to find out the maximum likelihood the em algorithm is iterative and alternates between two steps the e or expectation step and the m or maximization step by using a latent variable z in the e step z is estimated given the current estimates of the model weight wk and σ k eq 8 8 z k s t j w k j 1 g d s t m k s t σ k j 1 i 1 k w i j 1 g d s t m i s t σ i j 1 where the superscript j refers to the jth iteration of the em algorithm and g d st m kst σ k j 1 is a normal density with mean mkst and standard deviation σ k j 1 in the m step the weight wk and standard deviation σ k are calculated with the current estimate of zkst eqs 9 and 10 9 w k j 1 n s t z k s t j 10 σ k 2 j s t z k s t j d s t m s t 2 s t z k s t j where n is the number of observations including distinct values of locations and time the e step and m step are iterated to convergence when the changes of weight variance latent variable z and log likelihood are smaller than some small tolerances 10 6 in this study the log likelihood is guaranteed to increase at each em iteration therefore finally it converges to a local maximum wu 1983 3 4 sources of uncertainty and lisflood fp configurations epistemic uncertainty in the lisflood fp model comes from a variety of sources including the assumed cross section shape of the channel channel width channel roughness dem resolution streamflow input and exclusion of hydraulic structures bales and wagner 2009 merwade et al 2008 papaioannou et al 2017 pappenberger et al 2006 among these sources uncertainty in cross sectional shape channel width model parameter and streamflow input are considered in this study it is acknowledged that topography plays an important role in hydraulic modeling but its impact varies depending on the data source and quality fernandez et al 2016 the u s national elevation dataset ned dem used in this study is derived from lidar with relatively higher accuracy so it is excluded from this study uncertainty arising from hydraulic structures such as bridges culverts is also excluded due to the lack of detailed data at the stream network scale the uncertainty in streamflow estimates at usgs gaging stations can be as high as 10 for stable natural channels harmel et al 2006 slade 2004 thus three streamflow estimates including 0 9q q and 1 1q are used hydraulic models require the description of channel banks to separate the floodplain from the main channel in lisflood fp this is typically done by specifying the channel width along the centerline generally the channel banks or width data are obtained based on aerial images captured during non flooding conditions this process adds substantial uncertainty in estimating the channel width depending on the time of the year when the aerial images are captured and the number of locations used in getting the average channel width the uncertainty in channel width is incorporated by creating a distribution of channel widths from manually digitized banks and cross sections for four major rivers in the black river watershed and then picking the 5 mean and 95 values from this distribution table 2 both channel and floodplain roughness play an important role in the hydrodynamic simulations but it is assumed that the floodplain roughness in this study which is derived from the land use data is less uncertain compared to the channel roughness a recent study by liu et al 2018 also found the channel roughness to affect the inundation extent more than the channel roughness hence only the uncertainty from channel roughness is included in this study the uncertainty in channel roughness manning s n value is incorporated by selecting three values ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 this range is selected based on previous studies horritt 2006 yu et al 2013 2015 to reflect the roughness of most natural channels characterized from a clean straight channel to a winding grassy and graveled channel finally the uncertainty in cross sectional shape is incorporated by assuming three shapes namely triangular parabola and rectangle considering the aforementioned four uncertainty sources and three varied types for each source 81 3 3 3 3 lisflood fp model configurations are created by using different combinations of these uncertainty sources table 3 3 5 evaluation of bma prediction in training and validation periods two types of bma predictions are considered in this study in the first type named bma station bma s the simulation outputs are trained with the observed water stage data at each station separately to obtain the corresponding weights for model members specifically the bma weights are determined by maximizing the likelihood function eq 7 over time for each location separately only considering the temporal component thus one set of weights is derived separately for each of the four validation stations in the second type named bma global bma g the bma weights are determined by maximizing the likelihood function by including simulation and observed data from all four validation stations to give one set of weights considering the spatial temporal components to validate the bma predictive ability the bma s and bma g weights are applied to model simulation outputs of another flood event and the predictions are evaluated with the observed flood stage in addition bma predictions are also compared with an ensemble mean prediction for each station and the root mean square error values of the water stage eq 11 are calculated and ranked for each bma model prediction and the ensemble mean prediction besides water stage flood inundation extent is also compared with observed data using f and c indices eqs 12 and 13 horritt and bates 2001 sangwan and merwade 2015 finally a probabilistic flood map is created by applying the bma g weights to each raster grid cell eq 14 based on ensemble flood inundation extent predictions the result is compared with the probabilistic flood map derived from the ensemble mean prediction eq 15 in which all models have equal weights these two types of probabilistic flood inundation extents are also evaluated using f and c indices 11 rmse i 1 n y i y obs 2 n 12 f a om a o a m a om 13 c a om a o 14 prob b m a g i 1 k w i 1 15 prob ensemblemean k n where yi stands for model predicted water stage yobs is the observed water stage n is the total number of model configurations k is the number of model configurations that predict the cell is flooded and wi is the weight for model i aom refers to area that is both observed and simulated as inundation ao refers to the observed area of inundation am is the model simulated flood inundation area f and c indices stand for fit and correctness respectively and range from 0 worst to 1 best 4 results and discussion 4 1 convergence of expectation maximization iterations and final model weights the four indicators of the expectation maximization algorithm including the maximum absolute change of weight maximum absolute change of logarithmic variance maximum absolute change of latent variable z and maximum absolute change of logarithmic likelihood converge after about 200 iterations fig 2 the convergence time for both station based weights and global weights is comparable although global based calculations required a few more iterations the bma s and bma g weights for each model member in the ensemble at iteration convergence are shown in fig 3 the model configurations x axis in fig 3 are described in table 4 fig 3 is a stacked bar plot and it shows that several model implementations give their best predictions with higher weights for each validation station in some cases a specific model implementation may obtain a vary high weight above 0 5 compared with other model implementations at one specific validation station this indicates that this specific model implementation may mostly fit for the real condition with respect to channel geometry roughness and input forcing along the rivers comparatively global data assigns relatively evenly distributed weights to all the model configurations and no one model could acquire a very high weight bma s weights vary across the basin and one set of weights obtained from one station may not be suitable and used to find out the bma predictions for another station whereas bma g weights could be applied to predictions for the entire basin consistently including the ungauged locations fig 3 also shows that the first 40 configurations which use lower channel width have lower weights compared to the next 40 this means that selection of proper channel width is crucial and a smaller channel width will produce less accurate results in lisflood fp lisflood fp relates the channel width with channel depth in general a wider channel also results in a deeper cross section when 5 threshold low channel width value is used the channel cross sectional area is significantly underestimated thus affecting the flood inundation depth and extent 4 2 validation of bma prediction performance overall the water stage range in fig 4 provided by the model ensemble predictions at four stations includes the observed water stage ensemble mean prediction as well as bma predictions the bma s performs the best followed by bma g and ensemble mean predictions in the validation period when the same weights derived from the training period are used in fig 4b and c the simulations from the model ensemble overestimate water levels when compared with observation data at low flow condition this indicates that assuming a high flow input forcing might cause prediction bias before and after the flood peaks additionally fig 4 also points out that the quality of dem from ned that is derived from lidar could satisfy the requirement of this study and it won t cause huge bias for the predicted water stages the difference in the performance of these models is more visible in the plot of water stage rmse in fig 5 additionally the difference of rmses between these predictions varies from station to station fig 5a and fig 5c show that ensemble mean predictions in these two stations are closer to bma predictions this is because the observation data is generally in the middle of the prediction ensemble which can be found in fig 4 besides bma for these two validation stations ensemble mean can also produce desirable output however in other cases as shown in fig 5b and d observed water stage data is closer to the upper or lower bound of the prediction ensemble for these two cases bma predictions are still among those best predictions whereas ensemble mean predictions are much worse comparing with bma s bma g performance is slightly worse for each specific station and this is because bma g weights consider a wider spatial range of training data from different stations when predictions for locations other than those four validation stations needed bma g is trustworthy bma g is especially useful for those data sparse watersheds where there is not enough training data for all the locations interested as shown in fig 5 bma s may not outperform all the models in the ensemble however without knowing which model implementation will yield better outcome beforehand it is good to use bma s and bma g predictions instead of trusting only one specific model implementation or the ensemble mean prediction this is because one model may perform well for one flood event in the training period but may not perform equally well for another in order to test the impact of temporal scale a shortened period 40 days around the flood peak is used for training however bma prediction still has its advantage and performs better compared with most of the model member predictions therefore to some extent the temporal scale may affect the results but not to change the conclusions moreover the weight obtained from one station is also used as global weights to test how it works at other locations one test done by applying the bma weight trained from usgs 07 072 000 to usgs 07 069 500 from validation station on eleven point river to validation station on spring river indicates that the bma performance becomes worse more biased compared with the observations it overestimates the water level about 0 5 m over the validation period on average whereas it behaves very well when the weights obtained from usgs 07 069 500 itself is used fig 4a this also points out that the spatial dependency for this study area is not very strong additionally the bma s and bma g were not compared with the single calibrated deterministic prediction in this study dechant and moradkhani 2011 thiboult et al 2016 as the calibrated model may not be the correct model due to equifinality 4 3 comparison of probabilistic flood maps based on bma g and ensemble mean the probabilistic flood map obtained from the bma and ensemble mean is shown in fig 6 for an area where satellite image derived observed inundation extent exists although both bma and ensemble mean derived flood inundation cover the same area the probability of flooding predicted by these two methods is different especially for the areas with high probability of flooding by assigning bma g weights to all model configurations the probability of flooding is higher for the upper right region in fig 6b compared with the ensemble mean probabilistic flood map since the upper right part is observed to be flooded black outline the higher probability as shown by the bma g probabilistic flood map is more reliable compared to the ensemble mean prediction fig 7 evaluates the performances of these two types of probabilistic flood maps with observed flood extent by calculating f and c indices specifically the predicted flood extents from raster grids in which flooding probability are greater than certain thresholds are evaluated with observed inundation extent respectively it indicates that the bma g probabilistic flood map has better performance than ensemble mean based approach when higher thresholds are selected chance of flood is greater than 60 for evaluation as the threshold level decreases below 60 there is no significant difference between these two approaches this is caused by the difference in model behaviors in the ensemble considering that the observed flood region is captured by some of the models in the ensemble while missed by others bma picks better performing models capturing the flood to assign higher weights accordingly this produces higher chance of flood in this region on the contrary the ensemble mean method assigns equal weights to all the models which reduces the probability of flooding in the region 4 4 evaluation of uncertainty associated with bma deterministic prediction fig 8 shows the 95 confidence intervals of bma deterministic water stage predictions the bandwidth space between upper interval and lower interval reflects uncertainty of the deterministic prediction and it is the mean width across all time steps except warm up period the difference of bandwidths for bma s predictions among stations is caused by the different variances σ k 2 and weights wk associated with each model member varying significantly across stations fig 8a and b show that the bma prediction uncertainty of these two stations are less than the other stations one reason is that these two validation stations 8a and 8b are closer to the flow station upstream table 5 additionally the change of width along these two reaches 8a and 8b is not as significant as the other reaches 8c and 8d table 5 thus the model configurations have relatively less variance on the bma simulation output for these two stations 8a and 8b comparatively bma g prediction bands have the same width across the four stations since the same variances and weights are applied to the model ensemble moreover fig 8c and 8d indicate that though bma s deterministic water stage prediction has better performance than bma g prediction the uncertainty bounds associated with bma s prediction could be higher 5 conclusion mitigating and managing flood risk depends on reliable prediction of flood inundation and water stage considering a wide range of epistemic uncertainty sources associated with the flood inundation modeling it is important to understand the combined effects of these uncertainties on the prediction of flood inundation extents instead of trusting prediction from only one specific model implementation the ensemble prediction trajectories are generated in this study by considering the uncertainty from channel width channel cross section shape roughness and bias in flow input data the bayesian model averaging approach is applied as the multi model combing method to provide a deterministic prediction as well as its associated prediction uncertainty bounds two types of bma bma s and bma g predicted deterministic water stages are evaluated with observed water stage data at four usgs validation stations and compared with ensemble mean prediction in addition bma g based probabilistic flood map is created and compared with the ensemble mean based probabilistic inundation extent uncertainty associated with the bma deterministic prediction is also investigated the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 although bma deterministic prediction may not always outperform all the model members in the ensemble this approach is able to provide a relatively robust water stage prediction at each validation station thus the bma approach can be used as the multi model combining method for the ensemble flood inundation modeling 2 typically bma s deterministic prediction behaves better than most of the member predictions in the ensemble additionally bma s has better prediction than bma g which is better or at least similar to ensemble mean prediction 3 in spite of bma g prediction is not as good as bma s by considering a wider spatial range of training data from different stations it could provide relatively reliable and robust prediction for an ungauged location in the watershed therefore bma g is especially useful for those data sparse watersheds where the training data of the interested locations is insufficient comparatively applying the weights obtained from one station in the training period as global weights to another validation station usually yields poorer result than adopting the weights derived from bma g additionally in general models implementing 5 low channel width perform poorer due to the underestimation of channel cross sectional areas 4 in terms of probabilistic flood inundation extents bma g has better performance than ensemble mean prediction for high chance flood regions at black river watershed on the other hand there is no significant difference between two types of probabilistic flood maps for low chance flood regions 5 the uncertainty bands of prediction based on 95 confidence intervals vary from location to location for bma s prediction this reflects the change of weights and variances associated with the normal distribution for models at different locations at usgs 07 069 500 and usgs 07072000 the bandwidths of confidence interval are relatively narrower this is because these stations are closer to the upstream flow input stations and it results in less variance from different model implementations whereas the bandwidths are the same for bma g prediction at all validation stations since the weights and variances associated with the normal distribution for models remain unchanged across the basin despite bma s deterministic prediction typically performing better than bma g the uncertainty associated with bma s might be higher the overall goal of this study was to use the bma method for quantifying the combined uncertainty from different sources in flood inundation modeling to create a reliable prediction from model ensembles additionally this study sets the stage for the next phase where the hierarchical bma can be used to quantify the relative contribution from each uncertainty source while the results show that the bma method is appropriate for providing robust predictions from an ensemble of model results incorporating multiple uncertainty sources the methodology used in this study has some limitations that merit attention first this study assumed that the flow depths are independent in time and space although the data are strongly correlated in time the correlation in the prediction errors is relatively smaller while this may not change the findings of this study it would be good to investigate the relative performance of the bma methodology when the temporal dependence is taken into consideration limitations related to the assumption of normally distributed predictive pdfs of transformed data and the adoption of local optimization technique e g expectation maximization have also been mentioned in other studies madadgar and moradkhani 2014 parrish et al 2012 vrugt and robinson 2007 although expectation maximization algorithm is suggested to find out the solution for the log likelihood function it is a local optimization approach the normal distribution is only valid for limited variables such as sea level pressure and temperature but other variables e g streamflow used in this study needs to be transformed to the normal space before bma is applied raftery et al 2005 although the box cox transformation can adjust the skewness of the data the pdf still remains bounded this is especially true for this study since as the same transformation power λ is used for all the simulations in the ensemble and observation data for each validation station this may have slightly affect the pdf of the transformed data a different transformation power could be used when individual simulation is considered for analysis to take this into account in future studies sequential data assimilation could be incorporated into bma to release the gaussian assumption of the likelihood function parrish et al 2012 also a group of copula functions could be integrated with bma to estimate the posterior distribution of model forecast which removes the normal distribution assumption of prediction data as well as the transformation process madadgar and moradkhani 2014 acknowledgement this work was performed with funding from the u s national science foundation aci

6994,changing climate especially extreme weather event is exerting considerable impacts on the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in forests worldwide a deep understanding of climate change terrestrial feedbacks is essential to predict future regional global carbon and water budgets which can be used to develop potential strategies for forest management in this study totally 11 years of eddy covariance tower measurements of co2 and h2o fluxes as well as the relevant environmental variables were analyzed to reveal the effects of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology carbon sequestration and ecosystem water use efficiency wue dynamics in a humid temperate deciduous forest warmer spring temperatures altered the phenological phases with the green up date advanced approximately 3 5 days per c and the extended growing season of about 3 days per c reaching the peak in 2012 because of spring temperature anomaly the shift from carbon source to sink occurred nearly 40 days earlier than usual but the abnormal carbon dynamics happened during the peak growth period correlation analyses indicated that the amount of precipitation dominantly controlled the capacity of forest carbon sequestration nep in this area therefore the subsequent water scarcity owing to the extremely dry summer together with heatwave severely decreased the forest nep by about 64 1 further analyses implied that the sharp reduction in gross primary production gpp rather than ecosystem respiration re resulted to the decrease in nep both gpp and evatranspiration et were larger during the springtime in 2012 than those at adjacent years but severe summer drought reduced the ecosystem wue and yielded the lowest gpp and et further work must focus on improving the recognition of forest feedback to climate systems keywords extreme weather events forest carbon fixation water use efficiency 1 introduction global climate change has significantly affected ecosystem functions and processes including tightly coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycles mu et al 2011 keenan et al 2013 yang et al 2015 the potential consequences resulting from climate anomalies particularly extreme weather events such as floods droughts and heatwaves were considered more severe ipcc 2007 2012 tang et al 2017 drought is generally defined as a prolonged period of months or years when precipitation is apparently less than the multi year average resulting in water scarcity for ecosystem health and food security thenkabail et al 2012 wilhite 2016 in addition drought is a natural disaster that causes the most severe economic and social losses carrao et al 2016 the frequency and intensity of droughts have increased across a wide range of spatial scales in recent decades trumbore et al 2015 thus understanding the responses of forest ecosystem to climate extremes is critical considering that future drought will become more intense than those experienced in the past century vegetation phenology which directly impacts the dynamic balance of terrestrial carbon budget and exerts feedbacks to climate system is receiving more and more attention in recent years richardson et al 2013 studies on vegetation phenology are vital in understanding the changing trend of natural seasonal phenomena and can serve as guide for global agricultural production and ecological change olmstead and rhode 2011 yu et al 2017 in addition changes in vegetation phenology are key indicators of the response of terrestrial biosphere to climate change through variability in the carbon water and energy cycles tang et al 2014 morison et al 2015 phenological information including the start and end dates of the vegetation growing season sos and eos is crucial to evaluate ecosystem responses to climate change because of its high sensitivity to climate particularly temperature and extensive influence on ecological processes forrest and miller rushing 2010 anwar et al 2015 cong et al 2017 zaitchik et al 2006 proposed that an early green up in spring 2003 could be due to anomalous warm temperatures and recent studies revealed the eos delay greatly contributed extension of the growing season wu et al 2013 garonna et al 2016 nonetheless the effects of climatic anomalies considerably vary because of various forest communities under different climate zones carbon sequestration of forests is severely affected by interannual variation in climate factors and the magnitude could be sharply reduced by extreme weather events and human disturbances ciais et al 2005 niu et al 2011a tang et al 2017 thus understanding the responses of net ecosystem co2 exchange nee to such events is central to clarify the climatic anomaly carbon cycle feebacks and determine the underlying processes and mechanisms across forests in addition to the unpredictability of climate change plenty of uncertainties existed regarding the future trend and strength of terrestrial carbon sink reichstein et al 2013 sitch et al 2015 mystakidis et al 2016 it is mainly dominated by high interannual variability in both ecosystem gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration re components facing climate change at regional to global scales ahlstrom et al 2015 mekonnen et al 2017 many attempts have to be made for exploring the interactions between climate extremes and temperate or boreal forests as the most likely explanation of the missing carbon sink on earth water use efficiency wue refers to the amount of carbon gained per unit of water consumed in terrestrial ecosystems understanding its dynamics and the associated environmental controls is essential for tracking ecosystem responses to future climate changes niu et al 2011b tang et al 2014 huang et al 2015 meanwhile ecosystem wue provides information on biological and physical processes of ecosystems which can enhance our ability to understand the interactions between ecosystem productivity and water availability beer et al 2009 he et al 2017 given the warming associated acceleration of terrestrial water cycle trenberth and asrar 2014 monitoring and evaluating the changes in ecosystem wue under varied hydroclimatic conditions are crucial for understanding the response of ecosystem functions e g sensitivity adaption and resilience to climate change particularly extreme weather condition zhou et al 2017 actually all these ecosystem functions are closely related to the climatic change whereas few attempts have been made to disclose the interactions among them in depth once the climatic anomalies happened it would directly affect the vegetation phenology then the changed photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration will obviously alter the carbon sequestration capacity in conjunction with ecosystem water use efficiency therefore 11 years of flux tower measurements of carbon and water exchanges and the relevant environmental variables at a temperate deciduous forest were analyzed in this study the work addressed to i examine the impact of spring temperature anomaly on vegetation phenology including sos and the length of the growing season los ii reveal the interannual and seasonal variabilities in nee and its component fluxes gpp and re during the periods of varied climate anomalies and iii identify the responses of ecosystem wue to such events encompassing warm spring and extremely dry summer all analyses will expand our understanding and predictions of the effects of global climate change on ecosystem functions and processes 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description the flux site us

presented in the study of gu et al 2015 2 2 flux data processing at present long term measurements of co2 and water vapor fluxes were conducted through eddy covariance ec technique across varied ecosystems on earth for quantitative and direct evaluation of the potential impacts of climate anomalies on terrestrial carbon dynamics goulden et al 1996 law et al 2002 as a member of the ameriflux network the site has been operational since 2004 flux data and meteorological observations were collected continuously up to 2015 from a 32 m walkup scaffold tower located at approximately 10 m above the top canopy a total of 11 years of flux measurements from 2005 to 2015 were used for analysis because of the incomplete data in 2004 co2 and water fluxes were recorded using an ec system consisting of a 3d ultrasonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific logan ut usa and a fast response open path infrared co2 h2o gas analyzer li7500a li cor lincoln ne usa the anemometer and gas analyzer were installed on the top of the tower and all sampled at 10 hz the eddy fluxes were processed at a half hourly time scale a series of software programs were used for post processing analysis data collection and regular calibrations of the tower based flux measurements were completed as described by ruehr et al 2012 the data were quality checked and data gaps due to system failure or data rejection were gap filled using standardized methods papale et al 2006 tang et al 2017 to obtain complete and standardized data sets the measured nee data were partitioned into its two components namely gpp and re through nonlinear regressions with air soil temperature desai et al 2008 in this study the night time based flux partitioning algorithm proposed by reichstein et al 2005 was applied for separation this method derives a short term temperature response of re from the eddy covariance data based on the lloyd and taylor 1994 regression model and then applies this relationship to the extrapolation from night time to daytime re performance of the partitioning methodology was assessed by stoy et al 2006 eventually this algorithm yields less biased estimates of gpp and re papale et al 2006 tang et al 2015 the missing values can be gap filled because of the covariance between flux measurements and meteorological driving factors all of these works including gap filling and flux partitioning are completed using the r based package proposed by the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgc jena mpg de reddyproc brew reddyproc rhtml ecosystem wue is generally defined as the ratio of gpp to et beer et al 2009 niu et al 2011b we used the daily wue g co2 kg 1 h2o to denote the seasonal dynamics of forest response to climate change given active photosynthetic activity occurred only for days during the growing season we applied a filter to exclude daily gpp and et values when mean daily latent heat flux le 20 w m2 global radiation rg 150 w m2 and mean air

weight of water with 2454000 j kg 1 tang et al 2014 2017 2 3 vegetation phenology from modis data the primary data source used to extract the key vegetation phenological information is the enhanced vegetation index evi which we calculate using the site level data from the modis brdf albedo product schaaf et al 2002 in particular the nadir brdf adjusted reflectance daily l3 data mcd43a4 v006 has experienced view angle effects removed and both cloud and aerosol contamination minimized the mcd43a4 product provides the reflectance of modis bands 1 7 adjusted at a spatial resolution of 500 m by using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function to model the values from the nadir view https modis ornl gov the red near infrared and blue bands were used to compute evi huete et al 2002 as follows evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ r ρ nir 6 ρ r 7 5 ρ b 1 where ρ nir ρ r and ρ b are the spectral reflectance in modis bands 2 1 and 3 respectively time series evi data must be preprocessed to extract vegetation phenology because they include gaps due to clouds and are inherently noisy in this regard the missing data were replaced using a moving window average based on the nearest available data i e linear interpolation for a single growth or senescence cycle the evi data were fitted using sigmoid functions of time whereas the phenological transition dates were identified based on the curvature change rate ccr of the fitted logistic models at each pixel this method characterizes key phenological phases by using four transition dates two of which are of interest in the present study namely 1 green up the date of onset of evi increase and 2 dormancy the date of onset of evi minimum we used sos eos and los to represent the start end and length of the growing season d odorico et al 2015 respectively specifically the transition dates correspond to the time when the ccr exhibits a local minima or maxima during sos the maximum ccr value corresponds to the onset of greenness increase whereas during eos the maximum ccr value represents the end of greenness decrease fig 1 showed the schematic diagram of how vegetation phenological information extracted from time series evi data in 2014 to reveal the effects of climate anomaly on vegetation phenology at the temperate forest site 11 years of time series modis evi data from 2005 to 2015 were computed for obtaining the key phenological information including sos eos and los 3 results 3 1 identification of climatic anomalies during the 11 year measurement period at the humid temperate forest site the multi year mean annual temperature and precipitation were 12 11 c and 986 mm respectively by contrast fig 2 a revealed that an extremely dry year 2012 occurred with the highest temperature of 15 57 c and the fewest amount of precipitation approximately 563 mm in total highlighting the severity of the extreme weather events meanwhile more details about the climatic anomaly during 2012 were compared with the other years on the basis of 8 day mean temperature and precipitation the amounts of precipitation in summer 2012 over many 8 day periods were close and even beyond to the normal lower limit of multi year mean values fig 2b implied the extremely dry 2012 was mainly ascribed to the coincidence of summer heatwave and drought almost no rainfall around the period of doy 123 and 242 moreover the seasonal anomaly of spring temperature doy 22 and 96 is apparently higher than the multi year mean value between 2005 and 2015 fig 2b implied that most 8 day mean temperature values during springtime 2012 were beyond the extent of 1 standard error 3 2 impact of spring temperature anomaly on phenology climate changes particularly temperature anomaly in springtime generally control the shifts in the vegetation phenology and the annual carbon uptake period therefore changes in phenological phases including sos and los are crucial to understand terrestrial carbon sequestration in this study linear regression was performed to evaluate the potential influence of spring temperature anomaly on vegetation phenology based on the 11 year measurement fig 3 a revealed a strong negative correlation between sos and springtime ta in spite that the p value is significant at 0 1 level the regression analysis implied that sos can be advanced by approximately 3 5 days per c with increasing ta in a certain extent thus the high temperature in springtime stimulated the early green up of plants los was strongly and positively correlated to springtime ta the period of los was elongated with about 3 days per c and reached the peak in 2012 the correlation coefficients of sos and los with spring temperature were 0 51 and 0 52 respectively fig 3c showed a markedly strong negative correlation between sos and los during the 11 years measurements the linear regression is significant at 0 05 level p value therefore the earlier sos the longer los 3 3 response of carbon fluxes to climate anomalies the seasonal dynamics of daily nee in the humid temperate forest during 2005 2015 were depicted in fig 4 which exhibited a typical v like curve over these years in the summertime the forest site generally acted as a strong carbon sink for the benefit of carbon cycle but released co2 from the biosphere to the atmosphere during the non growing season moreover the multi year mean daily nee variations in fig 4 made the trend more characteristic by contrast the starting date of the carbon sink in 2012 was advanced by nearly 40 days owing to springtime temperature anomaly the growing season of 2012 started at doy 52 with the carbon offset at about doy 97 nevertheless the forest changed from carbon sink to source at approximately doy 180 during the peak growing season the abnormal dynamics in nee can be explained by the extremely dry summer in 2012 which increasingly aggravated the water scarcity around this period fig 5 confirmed that nee of the 2012 summer was the weakest among the 11 years overall the annual mean nee in 2012 performed as a weak carbon sink with about 0 28 g co2 m 2 d 1 in comparison with the multi year mean value of 0 78 g co2 m 2 d 1 therefore the severe summer drought significantly reduced the forest carbon sequestration capacity fig 6 further explained the nee dynamics during the periods of spring temperature anomaly and summer drought in 2012 from the perspective of gpp and re components interestingly both gpp and re co varied with a consistent tendency and the annual mean values hit bottom in 2012 as illustrated in fig 5 the weakest nee during the 2012 summer drought was mainly dominated by the sharp reduction in gpp rather than re the multi year mean gpp and re during this period of 2005 to 2015 were 8 78 g co2 m 2 d 1 and 5 56 g co2 m 2 d 1 respectively in spite of 5 15 g co2 m 2 d 1 and 3 33 g co2 m 2 d 1 in 2012 summer influenced by the spring temperature anomaly in 2012 the gpp displayed a smaller increase compared with that in the other years by contrast the re was markedly increased making the nee value reach its peak in the springtime of 2012 3 4 potential effects on ecosystem wue fig 5 showed that the carbon sequestration capacity was strong before the extremely dry 2012 with 3 16 g co2 m 2 d 1 and recovered quickly after this event with 3 73 g co2 m 2 d 1 where the nee was 1 82 g co2 m 2 d 1 in 2012 as an important linkage between terrestrial carbon and water cycles the effects of ecosystem wue to such climate anomalies remained unclear in the temperate forest site thus daily dynamics of gpp et and ecosystem wue among the three years were depicted to exhibit how they responded to the spring temperature anomaly and summer drought in 2012 fig 7 in particular owing to the earlier sos in 2012 both gpp and et were apparently higher than those in the adjacent years 2011 and 2013 table 1 meanwhile the forest maintained a strong ecosystem wue in the period but during the peak growing season summer the long term water scarcity sharply decreased ecosystem wue resulting in the lowest gpp and et during the dry period in 2012 gpp decreased by 34 1 in comparison with 2011 whereas et had a slighter reduction with 28 1 therefore such event reduced gpp more than et which led to the decreased wue large variability in gpp et and ecosystem wue during the three years implied the strong inherent resilience of the region against climate change 4 discussion 4 1 climate change and vegetation phenology climate change and vegetation phenology generally regulated the variation in annual nee which indicated that thermal conditions at the onset of the growing season were critical for triggering the emergence of leaves ma et al 2007 marcolla et al 2011 and much more important than water status in determining the carbon assimilation capacity of the ecosystem groendahl et al 2007 barichivich et al 2013 the responses of vegetation phenology to climate extremes however are complicated with varied magnitude along climatic gradients and among biomes ma et al 2015 several studies reported that early green up could increase photosynthesis more than respiration among high latitude biomes in the northern hemisphere kato et al 2006 piao et al 2011 however this study found that at the humid temperate forest site re increased more than gpp during the springtime fig 6 and acted as a stronger carbon source in this period fig 5 numerous studies have documented advances in the timing of spring onset in temperate vegetation areas across the northern hemisphere schwartz et al 2006 monahan et al 2016 these trends are unequivocally attributed to spring warming combined with the advances in spring onset the delays in autumn senescence have extended the growing season length in eurasian and north american temperate forests over the past years menzel et al 2008 jeong et al 2011 liu et al 2016 the continuing trends of rising air temperatures in temperate region suggest increasingly earlier spring leaf out which is potentially tempered by photoperiod or chilling requirements in certain species delayed senescence and consequently longer growing period the study also implied that sos was strongly and negatively correlated to los which meant that the earlier sos the longer los fig 3c in spite that terrestrial ecosystems generally have recurrent phenological cycles driven predominantly by temperature variability vegetation growth can be nearly completely inhibited under the extreme drought in spring ma et al 2015 but when the favorable period arrived vegetation maintained the ability to recover and grow 4 2 climate controls on forest carbon sequestration amplification of the hydrological cycle as a consequence of global climate warming increases the frequency intensity and spatial extent of extreme climate events globally sheffield and wood 2008 the effects of such events on ecosystem functions particularly on terrestrial carbon budget remain largely uncertain barr et al 2007 found that when a boreal aspen forest received adequate precipitation the annual gpp was largely controlled by how long the deciduous canopy had leaves as this governed the amount of solar radiation that was intercepted however the photosynthetic light use efficiency was diminished under drought conditions although the canopy s capacity for light interception was unchanged gitelson et al 2015 the potential carbon sequestration of a forest can be influenced by a range of climatic variables such as energy and water through their impacts on gpp and re wilhite 2016 the responses to drought of annual nee and its components might spatially and temporally change depending on the severity continuation and timing of the droughts mitchell et al 2015 schlesinger et al 2016 generally gpp is majorly affected by droughts during the growing season whereas re could be influenced by droughts occurring throughout all seasons although drought is generally associated with declines in forest carbon sequestration due to water and heat stresses on ecosystem metabolism eamus et al 2013 the magnitude of reduction which is determined by ecosystem sensitivity to drought varies dramatically across or even within biomes knapp et al 2015 our current knowledge on these responses remains limited a comprehensive understanding of the factors that determine the variations in sensitivity to drought across terrestrial biomes is crucial linear regression was used to examine the environmental controls on the carbon sequestration potential at the humid temperate deciduous forest fig 8 the relationships were analyzed at three periods namely the spring temperature anomaly sta and extremely dry summer edp in 2012 and the annual time scale over the 11 years of measurements the study found that 1 all climate factors including solar radiation rg air temperature ta soil temperature ts vapor pressure deficit vpd and natural precipitation p performed consistent trends during edp and annual periods which indicated that the growing season acted as the most important role around the year for a ecosystem 2 with the increases in rg ta and ts and vpd across the three periods the capacity of carbon sequestration weakened implying that they were not the dominant factors in the region 3 only p exhibited distinctly different correlations during the sta and edp periods more rainfall in springtime led to a slight decrease in nep whereas the nep was positively correlated with p during the summertime this finding again demonstrated that the amount of rainfall dominantly controlled the carbon fixation capacity therefore in summer 2012 not only the heatwave but also the drought exerted extremely adverse effects on the humid temperate deciduous forest 4 3 responses of ecosystem wue to climate factors previous studies showed that the cumulative effect of the spring temperature was the principal limiting factor in breaking plant dormancy leaf phenological development and subsequent plant growth kato et al 2006 marcolla et al 2011 shen et al 2015 the strong correlations between gpp ta and ts during the spring temperature anomaly reached up to 0 64 and 0 66 respectively table 2 meanwhile the water loss et exhibited a much stronger relationship with ta and ts nevertheless during the peak growing season the high ta and ts turned into a negative controlling factor for gpp and et but natural rainfall p was positively and strongly correlated to gpp and et with coefficients of 0 63 and 0 88 respectively it implied that both gpp and et would suffer from the constraints of water scarcity in spite that wue did not decrease significantly as the ratio of gpp to et on the annual time scale 1 75 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2011 vs 1 70 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2012 but the heatwave in summer 2012 further amplified the effect of drought on forest gpp and et and led to the decreased wue 2 39 g co2 kg 1 h2o compared with the adjacent years during the extreme dry period 2 90 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2011 and 3 17 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2013 dynamics in ecosystem wue were affected by a series of variables including co2 levels keenan et al 2013 water vapor pressure deficit yang et al 2010 mitchell et al 2015 solar radiation rocha et al 2004 gitelson et al 2015 and human induced disturbances magnani et al 2007 tang et al 2017 the dominant controls varied among sites and across scales the response of an ecosystem s wue to climate anomalies remain a difficult challenge and more studies are needed to set up the common principles that govern it 5 conclusions in spite that the ec based measurements of co2 and h2o fluxes at the humid temperate forest only had 11 years of data and the flux partitioning method for gpp and re components owned plenty of uncertainties this study revealed that climate extremes have exerted dramatic impacts on vegetation phenology carbon sequestration and ecosystem wue the main findings were summarized as follows 1 green up dates were advanced with the increase in spring temperature approximately 3 5 days per c in sos meanwhile the growing season los elongated apparently with about 3 days per c and reached the peak at 2012 2 the shift of carbon source to sink in 2012 advanced by nearly 40 days owing to springtime temperature anomaly however the extremely dry summer severely reduced forest carbon sequestration capacity from 0 78 g co2 m 2 d 1 to 0 28 g co2 m 2 d 1 further analyses implied that the weakest nep was mainly dominated by the sharp reduction in gpp rather than re 3 in view of earlier sos in 2012 both gpp and et were apparently higher than those during the adjacent years but prolonged summer drought sharply decreased the ecosystem wue resulting in the fewest gpp and et 4 in this area the amount of precipitation dominantly controlled the capacity of forest carbon sequestration the heatwave together with summer drought exerted extremely adverse effects in 2012 all of these findings provide important implications for developing forest

6994,changing climate especially extreme weather event is exerting considerable impacts on the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in forests worldwide a deep understanding of climate change terrestrial feedbacks is essential to predict future regional global carbon and water budgets which can be used to develop potential strategies for forest management in this study totally 11 years of eddy covariance tower measurements of co2 and h2o fluxes as well as the relevant environmental variables were analyzed to reveal the effects of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology carbon sequestration and ecosystem water use efficiency wue dynamics in a humid temperate deciduous forest warmer spring temperatures altered the phenological phases with the green up date advanced approximately 3 5 days per c and the extended growing season of about 3 days per c reaching the peak in 2012 because of spring temperature anomaly the shift from carbon source to sink occurred nearly 40 days earlier than usual but the abnormal carbon dynamics happened during the peak growth period correlation analyses indicated that the amount of precipitation dominantly controlled the capacity of forest carbon sequestration nep in this area therefore the subsequent water scarcity owing to the extremely dry summer together with heatwave severely decreased the forest nep by about 64 1 further analyses implied that the sharp reduction in gross primary production gpp rather than ecosystem respiration re resulted to the decrease in nep both gpp and evatranspiration et were larger during the springtime in 2012 than those at adjacent years but severe summer drought reduced the ecosystem wue and yielded the lowest gpp and et further work must focus on improving the recognition of forest feedback to climate systems keywords extreme weather events forest carbon fixation water use efficiency 1 introduction global climate change has significantly affected ecosystem functions and processes including tightly coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycles mu et al 2011 keenan et al 2013 yang et al 2015 the potential consequences resulting from climate anomalies particularly extreme weather events such as floods droughts and heatwaves were considered more severe ipcc 2007 2012 tang et al 2017 drought is generally defined as a prolonged period of months or years when precipitation is apparently less than the multi year average resulting in water scarcity for ecosystem health and food security thenkabail et al 2012 wilhite 2016 in addition drought is a natural disaster that causes the most severe economic and social losses carrao et al 2016 the frequency and intensity of droughts have increased across a wide range of spatial scales in recent decades trumbore et al 2015 thus understanding the responses of forest ecosystem to climate extremes is critical considering that future drought will become more intense than those experienced in the past century vegetation phenology which directly impacts the dynamic balance of terrestrial carbon budget and exerts feedbacks to climate system is receiving more and more attention in recent years richardson et al 2013 studies on vegetation phenology are vital in understanding the changing trend of natural seasonal phenomena and can serve as guide for global agricultural production and ecological change olmstead and rhode 2011 yu et al 2017 in addition changes in vegetation phenology are key indicators of the response of terrestrial biosphere to climate change through variability in the carbon water and energy cycles tang et al 2014 morison et al 2015 phenological information including the start and end dates of the vegetation growing season sos and eos is crucial to evaluate ecosystem responses to climate change because of its high sensitivity to climate particularly temperature and extensive influence on ecological processes forrest and miller rushing 2010 anwar et al 2015 cong et al 2017 zaitchik et al 2006 proposed that an early green up in spring 2003 could be due to anomalous warm temperatures and recent studies revealed the eos delay greatly contributed extension of the growing season wu et al 2013 garonna et al 2016 nonetheless the effects of climatic anomalies considerably vary because of various forest communities under different climate zones carbon sequestration of forests is severely affected by interannual variation in climate factors and the magnitude could be sharply reduced by extreme weather events and human disturbances ciais et al 2005 niu et al 2011a tang et al 2017 thus understanding the responses of net ecosystem co2 exchange nee to such events is central to clarify the climatic anomaly carbon cycle feebacks and determine the underlying processes and mechanisms across forests in addition to the unpredictability of climate change plenty of uncertainties existed regarding the future trend and strength of terrestrial carbon sink reichstein et al 2013 sitch et al 2015 mystakidis et al 2016 it is mainly dominated by high interannual variability in both ecosystem gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration re components facing climate change at regional to global scales ahlstrom et al 2015 mekonnen et al 2017 many attempts have to be made for exploring the interactions between climate extremes and temperate or boreal forests as the most likely explanation of the missing carbon sink on earth water use efficiency wue refers to the amount of carbon gained per unit of water consumed in terrestrial ecosystems understanding its dynamics and the associated environmental controls is essential for tracking ecosystem responses to future climate changes niu et al 2011b tang et al 2014 huang et al 2015 meanwhile ecosystem wue provides information on biological and physical processes of ecosystems which can enhance our ability to understand the interactions between ecosystem productivity and water availability beer et al 2009 he et al 2017 given the warming associated acceleration of terrestrial water cycle trenberth and asrar 2014 monitoring and evaluating the changes in ecosystem wue under varied hydroclimatic conditions are crucial for understanding the response of ecosystem functions e g sensitivity adaption and resilience to climate change particularly extreme weather condition zhou et al 2017 actually all these ecosystem functions are closely related to the climatic change whereas few attempts have been made to disclose the interactions among them in depth once the climatic anomalies happened it would directly affect the vegetation phenology then the changed photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration will obviously alter the carbon sequestration capacity in conjunction with ecosystem water use efficiency therefore 11 years of flux tower measurements of carbon and water exchanges and the relevant environmental variables at a temperate deciduous forest were analyzed in this study the work addressed to i examine the impact of spring temperature anomaly on vegetation phenology including sos and the length of the growing season los ii reveal the interannual and seasonal variabilities in nee and its component fluxes gpp and re during the periods of varied climate anomalies and iii identify the responses of ecosystem wue to such events encompassing warm spring and extremely dry summer all analyses will expand our understanding and predictions of the effects of global climate change on ecosystem functions and processes 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description the flux site us

important transitional zone between the central hardwood area and the grassland region of the us the tower is placed in the temperate deciduous forest under the joint support from oak ridge national laboratory and the u s department of energy climate of the area is characterized as warm humid and continental with monthly mean temperature of 1 3 c in january and 25 2 c in july and multi year mean

presented in the study of gu et al 2015 2 2 flux data processing at present long term measurements of co2 and water vapor fluxes were conducted through eddy covariance ec technique across varied ecosystems on earth for quantitative and direct evaluation of the potential impacts of climate anomalies on terrestrial carbon dynamics goulden et al 1996 law et al 2002 as a member of the ameriflux network the site has been operational since 2004 flux data and meteorological observations were collected continuously up to 2015 from a 32 m walkup scaffold tower located at approximately 10 m above the top canopy a total of 11 years of flux measurements from 2005 to 2015 were used for analysis because of the incomplete data in 2004 co2 and water fluxes were recorded using an ec system consisting of a 3d ultrasonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific logan ut usa and a fast response open path infrared co2 h2o gas analyzer li7500a li cor lincoln ne usa the anemometer and gas analyzer were installed on the top of the tower and all sampled at 10 hz the eddy fluxes were processed at a half hourly time scale a series of software programs were used for post processing analysis data collection and regular calibrations of the tower based flux measurements were completed as described by ruehr et al 2012 the data were quality checked and data gaps due to system failure or data rejection were gap filled using standardized methods papale et al 2006 tang et al 2017 to obtain complete and standardized data sets the measured nee data were partitioned into its two components namely gpp and re through nonlinear regressions with air soil temperature desai et al 2008 in this study the night time based flux partitioning algorithm proposed by reichstein et al 2005 was applied for separation this method derives a short term temperature response of re from the eddy covariance data based on the lloyd and taylor 1994 regression model and then applies this relationship to the extrapolation from night time to daytime re performance of the partitioning methodology was assessed by stoy et al 2006 eventually this algorithm yields less biased estimates of gpp and re papale et al 2006 tang et al 2015 the missing values can be gap filled because of the covariance between flux measurements and meteorological driving factors all of these works including gap filling and flux partitioning are completed using the r based package proposed by the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgc jena mpg de reddyproc brew reddyproc rhtml ecosystem wue is generally defined as the ratio of gpp to et beer et al 2009 niu et al 2011b we used the daily wue g co2 kg 1 h2o to denote the seasonal dynamics of forest response to climate change given active photosynthetic activity occurred only for days during the growing season we applied a filter to exclude daily gpp and et values when mean daily latent heat flux le 20 w m2 global radiation rg 150 w m2 and mean air temperature ta 0 c the measured le fluxes were used to calculate water loss et mm d 1 by multiplying a factor of 0 035 which was converted by et le λ where λ is amount of evaporation energy per unit weight of water with 2454000 j kg 1 tang et al 2014 2017 2 3 vegetation phenology from modis data the primary data source used to extract the key vegetation phenological information is the enhanced vegetation index evi which we calculate using the site level data from the modis brdf albedo product schaaf et al 2002 in particular the nadir brdf adjusted reflectance daily l3 data mcd43a4 v006 has experienced view angle effects removed and both cloud and aerosol contamination minimized the mcd43a4 product provides the reflectance of modis bands 1 7 adjusted at a spatial resolution of 500 m by using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function to model the values from the nadir view https modis ornl gov the red near infrared and blue bands were used to compute evi huete et al 2002 as follows evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ r ρ nir 6 ρ r 7 5 ρ b 1 where ρ nir ρ r and ρ b are the spectral reflectance in modis bands 2 1 and 3 respectively time series evi data must be preprocessed to extract vegetation phenology because they include gaps due to clouds and are inherently noisy in this regard the missing data were replaced using a moving window average based on the nearest available data i e linear interpolation for a single growth or senescence cycle the evi data were fitted using sigmoid functions of time whereas the phenological transition dates were identified based on the curvature change rate ccr of the fitted logistic models at each pixel this method characterizes key phenological phases by using four transition dates two of which are of interest in the present study namely 1 green up the date of onset of evi increase and 2 dormancy the date of onset of evi minimum we used sos eos and los to represent the start end and length of the growing season d odorico et al 2015 respectively specifically the transition dates correspond to the time when the ccr exhibits a local minima or maxima during sos the maximum ccr value corresponds to the onset of greenness increase whereas during eos the maximum ccr value represents the end of greenness decrease fig 1 showed the schematic diagram of how vegetation phenological information extracted from time series evi data in 2014 to reveal the effects of climate anomaly on vegetation phenology at the temperate forest site 11 years of time series modis evi data from 2005 to 2015 were computed for obtaining the key phenological information including sos eos and los 3 results 3 1 identification of climatic anomalies during the 11 year measurement period at the humid temperate forest site the multi year mean annual temperature and precipitation were 12 11 c and 986 mm respectively by contrast fig 2 a revealed that an extremely dry year 2012 occurred with the highest temperature of 15 57 c and the fewest amount of precipitation approximately 563 mm in total highlighting the severity of the extreme weather events meanwhile more details about the climatic anomaly during 2012 were compared with the other years on the basis of 8 day mean temperature and precipitation the amounts of precipitation in summer 2012 over many 8 day periods were close and even beyond to the normal lower limit of multi year mean values fig 2b implied the extremely dry 2012 was mainly ascribed to the coincidence of summer heatwave and drought almost no rainfall around the period of doy 123 and 242 moreover the seasonal anomaly of spring temperature doy 22 and 96 is apparently higher than the multi year mean value between 2005 and 2015 fig 2b implied that most 8 day mean temperature values during springtime 2012 were beyond the extent of 1 standard error 3 2 impact of spring temperature anomaly on phenology climate changes particularly temperature anomaly in springtime generally control the shifts in the vegetation phenology and the annual carbon uptake period therefore changes in phenological phases including sos and los are crucial to understand terrestrial carbon sequestration in this study linear regression was performed to evaluate the potential influence of spring temperature anomaly on vegetation phenology based on the 11 year measurement fig 3 a revealed a strong negative correlation between sos and springtime ta in spite that the p value is significant at 0 1 level the regression analysis implied that sos can be advanced by approximately 3 5 days per c with increasing ta in a certain extent thus the high temperature in springtime stimulated the early green up of plants los was strongly and positively correlated to springtime ta the period of los was elongated with about 3 days per c and reached the peak in 2012 the correlation coefficients of sos and los with spring temperature were 0 51 and 0 52 respectively fig 3c showed a markedly strong negative correlation between sos and los during the 11 years measurements the linear regression is significant at 0 05 level p value therefore the earlier sos the longer los 3 3 response of carbon fluxes to climate anomalies the seasonal dynamics of daily nee in the humid temperate forest during 2005 2015 were depicted in fig 4 which exhibited a typical v like curve over these years in the summertime the forest site generally acted as a strong carbon sink for the benefit of carbon cycle but released co2 from the biosphere to the atmosphere during the non growing season moreover the multi year mean daily nee variations in fig 4 made the trend more characteristic by contrast the starting date of the carbon sink in 2012 was advanced by nearly 40 days owing to springtime temperature anomaly the growing season of 2012 started at doy 52 with the carbon offset at about doy 97 nevertheless the forest changed from carbon sink to source at approximately doy 180 during the peak growing season the abnormal dynamics in nee can be explained by the extremely dry summer in 2012 which increasingly aggravated the water scarcity around this period fig 5 confirmed that nee of the 2012 summer was the weakest among the 11 years overall the annual mean nee in 2012 performed as a weak carbon sink with about 0 28 g co2 m 2 d 1 in comparison with the multi year mean value of 0 78 g co2 m 2 d 1 therefore the severe summer drought significantly reduced the forest carbon sequestration capacity fig 6 further explained the nee dynamics during the periods of spring temperature anomaly and summer drought in 2012 from the perspective of gpp and re components interestingly both gpp and re co varied with a consistent tendency and the annual mean values hit bottom in 2012 as illustrated in fig 5 the weakest nee during the 2012 summer drought was mainly dominated by the sharp reduction in gpp rather than re the multi year mean gpp and re during this period of 2005 to 2015 were 8 78 g co2 m 2 d 1 and 5 56 g co2 m 2 d 1 respectively in spite of 5 15 g co2 m 2 d 1 and 3 33 g co2 m 2 d 1 in 2012 summer influenced by the spring temperature anomaly in 2012 the gpp displayed a smaller increase compared with that in the other years by contrast the re was markedly increased making the nee value reach its peak in the springtime of 2012 3 4 potential effects on ecosystem wue fig 5 showed that the carbon sequestration capacity was strong before the extremely dry 2012 with 3 16 g co2 m 2 d 1 and recovered quickly after this event with 3 73 g co2 m 2 d 1 where the nee was 1 82 g co2 m 2 d 1 in 2012 as an important linkage between terrestrial carbon and water cycles the effects of ecosystem wue to such climate anomalies remained unclear in the temperate forest site thus daily dynamics of gpp et and ecosystem wue among the three years were depicted to exhibit how they responded to the spring temperature anomaly and summer drought in 2012 fig 7 in particular owing to the earlier sos in 2012 both gpp and et were apparently higher than those in the adjacent years 2011 and 2013 table 1 meanwhile the forest maintained a strong ecosystem wue in the period but during the peak growing season summer the long term water scarcity sharply decreased ecosystem wue resulting in the lowest gpp and et during the dry period in 2012 gpp decreased by 34 1 in comparison with 2011 whereas et had a slighter reduction with 28 1 therefore such event reduced gpp more than et which led to the decreased wue large variability in gpp et and ecosystem wue during the three years implied the strong inherent resilience of the region against climate change 4 discussion 4 1 climate change and vegetation phenology climate change and vegetation phenology generally regulated the variation in annual nee which indicated that thermal conditions at the onset of the growing season were critical for triggering the emergence of leaves ma et al 2007 marcolla et al 2011 and much more important than water status in determining the carbon assimilation capacity of the ecosystem groendahl et al 2007 barichivich et al 2013 the responses of vegetation phenology to climate extremes however are complicated with varied magnitude along climatic gradients and among biomes ma et al 2015 several studies reported that early green up could increase photosynthesis more than respiration among high latitude biomes in the northern hemisphere kato et al 2006 piao et al 2011 however this study found that at the humid temperate forest site re increased more than gpp during the springtime fig 6 and acted as a stronger carbon source in this period fig 5 numerous studies have documented advances in the timing of spring onset in temperate vegetation areas across the northern hemisphere schwartz et al 2006 monahan et al 2016 these trends are unequivocally attributed to spring warming combined with the advances in spring onset the delays in autumn senescence have extended the growing season length in eurasian and north american temperate forests over the past years menzel et al 2008 jeong et al 2011 liu et al 2016 the continuing trends of rising air temperatures in temperate region suggest increasingly earlier spring leaf out which is potentially tempered by photoperiod or chilling requirements in certain species delayed senescence and consequently longer growing period the study also implied that sos was strongly and negatively correlated to los which meant that the earlier sos the longer los fig 3c in spite that terrestrial ecosystems generally have recurrent phenological cycles driven predominantly by temperature variability vegetation growth can be nearly completely inhibited under the extreme drought in spring ma et al 2015 but when the favorable period arrived vegetation maintained the ability to recover and grow 4 2 climate controls on forest carbon sequestration amplification of the hydrological cycle as a consequence of global climate warming increases the frequency intensity and spatial extent of extreme climate events globally sheffield and wood 2008 the effects of such events on ecosystem functions particularly on terrestrial carbon budget remain largely uncertain barr et al 2007 found that when a boreal aspen forest received adequate precipitation the annual gpp was largely controlled by how long the deciduous canopy had leaves as this governed the amount of solar radiation that was intercepted however the photosynthetic light use efficiency was diminished under drought conditions although the canopy s capacity for light interception was unchanged gitelson et al 2015 the potential carbon sequestration of a forest can be influenced by a range of climatic variables such as energy and water through their impacts on gpp and re wilhite 2016 the responses to drought of annual nee and its components might spatially and temporally change depending on the severity continuation and timing of the droughts mitchell et al 2015 schlesinger et al 2016 generally gpp is majorly affected by droughts during the growing season whereas re could be influenced by droughts occurring throughout all seasons although drought is generally associated with declines in forest carbon sequestration due to water and heat stresses on ecosystem metabolism eamus et al 2013 the magnitude of reduction which is determined by ecosystem sensitivity to drought varies dramatically across or even within biomes knapp et al 2015 our current knowledge on these responses remains limited a comprehensive understanding of the factors that determine the variations in sensitivity to drought across terrestrial biomes is crucial linear regression was used to examine the environmental controls on the carbon sequestration potential at the humid temperate deciduous forest fig 8 the relationships were analyzed at three periods namely the spring temperature anomaly sta and extremely dry summer edp in 2012 and the annual time scale over the 11 years of measurements the study found that 1 all climate factors including solar radiation rg air temperature ta soil temperature ts vapor pressure deficit vpd and natural precipitation p performed consistent trends during edp and annual periods which indicated that the growing season acted as the most important role around the year for a ecosystem 2 with the increases in rg ta and ts and vpd across the three periods the capacity of carbon sequestration weakened implying that they were not the dominant factors in the region 3 only p exhibited distinctly different correlations during the sta and edp periods more rainfall in springtime led to a slight decrease in nep whereas the nep was positively correlated with p during the summertime this finding again demonstrated that the amount of rainfall dominantly controlled the carbon fixation capacity therefore in summer 2012 not only the heatwave but also the drought exerted extremely adverse effects on the humid temperate deciduous forest 4 3 responses of ecosystem wue to climate factors previous studies showed that the cumulative effect of the spring temperature was the principal limiting factor in breaking plant dormancy leaf phenological development and subsequent plant growth kato et al 2006 marcolla et al 2011 shen et al 2015 the strong correlations between gpp ta and ts during the spring temperature anomaly reached up to 0 64 and 0 66 respectively table 2 meanwhile the water loss et exhibited a much stronger relationship with ta and ts nevertheless during the peak growing season the high ta and ts turned into a negative controlling factor for gpp and et but natural rainfall p was positively and strongly correlated to gpp and et with coefficients of 0 63 and 0 88 respectively it implied that both gpp and et would suffer from the constraints of water scarcity in spite that wue did not decrease significantly as the ratio of gpp to et on the annual time scale 1 75 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2011 vs 1 70 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2012 but the heatwave in summer 2012 further amplified the effect of drought on forest gpp and et and led to the decreased wue 2 39 g co2 kg 1 h2o compared with the adjacent years during the extreme dry period 2 90 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2011 and 3 17 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2013 dynamics in ecosystem wue were affected by a series of variables including co2 levels keenan et al 2013 water vapor pressure deficit yang et al 2010 mitchell et al 2015 solar radiation rocha et al 2004 gitelson et al 2015 and human induced disturbances magnani et al 2007 tang et al 2017 the dominant controls varied among sites and across scales the response of an ecosystem s wue to climate anomalies remain a difficult challenge and more studies are needed to set up the common principles that govern it 5 conclusions in spite that the ec based measurements of co2 and h2o fluxes at the humid temperate forest only had 11 years of data and the flux partitioning method for gpp and re components owned plenty of uncertainties this study revealed that climate extremes have exerted dramatic impacts on vegetation phenology carbon sequestration and ecosystem wue the main findings were summarized as follows 1 green up dates were advanced with the increase in spring temperature approximately 3 5 days per c in sos meanwhile the growing season los elongated apparently with about 3 days per c and reached the peak at 2012 2 the shift of carbon source to sink in 2012 advanced by nearly 40 days owing to springtime temperature anomaly however the extremely dry summer severely reduced forest carbon sequestration capacity from 0 78 g co2 m 2 d 1 to 0 28 g co2 m 2 d 1 further analyses implied that the weakest nep was mainly dominated by the sharp reduction in gpp rather than re 3 in view of earlier sos in 2012 both gpp and et were apparently higher than those during the adjacent years but prolonged summer drought sharply decreased the ecosystem wue resulting in the fewest gpp and et 4 in this area the amount of precipitation dominantly controlled the capacity of forest carbon sequestration the heatwave together with summer drought exerted extremely adverse effects in 2012 all of these findings provide important implications for developing forest
