plants wwtps are stresses with increased water pollutants due to rapid urbanization manoli and samara 2008 akinpelu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d yadav et al 2019 wastewater generated from industries and plants covers hazardous and highly toxic materials including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pahs produced by anthropogenic activities associated with industrialization and urbanization such as incomplete combustion of organic materials such as oil gasoline tobacco diesel petrol coal asphalt and creosote sun et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2018 baniasadi et al 2018 moreover pahs found to be significant in wwtps groundwater surface water sludge soil and sediments because it contains and receive complex mixtures of secondary pollutants and further causing severe contamination to surface and groundwater qi et al 2013 suciu et al 2015 natural sources of pahs include volcanic activities seepage of petroleum natural losses and coal deposits and open burning of fossil fuels in contrast anthropogenic sources consist of coal gasification residential heating liquefying plants asphalt production coal tar pitch carbon black production aluminum production catalytic cracking towers petroleum refineries and vehicle exhaust bhadra et al 2018 lamichhane et al 2016 ding et al 2013 the release of pahs into the environment influences aquatic life e g flora fauna bacterial and algal species available in benthic region erosion wearing of sedimentary rocks and petroleum seeps and decomposition of vegetative litter fall nisticò et al 2017 dong et al 2012 veltman et al 2012 relatively high concentrations of pahs exist in urban soils 467 5470 ng g compared with water 0 9 1 547 ng g or air 0 0007 0 016 ng m3 ngo et al 2014 bushnaf et al 2011 furthermore the presence of hazardous pahs such as anthracene an pyrene pyr and chrysene chr may pose a potential risk to the ecosystem in terms of increasing number of cancer cases in humans and tumors in animals us epa 2011 pahs are well known for their distinguishing characteristics such as high boiling and melting points low solubility and vapor pressure hussein et al 2016 the solubility and vapor pressure of pahs reduce local pah concentrations along with rising molecular weight e g gain of the additional ring accompanied by increasing resistance to oxidation and reduction akinpelu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d kaleta 2011 włodarczyk makuła 2007 due to the widespread applications of pahs and their low removal abilities in conventional treatment methods pahs are consistently detected in secondary effluent across the globe ghosal et al 2016 several pahs such as naphthalene nap acenaphthene phenanthrene phe and fluorine flu are frequently found in the effluent from the municipal wwtps katsou et al 2015 removal of pahs through pretreatment and primary treatment processes ranges between 40 and 60 however in biological i e secondary treatment process their removal was observed over a broad range of 10 to 90 katsou et al 2015 petrochemical industrial releases are one of the primary pah sources in wastewater nacheva and sotelo 2016 coking wastewater using biological treatment processes plays a crucial role in removing pahs featuring successful removal of 92 of target pollutants studies have suggested that the application of tertiary treatments is still required to reduce the ongoing input of pah contaminants smol et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 kong et al 2018 zhang et al 2013a 2013b the different pah estimation method is a promising way to estimation transport parameters required to assessed constraints ngo et al 2014 bushnaf et al 2011 akinpelu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d hence to avoid the impact of constraints on the optimized results to explain optimization consequences based on the projected trial situations it is obligatory to appraise the evidence pleased and the promising connections among different parameters before assessing them the basic principles and removal mechanisms of treatment techniques are also summarized recent developments in this area covering various approaches have been discussed generally it comprises i sources distribution

warning on the exact range of the operating conditions emphasis on all aspects of performance evaluation most suitable to achieve maximum yield and extent of degradation is also outlined furthermore in recent years aops coupled with catalysts have been determined as the most effective methods in removing pahs in wastewater in this study various techniques have been discussed for pahs removal processes and range of membrance pore size has been given in fig 1 it is needed because very few authors have discussed all techniques elaborately with mechanism in depth along with these performance evaluation and isotherm parameters are also discussed through various nonlinear methods such as langmuir freundlich qiu et al 2009 temkin febrianto et al 2009 redlich peterson woo et al 2009 webbers and morris models campos et al 2018 these helped in better understanding of interactions between adsorbent materials and organic adsorbates further these techniques have been applied for determination of isotherm parameters gong et al 2007 till date it is observed that very few numbers of work are available for pahs removal mainly for industrial waste water in this study current treatment techniques were compared and discussed to select the appropriate methods for effective removal of pah from industrial wastewater fig 2 the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques are also described briefly it is worth mentioning here that present review study encompasses detailed performance evaluation of pahs removal techniques to select economic and more efficient processes identified for further research 2 origins and distribution of pahs major sources of pahs in industrial wastewater include organic substances exposed to high temperatures at oxygen deficit conditions and oil based sources such as natural oil seeps crude refined oil and oil spillages hussein et al 2016 inengite et al 2013 sun et al 2010 pah level in wastewater is dependent on weather conditions and types of treatment processes steckenmesser et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 2 1 classification and origin of pahs according to the international agency for research on cancer the classification of pahs is based on carcinogenicity sufficient information and available evidence indicate that these contaminants cause cancer in animals and probably in humans rajendran et al 2014 information about public health along with its mechanism and its route of exposure is well described hirano et al 2013 typical pahs include acenaphthene an fluoranthene flt flu phe and pyr man et al 2017 katsou et al 2015 kaminski et al 2008 pahs are also categorized as persistent organic contaminants with 16 belonging to the list of emerging contaminants designated by the us environmental protection agency usepa us epa 2011 singh and borthakur 2018 several pahs are hydrophobic compounds that show a high affinity for organics these pahs are only partially removed in wwtps with an average removal of 60 to 90 from water jelic et al 2015 the influent and effluent concentrations of the 16 pahs reach 9 to 429 ng l and 1 to 86 ng l respectively in sewerage systems in urban areas of japan ozaki et al 2015 the removal efficiency of pahs from paper pulping wastewater treatment using the electro coagulation method could reach 86 gong et al 2017 pyrogenic pahs are generated under the exposure of organic substances at high temperatures in oxygen deficit conditions wang et al 2014 meanwhile petro genic pahs are mostly found in crude oil petroleum products in oil refinery petroleum plants abdel shafy and mansour 2016 formation of pahs can be either natural e g vegetable decay plant synthesis and natural petroleum or anthropogenic e g pesticide formations sewage sludge and pah contaminated media seo et al 2007 masih and taneja 2006 the major sources of pahs include petro genic pyrogenic and biological pahs are mainly generated by incomplete combustion of organic materials for example the manufacture of pigments dyes plastics pesticides and pharmaceuticals the most commonly found pahs in the water environment include nap phe flt an pyr flu benzo b fluoranthene 2 methylnapthalene benzo k fluoranthene 2 methylnapthalene benzo a pyrene acenapthylene acy indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene acenaphthene benza a anthracene dibenzo ah anthracene daha chrysene and benzo g h i perylene torretta 2012 table 1 summarizes the information related to sources classification and health environmental effects of commonly detected pahs the predominant sources of all 16 pahs are wood smoke and motor vehicles ravindra et al 2008 us epa 2011 pahs mainly include two or more than two benzene rings with linear angular and cluster arrangements gupte et al 2016 butler et al 2017 as per who regional guidelines pahs having a high range of organic compounds consist two or more than two fused aromatic rings eg benzene who 2000 low molecular weight pahs have two and three rings eg naphthalene fluorene phenanthrene acenaphthene found mainly in the atmosphere in the form of vapour phase while high molecular weight pahs e g pyrene dibenz a h anthracene benzo a pyrene chrysene having five rings or more than five are highly bound to the particles less soluble in water in case of intermediate ringed molecular weight having four rings which is partitioned in between vapour and particulate form of phases mentioned in table 2 which depends on atmospheric temperature srogi 2007 in general particle bound pahs is highly risky dangerous for human health benzo a pyrene b a p is the most often used in the form of total exposure to the carcinogenic pahs because contribution of b a p to total carcinogenic potential is very much high range 51 64 abdel shafy and mansour 2016 anthropogenic pahs are generated from diverse sources including incomplete combustion of organic materials industrial discharge cooking transportation tobacco smoking biomass burning gas wood combustion and petrol coal gaurav and khanam 2017 and waste incineration ravindra et al 2008 pahs are considered alternant or non alternant depending on whether they contain four five or six non aromatic benzene rings wick et al 2011 selection of suitable techniques for effective pah removal is dependent on their physio chemical properties and operating parameters such as current density initial ph pressure flow velocity and hydraulic retention time asim et al 2017 gonzález et al 2012 gaurav et al 2020 2 2 distribution of pahs analysis of carcinogenic pahs is performed with consideration of relevant toxic equivalency factors tefs which are associated with potential human health risks xuan zhen et al 2014 kumar and sharma 2016 carcinogenic pahs are identified by factors tefs and equivalent bap emission bapeq tefs for all pahs range between 0 001 and 1 00 except for certain pahs such as benzo e pyrene bep and coronene bapeq emission factor for individual pah is calculated by multiplying emission factor with its corresponding tef value real toxic potency is obtained with these values bapeq emission factor for all pahs is in the range of 0 04 to 453 8 ng km yang et al 2011 the emission of pahs is primarily through combustion processes high molecular weight pahs such as daha are mainly emitted from the burning of biomass whereas the low and medium molecular weight of pahs such as nap and phe are primarily originated from emissions of waste incinerators vehicle engines steel iron manufacturing plants and coke production plants similar distributions and trends of two and three ring pahs observed in emissions from coal combustion sewage sludge incineration municipal solid waste incineration and cement plants hsu et al 2016 conesa et al 2016 van caneghem and vandecasteele 2014 pah distribution in the gaseous phase and particle form is dependent on emission characteristics additionally daha is robustly dominant through the emission of burning biomass thus it is a prime contributor in gas and particle phases although nap dominates in the gas phase heavier pahs phe from diesel and bio diesel are partitioned more efficiently into the particle phase he et al 2010 yang et al 2011 thus two to three pahs i e nap to an are prime contributors accounting for 78 of total pah emission shen et al 2013 nap is the predominant gas phase pah contributor i e 71 81 followed by acy 11 19 particulate pahs contain phe 8 32 flt 4 18 flu 7 11 and pyr 3 17 the outcomes show that emission profiles of pahs that are similarly ignited materials could be substantially different depending on the ignition conditions several appropriate solvent extraction techniques have been suggested for accurate measurement of pahs in air particulate matter szulejko et al 2014 3 current aops treatment processes for pahs 3 1 chemical oxidation processes chemical oxidation processes techniques aim to oxidize pollutants and decrease their toxicity harmless substances such as potassium permanganate kmno4 sodium persulfate na2s2o8 conventional fenton and modified fenton are commonly used for removal of pahs chen et al 2001 on the basis of the favorable reactant doses the effective liquid oxidants have been identified through the tests against the highest acceptable concentration e g 1000 ng g of 16 pahs the removal efficiency of pahs by kmno4 na2s2o8 and conventional modified fenton reagents are in the range of 5 3 72 8 10 7 39 1 0 30 9 and 31 5 68 3 respectively chen et al 2001 additionally the maximum removal of overall pahs using different processes is discussed the maximum removal 72 8 was attained through high dosages of kmno4 na2s2o8 achieved the maximum removal of 39 1 whereas consumption of persulfate vigorously occurred by off target compounds in sediments chen et al 2001 the maximum 30 9 removed by the conventional fenton process modified fenton method attained a higher removal efficiency than conventional fenton sodium citrate was the most appropriate complex agent for activating h2o2 in the remediation of pah contaminated sediments adequate utilization of chelating agents exhibits adverse effects reduced degradation on pah removal efficiency 3 2 electrochemical processes pah removal has been investigated through electrochemical processes electstab zheng et al 2007 tran et al 2010 gong et al 2017 a study was performed with the addition of 5 l doped sludge charged into a 12 l electro reactor with a 0 42 m height 0 25 m diameter along with a cell consisting of two concentrically electrodes with ti ruo2 and ti and power supply of dc 0 40 v 1 70 a electrochemical treatment was applied at 8 a and 16 v at room temperature for 60 min then through centrifugation sludge collected from wastewater treatment was divided into solid and liquid phases the efficient degradation of pahs was achieved during the elecstab process with approximately 62 of pah removal three ring pahs can be partially removed through the electrochemical elecstab process from wastewater sewage sludge future studies should explore the best conditions for acceptable surfactants in elecstab or metix ac processes for pahs removal however studies on the removal of larger pahs four ring are still necessary removal and transformation of pahs from industrial effluents have been performed on paper making wastewater by electro coagulation ec process gong et al 2017 a total of 86 pahs have been effectively removed and the transformation of pahs should be considered double sided consequences during removal via ec treatment gong et al 2017 the mechanism of the process is highly complex due to the involvement of electron coupling with dissociative chemisorption steps basically two different processes occurred namely direct and indirect electrolysis direct electrolysis depends on electrode activity current density and diffusion rate of pollutants whereas indirect electrolysis is determined by temperature the diffusion rate of generated oxidants and ph level in indirect electro oxidation chloride salts of sodium and potassium are added to wastewater to achieve enhanced conductivity through the generation of hypochlorite ions the anodic oxidation of chloride ions is expressed as follows 1 2 cl k 1 cl 2 2 e the liberated chlorine forms hypochlorous acid as follows 2 cl 2 h 2 o k 2 h cl hocl furthermore hypochlorous acid is dissociated into hypochlorite ions as follows 3 hocl k 3 k 3 h ocl a generalized mechanism for electrochemical conversion of pahs and organic matter on the noble oxide coated catalytic anode mox is described as follows panizza and cerisola 2009 in the first step h2o is discharged at the anode thereby producing adsorbed hydroxyl radicals as expressed in the following equation 4 m o x h 2 o m o x oh h e in the second step adsorbed hydroxyl radicals interact with oxygen in oxide anode with the transition of oxygen from adsorbed hydroxyl radicals to higher oxide as expressed in the following equation 5 m o x oh m o x 1 h e 3 3 advanced oxidation treatment processes aops for pahs the concept of aops was developed in the 20th century in aops a sufficient generation of hydroxyl radicals affects the efficiency of water purification fig 3 these processes have been substantially studied with the application of oxidation technologies such as uv o3 uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 and photo fenton reaction such as uv h2o2 fe2 or fe3 hassaan and nemr 2017 cuerda correa et al 2020 a detailed outline and description of the aops have been presented by stefan 2017 miklos et al 2018 the aops can be classified into two categories namely established and emerging based on available literature on wastewater treatment operation the mechanism of aops can be defined in three steps miklos et al 2018 initiation in this step radicals are generated via reactions with oh and substrate m in an aqueous solution 6 o 3 oh o 2 h o 2 7 o 3 m o 3 m propagation the radical reaction chain is maintained 8 o 3 h h o 3 9 h o 3 oh o 2 10 oh m r 11 r o 2 roo 12 roo o 2 m oxid termination m acts as a radical scavenger and the reaction of the radical chain is ended by product formation m 13 oh m m oxidative processes such as aops for the treatment of toxic pollutants are commonly used at different industrial levels and in wwtps these processes convert complex organic related compounds in wastewater which are difficult to biologically degrade into simple end products as a result aops integrated with biological processes are used in the pre treatment process to minimize the operating cost canizares et al 2009 the integration of these treatment methods is useful in fulfilling environmental regulations by enhancing the removal rate of contaminants and ensuring efficiency and profitability ayed et al 2017 mohanjerani et al mohajerani et al 2009 recently aops have been used as a quadruple action or a shining step to disinfect water and remove micro pollutants from the treated effluents ayed et al 2017 a single aop system can manage partial degradation of pollutants and rarely achieves complete mineralization except in combination with other forms of aops hou et al 2016 cai et al 2015 thus a combined aop system is effective in improving pollutant removal and reducing operating costs along with potentially nil or extremely low chemical and energy inputs mahdad et al 2016 thiruvenkatachari et al 2007 advanced oxidation involves the following steps a development of strong oxidants b oxidants reaction of an organic substance cause growth of biodegradable intermediates in water and c biodegradable intermediate reaction with oxidants which leads to mineralization in wastewater treatment the main types of aops commonly applied include a ozonation b ozone uv and c hydrogen peroxide uv and fenton reactions 3 3 1 application of ozonation processes for pahs the applications have been explained along with the operating principles and mechanisms of ozonation in this process direct ozone reactions involve contaminants in wastewater treatment and ozone molecules that are decomposed into reactive oxygen species e g free radicals and react with pollutants in water ozonation is defined as hydroxyl radical pathway as hydroxyl radical is the chief reactive species this condition is mainly due to radical chain series reactions such as initiation propagation and termination eqs 6 13 which occur during the desired product formation in ozonation based aop treatment systems ikehata and li 2018 several researchers have explained the removal of pahs using ozonation lin et al 2016 rubio clemente et al 2014 jing et al 2018 two mechanisms that have been discussed are i direct oxidation by o3 of target pollutants eq 14 and ii indirect oxidation at alkaline conditions though the transformation from o3 to oh eqs 14 21 jing et al 2018 gerrity et al 2012 14 o 3 pah pah ox 15 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 16 o 3 ho 2 ho 2 o 3 17 ho 2 h o 2 18 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 19 o 3 h ho 3 20 ho 3 o 2 o h 21 o 3 o h ho 2 o 2 3 3 2 application of ozone uv for pahs ozone based processes for industrial wastewater treatment are generally considered as a cost ineffective technique because the generated hydrogen peroxide is subsequently photolyzed to form hydroxyl radicals souza et al 2011 mozia et al 2017 the removal efficiencies of halogenated alkenes and aromatic compounds with concentrations of 50 384 μg l were up to 87 and 82 respectively when a dose of 6 mg l of ozone was used murray et al 2009 compared with ozonation the treatment performance of ozone uv systems for removal of tetrachloroethylene c2cl4 chloroform and bromo dichloromethane were four to fifty times faster thiruvenkatachari et al 2007 sun et al 2017 at the dose rate of 0 1 1 3 mg l min and uv intensity of 0 09 0 38 watt l conventional ozonation process is ineffective for the oxidation of pahs which react slowly with ozone such as c2cl4 and benzene c6h6 keyte et al 2013 szulżyk cieplak 2017 uv radiation and other oxidant such as h2o2 with o3 enhance the degradation rates of pollutants litter and quici 2010 matilainen and sillanpää 2010 the mechanism for the combined process of uv o3 is discussed in the following equations eqs 22 25 first initiation of o3 photolysis produce o2 and h2o2 thereafter photolysis of hydrogen peroxide to oh occurs followed by dissociation into ho2 22 o 3 h 2 o hv o 2 h 2 o 2 23 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh 24 h 2 o 2 hν ho 2 h 25 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o for the o3 h2o2 system initiation of o3 decomposition is induced by h2o2 through electron transfer with yields of oh and ho2 eq 22 in the uv o3 and o3 h2o2 systems the generation of ho2 is involved in the oh production through a chain mechanism as described in eqs 17 20 thereby improving the degradation of the processes litter and quici 2010 metalsbetancourt buitrago et al 2019 26 o 3 h 2 o 2 o 2 ho 2 oh compared with the uv h2o2 process the former processes i e uv o3 and o3 h2o2 are less energy efficient because they produce large quantities of oh due to the low solubility of o3 in water compared with h2o2 litter and quici 2010 however in the uv h2o2 process operating costs are estimated to be higher due to the presence of large amounts of contaminants also the uv o3 and o3 h2o2 processes require a more efficient reactor design to maximize the o3 mass transfer because gaseous o3 is diffused into the water due to liquid solution alimoradzadeh et al 2012 litter and quici 2010 3 3 3 application of hydrogen peroxide uv and fenton reactions aops using o3 h2o2 are more effective for organic compounds that do not absorb uv the uv h2o2 process involves photons with a wavelength shorter than 370 nm organic compounds can be easily oxidized by these radicals compared with photolysis of ozone with photodecomposition efficiency of 254 nm yao et al 2016 lee et al 2016 the h2o2 uv process shows promising development when the lamps used or emit light efficiently at a wavelength of 185 nm furatian 2017 for fenton s reagent the generation of hydroxyl radicals is initiated and catalyzed by ferrous ion through h2o2 decomposition the generated radicals are in an aqueous solution with a complex reaction sequence matavos aramyan and moussavi 2017 in general fenton s oxidation process comprises four stages namely precipitation neutralization and coagulation ph adjustment and oxidation reaction the organic substances are degraded at the stages of oxidation and coagulation ebrahiem et al 2017 the photo activated reactions were indicated through the free radical mechanism and initiated by photon interaction with a suitable energy level and chemical species available in the solution radicals are originated by uv radiation via photochemical degradation of oxidizing compounds such as hydrogen peroxide fenton s reagent and ozone which are homogeneous the radicals are superior to the sole use of uv radiation or such oxidants deng and zhao 2015 harmosilla et al 2015 babu et al 2016 garcia montano et al 2008 dye wastewater with high uv absorbing capacity may suppress the potency of this technique due to limited penetration of uv radiation and requires utilization of high intensity uv lamps and a specially designed reactor free radicals can also be obtained through the photo catalytic mechanism that materializes on the s surface of the semiconductor in anatase form titanium dioxide tio2 exhibits reasonable photo activity and is commonly used as a photo catalyst this substance has advantageous properties such as non toxic insoluble low cost and resistant to photo corrosion and biological immunity gonzalez gutierrez and escamilla silva 2009 the photo catalytic process can be conducted easily using a fine catalyst particle slurry that is distributed in liquid state using supported immobilized catalysts in a reactor the drawbacks of slurry reactors include small efficiency radiation for the sake of opacity suspension surface radiation source fouling along with catalyst decomposition and demand of ultrafine catalyst particles and its separation from the treated effluent hai et al 2007 in addition to the single stage process photocatalysts that are present as o3 or h2o2 can also improve bleaching and mineralization total mineralization of compounds and specific energy consumption of photo catalytic ozonation is lower than that of conventional photocatalysis along with ozonation fenton s reagent and its modifications such as thermal fenton technique and photo fenton reaction via fe2 fe3 oxalate ion h2o2 and uv radiation are considered for whitening of synthetic dyes hsueh et al 2009 yang et al 2009 for three synchronized reactions h2o2 is used swiftly in the photo fenton technique as well as the shortest operation of fenton photo reduction of fe3 fe2 ions and h2o2 photolysis compared with the conventional fenton process and photolysis the photo fenton technique generates a large number of hydroxyl radicals about the performance of organic pollutant removal the fenton process is advantageous when combined with alternatives advanced oxidation to reduce energy consumption h2o2 requirement sludge generation and maintenance cost and improve the flexibility of the process fenton reagent demands the use of immense amounts of acidic and basic chemicals yamamoto and fukushi 2007 jadhav et al 2007 using the h2o2 iron powder solution system is recommended to take advantage of oxidizing agents e g fenton to eliminate iron salt separation the process can contribute to superior stain removal than h2o2 fe2 as chemisorption of iron powder added to a regular type of reaction however based on different transition metals fenton reactions have been less explored to date despite being described as insensitive to ph and useful for synthetic dye degradation among aops photo fenton reaction and tio2 mediated heterogeneous photocatalytic processes are desirable in absorbing light near the uv spectral region to initiate radical reactions these applications would virtually remove significant operating costs by using solar radiation as an alternative to artificial uv light the ferric oxalate solution has been utilized as a chemical action meter and can also be adopted in the photo fenton technique to achieve further advantages as replacement of uv light along with solar radiation brienza et al 2016 khouni et al 2012 jadhav et al 2011 various efforts have been exerted to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 these approaches include phosphate deposition of noble metal doping ions the addition of inorganic adsorbents catalysis of coupling and use of nonporous films yadav et al 2015 furthermore new catalysts such as metalloporphyrins polymers are excited by violet and visible light by using only 3 of the available solar energy for commonly used tio2 merayo et al 2013 fenton s reagent which was discovered in 1894 fenton 1982 clemente et al 2014 is a mixture of h2o2 and ferrous ion which generates hydroxyl radicals according to the following reactions eqs 27 30 jing et al 2018 litter and quici 2010 27 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h oh 28 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 o 2 2 h 29 o 2 f e 3 f e 2 o 2 30 oh mtbe oxidationby products the ferrous ion initiates and catalyzes the decomposition of h2o2 resulting in the generation of hydroxyl radicals the generation of these radicals involves a complex reaction sequence in an aqueous solution szulżyk cieplak 2017 3 3 4 catalytic oxidation for pahs catalytic oxidation has been primarily used in eliminating 16 pahs consisting of 3 ring 4 ring 5 ring and 6 ring pahs using dihydrogen dioxide in the presence of cobalt titanium and platinum catalysts turek and włodarczyk makuła 2012 turek et al 2015 generally for titanium catalysts maximum reduction of 16 pahs was attained compared with platinum and cobalt catalysts wlodarczyk makula 2011 the results of titanium catalyst show that the pah reduction rate of selected hydrocarbons in terms of pah reduction at the dose of 0 82 ml l is in the following order 6 ring 5 ring 99 4 ring 98 3 ring 79 similarly for platinum catalysts the highest reduction of 16 pahs was achieved ata dose of 1 64 ml l and the pah reduction of the examined hydrocarbons in the following order 5 ring 45 6 ring 34 3 ring 26 4 ring 22 for cobalt catalyst a maximum reduction of 16 pahs was attained at the dose of 1 64 ml l and the pah reduction rate of selected hydrocarbons decreased in the following order 6 ring 61 5 ring 50 4 ring 22 3 ring 9 turek et al 2015 catalytic peroxidation cpo is a promising technique in which homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are used to degrade organic pollutants by using h2o2 as an oxidant this method is easily performed under mild conditions and low energy consumption a variety of free radicals are generated by h2o2 along with other reactive species that are capable of decomposing or transforming organic substances the generated reactive species that act as oxidants and reductants during cpo are shown in fig 4 lou et al 2009 heterogeneous cpo systems have been loaded with different transition metals on numerous solid materials domingueza et al 2014 subbaramaiah et al 2013a the solid supported materials provide sufficient surface area for the interaction of organic pollutants with hydroxyl radicals which are active resulting in improved removal efficiency of organic pollutants recovery and separation of heterogeneous catalysts are easily facilitated in treated effluent yoshino et al 2014 valkaj and katovic 2011 copper is readily available cheap and widely used as a catalyst compared with other transition metals such as palladium ruthenium gold and platinum domingueza et al 2014 valkaj and katovic 2011 sba 15 is also used as a catalyst due to its stability selectivity and activity that increase its surface properties subbaramaiah et al 2013b kjellman and alfredsson 2013 4 performance evaluation of pahs removal techniques several technologies such as adsorption coagulation flocculation membrane separation and biological and electrochemical processes have been used to remove pahs from wastewater among the chemical processes aops are the most commonly used method for pah removal the removal performance and optimal operating parameters of conventional pahs treatment processes are summarized in table 3 researchers found that 86 of pahs related to 2 ring hydrocarbons e g nap and di methyl nap in papermaking wastewater were effectively removed using a combined treatment of electro oxidation reactions followed by adsorption these processes also efficiently treat the pahs with 3 and 4 ring carbon however improvement in the design and operation of wastewater treatment systems is necessary to enhance the degradation rate gong et al 2017 previous studies showed that the removal efficiencies of 16 pahs in a coke wastewater plant were 53 and 67 using a filtration process incorporating sand bed and reverse osmosis process respectively smol et al 2018 after secondary treatment most of the micropollutants except pahs flame retardants and tire leachate compounds were removed with a removal efficiency in the range of 81 1 92 9 furthermore the removal efficiency of pahs in the range of 32 99 3 was achieved in advanced treatment processes thus the findings suggested that a combination of secondary treatment with appropriate advanced treatment processes is highly effective in reducing micropollutants in municipal wastewater treatment plants wang et al 2018 in a textile wastewater treatment plant degradation of typical pahs such as fluorene fl phe an and dibenz a h anthracene dba was investigated using o3 h2o2 process at optimum conditions a 0 4 l min flow rate of o3 0 60 mol l h2o2 concentration 15 min reaction time and ph 7 were considered the removal efficiency was in the following order 89 for fl 81 for dba 71 for an and 66 for phe these removal rates increased by 5 5 21 and 27 for fl dba an and phe respectively with h2o2 addition to the o3 process within 30 min ning et al 2015 the pah removal rate was 90 for pyrene and 87 for phenanthrene at optimum conditions of influent flow 0 35 ml min when initial concentrations of pyrene and phenanthrene were 60 mg l researchers found that the best suited model for pah removal and enzyme activity is the quadratic model predicted by response surface methodology with a variation of feed flow rate and initial pah concentration baniasadi et al 2018 the average removal efficiency of total pahs by biodegradation was 85 in a wastewater treatment plant in harbin china the main sources of pahs were identified in heating and non heating seasons through principal component analysis researchers found a higher removal efficiency of 5 and 6 ring pahs compared with pahs congeners due to biosorption sun et al 2018a 2018b the pah removal rate exceeded 95 in the case of 3 ring pahs after a 21 day treatment using a combination of biological i e mad and chemical processes i e metix and stabiox metix bs mad process with the addition of tw80 enhanced the removal rate of 4 ring pahs in addition in the metix ac process almost 45 of 3 ring pah removal was contributed by sludge whereas the elecstab process removed approximately 62 of 3 ring pahs moreover poor treatment performance of 3 ring pahs 35 was observed in stabiox these investigated processes were not efficient for high molecular weight i e 5 ring pahs by sludge adsorption zhang et al 2018 the estimated reduction rates of pahs and spahs in the polluted rivers wastewater collected from sources such as coal combustion were 33 and 30 while that from wastewater treatment upgrading was 15 therefore the reduction from the source was more effective than that from the wastewater treatment upgrading to reduce pahs and spahs in urban receiving industrial wastewater from rivers qiao et al 2018 fig 5 based on the chemical structure of pah high removal capacities i e 80 of fl ant fn py and phe were achieved in adsorption systems in contrast lower retention was achieved for nap acl and ac nisticò et al 2017 furthermore performance evaluation is understood adequately by studying various nonlinear methods such as langmuir freundlich cooney 1999 temkin febrianto et al 2009 redlich peterson redlich and peterson 1959 and webbers and morris 1965 models the removal of pahs adsorption from wastewater was investigated using adsorbents including al mcm 41 araújo et al 2008 and zeolite chang et al 2004 and the results were compared with the findings of the present study the relevant adsorption capacities and langmuir adsorption constants are summarized in table 4 the pah adsorption was studied using different substances including chitosan sugar bagasse coconut shells chitin and immature coal leonardite crisafulli et al 2008 zeledón toruño et al 2007 the corresponding adsorption capacities and freundlich adsorption constants are listed in table 4 generally high pah removal efficiency can be achieved in membrane bioreactors mbrs and the treatment performance of mbr varies with distinct properties of different pahs the removal mechanisms include sludge adsorption biotransformation biodegradation zvolatilization and air stripping lehnberg et al 2009 margot et al 2015 low molecular weight pahs e g phenanthrene are more easily removed than larger molecules e g fluoranthene high molecular weight pahs are mainly removed by adsorption to sludge particle and further removed to the atmosphere from liquid and sediment phases through air stripping in the course of aerated treatment the pah concentration of the effluent of mbr was within the detection limit the significance of air stripping limits the volatilization and biodegradation mechanisms the toxicity of pahs which exhibit low bio availability of microorganisms cannot be anticipated because of high removal through air stripping in mbrs gonzález et al 2012 this review has provided some informative data for a better understanding of the performance evaluation of different treatment systems aops e g fenton reagent are successfully applied for organic pollutant removal which helps to calculate the optimal conditions for the effective removal of pahs the most important governing factor is the ph level which is predominant in improving the efficiency of the fenton reaction among the aops fenton oxidation and ozone based oxidation are widely investigated and broadly applied methods for pah removal these techniques attain approximately 15 95 of cod removal with the concentration varying from 0 6 mg ml to 26 mg ml the fenton process is the best method because of the simple process without mass transfer limitation homogeneous mature low cost and non toxic fenton process used as pre treatment of biological processes can significantly reduce the operating cost of treatment systems and improve their removal efficiency due to chemical stability pahs have been referred to persistent organic pollutants pops which cause of lung skin and bladder cancer to the humans directly connected to pahs also affects environment badly to understand the relationships in between cancers and the environments mainly depends on the exposure of pahs akinpelu et al 2019a some pahs such as naphthalene as well as fluorene listed as pops its also affects the human health as well as environments badly to remove these from polluted contaminated water using chronicled heavily author links open overlay panel akinpelu et al 2019b the performance evaluation of pah removal was conducted in five wwtps in jordan the removal of six pahs namely fluoranthene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene benzo ghi perylene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene was investigated in different unit operations and processes among the six pahs the involvement of fluoranthene was the highest accounting for 62 66 of the total pahs the removal efficiencies of the six pahs were in the range of 73 83 and 24 56 in biological treatment systems and aerated grit process respectively wu et al 2013 evaluated that the final sedimentation and disinfection for pah removal were limited 5 summary and outlook over the years different conventional and advanced oxidation processes have been used to remove pahs from wastewater among the methods reviewed in this study conventional methods are not entirely removing pahs removal of pahs remains a challenge due to the complexity undesirable by products and adverse effects of these materials understanding of the performance evaluation can be improved by studying various nonlinear methods such as langmuir freundlich temkin redlich peterson and webbers and morris models as well as chemical biological electrochemical oxidation and other existing processes in spite off available techniques possess their own advantages and disadvantages however they are not efficient in pahs degradation in terms of yield removal efficiency destruction of high ring pahs i e complex pah compounds ease of use cost effectiveness analytical recovery and performance evaluation compared with other techniques the main disadvantage is that this process is not focused on the complete recovery of contaminants in recent years more efficient aops and catalytic oxidation techniques have been developed and used frequently for pahs removal this review discussed in detail the different treatment techniques along with their mechanisms oxidant doses and operating parameters that affect the removal efficiency through a rigorous performance evaluation of the available techniques the coupling of aops and catalytic oxidation processes can be applied simultaneously to degrade high ring pahs more than 5 and 6 rings to achieve highly sophisticated results this approach would ensure that monitoring of wastewater treatment using uplc ms ms is economical and possesses high removal efficiency regardless of conventional techniques used based on the reported literature this review concludes that further research needs to focus on pahs removal in wastewater using aops as well as combined aops systems along with other treatment techniques for evaluating optimizing and analyzing operating conditions studying reaction intermediates and their performance estimating of degradation kinetics and designing productive geometric configuration reactors and their materials in addition combined or coupled processes have to be strategically targeted in the context of industrial scale importance few studies on pahs removal have been reported and feasible and applicable treatment techniques have been discussed in this review in the future further development of aop techniques in single and combined systems for pahs removal should be emphasized several studies have reported that aops used alone are effective in pahs removal however the simultaneous application of different aops promotes the degradation rates of pahs thereby leading to synergistic effects typical examples include uv o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 tio2 and uv tio2 fe2 us fe2 and us uv tio2 among others the main problem related to aops application lies in the relatively high operating costs associated with the reagents e g h2o2 and energy consumption although using solar radiation can reduce these costs moreover all of these processes can form by products that are more toxic than the target compounds furthermore these processes may be susceptible to the scavenging effect of oh by non target pollutants thereby reducing process efficiency although the use of aops coupled with biological processes is not yet a prevalent exercise it promises to be a lucrative answer for handling industrial effluents comprising pahs in the future aspects aops can transform pahs into biodegradable compounds in a relatively short time therefore using an aops followed by a biological process could be considered an effective option for the degradation of pahs especially if an mbr is involved the performance evaluation of different removal techniques are discussed in details and found that highest reduction for 5 or 6 ring pahs was obtained 99 while in case of 3 ring only 79 reduction with oxidant dose of 1 64 ml l using titanium catalyst by catalytic oxidation process as compared to other available techniques such as electrochemical oxidation process biodegradation adsorption in case of 2 ring only eg nap and dimethyl nap removal efficiency is found 86 with combined treatment of electro oxidation reactions followed by adsorption of paper making wastewater while these processes also efficiently degrade 3 ring and 4 ring pahs the average removal efficiency of total pahs by biodegradation was found 85 for wastewater in case of textile wastewater treatment plant at an optimum condition achieved removal efficiency in order of 89 for fl 66 for ph 71 for an and 81 for dba using ozonation treatment process these efficiency enhanced with addition of h2o2 in case of mwtps using secondary techniques the average removal efficiency found in the range of 81 1 92 9 while for aops are 32 99 3 here overall yield through aops most suitable if process used with some catalyst enhanced the yield as well and suitable for high ring as well as low ring pahs too among various processes advanced oxidation and catalytic oxidation processes are the most valuable and promising techniques for pahs removal various treatment techniques have been studied and found that aops have higher efficiency and more effective compare to other conventional techniques these are more capable highly efficient higher energy consumption consuming less time more reliable eco friendly in some cases because use natural catalysts a very few works have been found and reported for pahs removal earlier here discussed possible treatment techniques in future a strong focus should be given to the further development of aops techniques for pahs removal in both single and combined form additional revisions have to be conducted chiefly concerning pahs conversion rates with combined aop biological processes to estimate and elevate the operational conditions appraise the toxicity of the reaction intermediates apprehend the degradation kinetics and advance enhanced reactor geometric configurations and materials amongst further serious restrictions another critical task is the development of strategies for the use of combined processes at an industrial scale declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science

pahs are well known for their distinguishing characteristics such as high boiling and melting points low solubility and vapor pressure hussein et al 2016 the solubility and vapor pressure of pahs

assessed constraints ngo et al 2014 bushnaf et al 2011 akinpelu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d hence to avoid the impact of constraints on the optimized results to explain optimization consequences based on the projected trial situations it is obligatory to appraise the evidence pleased and the promising connections among different parameters before assessing them the basic principles and removal mechanisms of treatment techniques are also summarized recent developments in this area covering various approaches have been discussed generally it comprises i sources distribution

warning on the exact range of the operating conditions emphasis on all aspects of performance evaluation most suitable to achieve maximum yield and extent of degradation is also outlined furthermore in recent years aops coupled with catalysts have been determined as the most effective methods in removing pahs in wastewater in this study various techniques have been discussed for pahs removal processes and range of membrance pore size has been given in fig 1 it is needed because very few authors have discussed all techniques elaborately with mechanism in depth along with these performance evaluation and isotherm parameters are also discussed through various nonlinear methods such as langmuir freundlich qiu et al 2009 temkin febrianto et al 2009 redlich peterson woo et al 2009 webbers and morris models campos et al 2018 these helped in better understanding of interactions between adsorbent materials and organic adsorbates further these techniques have been applied for determination of isotherm parameters gong et al 2007 till date it is observed that very few numbers of work are available for pahs removal mainly for industrial waste water in this study current treatment techniques were compared and discussed to select the appropriate methods for effective removal of pah from industrial wastewater fig 2 the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques are also described briefly it is worth mentioning here that present review study encompasses detailed performance evaluation of pahs removal techniques to select economic and more efficient processes identified for further research 2 origins and distribution of pahs major sources of pahs in industrial wastewater include organic substances exposed to high temperatures at oxygen deficit conditions and oil based sources such as natural oil seeps crude refined oil and oil spillages hussein et al 2016 inengite et al 2013 sun et al 2010 pah level in wastewater is dependent on weather conditions and types of treatment processes steckenmesser et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 2 1 classification and origin of pahs according to the international agency for research on cancer the classification of pahs is based on carcinogenicity sufficient information and available evidence indicate that these contaminants cause cancer in animals and probably in humans rajendran et al 2014 information about public health along with its mechanism and its route of exposure is well described hirano et al 2013 typical pahs include acenaphthene an fluoranthene flt flu phe and pyr man et al 2017 katsou et al 2015 kaminski et al 2008 pahs are also categorized as persistent organic contaminants with 16 belonging to the list of emerging contaminants designated by the us environmental protection agency usepa us epa 2011 singh and borthakur 2018 several pahs are hydrophobic compounds that show a high affinity for organics these pahs are only partially removed in wwtps with an average removal of 60 to 90 from water jelic et al 2015 the influent and effluent concentrations of the 16 pahs reach 9 to 429 ng l and 1 to 86 ng l respectively in sewerage systems in urban areas of japan ozaki et al 2015 the removal efficiency of pahs from paper pulping wastewater treatment using the electro coagulation method could reach 86 gong et al 2017 pyrogenic pahs are generated under the exposure of organic substances at high temperatures in oxygen deficit conditions wang et al 2014 meanwhile petro genic pahs are mostly found in crude oil petroleum products in oil refinery petroleum plants abdel shafy and mansour 2016 formation of pahs can be either natural e g vegetable decay plant synthesis and natural petroleum or anthropogenic e g pesticide formations sewage sludge and pah contaminated media seo et al 2007 masih and taneja 2006 the major sources of pahs include petro genic pyrogenic and biological pahs are mainly generated by incomplete combustion of organic materials for example the manufacture of pigments dyes plastics pesticides and pharmaceuticals the most commonly found pahs in the water environment include nap phe flt an pyr flu benzo b fluoranthene 2 methylnapthalene benzo k fluoranthene 2 methylnapthalene benzo a pyrene acenapthylene acy indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene acenaphthene benza a anthracene dibenzo ah anthracene daha chrysene and benzo g h i perylene torretta 2012 table 1 summarizes the information related to sources classification and health environmental effects of commonly detected pahs the predominant sources of all 16 pahs are wood smoke and motor vehicles ravindra et al 2008 us epa 2011 pahs mainly include two or more than two benzene rings with linear angular and cluster arrangements gupte et al 2016 butler et al 2017 as per who regional guidelines pahs having a high range of organic compounds consist two or more than two fused aromatic rings eg benzene who 2000 low molecular weight pahs have two and three rings eg naphthalene fluorene phenanthrene acenaphthene found mainly in the atmosphere in the form of vapour phase while high molecular weight pahs e g pyrene dibenz a h anthracene benzo a pyrene chrysene having five rings or more than five are highly bound to the particles less soluble in water in case of intermediate ringed molecular weight having four rings which is partitioned in between vapour and particulate form of phases mentioned in table 2 which depends on atmospheric temperature srogi 2007 in general particle bound pahs is highly risky dangerous for human health benzo a pyrene b a p is the most often used in the form of total exposure to the carcinogenic pahs because contribution of b a p to total carcinogenic potential is very much high range 51 64 abdel shafy and mansour 2016 anthropogenic pahs are generated from diverse sources including incomplete combustion of organic materials industrial discharge cooking transportation tobacco smoking biomass burning gas wood combustion and petrol coal gaurav and khanam 2017 and waste incineration ravindra et al 2008 pahs are considered alternant or non alternant depending on whether they contain four five or six non aromatic benzene rings wick et al 2011 selection of suitable techniques for effective pah removal is dependent on their physio chemical properties and operating parameters such as current density initial ph pressure flow velocity and hydraulic retention time asim et al 2017 gonzález et al 2012 gaurav et al 2020 2 2 distribution of pahs analysis of carcinogenic pahs is performed with consideration of relevant toxic equivalency factors tefs which are associated with potential human health risks xuan zhen et al 2014 kumar and sharma 2016 carcinogenic pahs are identified by factors tefs and equivalent bap emission bapeq tefs for all pahs range between 0 001 and 1 00 except for certain pahs such as benzo e pyrene bep and coronene bapeq emission factor for individual pah is calculated by multiplying emission factor with its corresponding tef value real toxic potency is obtained with these values bapeq emission factor for all pahs is in the range of 0 04 to 453 8 ng km yang et al 2011 the emission of pahs is primarily through combustion processes high molecular weight pahs such as daha are mainly emitted from the burning of biomass whereas the low and medium molecular weight of pahs such as nap and phe are primarily originated from emissions of waste incinerators vehicle engines steel iron manufacturing plants and coke production plants similar distributions and trends of two and three ring pahs observed in emissions from coal combustion sewage sludge incineration municipal solid waste incineration and cement plants hsu et al 2016 conesa et al 2016 van caneghem and vandecasteele 2014 pah distribution in the gaseous phase and particle form is dependent on emission characteristics additionally daha is robustly dominant through the emission of burning biomass thus it is a prime contributor in gas and particle phases although nap dominates in the gas phase heavier pahs phe from diesel and bio diesel are partitioned more efficiently into the particle phase he et al 2010 yang et al 2011 thus two to three pahs i e nap to an are prime contributors accounting for 78 of total pah emission shen et al 2013 nap is the predominant gas phase pah contributor i e 71 81 followed by acy 11 19 particulate pahs contain phe 8 32 flt 4 18 flu 7 11 and pyr 3 17 the outcomes show that emission profiles of pahs that are similarly ignited materials could be substantially different depending on the ignition conditions several appropriate solvent extraction techniques have been suggested for accurate measurement of pahs in air particulate matter szulejko et al 2014 3 current aops treatment processes for pahs 3 1 chemical oxidation processes chemical oxidation processes techniques aim to oxidize pollutants and decrease their toxicity harmless substances such as potassium permanganate kmno4 sodium persulfate na2s2o8 conventional fenton and modified fenton are commonly used for removal of pahs chen et al 2001 on the basis of the favorable reactant doses the effective liquid oxidants have been identified through the tests against the highest acceptable concentration e g 1000 ng g of 16 pahs the removal efficiency of pahs by kmno4 na2s2o8 and conventional modified fenton reagents are in the range of 5 3 72 8 10 7 39 1 0 30 9 and 31 5 68 3 respectively chen et al 2001 additionally the maximum removal of overall pahs using different processes is discussed the maximum removal 72 8 was attained through high dosages of kmno4 na2s2o8 achieved the maximum removal of 39 1 whereas consumption of persulfate vigorously occurred by off target compounds in sediments chen et al 2001 the maximum 30 9 removed by the conventional fenton process modified fenton method attained a higher removal efficiency than conventional fenton sodium citrate was the most appropriate complex agent for activating h2o2 in the remediation of pah contaminated sediments adequate utilization of chelating agents exhibits adverse effects reduced degradation on pah removal efficiency 3 2 electrochemical processes pah removal has been investigated through electrochemical processes electstab zheng et al 2007 tran et al 2010 gong et al 2017 a study was performed with the addition of 5 l doped sludge charged into a 12 l electro reactor with a 0 42 m height 0 25 m diameter along with a cell consisting of two concentrically electrodes with ti ruo2 and ti and power supply of dc 0 40 v 1 70 a electrochemical treatment was applied at 8 a and 16 v at room temperature for 60 min then through centrifugation sludge collected from wastewater treatment was divided into solid and liquid phases the efficient degradation of pahs was achieved during the elecstab process with approximately 62 of pah removal three ring pahs can be partially removed through the electrochemical elecstab process from wastewater sewage sludge future studies should explore the best conditions for acceptable surfactants in elecstab or metix ac processes for pahs removal however studies on the removal of larger pahs four ring are still necessary removal and transformation of pahs from industrial effluents have been performed on paper making wastewater by electro coagulation ec process gong et al 2017 a total of 86 pahs have been effectively removed and the transformation of pahs should be considered double sided consequences during removal via ec treatment gong et al 2017 the mechanism of the process is highly complex due to the involvement of electron coupling with dissociative chemisorption steps basically two different processes occurred namely direct and indirect electrolysis direct electrolysis depends on electrode activity current density and diffusion rate of pollutants whereas indirect electrolysis is determined by temperature the diffusion rate of generated oxidants and ph level in indirect electro oxidation chloride salts of sodium and potassium are added to wastewater to achieve enhanced conductivity through the generation of hypochlorite ions the anodic oxidation of chloride ions is expressed as follows 1 2 cl k 1 cl 2 2 e the liberated chlorine forms hypochlorous acid as follows 2 cl 2 h 2 o k 2 h cl hocl furthermore hypochlorous acid is dissociated into hypochlorite ions as follows 3 hocl k 3 k 3 h ocl a generalized mechanism for electrochemical conversion of pahs and organic matter on the noble oxide coated catalytic anode mox is described as follows panizza and cerisola 2009 in the first step h2o is discharged at the anode thereby producing adsorbed hydroxyl radicals as expressed in the following equation 4 m o x h 2 o m o x oh h e in the second step adsorbed hydroxyl radicals interact with oxygen in oxide anode with the transition of oxygen from adsorbed hydroxyl radicals to higher oxide as expressed in the following equation 5 m o x oh m o x 1 h e 3 3 advanced oxidation treatment processes aops for pahs the concept of aops was developed in the 20th century in aops a sufficient generation of hydroxyl radicals affects the efficiency of water purification fig 3 these processes have been substantially studied with the application of oxidation technologies such as uv o3 uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 and photo fenton reaction such as uv h2o2 fe2 or fe3 hassaan and nemr 2017 cuerda correa et al 2020 a detailed outline and description of the aops have been presented by stefan 2017 miklos et al 2018 the aops can be classified into two categories namely established and emerging based on available literature on wastewater treatment operation the mechanism of aops can be defined in three steps miklos et al 2018 initiation in this step radicals are generated via reactions with oh and substrate m in an aqueous solution 6 o 3 oh o 2 h o 2 7 o 3 m o 3 m propagation the radical reaction chain is maintained 8 o 3 h h o 3 9 h o 3 oh o 2 10 oh m r 11 r o 2 roo 12 roo o 2 m oxid termination m acts as a radical scavenger and the reaction of the radical chain is ended by product formation m 13 oh m m oxidative processes such as aops for the treatment of toxic pollutants are commonly used at different industrial levels and in wwtps these processes convert complex organic related compounds in wastewater which are difficult to biologically degrade into simple end products as a result aops integrated with biological processes are used in the pre treatment process to minimize the operating cost canizares et al 2009 the integration of these treatment methods is useful in fulfilling environmental regulations by enhancing the removal rate of contaminants and ensuring efficiency and profitability ayed et al 2017 mohanjerani et al mohajerani et al 2009 recently aops have been used as a quadruple action or a shining step to disinfect water and remove micro pollutants from the treated effluents ayed et al 2017 a single aop system can manage partial degradation of pollutants and rarely achieves complete mineralization except in combination with other forms of aops hou et al 2016 cai et al 2015 thus a combined aop system is effective in improving pollutant removal and reducing operating costs along with potentially nil or extremely low chemical and energy inputs mahdad et al 2016 thiruvenkatachari et al 2007 advanced oxidation involves the following steps a development of strong oxidants b oxidants reaction of an organic substance cause growth of biodegradable intermediates in water and c biodegradable intermediate reaction with oxidants which leads to mineralization in wastewater treatment the main types of aops commonly applied include a ozonation b ozone uv and c hydrogen peroxide uv and fenton reactions 3 3 1 application of ozonation processes for pahs the applications have been explained along with the operating principles and mechanisms of ozonation in this process direct ozone reactions involve contaminants in wastewater treatment and ozone molecules that are decomposed into reactive oxygen species e g free radicals and react with pollutants in water ozonation is defined as hydroxyl radical pathway as hydroxyl radical is the chief reactive species this condition is mainly due to radical chain series reactions such as initiation propagation and termination eqs

peroxide is subsequently photolyzed to form hydroxyl radicals souza et al 2011 mozia et al 2017 the removal efficiencies of halogenated alkenes and aromatic compounds with concentrations of 50 384 μg l were up to 87 and 82 respectively when a dose of 6 mg l of ozone was used murray et al 2009 compared with ozonation the treatment performance of ozone uv systems for removal of tetrachloroethylene c2cl4 chloroform and bromo dichloromethane were four to fifty times faster thiruvenkatachari et al 2007 sun et al 2017 at the dose rate of 0 1 1 3 mg l min and uv intensity of 0 09 0 38 watt l conventional ozonation process is ineffective for the oxidation of pahs which react slowly with ozone such as c2cl4 and benzene c6h6 keyte et al 2013 szulżyk cieplak 2017 uv radiation and other oxidant such as h2o2 with o3 enhance the degradation rates of pollutants litter and quici 2010 matilainen and sillanpää 2010 the mechanism for the combined process of uv o3 is discussed in the following equations eqs 22 25 first initiation of o3 photolysis produce o2 and h2o2 thereafter photolysis of hydrogen peroxide to oh occurs followed by dissociation into ho2 22 o 3 h 2 o hv o 2 h 2 o

the uv o3 and o3 h2o2 systems the generation of ho2 is involved in the oh production through a chain mechanism as described in eqs 17 20 thereby improving the degradation of the processes litter and

large quantities of oh due to the low solubility of o3 in water compared with h2o2 litter and quici 2010 however in the uv h2o2 process operating costs are estimated to be higher due to the presence of large amounts of contaminants also the uv o3 and o3 h2o2 processes require a more efficient reactor design to maximize the o3 mass transfer because gaseous o3 is diffused into the water due to liquid solution alimoradzadeh et al 2012 litter and quici 2010 3 3 3 application of hydrogen peroxide uv and fenton reactions aops using o3 h2o2 are more effective for organic compounds that do not absorb uv the uv h2o2 process involves photons with a wavelength shorter than 370 nm organic compounds can be easily oxidized by these radicals compared with photolysis of ozone with photodecomposition efficiency of 254 nm yao et al 2016 lee et al 2016 the h2o2 uv process shows promising development when the lamps used or emit light efficiently at a wavelength of 185 nm furatian 2017 for fenton s reagent the generation of hydroxyl radicals is initiated and catalyzed by ferrous ion through h2o2 decomposition the generated radicals are in an aqueous solution with a complex reaction sequence matavos aramyan and moussavi 2017 in general fenton s oxidation process comprises four stages namely precipitation neutralization and coagulation ph adjustment and oxidation reaction the organic substances are degraded at the stages of oxidation and coagulation ebrahiem et al 2017 the photo activated reactions were indicated through the free radical mechanism and initiated by photon interaction with a suitable energy level and chemical species available in the solution radicals are originated by uv radiation via photochemical degradation of oxidizing compounds such as hydrogen peroxide fenton s reagent and ozone which are homogeneous the radicals are superior to the sole use of uv radiation or such oxidants deng and zhao 2015 harmosilla et al 2015 babu et al 2016 garcia montano et al 2008 dye wastewater with high uv absorbing capacity may suppress the potency of this technique due to limited penetration of uv radiation and requires utilization of high intensity uv lamps and a specially designed reactor free radicals can also be obtained through the photo catalytic mechanism that materializes on the s surface of the semiconductor in anatase form titanium dioxide tio2 exhibits reasonable photo activity and is commonly used as a photo catalyst this substance has advantageous properties such as non toxic insoluble low cost and resistant to photo corrosion and biological immunity gonzalez gutierrez and escamilla silva 2009 the photo catalytic process can be conducted easily using a fine catalyst particle slurry that is distributed in liquid state using supported immobilized catalysts in a reactor the drawbacks of slurry reactors include small efficiency radiation for the sake of opacity suspension surface radiation source fouling along with catalyst decomposition and demand of ultrafine catalyst particles and its separation from the treated effluent hai et al 2007 in addition to the single stage process photocatalysts that are present as o3 or h2o2 can also improve bleaching and mineralization total mineralization of compounds and specific energy consumption of photo catalytic ozonation is lower than that of conventional photocatalysis along with ozonation fenton s reagent and its modifications such as thermal fenton technique and photo fenton reaction via fe2 fe3 oxalate ion h2o2 and uv radiation are considered for whitening of synthetic dyes hsueh et al 2009 yang et al 2009 for three synchronized reactions h2o2 is used swiftly in the photo fenton technique as well as the shortest operation of fenton photo reduction of fe3 fe2 ions and h2o2 photolysis compared with the conventional fenton process and photolysis the photo fenton technique generates a large number of hydroxyl radicals about the performance of organic pollutant removal the fenton process is advantageous when combined with alternatives advanced oxidation to reduce energy consumption h2o2 requirement sludge generation and maintenance cost and improve the flexibility of the process fenton reagent demands the use of immense amounts of acidic and basic chemicals yamamoto and fukushi 2007 jadhav et al 2007 using the h2o2 iron powder solution system is recommended to take advantage of oxidizing agents e g fenton to eliminate iron salt separation the process can contribute to superior stain removal than h2o2 fe2 as chemisorption of iron powder added to a regular type of reaction however based on different transition metals fenton reactions have been less explored to date despite being described as insensitive to ph and useful for synthetic dye degradation among aops photo fenton reaction and tio2 mediated heterogeneous photocatalytic processes are desirable in absorbing light near the uv spectral region to initiate radical reactions these applications would virtually remove significant operating costs by using solar radiation as an alternative to artificial uv light the ferric oxalate solution has been utilized as a chemical action meter and can also be adopted in the photo fenton technique to achieve further advantages as replacement of uv light along with solar radiation brienza et al 2016 khouni et al 2012 jadhav et al 2011 various efforts have been exerted to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 these approaches include phosphate deposition of noble metal doping ions the addition of inorganic adsorbents catalysis of coupling and use of nonporous films yadav et al 2015 furthermore new catalysts such as metalloporphyrins polymers are excited by violet and visible light by using only 3 of the available solar energy for commonly used tio2 merayo et al 2013 fenton s reagent which was discovered in 1894 fenton 1982 clemente et al 2014 is a mixture of h2o2 and ferrous ion which

reaction sequence in an aqueous solution szulżyk cieplak 2017 3 3 4 catalytic oxidation for pahs catalytic oxidation has been primarily used in eliminating 16 pahs consisting of 3 ring 4 ring 5 ring and 6 ring pahs using dihydrogen dioxide in the presence of cobalt titanium and platinum catalysts turek and włodarczyk makuła 2012 turek et al 2015 generally for titanium catalysts maximum reduction of 16 pahs was attained compared with platinum and cobalt catalysts wlodarczyk makula 2011 the results of titanium catalyst show that the pah reduction rate of selected hydrocarbons in terms of pah reduction at the dose of 0 82 ml l is in the following order 6 ring 5 ring 99 4 ring 98 3 ring 79 similarly for platinum catalysts the highest reduction of 16 pahs was achieved ata dose of 1 64 ml l and the pah reduction of the examined hydrocarbons in the following order 5 ring 45 6 ring 34 3 ring 26 4 ring 22 for cobalt catalyst a maximum reduction of 16 pahs was attained at the dose of 1 64 ml l and the pah reduction rate of selected hydrocarbons decreased in the following order 6 ring 61 5 ring 50 4 ring 22 3 ring 9 turek et al 2015 catalytic peroxidation cpo is a promising technique in which homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are used to degrade organic pollutants by using h2o2 as an oxidant this method is easily performed under mild conditions and low energy consumption a variety of free radicals are generated by h2o2 along with other reactive species that are capable of decomposing or transforming organic substances the generated reactive species that act as oxidants and reductants during cpo are shown in fig 4 lou et al 2009 heterogeneous cpo systems have been loaded with different transition metals on numerous solid materials domingueza et al 2014 subbaramaiah et al 2013a the solid supported materials provide sufficient surface area for the interaction of organic pollutants with hydroxyl radicals which are active resulting in improved removal efficiency of organic pollutants recovery and separation of heterogeneous catalysts are easily facilitated in treated effluent yoshino et al 2014 valkaj and katovic 2011 copper is readily available cheap and widely used as a catalyst compared with other transition metals such as palladium ruthenium gold and platinum domingueza et al 2014 valkaj and katovic 2011 sba 15 is also used as a catalyst due to its stability selectivity and activity that increase its surface properties subbaramaiah et al 2013b kjellman and alfredsson 2013 4 performance evaluation of pahs removal techniques several technologies such as adsorption coagulation flocculation membrane separation and biological and electrochemical processes have been used to remove pahs from wastewater among the chemical processes aops are the most commonly used method for pah removal the removal performance and optimal operating parameters of conventional pahs treatment processes are summarized in table 3 researchers found that 86 of pahs related to 2 ring hydrocarbons e g nap and di methyl nap in papermaking wastewater were effectively removed using a combined treatment of electro oxidation reactions followed by adsorption these processes also efficiently treat the pahs with 3 and 4 ring carbon however improvement in the design and operation of wastewater treatment systems is necessary to enhance the degradation rate gong et al 2017 previous studies showed that the removal efficiencies of 16 pahs in a coke wastewater plant were 53 and 67 using a filtration process incorporating sand bed and reverse osmosis process respectively smol et al 2018 after secondary treatment most of the micropollutants except pahs flame retardants and tire leachate compounds were removed with a removal efficiency in the range of 81 1 92 9 furthermore the removal efficiency of pahs in the range of 32 99 3 was achieved in advanced treatment processes thus the findings suggested that a combination of secondary treatment with appropriate advanced treatment processes is highly effective in reducing micropollutants in municipal wastewater treatment plants wang et al 2018 in a textile wastewater treatment plant degradation of typical pahs such as fluorene fl phe an and dibenz a h anthracene dba was investigated using o3 h2o2 process at optimum conditions a 0 4 l min flow rate of o3 0 60 mol l h2o2 concentration 15 min reaction time and ph 7 were considered the removal efficiency was in the following order 89 for fl 81 for dba 71 for an and 66 for phe these removal rates increased by 5 5 21 and 27 for fl dba an and phe respectively with h2o2 addition to the o3 process within 30 min ning et al 2015 the pah removal rate was 90 for pyrene and 87 for phenanthrene at optimum conditions of influent flow 0 35 ml min when initial concentrations of pyrene and phenanthrene were 60 mg l researchers found that the best suited model for pah removal and enzyme activity is the quadratic model predicted by response surface methodology with a variation of feed flow rate and initial pah concentration baniasadi et al 2018 the average removal efficiency of total pahs by biodegradation was 85 in a wastewater treatment plant in harbin china the main sources of pahs were identified in heating and non heating seasons through principal component analysis researchers found a higher removal efficiency of 5 and 6 ring pahs compared with pahs congeners due to biosorption sun et al 2018a 2018b the pah removal rate exceeded 95 in the case of 3 ring pahs after a 21 day treatment using a combination of biological i e mad and chemical processes i e metix and stabiox metix bs mad process with the addition of tw80 enhanced the removal rate of 4 ring pahs in addition in the metix ac process almost 45 of 3 ring pah removal was contributed by sludge whereas the elecstab process removed approximately 62 of 3 ring pahs moreover poor treatment performance of 3 ring pahs 35 was observed in stabiox these investigated processes were not efficient for high molecular weight i e 5 ring pahs by sludge adsorption zhang et al 2018 the estimated reduction rates of pahs and spahs in the polluted rivers wastewater collected from sources such as coal combustion were 33 and 30 while that from wastewater treatment upgrading was 15 therefore the reduction from the source was more effective than that from the wastewater treatment upgrading to reduce pahs and spahs in urban receiving industrial wastewater from rivers qiao et al 2018 fig 5 based on the chemical structure of pah high removal capacities i e 80 of fl ant fn py and phe were achieved in adsorption systems in contrast lower retention was achieved for nap acl and ac nisticò et al 2017 furthermore performance evaluation is understood adequately by studying various nonlinear methods such as langmuir freundlich cooney 1999 temkin febrianto et al 2009 redlich peterson redlich and peterson 1959 and webbers and morris 1965 models the removal of pahs adsorption from wastewater was investigated using adsorbents including al mcm 41 araújo et al 2008 and zeolite chang et al 2004 and the results were compared with the findings of the present study the relevant adsorption capacities and langmuir adsorption constants are summarized in table 4 the pah adsorption was studied using different substances including chitosan sugar bagasse coconut shells chitin and immature coal leonardite crisafulli et al 2008 zeledón toruño et al 2007 the corresponding adsorption capacities and freundlich adsorption constants are listed in table 4 generally high pah removal efficiency can be achieved in membrane bioreactors mbrs and the treatment performance of mbr varies with distinct properties of different pahs the removal mechanisms include sludge adsorption biotransformation biodegradation zvolatilization and air stripping lehnberg et al 2009 margot et al 2015 low molecular weight pahs e g phenanthrene are more easily removed than larger molecules e g fluoranthene high molecular weight pahs are mainly removed by adsorption to sludge particle and further removed to the atmosphere from liquid and sediment phases through air stripping in the course of aerated treatment the pah concentration of the effluent of mbr was within the detection limit the significance of air stripping limits the volatilization and biodegradation mechanisms the toxicity of pahs which exhibit low bio availability of microorganisms cannot be anticipated because of high removal through air stripping in mbrs gonzález et al 2012 this review has provided some informative data for a better understanding of the performance evaluation of different treatment systems aops e g fenton reagent are successfully applied for organic pollutant removal which helps to calculate the optimal conditions for the effective removal of pahs the most important governing factor is the ph level which is predominant in improving the efficiency of the fenton reaction among the aops fenton oxidation and ozone based oxidation are widely investigated and broadly applied methods for pah removal these techniques attain approximately 15 95 of cod removal with the concentration varying from 0 6 mg ml to 26 mg ml the fenton process is the best method because of the simple process without mass transfer limitation homogeneous mature low cost and non toxic fenton process used as pre treatment of biological processes can significantly reduce the operating cost of treatment systems and improve their removal efficiency due to chemical stability pahs have been referred to persistent organic pollutants pops which cause of lung skin and bladder cancer to the humans directly connected to pahs also affects environment badly to understand the relationships in between cancers and the environments mainly depends on the exposure of pahs akinpelu et al 2019a some pahs such as naphthalene as well as fluorene listed as pops its also affects the human health as well as environments badly to remove these from polluted contaminated water using chronicled heavily author links open overlay panel akinpelu et al 2019b the performance evaluation of pah removal was conducted in five wwtps in jordan the removal of six pahs namely fluoranthene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene benzo ghi perylene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene was investigated in different unit operations and processes among the six pahs the involvement of fluoranthene was the highest accounting for 62 66 of the total pahs the removal efficiencies of the six pahs were in the range of 73 83 and 24 56 in biological treatment systems and aerated grit process respectively wu et al 2013 evaluated that the final sedimentation and disinfection for pah removal were limited 5 summary and outlook over the years different conventional and advanced oxidation processes have been used to remove pahs from wastewater among the methods reviewed in this study conventional methods are not entirely removing pahs removal of pahs remains a challenge due to the complexity undesirable by products and adverse effects of these materials understanding of the performance evaluation can be improved by studying various nonlinear methods such as langmuir freundlich temkin redlich peterson and webbers and morris models as well as chemical biological electrochemical oxidation and other existing processes in spite off available techniques possess their own advantages and disadvantages however they are not efficient in pahs degradation in terms of yield removal efficiency destruction of high ring pahs i e complex pah compounds ease of use cost effectiveness analytical recovery and performance evaluation compared with other techniques the main disadvantage is that this process is not focused on the complete recovery of contaminants in recent years more efficient aops and catalytic oxidation techniques have been developed and used frequently for pahs removal this review discussed in detail the different treatment techniques along with their mechanisms oxidant doses and operating parameters that affect the removal efficiency through a rigorous performance evaluation of the available techniques the coupling of aops and catalytic oxidation processes can be applied simultaneously to degrade high ring pahs more than 5 and 6 rings to achieve highly sophisticated results this approach would ensure that monitoring of wastewater treatment using uplc ms ms is economical and possesses high removal efficiency regardless of conventional techniques used based on the reported literature this review concludes that further research needs to focus on pahs removal in wastewater using aops as well as combined aops systems along with other treatment techniques for evaluating optimizing and analyzing operating conditions studying reaction intermediates and their performance estimating of degradation kinetics and designing productive geometric configuration reactors and their materials in addition combined or coupled processes have to be strategically targeted in the context of industrial scale importance few studies on pahs removal have been reported and feasible and applicable treatment techniques have been discussed in this review in the future further development of aop techniques in single and combined systems for pahs removal should be emphasized several studies have reported that aops used alone are effective in pahs removal however the simultaneous application of different aops promotes the degradation rates of pahs thereby leading to synergistic effects typical examples include uv o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 tio2 and uv tio2 fe2 us fe2 and us uv tio2 among others the main problem related to aops application lies in the relatively high operating costs associated with the reagents e g h2o2 and energy consumption although using solar radiation can reduce these costs moreover all of these processes can form by products that are more toxic than the target compounds furthermore these processes may be susceptible to the scavenging effect of oh by non target pollutants thereby reducing process efficiency although the use of aops coupled with biological processes is not yet a prevalent exercise it promises to be a lucrative answer for handling industrial effluents comprising pahs in the future aspects aops can transform pahs into biodegradable compounds in a relatively short time therefore using an aops followed by a biological process could be considered an effective option for the degradation of pahs especially if an mbr is involved the performance evaluation of different removal techniques are discussed in details and found that highest reduction for 5 or 6 ring pahs was obtained 99 while in case of 3 ring only 79 reduction with oxidant dose of 1 64 ml l using titanium catalyst by catalytic oxidation process as compared to other available techniques such as electrochemical oxidation process biodegradation adsorption in case of 2 ring only eg nap and dimethyl nap removal efficiency is found 86 with combined treatment of electro oxidation reactions followed by adsorption of paper making wastewater while these processes also efficiently degrade 3 ring and 4 ring pahs the average removal efficiency of total pahs by biodegradation was found 85 for wastewater in case of textile wastewater treatment plant at an optimum condition achieved removal efficiency in order of 89 for fl 66 for ph 71 for an and 81 for dba using ozonation treatment process these efficiency enhanced with addition of h2o2 in case of mwtps using secondary techniques the average removal efficiency found in the range of 81 1 92 9 while for aops are 32 99 3 here overall yield through aops most suitable if process used with some catalyst enhanced the yield as well and suitable for high ring as well as low ring pahs too among various processes advanced oxidation and catalytic oxidation processes are the most valuable and promising techniques for pahs removal various treatment techniques have been studied and found that aops have higher efficiency and more effective compare to other conventional techniques these are more capable highly efficient higher energy consumption consuming less time more reliable eco friendly in some cases because use natural catalysts a very few works have been found and reported for pahs removal earlier here discussed possible treatment techniques in future a strong focus should be given to the further development of aops techniques for pahs removal in both single and combined form additional revisions have to be conducted chiefly concerning pahs conversion rates with combined aop biological processes to estimate and elevate the operational conditions appraise the toxicity of the reaction intermediates apprehend the degradation kinetics and advance enhanced reactor geometric configurations and materials amongst further serious restrictions another critical task is the development of strategies for the use of combined processes at an industrial scale declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science

calculated air water interfacial awi adsorption data are presented for solution mixtures of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas specifically a series of binary and one ternary mixtures of homologous linear perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas in a simulated groundwater and two 8 component mixtures containing both pfcas and linear perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas in all cases non ideal competitive adsorption was observed that favored the most surface active component s of the solution mixture the multi component extended langmuir el isotherm model was observed to accurately predict the competitive adsorption observed in the binary and ternary pfca solution mixtures however the predictive utility of the el model was observed to diminish when mixtures contained both pfcas and pfsas which differ in their hydrophile structure resulting in overpredictions and underpredictions of the awi adsorption isotherms derived from measured data depending on the specific components present in the solution mixtures observations indicate that the individual component adsorptive affinities for the awi can change in response to competitive preferential adsorption as their solution concentrations increase that is not being captured by the el model our results demonstrate that alternative mathematical models are needed that support concentration dependent affinity coefficients for non similar mixtures of pfas such that the transport of individual target pfas components within a larger mixture of components can be accurately predicted across a wider range of solution concentration keywords pfas pfas mixtures air water interfacial adsorption vadose zone unsaturated transport competitive adsorption 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas present in the vadose zone due to the past use of pfas containing aqueous film forming foams afff for fire suppression has been identified as a long term source of groundwater contamination shin et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2019 therefore it is important to understand and characterize the mechanisms of pfas transport in the vadose zone to better risk assessment and potential remedial actions pfas can be retained in the vadose zone by a combination of mechanisms including adsorption to soil surfaces and soil organic phases higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 and adsorption at air water interfaces awi owing to their surface active properties brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 silva et al 2019a b brusseau et al 2019 schaefer et al 2019 costanza et al 2019 pfas awi adsorption has been recently shown to be a significant source of retention in the vadose zone brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 silva et al 2019a b costanza et al 2019 for example lyu et al 2018 demonstrated that awi adsorption contributed as much as 50 70 of the total transport retardation of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in water unsaturated laboratory columns brusseau et al 2019 performed similar laboratory experiments and observed similar retention for pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos silva et al 2019a expanded the database for pfas awi adsorption by presenting awi adsorption constants k aw for six linear perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca of environmental interest for six different ionic strength conditions simulating a range of natural groundwater geochemistry which were derived from measured data with a few recent exceptions most research investigating pfas awi adsorption and its impact on vadose zone transport to date have largely focused on monocomponent adsorption however pfas contamination within afff source zones is typically a complex mixture of numerous components each of which can compete with other components for adsorption at the awi for example vectis et al 2008 observed competitive adsorption for binary solution mixtures of pfoa and pfos that greatly favored the adsorption of pfos the most surface active component likewise brusseau and van glubt 2019 observed competitive adsorption for binary mixtures of pfoa and perfluorotridecanoic acid solutions when one or more strongly surface active components within a mixture outcompete the other components for adsorption at the awi this can affect the transport of the less surface active components in the mixture competitive adsorption for pfas occurs as adsorbed concentrations increase and approach monolayer coverage silva et al 2019b in keeping with the langmuir model of adsorption for surfactants competitive adsorption should be negligible at lower concentrations i e within the linear adsorption regime and adsorption of the various components should occur according to their individual surface activities however the significance of competitive adsorption for pfas at afff source zones is not entirely clear based on the existing field data to date most pfas site investigations have provided pfas concentration data in soil and phreatic groundwater however pfas concentrations for tension held pore waters c pw within and beneath pfas source areas remain largely uncharacterized pfca concentrations in groundwater collected from former fire training sites have been reported to fall within the μg l range moody and field 1999 mcguire et al 2014 anderson et al 2016 weber et al 2017 within this range of values linear henry s adsorption at the awi can be assumed however on some occasions concentrations in groundwater samples have been found to be in the mg l range for example moody and field 1999 reported pfoa at a concentration of 6 5 mg l in groundwater collected adjacent to a former burn pit at naval air station fallon nv similarly pfos was reported at concentrations ranging between 0 5 and 6 4 mg l at wells adjacent to a former fire training area at joint base cape cod ma weber et al 2017 these groundwater samples were collected from within the phreatic zone using monitoring wells often screened across a wide depth interval e g 5 10 ft and dilution of pfas concentration within these samples is expected additionally dispersion in the vadose zone between the source and groundwater is highly likely and can contribute to relatively lower observed groundwater concentrations thus higher pfas concentrations i e within in the mg l range could exist within the overlying vadose zone source area that is the source of the phreatic groundwater contamination additional evidence for potential elevated pore water concentrations i e greater than reported phreatic groundwater concentrations can be extracted from the published dataset for example soil concentrations c sorb of pfos ranging up to 4 and 36 mg kg were reported for samples collected at two fire training areas mcguire et al 2014 baduel et al 2017 using a reported soil sorption coefficient k d of 1 15 l kg for pfos ferrey et al 2012 calculated pore water concentrations c pw i e assuming linear sorption and using c pw c sorb k d are as high as 3 3 and 30 mg l similarly mcguire et al 2014 also report soil concentrations for pfoa at ellsworth air force base fire training area that ranged as high as 3 10 mg kg k d values for pfoa have been reported to range between 0 27 and 0 6 l kg ferrey et al 2012 guelfo and higgins 2013 calculated c pw values for pfoa at these sites would then range between 5 and 16 7 mg l these c pw values are considerably higher than the low μg l range of values typically reported for groundwater at these sites and fall within the range of values that could promote competitive adsorption therefore it is important to characterize pore water concentrations at pfas source areas to allow proper numerical simulation of pfas transport in the vadose zone to our knowledge the results of direct sampling and analyses of pfas concentrations in tension held pore waters within and beneath pfas source areas has not been published to provide an informed comparison nonetheless herein we evaluate the effect of competitive adsorption on the retention of pfas components when present in mixture we also evaluate the utility of the extended langmuir el model to predict the effects of competitive adsorption by comparison with measured data or relationships derived from measured data for pfas mixtures this type of evaluation is significant because environmental professionals are often interested in the transport of a few pfas of regulatory concern e g pfoa and pfos and their transport can be affected by the presence of other pfas and non pfas co contaminants present at afff source areas the existing monocomponent awi adsorption dataset presented in the current literature on the subject does not allow this type of evaluation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich co and used without further purification perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa pfoa perfluorodecanoic acid pfda perfluorononanoic acid pfna and perfluodecanoic acid pfda were selected as representative pfcas the free acid form of these pfcas were selected to mimic the form produced in situ by the degradation and or oxidation of precursor compounds pfos perflurohexane sulfonate pfhxs and perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs as representative perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas were also purchased as free acids deionized di water used in this work conformed to the american society for testing and materials astm type ii specification sodium bicarbonate nahco3 calcium sulfate caso4 2h2o magnesium sulfate mgso4 and potassium chloride kcl salts were used to prepare solutions of simulated groundwater sgw 2 2 methods 2 2 1 solutions preparation the sgw solution used in this work was prepared from di water and included the following inorganic salts nahco3 48 mg l caso4 2h2o 30 mg l mgso4 30 mg l and kcl 2 mg l the ph and ionic strength of the sgw was 7 3 and 0 023 m respectively using this sgw solution single component solution standards and mixture standards were prepared within 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles and the preparations slowly agitated for 48 h prior to use 2 2 2 aqueous surface tension measurements and awi adsorption coefficients the surface tension of these solution standards was measured using a du nouy ring tensiometer fisher surface tensiomat model 21 fisher scientific using standard ring methods astm standard d1331 1989 the tensiometer was calibrated using manufacturer recommended methods measurements were repeated until the measured tension deviated within less than 1 across three consecutive measurements the results of these measurements were used to construct isotherms of surface tension γ versus bulk aqueous concentration c w the following form of the szyszkowski equation was selected to fit the tension isotherm data adamson and gast 1997 1 γ γ 0 b ln 1 c w a where γ 0 is the surface tension of water for pure water or water at the ionic strength of interest and a and b are fitting parameters eq 1 was fit to the data by minimizing the sum of the squared error between measured and predicted values the szyszkowski equation fit was then used in all further analyses as it provided a data set of higher resolution for calculating interfacial parameters awi adsorption coefficients k aw units or cm3 cm2 or cm were calculated from the surface tension isotherms using the following form of the gibbs equation kim et al 1997 szymczyk and janczuk 2007 2 k aw γ c w 1 rt δγ δ c w t where γ is the surface concentration mole or mass per unit area r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature of measurement this involved calculating the incremental change in the slope of the fitted tension isotherm data i e dγ dc w across the range of solution concentrations of interest and applying eq 2 lyu et al 2018 demonstrated by comparison with the results of transport experiments that measured surface tension isotherms can be used to predict awi adsorption coefficients and estimate retardation factors resulting from awi adsorption in porous media the form of eq 2 assumes the presence of dissolved electrolytes in excess of total pfas concentrations which is appropriate for the use of the sgw solution and the range of pfas concentrations values used to calculate k aw values k aw values presented herein were calculated for total pfas concentrations less than the total solution electrolyte concentration to be consistent with eq 2 because k aw values are concentration dependent one must select a specific solution concentration when comparing retention characteristics for different pfas to simplify comparisons between individual pfass the concentration independent langmuir coefficient k l is additionally used in this work when the langmuir isotherm is explicitly used eq 1 can be written as the langmuir szyszkowski ls equation siddiqui and franses 1996 zhmud et al 2000 rosen 2012 3 γ γ 0 γ 0 rt γ max ln 1 k l c w where γ max is the maximum surface concentration observed as dissolved concentrations approach the solubility limit and r and t are the universal gas constant and temperature of measurement respectively the a parameter in eq 1 is 1 k l and b γ 0 rtγ max eq 3 is useful because k l and γ max can be directly calculated from the surface tension isotherm data and can be used to model the concentration dependence of awi adsorption directly via the standard form of the langmuir equation or 4 γ γ max k l c w 1 k l c w with respect to the data fit it should be noted that this approach utilizes measured data at higher aqueous concentrations and the surface tension of water at zero pfca concentration to anchor the fit of the ls equation thereafter the approach relies on model interpolation to ultimately calculate interfacial adsorption parameters at concentrations below the limit of surface tension measurement therefore it is assumed that the ls equation continues to appropriately describe surface tension changes due to awi adsorption at lower environmentally relevant concentrations 2 2 3 modeling multi component adsorption mathematical methods to characterize the composition of adsorbed surfactant molecules at the awi are well documented in the literature e g hutchinson 1948 rosen and hua 1982 gu and rosen 1988 these referenced approaches each assume regular solution theory i e ideal mixing and synergistic adsorption i e total adsorption for the mixture is in excess of that provided by the individual component isotherms alone as adsorptive synergism was not observed for the pfca mixtures used in this work these methods could not be used and another approach was required the method selected to estimate adsorbed composition of the pfca mixtures utilized the minimum adsorbed surface area per molecule a m calculated from the ls equation fit to the measured data as kissa 2001 5 a m nm 2 10 14 γ max n a where n a is avagadro s number for the binary mixtures the surface adsorbed mole fraction x s of the more surface active component adsorbed at the awi x 1s was then estimated by 6 x 1 s a m mix a m min a m max a m min where a m mix is the a m value determined from the mixture isotherm a m min is the minimum value associated with the least surface active component of the binary system and a m max is the value for the most surface active component the surface mole fraction of the least surface active component x 2s is determined as x 2s 1 x 1s the use of a m values to characterize surface adsorbed mole fractions of surfactants at the awi is represented in the literature e g gu and rosen 1989 and assumes that the area occupied by a surfactant in a mixed monolayer is not significantly different from that in a monolayer of the same surfactant adsorbed from a single component solution calculated x s values were compared to predictions for the same binary mixtures using the multi component extended langmuir el model markham and benton 1931 to evaluate the utility of the model to describe pfas adsorption at the awi across an environmentally significant range of concentrations the el model used has the following form 7 γ e i γ max i k l i c w i 1 j 1 n k l j c w j where γ e i is the equilibrium adsorbed concentration of component i and the concentration dependence of equilibrium adsorbed concentration of a mixture γ mix i n γ e i the el model holds the same basic assumptions as the langmuir model for monocomponent adsorption a a homogeneous surface energies of adsorption b no interaction between adsorbed species c monolayer adsorption d equal availability of adsorption sites e reversible adsorption and maximum adsorption equivalent to saturated monolayer adsorption of the solutes weber 1972 mckay et al 1989 γ max and k l for each component is determined from filling eq 4 to monocomponent data 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfca binary mixtures 3 1 1 surface tension isotherms examples of the measured surface tension isotherms for the monocomponent pfcas and pfca binary mixtures are presented in fig 1 specific pfca binary pairs were selected to evaluate a wide range of surface activity and in the results shown pfda is in all cases the most surface active pfaa the results of the szyskowski equation eq 1 fit to the measured surface tension data are provided in table 1 as shown in fig 1 a d the surface tension isotherms for each of the pfca mixtures are positioned entirely within the bounds of the monocomponent isotherms which demonstrates a lack of synergistic or cooperative adsorption for these chemicals at the awi rather the relative positioning of the mixture isotherms demonstrates competitive adsorption at the awi that is dominated by the adsorption of pfda as the most surface active component this competitive adsorption is best observed for the equimolar i e 50 50 mol mixtures where the positioning of the isotherms is weighted toward pfda in all cases competitive adsorption was also reported in the recent literature for mixtures of pfoa and perfluorotridecanoic acid brusseau and van glubt 2019 and for a 1 1 pfoa and pfos mixture vectis et al 2008 3 1 2 adsorbed surface composition and modeling also provided in fig 1 e f are the equilibrium surface composition diagrams for each pfca binary mixture represented as the surface adsorbed mole fraction of pfda that were calculated using eq 6 and a min derived from the least squares fit to the measured surface tension data c f table 1 the results of the el model predictions for these binary mixtures is also presented for comparison in all cases awi adsorption was non ideal with the observed positive deviations from the ideal case in fig 1 indicating competitive adsorption that favors pfda this non ideal competitive awi adsorption was also observed to become more significant as the difference in surface activity of the mixture components increased i e adsorption selectivity with pfpea being the least surface active pfca evaluated in these cases the el model well represented the calculated equilibrium composition of the mixed monolayer adsorbed at the awi at elevated concentrations for these binary pfca mixtures and for other pfca binary mixtures examined during this work where pfda was not included data not shown the el model also captured the adsorption selectivity observed in the measured data the predictiveness of the el model for these binary pfas cases was somewhat surprising given the observed competitive adsorption of these molecules which would violate the langmuir model assumption of no interaction between adsorbates however given that the el model represents the adsorbed equilibrium condition the net effect of competitive adsorption appears to be adequately captured another violated condition of the el model is that each adsorbate possesses the same or very similar γ max markham and benton 1931 valenciano et al 2015 which is not the case for these pfcas particularly for pfpea still the combined and individual component adsorption of these pfcas at the awi appears to be adequately represented by the weighted averaging of the affinity constants i e k l in the mixture despite the variability in γ max these results presented in fig 1 e h are representative of the equilibrium adsorbed composition at monolayer coverage as the solution concentration of the components decrease i e to include the henry s law or linear adsorption regime the equilibrium composition will become dependent only on the individual k l values which is also represented by the el model these results are significant in that they suggest the el model utilizing langmuir parameters for individual components can be used to predict the awi adsorption and surface adsorbed composition of these binary pfca mixtures across a wide range of solution concentration this initial finding will be tested for more complex mixtures in a subsequent section 3 1 3 implications for pfas transport the practical implication of the observed competitive adsorption is that as adsorbed pfas concentrations increase and approach monolayer coverage preferential adsorption of the more surface active components at awi s could limit the adsorption of the less surface active components in the mixture this condition could occur within pfas source areas and would have the effect of accelerating the transport of the less surface active components compared to predictions made using awi adsorption parameters derived from monocomponent isotherms as adsorbed concentrations decrease and ultimately fall within the linear adsorption regime for all components interactions between adsorbed molecules at the awi would become increasingly less likely and the adsorption of individual components of a mixture would theoretically occur as prescribed by their individual monocomponent isotherms given the uncertainty in pfas concentrations possible within the vadose zone beneath afff impacted sites the model selected to describe awi adsorption of pfas mixtures should represent adsorption across these concentration regimes the el model results were used to explore the effect of competitive adsorption on pfas retention by evaluating the change in the awi partition coefficients k aw i γ i c w i as a function of solution concentration and mole fraction of components in solution the results of these calculations for the binary pfca dataset are provided in fig 2 at low concentration model k aw values match those obtained from monocomponent measurements however as solution concentrations increase the modeled k aw values are shown to depart from the monocomponent k aw c w functions in response to competitive and preferential adsorption these results demonstrate that the preferential adsorption of one or more components in a pfas mixture can reduce the k aw values of other components that can in turn impact the rate of transport of these less retained components in some cases an order of magnitude decrease in k aw was observed as solution concentrations approach 10 mg l the solution concentration at which the departure occurs and degree of departure from the monocomponent k aw c w function was observed to be dependent on the relative solution mole fractions of the components and the difference in k l values trends are generally consistent with those of the surface composition diagrams for the equimolar condition i e 50 50 mol cases in fig 2 pfda awi adsorption remains dominant and its k aw c w function follows that of the monocomponent pfda case across the entire environmentally significant range of solution concentrations k aw c w functions for pfna pfoa and pfhpa each depart from their corresponding monocomponent functions indicating that the retention of these components would be reduced during transport in the vadose zone for the pfda pfna solutions the effect of the solution phase composition on the interplay between awi adsorption and component k aw c w functions is observed to be more dynamic as the mole fraction of pfna is increased it becomes the dominant component adsorbed at the awi and begins to reduce the retention of pfda i e k aw for pfda is reduced relative to pfna because the mcl model predicts the surface adsorbed concentrations in these binary cases the k aw c w functions calculated from the model predictions can be considered reliable for use in simulating the vadose zone transport of individual pfas chemicals when present in a mixture 3 2 evaluating more complex pfas mixtures more complex pfaa mixtures were prepared to gain additional insight into the awi competitive adsorption dynamics and to further evaluate the utility of the el model specifically three ternary mixtures composed of pfda pfoa and pfpea and an 8 component mixture containing both pfcas and pfsas were prepared measured surface tension isotherms for the ternary mixtures and the corresponding k aw c w functions derived from the el equation results are provided in fig 3 surface composition calculations were not performed for these mixtures because interpreting adsorbed fractions for mixtures with three or more components using the a m approach becomes increasingly ambiguous as was the case for the binary pfca mixtures the positioning of the surface tension isotherms for the ternary mixtures used in this work indicates competitive adsorption and preferential adsorption of pfda as the most surface active component the position of the mixture isotherms is greatly affected by presence of pfda in solution likewise the k aw c w functions for the ternary mixture show the preferential awi adsorption of pfda and the effect of adsorption on the k aw values of the other components as the solution composition changes again k aw for pfoa and pfpea were observed to decrease by as much as an order of magnitude as solution concentrations approach 10 mg l increasing the mole fraction of pfda resulted in a less significant effect on the pfoa and pfpea k aw values within the solution concentration range of interest for the cases presented decreasing the pfda mole fraction in the mixture increased the effect on pfoa and pfpea k aw values however based on the binary pfca mixture evaluation there should be a limit to this effect where further reductions in the pfda mole fraction will result in a corresponding reduction in the pfda k aw values due to the emerging preferential adsorption of the component with the more favorable combination of solution mole fraction contribution and k l value the 8 component mixture was an equimolar solution that included the following components pfda pfna pfoa pfhpa and pfpea pfos pfhxs and pfbs the surface tension isotherm prepared for this mixture and the monocomponent isotherms for each component are provided in fig 4 again the surface tension isotherm for the mixture is greatly influenced by presence of pfda and pfos in solution which are the two most surface active components in the mixture note also that the slope of the mixture isotherm within the monolayer region is generally between those of the monocomponent pfcas and pfsas the slope of the surface tension isotherm is directly related to the magnitude of γ max which is dependent on the packing density at the awi and therefore a min because the sulfonate hydrophile is larger than the carboxylate hydrophile calculated a min values for the pfsas will be greater than those for the pfcas for the same hydrophobe chain length shinoda et al 1972 kissa 1981 table 1 this work which implies lower packing densities for the pfsas as monocomponents compared to the pfcas therefore the slope of the mixture isotherms suggests an overall reduction in packing density at the awi relative to the pfcas and the presence of a mixed monolayer containing both pfsas and pfcas k aw c w functions for each of the 8 components in the mixture calculated from the el model results are also provided in fig 4 as was demonstrated for the ternary mixture the effect of competitive adsorption on the degree of departure of the mixture k aw values from the monocomponent values is observed to increase with decreasing surface activity of the component contrary to the ternary mixture results the awi adsorption of the less surface active components in the 8 component mixture are shown to impact the predicted k aw values of the more surface active components as the total concentration of components increase these results again highlight the importance of including the effects of preferential and competitive adsorption for pfass at the awi when simulating pfas fate and transport in the vadose zone 3 3 a closer look at the mcl model the el model was initially selected in this work because of its simplicity in that it uses monocomponent adsorption parameters as input and is therefore easily incorporated into existing water unsaturated flow and transport simulators e g hydrus the use of individual monocomponent adsorption parameters also allows the direct use of monocomponent adsorption parameters derived from quantitative structure activity relationships and other similar relationships for estimating adsorption parameters of pfas components for which measured tension adsorption isotherm data have not yet been prepared the k aw c w functions predicted exhibit the anticipated form in that k aw predicted equals that derived from the measured monocomponent data at very low solution surface concentration in the absence of measured surface adsorbed mole fraction data for these more complicated mixtures it is difficult to know if the el model is accurately predicting the equilibrium adsorbed composition at the awi and therefore the k aw c w functions for individual components of the mixture as concentrations increase however some insight can be gained from examining the total γ e mix c w functions as i n γ e i the surface adsorbed pfas compositions and comparison of the γ e mix c w functions for the ternary pfca mixtures the 8 component mixture and those of a similar 8 component mixture derived from the literature i e schaefer et al 2019 hereafter referred to as the literature mixture are provided in fig 5 as was discussed previously for each of the ternary mixtures pfda dominates awi adsorption more importantly the γ e mix c w functions predicted by the el model match those derived from the mixture surface tension isotherms which implies that the el model is accurately representing the surface adsorbed composition and that individual component k aw c w functions are reliable conversely when the number of components increase and pfsas are included in the mixture γ e mix c w functions predicted from the mcl model deviate from the corresponding data derived functions i e γ e mix i n γ e i for the 8 component mixture the el model underpredicts the data derived γ e mix c w function within the lower concentration range of interest and overestimates γ e mix values as concentrations approach the monolayer regime ultimately overestimating γ max for the mixture root mean squared error of the prediction rmsep 2 37 10 6 rmsep within concentration range of interest rmsep 10 was 1 43 10 6 for the literature mixture the el model was found to underpredict the data derived γ e mix c w function across the entire range of solution concentration rmsep 1 28 10 6 rmsep 10 1 11 10 7 these results suggest that the adsorbed composition predicted by the el model is not the same as the true adsorbed composition at the awi for these more complex mixtures these results also suggest that as the complexity and number of pfas components in a mixture increase the use of monocomponent k l values to describe the affinity of individual components for the awi becomes less valid as the individual affinities of the components for the awi appears to change with increasing concentration in response to competitive adsorption and the resulting equilibrium readjustment in the system k l is only a constant if the enthalpy and thus free energy of adsorption is independent of surface coverage markham and benton 1931 liu y 2009 despite this discrepancy in the γ e mix c w functions the el model continues to provide k aw c w functions that closely match monocomponent values at low concentrations i e within the linear range of adsorption because solution concentrations are low enough that the el model predictions are not significantly different from the monocomponent langmuir equation prediction however as solution concentrations increase toward the monolayer regime k aw values predicted by the el model could differ from actual values overestimation of the γ e mix c w function would result in an increase in k aw and an underestimation provides reduced k aw values for the actual solutions for the specific mixtures used here the effect on k aw values calculated from the mcl model results are considered reasonable for the concentration range of interest i e c w 10 mg l however as the complexity of the mixture increases as would be the case for pore water solutions within pfas source areas an alternative model may be needed to more reliably describe the interplay between adsorbed pfas components at the awi and the solution phase during unsaturated transport achieving a better match between the data derived γ e mix c w function and the el model predicted function requires either 1 a change in surface composition with increasing concentration for the mixture or 2 a change in the way the affinity of each component for the awi varies with concentration adjusting el model parameters to match the data derived γ e mix c w functions for both the 8 component and literature mixture across the entire range of solution concentration provided the adsorbed pfas compositions shown in fig 6 note that for the literature mixture the surface adsorbed composition did not change significantly from the original mcl model prediction however for the 8 component mixture the surface composition needed to match the data derived γ e mix c w function required the near elimination of pfas components from the awi at monolayer coverage which is not supported by the analysis of the mixture surface tension isotherm in terms of a min section 3 2 to implement a variable awi affinity for the mixture components the following modified el model was employed 8 γ e i γ max i k l i c w i 1 j 1 n k l j c w j η l j where the parameter η l j is an interaction parameter dependent on the concentration of other components in eq 8 the numerator provides a linear concentration dependence to maintain el model predictions at low concentration and the denominator effectively modifies k l values by incorporating interaction between individual components by assigning η l values of 0 6 0 65 and 0 7 to pfda pfos and pfna respectively all other η l were unit values the modified el model more closely matched the data derived γ e mix c w rmsep 2 63 10 7 rmsep 10 8 67 10 8 as shown in fig 7a likewise a better match to the data derived γ e mix c w function for the literature mixture was obtained when η l for pfos was assigned a value of 1 12 all other η l were unit values rmsep 1 39 10 6 rmsep 10 9 18 10 8 note the overall lower k aw predicted for the 8 component mixture when these changes were made compared to the original el model predictions fig 5b k aw c w functions for the three most surface active components of literature mixture are also provided in fig 7 for comparison although the modified el model used here provides a better match to the data derived γ e mix c w functions the values of η l used are currently not bound to theory validation of the η l values used await measurement of specific binary adsorption isotherm data additional mathematical methods to address the observed concentration dependence on the affinity coefficient for pfas mixtures will need be evaluated as additional complex mixture adsorption data is produced however validation of these models would be best served by the physical measurement of surface adsorbed mole fractions and characterization of adsorbed pfas compositions at the awi at different concentration regimes these models will be ultimately included in the hydrus simulator that was originally modified by the authors of this manuscript to simulate pfas vadose zone transport under transient variably saturated flow conditions silva et al 2019b 3 4 addressing recently observed enhanced awi adsorption at low pfas concentration throughout this presentation langmuir based isotherm equations were assumed valid for describing pfas adsorption at the awi even for pfas concentrations below the limits of surface tension measurement the langmuir equation was specifically selected and used to be consistent with previous work and because it is the basis for the szyszkowski equation that was used to fit the measured surface tension isotherms the langmuir equation also allowed for distributing adsorbed mass between mixture components from a mixed monolayer and has a thermodynamic basis as demonstrated herein at low solution concentrations the langmuir equation predicts a constant k aw value for individual components which arises from linear adsorption i e henry isotherm and the assumed absence of inter molecular interactions between adsorbed pfas molecules as solution concentrations decrease however schaefer et al 2019 recently reported measured awi adsorbed concentrations and k aw values for pfas within the very low i e μg l to ng l range of solution concentration that were in excess of those predicted by the langmuir equation and concluded that the fruendlich isotherm provides a more reasonable prediction for pfas uptake at the awi as represented in fig 8 the k aw values provided by schaefer et al 2019 increase with decreasing concentration as the bulk pfas concentration becomes increasingly dilute schaefer et al 2019 also demonstrated that the total multicomponent interfacial adsorption for their pfaa mixture could be predicted using monocomponent adsorption freundlich parameters via an additive adsorption model which implies ideal awi adsorption at dilute solution concentration low surface coverage no interaction between adsorbed molecules given the potential implications to the results presented herein i e langmuir equation potentially underpredicting awi adsorption of pfas within the lower range of solution concentration the results presented by schaefer et al 2019 warrant consideration schaefer et al 2019 did not provide a mechanistic description for the enhanced adsorption however if the freundlich isotherm equation truly best represents pfas adsorption at dilute concentration awi adsorption within this range would not be linear as predicted using the langmuir equation but rather non linear with the slope of γ c w incrementally decreasing with increasing concentration applying eq 2 this would provide an initially higher k aw with its value decreasing as shown in fig 8 additional research is needed to externally validate the observed enhanced awi adsorption observed by schaefer et al 2019 and to provide a clear mechanistic understanding for the enhanced adsorption observed still in the interest of acknowledging the implications of these results modeling this enhanced adsorption was addressed here rather than relying on the freundlich equation alone the following hybrid langmuir freundlich lf isotherm equation was employed from ayawei et al 2017 8 γ γ max k lf c w m lf 1 k lf c w m lf where k lf is the lf equation equilibrium constant and m lf is a surface heterogeneity parameter that varies between 0 and 1 eq 8 provides the benefits of the langmuir equation for describing awi adsorption at high adsorbate concentrations i e monolayer adsorption region and conforms to the freundlich isotherm model at low adsorbate concentration in preparing fig 8 k lf values were the monocomponent k l values for pfos and pfoa provided in table 1 this allowed the adsorbed concentrations within the monolayer concentration regime to be properly represented by the langmuir equation m lf values for pfos and pfoa were assigned values of 0 6 and 0 67 respectively and were selected to match the slope of the k aw c w function for these compounds as presented by schaefer et al 2019 these results demonstrate that the enhanced adsorption observed by schaefer et al 2019 can be described by a simple model that could be incorporated into existing unsaturated flow and transport simulators likewise a mathematical model similar to eq 8 could eventually be developed to also account for the competitive adsorption effects for awi adsorption for pfas mixtures at higher pfas concentrations which is the overriding focus of this current paper 4 summary and conclusions the data presented shows that pfas solution mixtures can exhibit non ideal competitive adsorption at the awi in keeping with the langmuir adsorption model when adsorbed concentrations are low competitive interactions at the surface are negligible however as concentrations increase competitive adsorption begins to change the adsorbed pfas composition at the awi competitive preferential adsorption of the more surface active components reduces the adsorption of the other components in the mixture with respect to transport of pfas mixtures in the vadose zone the preferentially adsorbed components will be more retained relative to the less adsorbed components the reduced adsorption has the effect of accelerating the transport of the less surface active components compared to predictions made using awi adsorption parameters derived from monocomponent isotherms this effect was demonstrated herein by the deviation of k aw c w functions compared to those for the monocomponent functions while the el model was shown to represent the effects of competitive adsorption for the binary and ternary pfca mixtures the predictive utility of the el model diminished as the number of components increased to include both pfca and pfsa components that differ in their hydrophile structure and adsorption energies the results of this evaluation suggest that for complex multi component pfas mixtures the el model which uses monocomponent langmuir adsorption parameters is not accurately representing the adsorbed composition of pfas at the awi with respect to predicting pfas transport parameters this observation is less problematic at low solution concentration i e within the linear adsorption regime wherein individual component concentrations in the mixture are low enough that calculated surface concentrations are very close to their corresponding monocomponent values however as component concentrations increase and competitive adsorption processes become more pronounced errors in predictions of the adsorbed composition at the awi can lead to errors in adsorption parameters which in turn affect predicted component transport retention due to awi adsorption this evaluation also observed that models used to describe the awi adsorption of complex pfas mixtures in terms of pfas structure and number of components may need to include concentration dependent adsorption affinity coefficients because a single representative value may not be valid across a wide range of solution

calculated air water interfacial awi adsorption data are presented for solution mixtures of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas specifically a series of binary and one ternary mixtures of homologous linear perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas in a simulated groundwater and two 8 component mixtures containing both pfcas and linear perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas in all cases non ideal competitive adsorption was observed that favored the most surface active component s of the solution mixture the multi component extended langmuir el isotherm model was observed to accurately predict the competitive adsorption observed in the binary and ternary pfca solution mixtures however the predictive utility of the el model was observed to diminish when mixtures contained both pfcas and pfsas which differ in their hydrophile structure resulting in overpredictions and underpredictions of the awi adsorption isotherms derived from measured data depending on the specific components present in the solution mixtures observations indicate that the individual component adsorptive affinities for the awi can change in response to competitive preferential adsorption as their solution concentrations increase that is not being captured by the el model our results demonstrate that alternative mathematical models are needed that support concentration dependent affinity coefficients for non similar mixtures of pfas such that the transport of individual target pfas components within a larger mixture of components can be accurately predicted across a wider range of solution concentration keywords pfas pfas mixtures air water interfacial adsorption vadose zone unsaturated transport competitive adsorption 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas present in the vadose zone due to the past use of pfas containing aqueous film forming foams afff for fire suppression has been identified as a long term source of groundwater contamination shin et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2019 therefore it is important to understand and characterize the mechanisms of pfas transport in the vadose zone to better risk assessment and potential remedial actions pfas can be retained in the vadose zone by a combination of mechanisms including adsorption to soil surfaces and soil organic phases higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 and adsorption at air water interfaces awi owing to their surface active properties brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 silva et al 2019a b brusseau et al 2019 schaefer et al 2019 costanza et al 2019 pfas awi adsorption has been recently shown to be a significant source of retention in the vadose zone brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 silva et al 2019a b costanza et al 2019 for example lyu et al 2018 demonstrated that awi adsorption contributed as much as 50 70 of the total transport retardation of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in water unsaturated laboratory columns brusseau et al 2019 performed similar laboratory experiments and observed similar retention for pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos silva et al 2019a expanded the database for pfas awi adsorption by presenting awi adsorption constants k aw for six linear perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca of environmental interest for six different ionic strength conditions simulating a range of natural groundwater geochemistry which were derived from measured data with a few recent exceptions most research investigating pfas awi adsorption and its impact on vadose zone transport to date have largely focused on monocomponent adsorption however pfas contamination within afff source zones is typically a complex mixture of numerous components each of which can compete with other components for adsorption at the awi for example vectis et al 2008 observed competitive adsorption for binary solution mixtures of pfoa and pfos that greatly favored the adsorption of pfos the most surface active component likewise brusseau and van glubt 2019 observed competitive adsorption for binary mixtures of pfoa and perfluorotridecanoic acid solutions when one or more strongly surface active components within a mixture outcompete the other components for adsorption at the awi this can affect the transport of the less surface active components in the mixture competitive adsorption for pfas occurs as adsorbed concentrations increase and approach monolayer coverage silva et al 2019b in keeping with the langmuir model of adsorption for surfactants competitive adsorption should be negligible at lower concentrations i e within the linear adsorption regime and adsorption of the various components should occur according to their individual surface activities however the significance of competitive adsorption for pfas at afff source zones is not entirely clear based on the existing field data to date most pfas site investigations have provided pfas concentration data in soil and phreatic groundwater however pfas concentrations for tension held pore waters c pw within and beneath pfas source areas remain largely uncharacterized pfca concentrations in groundwater collected from former fire training sites have been reported to fall within the μg l range moody and field 1999 mcguire et al 2014 anderson et al 2016 weber et al 2017 within this range of values linear henry s adsorption at the awi can be assumed however on some occasions concentrations in groundwater samples have been found to be in the mg l range for example moody and field 1999 reported pfoa at a concentration of 6 5 mg l in groundwater collected adjacent to a former burn pit at naval air station fallon nv similarly pfos was reported at concentrations ranging between 0 5 and 6 4 mg l at wells adjacent to a former fire training area at joint base cape cod ma weber et al 2017 these groundwater samples were collected from within the phreatic zone using monitoring wells often screened across a wide depth interval e g 5 10 ft and dilution of pfas concentration within these samples is expected additionally dispersion in the vadose zone between the source and groundwater is highly likely and can contribute to relatively lower observed groundwater concentrations thus higher pfas concentrations i e within in the mg l range could exist within the overlying vadose zone source area that is the source of the phreatic groundwater contamination additional evidence for potential elevated pore water concentrations i e greater than reported phreatic groundwater concentrations can be extracted from the published dataset for example soil concentrations c sorb of pfos ranging up to 4 and 36 mg kg were reported for samples collected at two fire training areas mcguire et al 2014 baduel et al 2017 using a reported soil sorption coefficient k d of 1 15 l kg for pfos ferrey et al 2012 calculated pore water concentrations c pw i e assuming linear sorption and using c pw c sorb k d are as high as 3 3 and 30 mg l similarly mcguire et al 2014 also report soil concentrations for pfoa at ellsworth air force base fire training area that ranged as high as 3 10 mg kg k d values for pfoa have been reported to range between 0 27 and 0 6 l kg ferrey et al 2012 guelfo and higgins 2013 calculated c pw values for pfoa at these sites would then range between 5 and 16 7 mg l these c pw values are considerably higher than the low μg l range of values typically reported for groundwater at these sites and fall within the range of values that could promote competitive adsorption therefore it is important to characterize pore water concentrations at pfas source areas to allow proper numerical simulation of pfas transport in the vadose zone to our knowledge the results of direct sampling and analyses of pfas concentrations in tension held pore waters within and beneath pfas source areas has not been published to provide an informed comparison nonetheless herein we evaluate the effect of competitive adsorption on the retention of pfas components when present in mixture we also evaluate the utility of the extended langmuir el model to predict the effects of competitive adsorption by comparison with measured data or relationships derived from measured data for pfas mixtures this type of evaluation is significant because environmental professionals are often interested in the transport of a few pfas of regulatory concern e g pfoa and pfos and their transport can be affected by the presence of other pfas and non pfas co contaminants present at afff source areas the existing monocomponent awi adsorption dataset presented in the current literature on the subject does not allow this type of evaluation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich co and used without

testing and materials astm type ii specification sodium bicarbonate nahco3 calcium sulfate caso4 2h2o magnesium sulfate mgso4 and potassium chloride kcl salts were used to prepare solutions of simulated groundwater sgw 2 2 methods 2 2 1 solutions preparation the sgw solution used in this work was prepared from di water and included the following inorganic salts nahco3 48 mg l caso4 2h2o 30 mg l mgso4 30 mg l and kcl 2 mg l the ph and ionic strength of the sgw was 7 3 and 0 023 m respectively using this sgw solution single component solution standards and mixture standards were prepared within 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles and the preparations slowly agitated for 48 h prior to use 2 2 2 aqueous surface tension measurements and awi adsorption coefficients the surface tension of these solution standards was measured using a du nouy ring tensiometer fisher surface tensiomat model 21 fisher scientific using standard ring methods astm standard d1331 1989 the tensiometer was calibrated using manufacturer recommended methods measurements were repeated until the measured tension deviated within less than 1 across three consecutive measurements the results of these measurements were used to construct isotherms of surface tension γ versus bulk aqueous concentration c w the following form of the szyszkowski equation was selected to fit the tension isotherm data adamson and gast 1997 1 γ γ 0 b ln 1 c w a where γ 0 is the surface tension of water for pure water or water at the ionic strength of interest and a and b are fitting parameters eq 1 was fit to the data by minimizing the sum of the squared error between measured and predicted values the szyszkowski equation fit was then used in all further analyses as it provided a data set of higher resolution for calculating interfacial parameters awi adsorption coefficients k aw units or cm3 cm2 or cm were calculated from the surface tension isotherms using the following form of the gibbs equation kim et al 1997 szymczyk and janczuk 2007 2 k aw γ c w 1 rt δγ δ c w t where γ is the surface concentration mole or mass per unit area r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature of measurement this involved calculating the incremental change in the slope of the fitted tension isotherm data i e dγ dc w across the range of solution concentrations of interest and applying eq 2 lyu et al 2018 demonstrated by comparison with the results of transport experiments that measured surface tension isotherms can be used to predict awi adsorption coefficients and estimate retardation factors resulting from awi adsorption in porous media the form of eq 2 assumes the presence of dissolved electrolytes in excess of total pfas concentrations which is appropriate for the use of the sgw solution and the range of pfas concentrations values used to calculate k aw values k aw values presented herein were calculated for total pfas concentrations less than the total solution electrolyte concentration to be consistent with eq 2 because k aw values are concentration dependent one must select a specific solution concentration when comparing retention characteristics for different pfas to simplify comparisons between individual pfass the concentration independent langmuir coefficient k l is additionally used in this work when the langmuir isotherm is explicitly used eq 1 can be written as the langmuir szyszkowski ls equation siddiqui and franses 1996 zhmud et al 2000 rosen 2012 3 γ γ 0 γ 0 rt γ max ln 1 k l c w where γ max is the maximum surface concentration observed as dissolved concentrations approach the solubility limit and r and t are the universal gas constant and temperature of measurement respectively the a parameter in eq 1 is 1 k l and b γ 0 rtγ max eq 3 is useful because k l and γ max can be directly calculated from the surface tension isotherm data and can be used to model the concentration dependence of awi adsorption directly via the standard form of the langmuir equation or 4 γ γ max k l c w 1 k l c w with respect to the data fit it should be noted that this approach utilizes measured data at higher aqueous concentrations and the surface tension of water at zero pfca concentration to anchor the fit of the ls equation thereafter the approach relies on model interpolation to ultimately calculate interfacial adsorption parameters at concentrations below the limit of surface tension measurement therefore it is assumed that the ls equation continues to appropriately describe surface tension changes due to awi adsorption at lower environmentally relevant concentrations 2 2 3 modeling multi component adsorption mathematical methods to characterize the composition of adsorbed surfactant molecules at the awi are well documented in the literature e g hutchinson 1948 rosen and hua 1982 gu and rosen 1988 these referenced approaches each assume regular solution theory i e ideal mixing and synergistic adsorption i e total adsorption for the mixture is in excess of that provided by the individual component isotherms alone as adsorptive synergism was not observed for the pfca mixtures used in this work these methods could not be used and another approach was required the method selected to estimate adsorbed composition of the pfca mixtures utilized the minimum adsorbed surface area per molecule a m calculated from the ls equation fit to the measured data as kissa 2001 5 a m nm 2 10 14 γ max n a where n a is avagadro s number for the binary mixtures the surface adsorbed mole fraction x s of the more surface active component adsorbed at the awi x 1s was then estimated by 6 x 1 s a m mix a m min a m max a m min where a m mix is the a m value determined from the mixture isotherm a m min is the minimum value associated with the least surface active component of the binary system and a m max is the value for the most surface active component the surface mole fraction of the least surface active component x 2s is determined as x 2s 1 x 1s the use of a m values to characterize surface adsorbed mole fractions of surfactants at the awi is represented in the literature e g gu and rosen 1989 and assumes that the area occupied by a surfactant in a mixed monolayer is not significantly different from that in a monolayer of the same surfactant adsorbed from a single component solution calculated x s values were compared to predictions for the same binary mixtures using the multi component extended langmuir el model markham and benton 1931 to evaluate the utility of the model to describe pfas adsorption at the awi across an environmentally significant range of concentrations the el model used has the following form 7 γ e i γ max i k l i c w i 1 j 1 n k l j c w j where γ e i is the equilibrium adsorbed concentration of component i and the concentration dependence of equilibrium adsorbed concentration of a mixture γ mix i n γ e i the el model holds the same basic assumptions as the langmuir

adsorption and maximum adsorption equivalent to saturated monolayer adsorption of the solutes weber 1972 mckay et al 1989 γ max and k l for each component is determined from filling eq 4 to monocomponent data 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfca binary mixtures 3 1 1 surface tension isotherms examples of the measured surface tension isotherms for the monocomponent pfcas and pfca binary mixtures are presented in fig 1 specific pfca binary pairs were selected to evaluate a wide range of surface activity and in the results shown pfda is in all cases the most surface active pfaa the results of the szyskowski equation eq 1 fit to the measured surface tension data are provided in table 1 as shown in fig 1 a d the surface tension isotherms for each of the pfca mixtures are positioned entirely within the bounds of the monocomponent isotherms which demonstrates a lack of synergistic or cooperative adsorption for these chemicals at the awi rather the relative positioning of the mixture isotherms demonstrates competitive adsorption at the awi that is dominated by the adsorption of pfda as the most surface active component this competitive adsorption is best observed for the equimolar i e 50 50 mol mixtures where the positioning of the isotherms is weighted toward pfda in all cases competitive adsorption was also reported in the recent literature for mixtures of pfoa and perfluorotridecanoic acid brusseau and van glubt 2019 and for a 1 1 pfoa and pfos mixture vectis et al 2008 3 1 2 adsorbed surface composition and modeling also provided in fig 1 e f are the equilibrium surface composition diagrams for each pfca binary mixture represented as the surface adsorbed mole fraction of pfda that were calculated using eq 6 and a min derived from the least squares fit to the measured surface tension data c f table 1 the results of the el model predictions for these binary mixtures is also presented for comparison in all cases awi adsorption was non ideal with the observed positive deviations from the ideal case in fig 1 indicating competitive adsorption that favors pfda this non ideal competitive awi adsorption was also observed to become more significant as the difference in surface activity of the mixture components increased i e adsorption selectivity with pfpea being the least surface active pfca evaluated in these cases the el model well represented the calculated equilibrium composition of the mixed monolayer adsorbed at the awi at elevated concentrations for these binary pfca mixtures and for other pfca binary mixtures examined during this work where pfda was not included data not shown the el model also captured the adsorption selectivity observed in the measured data the predictiveness of the el model for these binary pfas cases was somewhat surprising given the observed competitive adsorption of these molecules which would violate the langmuir model assumption of no interaction between adsorbates however given that the el model represents the adsorbed equilibrium condition the net effect of competitive adsorption appears to be adequately captured another violated condition of the el model is that each adsorbate possesses the same or very similar γ max markham and benton 1931 valenciano et al 2015 which is not the case for these pfcas particularly for pfpea still the combined and individual component adsorption of these pfcas at the awi appears to be adequately represented by the weighted averaging of the affinity constants i e k l in the mixture despite the variability in γ max these results presented in fig 1 e h are representative of the equilibrium adsorbed composition at monolayer coverage as the solution concentration of the components decrease i e to include the henry s law or linear adsorption regime the equilibrium composition will become dependent only on the individual k l values which is also represented by the el model these results are significant in that they suggest the el model utilizing langmuir parameters for individual components can be used to predict the awi adsorption and surface adsorbed composition of these binary pfca mixtures across a wide range of solution concentration this initial finding will be tested for more complex mixtures in a subsequent section 3 1 3 implications for pfas transport the practical implication of the observed competitive adsorption is that as adsorbed pfas concentrations increase and approach monolayer coverage preferential adsorption of the more surface active components at awi s could limit the adsorption of the less surface active components in the mixture this condition could occur within pfas source areas and would have the effect of accelerating the transport of the less surface active components compared to predictions made using awi adsorption parameters derived from monocomponent isotherms as adsorbed concentrations decrease and ultimately fall within the linear adsorption regime for all components interactions between adsorbed molecules at the awi would become increasingly less likely and the adsorption of individual components of a mixture would theoretically occur as prescribed by their individual monocomponent isotherms given the uncertainty in pfas concentrations possible within the vadose zone beneath afff impacted sites the model selected to describe awi adsorption of pfas mixtures should represent adsorption across these concentration regimes the el model results were used to explore the effect of competitive adsorption on pfas retention by evaluating the change in the awi partition coefficients k aw i γ i c w i as a function of solution concentration and mole fraction of components in solution the results of these calculations for the binary pfca dataset are provided in fig 2 at low concentration model k aw values match those obtained from monocomponent measurements however as solution concentrations increase the modeled k aw values are shown to depart from the monocomponent k aw c w functions in response to competitive and preferential adsorption these results demonstrate that the preferential adsorption of one or more components in a pfas mixture can reduce the k aw values of other components that can in turn impact the rate of transport of these less retained components in some cases an order of magnitude decrease in k aw was observed as solution concentrations approach 10 mg l the solution concentration at which the departure occurs and degree of departure from the monocomponent k aw c w function was observed to be dependent on the relative solution mole fractions of the components and the difference in k l values trends are generally consistent with those of the surface composition diagrams for the equimolar condition i e 50 50 mol cases in fig 2 pfda awi adsorption remains dominant and its k aw c w function follows that of the monocomponent pfda case across the entire environmentally significant range of solution concentrations k aw c w functions for pfna pfoa and pfhpa each depart from their corresponding monocomponent functions indicating that the retention of these components would be reduced during transport in the vadose zone for the pfda pfna solutions the effect of the solution phase composition on the interplay between awi adsorption and component k aw c w functions is observed to be more dynamic as the mole fraction of pfna is increased it becomes the dominant component adsorbed at the awi and begins to reduce the retention of pfda i e k aw for pfda is reduced relative to pfna because the mcl model predicts the surface adsorbed concentrations in these binary cases the k aw c w functions calculated from the model predictions can be considered reliable for use in simulating the vadose zone transport of individual pfas chemicals when present in a mixture 3 2 evaluating more complex pfas mixtures more complex pfaa mixtures were prepared to gain additional insight into the awi competitive adsorption dynamics and to further evaluate the utility of the el model specifically three ternary mixtures composed of pfda pfoa and pfpea and an 8 component mixture containing both pfcas and pfsas were prepared measured surface tension isotherms for the ternary mixtures and the corresponding k aw c w functions derived from the el equation results are provided in fig 3 surface composition calculations were not performed for these mixtures because interpreting adsorbed fractions for mixtures with three or more components using the a m approach becomes increasingly ambiguous as was the case for the binary pfca mixtures the positioning of the surface tension isotherms for the ternary mixtures used in this work indicates competitive adsorption and preferential adsorption of pfda as the most surface active component the position of the mixture isotherms is greatly affected by presence of pfda in solution likewise the k aw c w functions for the ternary mixture show the preferential awi adsorption of pfda and the effect of adsorption on the k aw values of the other components as the solution composition changes again k aw for pfoa and pfpea were observed to decrease by as much as an order of magnitude as solution concentrations approach 10 mg l increasing the mole fraction of pfda resulted in a less significant effect on the pfoa and pfpea k aw values within the solution concentration range of interest for the cases presented decreasing the pfda mole fraction in the mixture increased the effect on pfoa and pfpea k aw values however based on the binary pfca mixture evaluation there should be a limit to this effect where further reductions in the pfda mole fraction will result in a corresponding reduction in the pfda k aw values due to the emerging preferential adsorption of the component with the more favorable combination of solution mole fraction contribution and k l value the 8 component mixture was an equimolar solution that included the following components pfda pfna pfoa pfhpa and pfpea pfos pfhxs and pfbs the surface tension isotherm prepared for this mixture and the monocomponent isotherms for each component are provided in fig 4 again the surface tension isotherm for the mixture is greatly influenced by presence of pfda and pfos in solution which are the two most surface active components in the mixture note also that the slope of the mixture isotherm within the monolayer region is generally between those of the monocomponent pfcas and pfsas the slope of the surface tension isotherm is directly related to the magnitude of γ max which is dependent on the packing density at the awi and therefore a min because the sulfonate hydrophile is larger than the carboxylate hydrophile calculated a min values for the pfsas will be greater than those for the pfcas for the same hydrophobe chain length shinoda et al 1972 kissa 1981 table 1 this work which implies lower packing densities for the pfsas as monocomponents compared to the pfcas therefore the slope of the mixture isotherms suggests an overall reduction in packing density at the awi relative to the pfcas and the presence of a mixed monolayer containing both pfsas and pfcas k aw c w functions for each of the 8 components in the mixture calculated from the el model results are also provided in fig 4 as was demonstrated for the ternary mixture the effect of competitive adsorption on the degree of departure of the mixture k aw values from the monocomponent values is observed to increase with decreasing surface activity of the component contrary to the ternary mixture results the awi adsorption of the less surface active components in the 8 component mixture are shown to impact the predicted k aw values of the more surface active components as the total concentration of components increase these results again highlight the importance of including the effects of preferential and competitive adsorption for pfass at the awi when simulating pfas fate and transport in the vadose zone 3 3 a closer look at the mcl model the el model was initially selected in this work because of its simplicity in that it uses monocomponent adsorption parameters as input and is therefore easily incorporated into existing water unsaturated flow and transport simulators e g hydrus the use of individual monocomponent adsorption parameters also allows the direct use of monocomponent adsorption parameters derived from quantitative structure activity relationships and other similar relationships for estimating adsorption parameters of pfas components for which measured tension adsorption isotherm data have not yet been prepared the k aw c w functions predicted exhibit the anticipated form in that k aw predicted equals that derived from the measured monocomponent data at very low solution surface concentration in the absence of measured surface adsorbed mole fraction data for these more complicated mixtures it is difficult to know if the el model is accurately predicting the equilibrium adsorbed composition at the awi and therefore the k aw c w functions for individual components of the mixture as concentrations increase however some insight can be gained from examining the total γ e mix c w functions as i n γ e i the surface adsorbed pfas compositions and comparison of the γ e mix c w functions for the ternary pfca mixtures the 8 component mixture and those of a similar 8 component mixture derived from the literature i e schaefer et al 2019 hereafter referred to as the literature mixture are provided in fig 5 as was discussed previously for each of the ternary mixtures pfda dominates awi adsorption more importantly the γ e mix c w functions predicted by the el model match those derived from the mixture surface tension isotherms which implies that the el model is accurately representing the surface adsorbed composition and that individual component k aw c w functions are reliable conversely when the number of components increase and pfsas are included in the mixture γ e mix c w functions predicted from the mcl model deviate from the corresponding data derived functions i e γ e mix i n γ e i for the 8 component mixture the el model underpredicts the data derived γ e mix c w function within the lower concentration range of interest and overestimates γ e mix values as concentrations approach the monolayer regime ultimately overestimating γ max for the mixture root mean squared error of the prediction rmsep 2 37 10 6 rmsep within concentration range of interest rmsep 10 was 1 43 10 6 for the literature mixture the el model was found to underpredict the data derived γ e mix c w function across the entire range of solution concentration rmsep 1 28 10 6 rmsep 10 1 11 10 7 these results suggest that the adsorbed composition predicted by the el model is not the same as the true adsorbed composition at the awi for these more complex mixtures these results also suggest that as the complexity and number of pfas components in a mixture increase the use of monocomponent k l values to describe the affinity of individual components for the awi becomes less valid as the individual affinities of the components for the awi appears to change with increasing concentration in response to competitive adsorption and the resulting equilibrium readjustment in the system k l is only a constant if the enthalpy and thus free energy of adsorption is independent of surface coverage markham and benton 1931 liu y 2009 despite this discrepancy in the γ e mix c w functions the el model continues to provide k aw c w functions that closely match monocomponent values at low concentrations i e within the linear range of adsorption because solution concentrations are low enough that the el model predictions are not significantly different from the monocomponent langmuir equation prediction however as solution concentrations increase toward the monolayer regime k aw values predicted by the el model could differ from actual values overestimation of the γ e mix c w function would result in an increase in k aw and an underestimation provides reduced k aw values for the actual solutions for the specific mixtures used here the effect on k aw values calculated from the mcl model results are considered reasonable for the concentration range of interest i e c w 10 mg l however as the complexity of the mixture increases as would be the case for pore water solutions within pfas source areas an alternative model may be needed to more reliably describe the interplay between adsorbed pfas components at the awi and the solution phase during unsaturated transport achieving a better match between the data derived γ e mix c w function and the el model predicted function requires either 1 a change in surface composition with increasing concentration for the mixture or 2 a change in the way the affinity of each component for the awi varies with concentration adjusting el model parameters to match the data derived γ e mix c w functions for both the 8 component and literature mixture across the entire range of solution concentration provided the adsorbed pfas compositions shown in fig 6 note that for the literature mixture the surface adsorbed composition did not change significantly from the original mcl model prediction however for the 8 component mixture the surface composition needed to match the data derived γ e mix c w function required the near elimination of pfas components from the awi at monolayer coverage which is not supported by the analysis of the mixture surface tension isotherm in terms of a min section 3 2 to implement a variable awi affinity for the mixture components the following modified el model was employed 8 γ e i γ max i k l i c w i 1 j 1 n k l j c w j η l j where the parameter η l j is an interaction parameter dependent on the concentration of other components in eq 8 the numerator provides a linear concentration dependence to maintain el model predictions at low concentration and the denominator effectively modifies k l values by incorporating interaction between individual components by assigning η l values of 0 6 0 65 and 0 7 to pfda pfos and pfna respectively all other η l were unit values the modified el model more closely matched the data derived γ e mix c w rmsep 2 63 10 7 rmsep 10 8 67 10 8 as shown in fig 7a likewise a better match to the data derived γ e mix c w function for the literature mixture was obtained when η l for pfos was assigned a value of 1 12 all other η l were unit values rmsep 1 39 10 6 rmsep 10 9 18 10 8 note the overall lower k aw predicted for the 8 component mixture when these changes were made compared to the original el model predictions fig 5b k aw c w functions for the three most surface active components of literature mixture are also provided in fig 7 for comparison although the modified el model used here provides a better match to the data derived γ e mix c w functions the values of η l used are currently not bound to theory validation of the η l values used await measurement of specific binary adsorption isotherm data additional mathematical methods to address the observed concentration dependence on the affinity coefficient for pfas mixtures will need be evaluated as additional complex mixture adsorption data is produced however validation of these models would be best served by the physical measurement of surface adsorbed mole fractions and characterization of adsorbed pfas compositions at the awi at different concentration regimes these models will be ultimately included in the hydrus simulator that was originally modified by the authors of this manuscript to simulate pfas vadose zone transport under transient variably saturated flow conditions silva et al 2019b 3 4 addressing recently observed enhanced awi adsorption at low pfas concentration throughout this presentation langmuir based isotherm equations were assumed valid for describing pfas adsorption at the awi even for pfas concentrations below the limits of surface tension measurement the langmuir equation was specifically selected and used to be consistent with previous work and because it is the basis for the szyszkowski equation that was used to fit the measured surface tension isotherms the langmuir equation also allowed for distributing adsorbed mass between mixture components from a mixed monolayer and has a thermodynamic basis as demonstrated herein at low solution concentrations the langmuir equation predicts a constant k aw value for individual components which arises from linear adsorption i e henry isotherm and the assumed absence of inter molecular interactions between adsorbed pfas molecules as solution concentrations decrease however schaefer et al 2019 recently reported measured awi adsorbed concentrations and k aw values for pfas within the very low i e μg l to ng l range of solution concentration that were in excess of those predicted by the langmuir equation and concluded that the fruendlich isotherm provides a more reasonable prediction for pfas uptake at the awi as represented in fig 8 the k aw values provided by schaefer et al 2019 increase with decreasing concentration as the bulk pfas concentration becomes increasingly dilute schaefer et al 2019 also demonstrated that the total multicomponent interfacial adsorption for their pfaa mixture could be predicted using monocomponent adsorption freundlich parameters via an additive adsorption model which implies ideal awi adsorption at dilute solution concentration low surface coverage no interaction between adsorbed molecules given the potential implications to the results presented herein i e langmuir equation potentially underpredicting awi adsorption of pfas within the lower range of solution concentration the results presented by schaefer et al 2019 warrant consideration schaefer et al 2019 did not provide a mechanistic description for the enhanced adsorption however if the freundlich isotherm equation truly best represents pfas adsorption at dilute concentration awi adsorption within this range would not be linear as predicted using the langmuir equation but rather non linear with the slope of γ c w incrementally decreasing with increasing concentration applying eq 2 this would provide an initially higher k aw with its value decreasing as shown in fig 8 additional research is needed to externally validate the observed enhanced awi adsorption observed by schaefer et al 2019 and to provide a clear mechanistic understanding for the enhanced adsorption observed still in the interest of acknowledging the implications of these results modeling this enhanced adsorption was addressed here rather than relying on the freundlich equation alone the following hybrid langmuir freundlich lf isotherm equation was employed from ayawei et al 2017 8 γ γ max k lf c w m lf 1 k lf c w m lf where k lf is the lf equation equilibrium constant and m lf is a surface heterogeneity parameter that varies between 0 and 1 eq 8 provides the benefits of the langmuir equation for describing awi adsorption at high adsorbate concentrations i e monolayer adsorption region and conforms to the freundlich isotherm model at low adsorbate concentration in preparing fig 8 k lf values were the monocomponent k l values for pfos and pfoa provided in table 1 this allowed the adsorbed concentrations within the monolayer concentration regime to be properly represented by the langmuir equation m lf values for pfos and pfoa were assigned values of 0 6 and 0 67 respectively and were selected to match the slope of the k aw c w function for these compounds as presented by schaefer et al 2019 these results demonstrate that the enhanced adsorption observed by schaefer et al 2019 can be described by a simple model that could be incorporated into existing unsaturated flow and transport simulators likewise a mathematical model similar to eq 8 could eventually be developed to also account for the competitive adsorption effects for awi adsorption for pfas mixtures at higher pfas concentrations which is the overriding focus of this current paper 4 summary and conclusions the data presented shows that pfas solution mixtures can exhibit non ideal competitive adsorption at the awi in keeping with the langmuir adsorption model when adsorbed concentrations are low competitive interactions at the surface are negligible however as concentrations increase competitive adsorption begins to change the adsorbed pfas composition at the awi competitive preferential adsorption of the more surface active components reduces the adsorption of the other components in the mixture with respect to transport of pfas mixtures in the vadose zone the preferentially adsorbed components will be more retained relative to the less adsorbed components the reduced adsorption has the effect of accelerating the transport of the less surface active components compared to predictions made using awi adsorption parameters derived from monocomponent isotherms this effect was demonstrated herein by the deviation of k aw c w functions compared to those for the monocomponent functions while the el model was shown to represent the effects of competitive adsorption for the binary and ternary pfca mixtures the predictive utility of the el model diminished as the number of components increased to include both pfca and pfsa components that differ in their hydrophile structure and adsorption energies the results of this evaluation suggest that for complex multi component pfas mixtures the el model which uses monocomponent langmuir adsorption parameters is not accurately representing the adsorbed composition of pfas at the awi with respect to predicting pfas transport parameters this observation is less problematic at low solution concentration i e within the linear adsorption regime wherein individual component concentrations in the mixture are low enough that calculated surface concentrations are very close to their corresponding monocomponent values however as component concentrations increase and competitive adsorption processes become more pronounced errors in predictions of the adsorbed composition at the awi can lead to errors in adsorption parameters which in turn affect predicted component transport retention due to awi adsorption this evaluation also observed that models used to describe the awi adsorption of complex pfas mixtures in terms of pfas structure and number of components may need to include concentration dependent adsorption affinity coefficients because a single representative value may not be valid across a wide range of solution

1462,heterogeneity across a broad range of scales in geologic porous media often manifests in observations of non fickian or anomalous transport while traditional anomalous transport models can successfully make predictions in certain geological systems increasing evidence suggests that assumptions relating to independent and identically distributed increments constrain where and when they can be reliably applied a relatively novel model the spatial markov model smm relaxes the assumption of independence the smm belongs to the family of correlated continuous time random walks and has shown promise across a wide range of transport problems relevant to natural porous media it has been successfully used to model conservative as well as more recently reactive transport in highly complex flows ranging from pore scales to much larger scales of interest in geology and subsurface hydrology in this review paper we summarize its original development and provide a comprehensive review of its advances and applications as well as lay out a vision for its future development 1 introduction heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of natural porous media and the complex geological media that make up the subsurface and their associated flow and transport processes span a vast range of scales from nanometers to hundreds of kilometers cushman 2013 subsurface heterogeneities occur at every scale and specific forms include physical heterogeneities like transitions between hydrofacies dagan 2012 chemical heterogeneities that reflect changing mineralogies allen king et al 2015 and biological heterogeneities like biofilm growth aubeneau et al 2016 among others each kind of heterogeneity can strongly influence the velocity at which substances can move through the porous medium or their residence times one of the most influential parameters on transport is certainly the intrinsic permeability of the medium which governs fluid velocity and pressure through darcy s law permeability is linked to hydraulic conductivity and can vary by orders of magnitude over relatively short distances this extreme variability often yields behaviors that exhibit broad spatial and temporal velocity distributions which are not predicted well by classical continuum based transport theories that model linear scaling of the mean squared displacement i e by specifying fickian dispersion with constant coefficients the transport of contaminants nutrients other dissolved substances such as bacteria colloids nanoparticles viruses etc often exhibits nonlinear temporal scaling of the mean squared displacement x 2 t α α 1 over time scales of practical interest meerschaert et al 2008 dentz et al 2004 and thus is classified as displaying anomalous transport characteristics superdiffusive transport is obtained for α 1 with subdiffusive transport occurring in the opposite case since transport in natural porous media routinely violates the assumptions of the prevailing state of the art models we need models that can capture the influence of heterogeneity across this range of scales that causes these deviations much of the early work on developing effective transport models in porous media built on the pioneering ideas of taylor taylor 1954 and aris aris 1956 these seminal works demonstrated that transport can be described by an effective advection dispersion equation with a fickian dispersion coefficient when a plume is given sufficient time to sample the full distribution of heterogeneous velocity scales common approaches following this idea include the method of moments brenner 2013 volume averaging whitaker 2013 and homogenization hornung 2012 auriault and adler 1995 as powerful and elegant as these upscaling approaches are they are restricted in their application for three main reasons i they are limited to specific ranges of transport regimes e g in terms of péclet or damköhler numbers the latter in the case of reactive transport ii they require the definition of a spatially periodic unit cell to compute effective parameters and iii the effective coefficients so derived may be valid only at asymptotic times which may be prohibitively long depending on the underlying flow structure other pioneering works studying dispersion in porous media include de josselin de jong 1958 saffman 1959 who introduced the concept of residence times to study particle displacement statistics in general anomalous transport behaviors can be predicted starting from a detailed model of the system heterogeneity this for example can be obtained by applying an effective fickian transport model at local scales where the heterogeneity of the system is fully resolved as it is in a multi dimensional spatially distributed model of flow and transport weissmann et al 1999 lee et al 2007 engdahl and maxwell 2015 riva et al 2010 riva et al 2008 once a spatial resolution is chosen to represent heterogeneity this effectively averages out the sub grid heterogeneity allowing transport in each cell to be modeled as a fickian process but the interactions between cells with disparate velocities lead to larger scale non fickian behaviors le borgne et al 2008a engdahl et al 2012 edery et al 2014 bianchi and pedretti 2017 wright et al 2019 the main issue with this approach is that it requires a detailed model of the subsurface heterogeneities the inaccessibility of the subsurface means that geostatistical techniques are required to approximate it carle and fogg 1996 goovaerts 1997 in fully saturated media e g at aquifer scale perturbation approaches may be used to characterize transport statistics as a function of a permeability spatial heterogeneity model e g dagan 1984 however these linearized approaches become inaccurate for increasing degrees of heterogeneity i e when the variance of natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivity exceeds unity even beyond the mere estimation of the intrinsic permeability significant uncertainty exists in the parameter fields e g porosity as well as the initial and boundary conditions and this may require numerically evaluating ensemble statistics to quantify the uncertainty all of which is computationally expensive similar issues arise when considering non fickian behavior emerging from pore scale simulations salles et al 1992 bijeljic and blunt 2006 anomalous transport can be predicted using a pore scale model but this is computationally unfeasible in real large scale applications i e beyond mm scale samples in short the uncertainty and complexity of a distributed parameter model may outweigh its benefits in a predictive capacity and this further motivates the need for simplified or upscaled models a variety of upscaled models have been proposed to describe anomalous transport in geological porous media and have been applied with success some of the most widely used are multi rate mass transfer mrmt haggerty and gorelick 1995 fractional advection dispersion models fade benson et al 2001 and continuous time random walks ctrw berkowitz et al 2006 it is important to emphasize that these are by no means the only anomalous transport models used in porous media but the most widely used due to their demonstrated success across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales their dissemination into the scientific community has been also promoted by openly available computational toolboxes cortis and berkowitz 2005 kelly et al 2017 haggerty et al 2002 despite the specifics of their individual origins it is noteworthy that these models are all highly inter related e g margolin et al 2003 neuman and tartakovsky 2009 berkowitz et al 2002 schumer et al 2003 dentz and berkowitz 2003 choosing any one model over another typically depends on the conceptual model developed by the user which often aligns more naturally with one framework than the others it has been shown that all of these models can be represented by a random walk or by eulerian nonlocal integro differential partial differential equations we focus in this review on lagrangian approaches where particles transition through space and time following prescribed rules benson and meerschaert 2009 berkowitz et al 2006 benson et al 2001 random walks in general are commonly used in the study of transport in porous media as highlighted in a review by noetinger et al noetinger et al 2016 classical fickian transport can be represented as a random walk but the primary difference is that anomalous transport is generated when the distributions of random increments in space or time have infinite variance or mean metzler and klafter 2000 as such the broad or heavy tailed distributions cannot converge by the central limit theorem to classical fickian limiting behavior resulting in anomalous transport it is important to note that in most implementations of lagrangian random walk models fickian or non fickian successive increments are either implicitly or explicitly assumed to be independent and identically distributed while this is a common assumption it is not necessarily correct in this context le borgne and co workers le borgne et al 2007 clearly showed the importance of correlation for geologically realistic heterogeneous porous media and suggested a need to develop models that relax the assumption of independence other authors painter and cvetkovic painter et al 2002 painter and cvetkovic 2005 painter et al 2008 studying transport in fractured geologic media also demonstrated the existence and importance of correlation effects that must be included to upscale transport correctly this can be achieved upon modeling transport by considering probabilistic rules to determine residence times in successive steps using a markov chain as was already envisaged in earlier works de josselin de jong 1958 in a conceptual sense consider that it is more likely for rapidly moving solute particles to continue moving quickly over small time scales than they are to abruptly slow down the latter is possible but less likely on average thus violating the assumption of independent transitions for practical problems relating to transport through porous media the spatial scale where transitions become independent may be larger than the scales of interest for predictions later numerical studies of flow through highly heterogeneous porous media by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2008a le borgne et al 2008b showed similar behavior including a dependence of lagrangian correlations on the local velocity as well as the ability for a particle to experience abrupt changes in velocities from these observations they suggested and then verified that velocities at equidistant positions along a particle trajectory form a markov process in particular they confirmed that fast particles tended to persist at being fast and slow particles tended to remain slow at fixed spatial increments from this they justified a fixed spatial step langevin equation where successive increments in time are correlated reflecting velocity correlation between individual particles steps this kind of model is what we call the spatial markov model smm the smm has shown great promise in replicating simulated and observed transport behaviors across the diverse range of settings and transport scales in geological porous media the model has also gone by the name correlated ctrw and we will use the names interchangeably throughout this article although it should be noted that the name correlated ctrw pertains to a broader family of models than just the smm the objective of this article is to provide an overview of the smm and its many developments and applications over the last decade or so we open with a general overview of the method in section 2 followed by its historical development and applications in porous and fractured media at multiple scales a discussion of random walks defined in terms of analytical models of velocity transitions is then provided complemented with an overview of smm applications to nonlinear transport processes we then close with a critical review of the challenges limitations and avenues for improving the model in the future and consider how to improve parameterizations and parameter identification as well as how to link specific smm model elements with the properties of natural geological media the work presented here focuses exclusively on the development and application of such models in the context of geologic media however it must be noted that correlated ctrws similar in nature to the smm presented here play an important role in other branches of physics also montero and masoliver 2007 tejedor and metzler 2010 as noted by magdziarz et al magdziarz et al 2012 correlations arise when dealing with living systems including bacterial motion rogers et al 2008 the ecology of animal motion nathan et al 2008 and human mobility song et al 2010 as well as in other dynamic systems such as financial markets scalas 2006 montero and masoliver 2017 seismology corral 2006 and chaotic and turbulent flows manneville 2010 2 the spatial markov model the smm is a particle based random walk model that simulates transport the system is described by a large number of particles n where during each step a particle takes a uniform fixed step in space of size l l in this sense it can be seen as a ctrw model or as a time domain random walk model tdrw using the distinction noted by aquino dentz aquino and dentz 2018 the amount of time it takes to perform the step is random but unlike other approaches it is not independent and is conditioned on the time taken to execute the previous step we then describe transport of each particle according to the discrete equation 1 x n 1 x n l t n 1 t n τ n 1 n 0 1 2 where x n l is the particle position at step n t n t denotes the total travel time at step n and the transition time τ n 1 t is sampled from 2 f τ f τ 1 if n 0 f τ n 1 τ n if n 1 2 where f is a joint distribution function of transition times between the discrete travel times in practice smm applications have predominately been 1 d which significantly reduces the complexity and data requirements of the upscaled model but multi dimensional forms also exist e g kang et al 2011a kang et al 2014 most et al 2019 the distribution of transition times f τ 1 is defined as part of the parameterization of a specific smm and f τ 2 τ 1 is modeled using a conditional transition matrix to obtain the transition matrix f τ 1 is separated into n discrete bins typically but not necessarily equiprobable where n is sufficiently large for convergence le borgne et al 2011a bin 1 contains the particles with the fastest travel times and bin n contains particles with the slowest travel times a particle with travel time τ p is in bin i if t c i τ p t c i 1 where t c i is the cutoff time for bin i t c 1 0 and t c n 1 is greater than the maximum value of τ 1 and τ 2 for all particles then the transition matrix is defined by 3 t i j p τ 2 bin j τ 1 bin i f τ 2 τ 1 it is assumed that the process is stationary such that f τ n 1 τ n f τ 2 τ 1 thus each block of the transition matrix t i j describes the probability that a particle will have a travel time in bin j given that its travel time was in bin i in the previous step a typical transition matrix in this case taken from a pore scale flow by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2011a is shown in fig 1 for equiprobable binning of the travel time distribution an uncorrelated ctrw can be obtained in this formulation if t i j 1 n i j this creates a uniformly distributed transition matrix where all bins are equally accessible to all others meaning that the conditional probability f τ n 1 τ n f τ n 1 and there can be no correlation between steps indeed strictly speaking an uncorrelated series of waiting times also represents a markov model a so called markov 0 model thus in this sense any continuous time random walk for the modeling of particle positions in space is based on a spatial markov process a non uniform transition matrix is the distinguishing feature of the smm as we refer to it here relative to their uncorrelated ctrw cousins the travel times τ n for each step along the path is drawn from the conditional distributions and this produces the total time to reach the nth step conceptually the resulting paths share some similarity with stochastic convective transport models simmons et al 1995 ginn et al 2001 or a streamtube ensemble atchley et al 2013 engdahl and maxwell 2014 cirpka et al 2015 3 development applications and implications 3 1 transport in highly heterogeneous permeability fields the first application of the smm in the context of porous media flows was performed by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2008a le borgne et al 2008b who were interested in upscaling transport of a conservative scalar through highly heterogeneous porous media represented by a darcy continuum darcy type flow is described by 4 q x k x h where k x l t is a hydraulic conductivity tensor h l is the head potential and the so called darcy velocity is q x l t the darcy velocity is a mass averaged velocity resulting from the homogenization of pore scale flows that are not explicitly represented in the upscaled model so the influence of all processes below the support scale of the darcy continuum are embedded in the effective parameter k x which is often reduced to a single scalar value k assuming an isotropic medium which is questionable in geologic media but often invoked for simplicity given the size of geologic systems it is typically not feasible not possible and not even desirable to represent pore scales in their full detail for domains larger than a soil column i e beyond the characteristic length scale of cm dm as such an effective continuum perspective is typically considered when studying practical applications of transport in geologic systems i e velocity is approximated through darcy s law the darcy velocity is defined to maintain continuity of the flow and is not the mean pore water velocity v x l that dictates how solutes advect but this can be obtained from v x q x ϕ x where ϕ is the porosity one of the challenges in groundwater hydrology is developing accurate transport models for highly heterogeneous systems for which the variance of the log conductivity field is typically much larger than one σ 2 lnk 1 while it is known that the limit σ 2 lnk 1 may be respected within individual geological depositional units fogg et al 1998 meerschaert et al 2013 the hierarchical nature of large scale geological formations juxtaposes geomaterials with dramatically different k ranges over short distances and this causes σ 2 lnk to grow rapidly le borgne et al investigated 2 d hydraulic conductivity fields that were well above the σ 2 lnk 1 threshold in particular they studied transport in three heterogeneous systems that contain several of the important features of real geologic systems i a multilognormal k field ii a field with identical variance but fully connected highly permeable preferential flow paths and iii a stratified system with σ 2 lnk 9 the k fields were characterized by an isotropic correlation distance λ sample conductivity and associated velocity fields are shown in fig 2 all three fields have identical point distributions of hydraulic conductivity values but clearly vary in their structure and this creates velocity fields that vary by over 10 orders of magnitude the velocity fields also exhibit varying degrees of connectivity in terms of slow regions and longer connected fast flow channels as one moves from i to iii the more connected fields typically result in earlier first arrivals and larger late arrivals with more disperse breakthrough curves reflecting that fast particles persist at being fast to arrive quickly and slow particles persist at being slow trapped to arrive later the fields shown in fig 2 were used to develop a domain wide upscaled model of the longitudinal mean flow direction lagrangian velocities defined as 5 v l x n 1 x n t x n 1 t x n which accounts for diffusive and advective motion the velocities were defined by considering the probability for a particle to transition from velocity v at travel time t to velocity v at travel time t 6 r t v t v t δ v v t t v t t v as well as the probability for a particle to make a transition from velocity v at travel distance x to velocity v at travel distance x 7 r s v x v x δ v v s x v s x v after discretizing the velocity distribution into n equiprobable classes they defined the temporal and spatial velocity transition matrices for temporal increment t and the spatial increment s as 8 t i j t v i v i 1 v j v j 1 r t v t v t d v dv t i j s v i v i 1 v j v j 1 r s v x v x d v dv where t i j is the probability to make a transition from a velocity v c j to a velocity v c i these metrics allowed le borgne et al to demonstrate that the lagrangian velocity fields are characterized by a broad range of correlation times as quantified by t t but a relatively narrow range of correlation distances as quantified by t s based on this observation the authors applied a test for markovian behavior in space and time in order to describe a markov chain the chapman kolmogorov condition requires that the transition matrix must satisfy 9 t ω ω t ω t ω t nω t n ω where ω is a dummy variable the analysis revealed that markovian behavior in time was never observed over the time scales considered owing to a broad distribution of correlation times but that spatial increments greater than λ 2 were markovian these observations motivate the use of an smm as described in 2 and also explain the origin of the name the smm model was proposed by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2008b and applied in le borgne et al 2008a to predict two commonly measured features in porous media i first passage time distributions at a distance 12 5λ corresponding to a flux weighted initial line condition spanning most of the vertical extent of the domain and ii evolution of the spatial variance of the concentration field in both cases the results of a fully resolved direct numerical simulation dns were compared to predictions made with an smm as well as a model that considers no correlation between successive spatial steps referred to in their paper a classical ctrw although we will not adopt that notation here their results are shown in fig 3 and demonstrate that the smm can reproduce the dominant features of the dns whilst the model that does not account for correlation is unable to accurately reproduce the dns most notably the uncorrelated model fails to adequately capture early arrivals but it also under predicts late time arrivals for the multi lognormal case which can be summarized as under estimating spreading over time the example clearly demonstrates the importance of accounting for velocity correlation since both models correlated and uncorrelated used the same limited information in the space time domain of interest to infer velocity distributions at larger scales the concept is simple enough in principle whereby fast particles tend to persist at being fast i e once in a fast channel they can remain their for quite a while and slow particles can also persist at being slow but it has a profound impact on the performance of the upscaled transport model it should be noted that the same numerical dataset was later analyzed by berkowitz and scher 2010 with an uncorrelated ctrw which was also able to accurately reproduce the dns data this can be explained by observing that the correlated model will ultimately converge to an uncorrelated one bolster et al 2014 whose space time transitions pdf is of course different than the one measured on a smaller scale 3 2 transport in fractured media another common setting that is of interest in the geosciences is flow through fractured media where flow rather than occurring through pore spaces in unconsolidated media happens through fractures in an otherwise near impermeable rock matrix such settings are common in nature and the broad range of fracture properties and architectures are known to result in complex flow networks that display anomalous transport e g berkowitz and scher 1997 anomalous transport in such systems may arise from different physical characteristics that define the fractures such as the aperture of individual fractures or the angle between the fracture direction and the average pressure gradient the spatial arrangement of fracture intersections also plays a relevant role in this context painter cvetkovic and coauthors using discrete fracture network models to simulate flow and transport in fractured geologic media demonstrated the existence and importance of correlation effects that must be included to upscale transport correctly painter et al 2002 painter and cvetkovic 2005 painter et al 2008 in the context of the smm kang et al kang et al 2011a studied flow and transport in a fractured medium to focus only on one form of heterogeneity they idealized their fracture network as depicted in fig 4 their lattice is made up of two sets of parallel equidistant links separated by distance l the links are oriented at a fixed angle α with respect to the longitudinal x axis the flow is driven by a unit potential drop in the longitudinal direction φ 1 at the inlet and φ 0 at the outlet along each link flow is governed by darcy type flow an averaged poiseuille flow where the flow velocity depends on the fracture conductivity k length l and potential drop across a fracture such that for a link between node i and j the velocity is u ij k ij φ i φ j l a further physical constraint of incompressibility is imposed such that the sum of all inflows and outflows at a node is zero i e at node i j u ij 0 this results in a linear set of equations that can readily be solved the only form of heterogeneity that the authors considered was in the fracture conductivities k where each link was assigned an independent and identically distributed value they considered lognormal cauchy and truncated power law distributions that is there is no correlation imposed in the medium structure from this setup the set of all realizations of the random fracture network form a statistical ensemble that is both stationary and ergodic they then perform particle tracking simulations neglecting diffusion and assuming complete mixing at each node i e a particle s exit from each node is determined randomly by flux weighted probability considering a point initial condition x t 0 δ x they run simulations over o 1000 realizations and average over realizations to obtain mean particle density p x t as in le borgne et al 2008a kang et al studied individual particle trajectories by considering ensemble statistics of lagrangian velocities and focusing on transition times at fixed space increments as in taylor 1954 they demonstrated that correlation between subsequent transition times does indeed exist despite the fact that the random fracture permeabilities are completely independent the imposition of incompressibility induces correlation in space i e flow develops along minimum resistance pathways that connect inflow to outflow they also successfully demonstrated that a markov model predicted the transition probabilities suggesting that a smm may be a suitable upscaled model they proposed such a correlated ctrw where particle locations are governed by the following equation 10 x n 1 x n l v n v n t n 1 t n l v n successive velocities follow a markov chain with one step transition probability density as in 7 from this the particle density can be written as 11 p x t t l v t r x v t d t dv where r x v t δ x x n δ v v n δ t t n where r x v t represents the particle distribution in space velocity and time after n steps it satisfies kolmogorov type recursion equation 12 r x v t δ x p v δ t r v v δ x x l v v r x v t d x d v which describes how this distribution evolves over successive jumps if one assumes that successive jumps are uncorrelated i e r v v p v then an uncorrelated ctrw model is recovered where 13 p x t 0 t t t r x t ψ x τ d x dτd t with recursion equation 14 r x t δ x δ t r x t ψ x x t t d x d t and joint transition length and time density is given by 15 ψ x t p v δ x l v v δ t l v d v finally kang et al compare the results from fully resolved dns simulations to predictions obtained with both the correlated and uncorrelated ctrw models their results are shown in fig 4 bottom particle density is non gaussian in space having a sharp leading edge and elongated tail as in le borgne et al 2008a an uncorrelated model where subsequent transition times are random and mutually independent and are drawn from numerically measured distributions fails to accurately capture the full behavior of the system similar mismatches not shown here are observed in predictions of first passage times and evolution of second centered moments in time which persist in displaying anomalous superdiffusive growth over the full range of space and times considered it is worth repeating here that there is no correlation in the fracture network permeability field but rather that this correlation structure emerges due to the fact that mass must be balanced at each node and the flow is incompressible the application of this approach to a fractured rock field site kang et al 2015a is described in further detail in 3 5 the model presented in this section has been further elaborated in kang et al 2011b kang et al 2015b other recent applications in random discrete fracture networks of potential interest include kang et al 2017a hyman et al 2019a hyman et al 2019b sherman et al 2020a 3 3 transport at pore scales in porous media working at the continuum darcy scale of flow and transport is practical when studying systems at geologic scales as was the case in the previous two sections but it is also important to recognize that heterogeneity in the flow exists below those scales within individual pores and fractures most natural media are highly complex at this scale and the resulting flows can have a very broad range of transport time and velocity scales leading to anomalous behaviors while this complexity is often ignored and replaced with an effective advection dispersion equation at darcy scales it is well known that such an effective model rests on strong assumptions that are often not met and that can lead to incorrect predictions most of these effective models are built on ideas relating to taylor dispersion taylor 1954 which is strictly only valid at asymptotic times that is at a time τ d l 2 d where l is a characteristic length and d the diffusion coefficient physically this timescale represents the characteristic time it takes a particle to sample a system s full velocity variability depending on the system in question or the problem being solved it may not be possible to reach the characteristic time scale so models capable of representing behaviors below this are needed 3 3 1 pore scale smms le borgne et al in le borgne et al 2011a were the first to apply the smm in the context of a pore scale flow and transport setting they considered a two dimensional porous medium as depicted in fig 5 the medium is made up of voids and circular grains of two diameters that fill the space resulting in a porosity of 0 42 the flow is driven by a uniform pressure drop from top to bottom periodic conditions are imposed for flux on all boundaries this particular domain was chosen as it had been the basis of previous transport upscaling studies tartakovsky and neuman 2008 tartakovsky et al 2007 due to the fact that the velocity field displays interesting features including a braided network of preferential flow paths as well as low velocity and stagnation zones two features that are often associated with anomalous or highly non fickian pre asymptotic transport dispersion in this setting has been observed to be superdiffusive over 2 orders of magnitude in time with higher order moments further reinforcing that transport is strongly anomalous de anna et al 2013 the authors compute the transit time and the transition matrix due to purely advective transport over a distance corresponding to the mean pore length the resulting transition matrix is depicted in fig 1 and as with previous studies depicts a strong diagonal dominance reflecting that particles will most likely persist to move at a similar velocity with the two strongest hot spots at the extremes fast particle persist at being fast i e they are trapped in fast channels and slow particle persist at being slow a comparison of the distribution of longitudinal position of particles from a line injection at the boundary at various times between numerical results from high resolution direct numerical simulation as well as correlated and uncorrelated ctrw models is shown in fig 5 the smm is well able to reproduce the pore scale dns values even at the very earliest times while the uncorrelated model fails 3 3 2 intermittency the results of le borgne et al 2011a are ultimately quite similar to previous studies merely in a different setting when the authors dug deeper into this system in de anna et al 2013 they found something that adds more significantly to the entire story in fig 6 we see the same two dimensional porous medium as above along with the trajectory of a single advective particle superimposed below are the time series along that trajectory for the particle s velocity and acceleration looking carefully at these series the lagrangian acceleration displays an intermittent behavior as it switches between periods of low variability to periods with strong fluctuations in magnitude the low variability regime corresponds to when a particle is in low velocity regions here lagrangian longitudinal velocities and accelerations are small and strongly correlated the large fluctuation regime occurs when the particle is in regions of high velocity such as flow channels where accelerations are large and erratic intermittency is a phenomenon that is observed in many physical settings e g friedrich et al 2011 but some key and unique aspects exist in the context of porous media some insight can be gained by considering the correlation function of the lagrangian acceleration as well as that of its absolute value respectively given by 16 χ a τ a t τ a a t τ a σ a 2 χ a τ a t τ a a t τ a σ a 2 where a denotes acceleration a related and useful measure that is often studied in intermittent systems is the lagrangian velocity increment associated with some time lag τ given by 17 δ τ v v t τ v t or better said the distribution of these accelerations normalized by its standard deviation p δ τ v σ δv τ both of these metrics are displayed for the considered system in fig 7 for the case of acceleration the correlation decreases rapidly in time briefly becoming anti correlated due to the rapid fluctuations in acceleration in high velocity channels noted above in fig 6 on the other hand the correlation for absolute value of acceleration decays more slowly showing something more like a power law decay over the observed timescales in other systems such as turbulent flows intermittency is associated with an exponential decay in correlation of a which in turn leads to a rapid convergence to gaussian like behavior as such this persistence is a unique and important aspect of intermittency in porous media its persistence highlights why it is important to consider as anomalous effects may play a role for longer times than assumed in conventional models the distribution of lagrangian velocity increments at fixed time lags has a sharp peak around 0 with symmetric exponential tails whose slope increases as the lag increases the sharp peak in the center is associated with low velocity regions that correspond to small accelerations as seen in fig 6 such a peak is typically not seen in other intermittent systems such as turbulent flows where the time varying nature of the flow allows particles to sample velocities more quickly also shown in the figure is the gaussian distribution which would arise at asymptotic times but that is never obtained here once again highlighting the persistence of intermittency and anomalous behavior the observations from this study suggest that any upscaled model for transport should ideally capture these behaviors in accelerations in order to be able to replicate intermittent behavior with these specific characteristics de anna et al de anna et al 2013 proposed that the smm is such a model a clear definition of acceleration for comparison with these observation is not obvious in the context of the smm and so de anna et al 2013 suggested the following the acceleration during step n considering spatial increment λ and time increment τ can be seen as 18 λ v n 1 τ n t n t n τ n t n t a n d t d t assuming a constant acceleration over each step and continuity of velocity at turning points 19 a n 2 λ τ n 2 2 v n 1 τ n v n v n 1 a n τ n with this they were able to compare to observations from the full pore scale simulations the smm is able to accurately represent both the correlation of the acceleration and absolute value of acceleration including anticorrelation and long range effects as shown in fig 7 likewise the distribution of velocity increments for different time lags are in excellent agreement for all considered time lags with peaks and tails well represented for comparison a single example for an uncorrelated model is also included such a model leads to an overestimate of probabilities of large increments over small lag times allowing particles to switch velocities too quickly relative to what happens in the real incompressible flow the setting considered by le borgne et al 2011a and de anna et al 2013 is a highly idealized porous medium relative to what a real geologic medium might look like to explore whether their findings extended to more realistic systems the model has been applied to predict solute transport kang et al 2014 in an image based reconstruction of a real rock system their flow field is shown in fig 8 along with velocity and acceleration time series in both longitudinal and transverse directions these time series display the same intermittent behavior as reported in de anna et al 2013 they found that transport is highly anomalous observing superdiffusive spreading in the longitudinal direction and subdiffusive spreading in the transverse one again reflecting a balance that likely arises due to the incompressible nature of the flow in this system they also show that an smm can faithfully reproduce the behavior measured from their dns both in terms of temporal scaling of spatial moments and instantaneous distributions of particle locations at various times it is important to note that the intermittency discussed in this section applies to time series such as those shown in figs 6 and 8 however if one looks at spatial series that is velocities of particles over fixed spatial increments a pretty regular spatial signal emerges where the velocity appears to remain roughly constant correlated for over an almost constant distance see puyguiraud et al 2019a fig 2 for a clear example such observations again justify the choice of a spatial over temporal markov model validating le borgne et al s le borgne et al 2008a le borgne et al 2008b original observations and suggestions 3 4 transport in periodic domains many of the classical upscaling theories that are commonly applied in the context of porous media typically rely on the assumption of some representative elementary volume that is assumed periodic in order to close the resulting mathematical system e g brenner 2013 whitaker 2013 while the smm does not appear to explicitly require such an assumption a reasonable question is whether it can perform well in such a context also in particular many of these classical theories are only valid at asymptotic times and it is often desirable to make predictions at pre asymptotic times while these theories can be generalized to pre asymptotic times the resulting set of differential equations can be highly nonlocal in space and time and almost as difficult to solve as the full microscale problem as noted by davit et al 2012 porta et al 2016 note that a recent paper puyguiraud et al 2020 does demonstrate the existence of an rev as a necessary condition for any ctrw however this rev is not defined in the traditional sense in terms of medium properties but rather in terms of the representativeness of the eulerian flow properties recognizing that a periodic domain has a natural length scale that is the length of the actual cell le borgne et al 2011a proposed that this should be the fixed spatial jump in the smm equations in order to test this they considered a simple benchmark problem that has often been considered as a useful idealization of a porous medium flow through a periodic channel with a sinusoidal boundary as depicted in 9 dykaar and kitanidis 1996 kitanidis and dykaar 1997 one of the reasons that this flow is considered interesting is that it has a fast preferential flow down the center line and depending on the aspect ratio of the pore as well as the considered reynolds number the emergence of recirculation zones which act as traps causing particles to potentially be retained for long times relative to the main flow two simulated trajectories in such a setting are shown in fig 9 reflecting both a very fast as well as a very slow trajectory in particular note that the slow one is repeatedly trapped while the fast one persists at being fast suggesting a correlated process similar to the ones we have discussed in the settings above in le borgne et al 2011a stokes flow is considered and the system behaves in a very similar manner to the more realistic porous medium discussed above and shown in fig 5 later bolster et al bolster et al 2014 considered a diverse range of reynolds numbers to explore the impact of flow inertia on transport in the same periodic geometry in both studies the authors simulated transport across two periodic elements recording the amount of time it took each particle to traverse the first and then the second periodic element from this they measured the transition matrix of the system in particular unlike previous studies which predominantly focused on purely advective transport or only considered one particular péclet number these studies explored behavior over a range of péclet numbers from diffusion to advection dominated here the péclet number is defined as 20 pe 2 uh d where u is the mean velocity h the characteristic half width of the channel and d the diffusion coefficient a typical transition matrix for pe 100 and pe 1000 is shown in fig 10 the pe 1000 case shows the characteristic behavior that we have described in several settings so far that fast particles are most likely to persist at being fast and that slow particles are most likely to persist at being slow reflected by the strong diagonal band predominance of diagonal terms is much less evident in the pe 100 case suggesting that correlation effects here are much less important than for the larger pe case using this result the authors compared breakthrough curve and moment evolution measured from dns to predictions using both correlated and uncorrelated ctrw models where the uncorrelated model draws transition times from the distribution obtained for transition times across a single periodic cell they found that for all cases of pe 100 that the uncorrelated and correlated models performed equally well while for pe o 100 the model that did not include correlation effects failed to reproduce observations in particular missing early arrivals and late time tails samples highlighting this can be seen in the breakthrough curves in fig 10 this threshold has been confirmed by other studies also suggesting that correlation effects should be accounted for any time a system with pe o 100 is considered an additional question that was addressed by le borgne et al 2011a relates to the discrete nature of the transition matrix how many bins should the transition matrix be discretized into to effectively capture large scale behavior via an error analysis they found that as long as more than ten bins were used that smm predictions converged to the reference solution while this is an entirely empirical observation for an isolated case it has been found to hold in other settings also e g sund et al 2015a sund et al 2016 as in previous implementations of the smm for the first set of periodic systems considered le borgne et al 2011a bolster et al 2014 parameterization of the model was conducted by simulating particle transport across two periodic elements in order to measure both the transition time as well as the transition matrix for most other upscaling approaches only one element is typically considered and so some have criticized the smm as gaining an unfair advantage over other models in this regard sund et al sund et al 2017a realized that in a periodic setting this parameterization could actually be done by simulating transport over only one single periodic element the key to their approach was recognizing that a particle s travel time across a single element is dictated by the location where it enters that element given its starting point a particle has a finite range of travel times and exit locations the exit location can then be used as the inlet location for the next element this is depicted pictorially in fig 11 where trajectories are shown for three different start locations across one periodic element for two different péclet numbers pe 100 and 1000 for the lower value of pe there are a broad range of possible outlet locations with significant overlap between the three distinct starting points on the other hand for the higher pe the range of possible outlet locations is much tighter inducing the correlation an effective transition matrix is also shown for the two cases highlighting probability inlet versus outlet location with very similar structural features to that which relates travel times in fig 10 note that this transition matrix is for illustration purposes only as it is never explicitly used the parameterization for this novel approach is developed by simulating trajectories for n ps particles distributed across all possible inlet locations with this one can define a set of s s 1 s n ps of trajectories s i each of which travels from an inlet to an outlet location each trajectory s i has an associated inlet location y in s i an outlet location y out s i and a travel time τ s i a specific order of the trajectories s i is assumed by setting y in s 1 y in s 2 y in s n ps for computational reasons the trajectories are subdivided into a number of n bin subsets similar to the discretization of the transition matrix 21 s j bin s i s y in s jb y in s i y in s jb where 22 j b j bin 1 n bin n ps 1 j b j bin n bin n ps j bin 1 n bin this sets a mapping between a location y in at the inlet section and a bin number j bin which establishes a direct link between the location of the particle at the inlet section and the travel time through the trajectory s i as noted the outlet position associated with trajectory s i serves as the inlet position for the next transition or better said sets the bin from which the next trajectory is sampled sund et al sund et al 2017a chose to study the same geometry as shown in fig 9 by doing this the authors were able to run a fully parameterized smm that performed as well as previous versions but with only half the simulation required for parameterization additionally the actual implementation of the model is more efficient resulting in an even faster model since as noted above no transition matrix step is ever explicitly needed finally as further discussed later in section 5 1 this version of the smm includes the ability to recover particle spatial distributions within each periodic cell this trajectory based framework can be indeed seen as a lagrangian numerical closure for a model that can be used to approximate solute mixing and particle positions below the cell resolution thus retaining close analogy with closure variable invoked in classical eulerian upscaling approaches 3 5 applications to real systems a criticism of the smm is that proper parameterization requires extensive data that cannot readily be obtained in field and laboratory settings in all cases discussed so far this comes from high resolution simulations which directly measure particle travel times and correlations most commonly particle trajectories are measured over two characteristic lengths in high resolution direct numerical simulations that fully resolve flow and transport across the domain of interest this then provides sufficient data to quantify velocity transition probabilities due to this most smm applications have been primarily limited to synthetic numerical systems two approaches have emerged recently aiming to overcome these challenges and enable application of the smm in field scale and laboratory settings in the first kang et al kang et al 2015a assume an idealized simplified diagonal transition matrix structure with a single correlation parameter which can be found by fitting tracer experiments in the second method sherman et al sherman et al 2017 introduce an inverse modeling approach which infers the transition matrix from two successively measured breakthrough curves this method was applied using column experimental data to predict transport at the laboratory scale sherman et al 2018 both of these methods have their associated strengths and weaknesses which are discussed below 3 5 1 fractured media kang et al kang et al 2015a is to our knowledge the first and only study where the smm is applied to non synthetic data at the field scale the setting that they worked on was experimental data collected from a fractured granite at the ploemeur field site in france fig 12 the matrix permeability within the granite at this site is very low and so groundwater flows primarily through the fracture network where four major conductive fracture intersections have been identified two boreholes 83 m and 100 m deep are spaced apart by a distance r c 6m enabling easy injection and extraction of tracer into the network kang et al conducted two types of experiments to quantify transport behavior convergent and push pull tracer tests in the convergent tests a known mass of nonreactive tracer flourescein is injected at borehole 1 and tracer concentration is measured at borehole 2 a pump at borehole 2 creates a stationary pressure field driving flow from borehole 1 to 2 in the push pull tests a known mass of tracer is again injected into borehole 1 followed by a continuous injection of water for a set amount of time push then a pump at borehole 1 is used to reverse the direction of flow pull and the tracer is measured at the point of injection in fractured media the four mechanisms that influence transport are heterogenous advection matrix diffusion hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption with heterogenous advection being partially time reversible while the others are not for this reason solute spreading due to heterogenous advection is partially reversed in the push pull experiments therefore the advective spreading in the push pull experiments is minimized and the observed breakthrough curves display a narrower distribution than the convergent breakthrough curves thereby indicating velocity correlation is important in this system additionally the observed breakthrough curves displayed different power law tailing exponents depending on the fracture upon which tracer was injected indicative of the varying levels of heterogeneity for each fracture these heterogeneities as well as heterogenous advection must be effectively represented in the smm for accurate modeling of solute transport through this fractured media kang et al kang et al 2015a proposed a simplified smm framework to model the observed transport behavior to do so they assume an idealized diagonal transition matrix structure determined by a single constant parameter a the idealized transition matrix has diagonal elements with a value a and the remaining elements have equal probability 1 a n 1 where n is the number of matrix columns 23 t ij a i j 1 a n 1 i j i j 1 n a quantifies the probability of persisting in the same velocity class over successive model steps note that as with many empirically measured transition matrices the fully parameterized transition matrix t converges to a uniform matrix after many model steps lim n t n i j 1 n and thus correlation decays exponentially specifically correlation at the n th model step is related to the second eigenvalue of t c n χ 2 n exp n ln χ 2 the second eigenvalue of the diagonalized transition matrix in eq 23 is χ 2 na 1 n 1 it follows naturally that a dimensionless correlation λ length can be expressed as 24 λ l r c 1 ln n 1 na 1 n 1 l r c 1 ln a 1 here l is the streamwise jump distance of the smm and r c is a characteristic length between the tracer injection and withdrawal points this simplified transition matrix of kang et al kang et al 2015a allows velocity correlation to be described with a single parameter a which is related to the correlation length and allows easier parameterization of smm particle motion in the smm as applied in kang et al 2015a follows 25 r n 1 r n l 2 αl ξ n t n 1 t n lr n k v η n where α is dispersivity ξ is a identical independently distributed gaussian random variable η is a dimensionless time and k v is proportional to discharge divided by the fracture aperture hence in addition to λ the velocity distribution and dispersivity input parameters are required to run the smm in this study the velocity distribution assumed the form of a truncated pareto distribution with power law slope 1 β meaning λ β and α are the only three parameters that need to be estimated for smm application to this end random walk equation parameters α dispersivity β velocity distribution and λ velocity correlation were fitted to measured breakthrough curve data the velocity and dispersivity parameters β α showed best fit values of 0 75 0 03 and 0 85 0 02 for two different fractures respectively the velocity correlation length was determined to be the same order of magnitude as the mean distance between fracture connections suggesting that velocities are strongly correlated through a single fracture and decorrelate at intersections ctrw model predictions show significant improvement when accounting for velocity correlation even with this simple idealized correlation structure note that the same authors later applied this idealized matrix structure to predict transport observed in numerical simulations of a stressed fracture system with heterogeneous aperture and flow fields kang et al 2016 the success of the idealized transition matrix structure in both of these systems is exciting for future field smm applications because it suggests that only certain correlation properties need to be included to faithfully predict transport in certain subsurface media furthermore this simplified structure closely resembles a bernoulli ctrw an emerging subclass of smm models that is discussed further down in section 4 2 we must note that the assumed correlation structure may not reflect universal behavior and therefore it remains an open challenge to fully parameterize the velocity correlation in non synthetic field scale systems 3 5 2 laboratory experiments one of the challenges with real experimental settings is that detailed information on individual lagrangian trajectories is not typically available nor realistically obtainable thus directly measuring the transition matrix is next to impossible in most settings the best one can hope for is breakthrough curve measurements at multiple downstream locations to this end sherman et al sherman et al 2017 introduced an inverse modeling approach to estimate the transition matrix from two successive breakthrough curves specifically breakthrough curves positioned at distances l c and 2l c from the inlet where a pulse injection is introduced the inverse modeling procedure solves the discretized form of the governing smm equation which requires that particle travel times sample from a discrete probability distribution the inverse model like the forward smm assumes that travel time distributions between successive spatial increments l c are stationary therefore the porous medium is conceptualized as a column of identical cells analogous to the periodic pore domains presented previously the travel time distribution for each cell is equivalent to the normalized breakthrough curve at the first cell s outlet a particle s arrival time at the second cell then must be a combination of two times sampled from this travel time distribution the inverse model leverages the stationary assumption to find combinations of times sampled from breakthrough curve 1 that equal times measured in breakthrough curve 2 discretizing breakthrough curves 1 and 2 enables all variables in the discretized smm equation to be known except the transition matrix meaning the transition matrix can be estimated by solving a system of equations the governing discretized smm equation can be expressed as 26 p τ 2 σ i σ j τ 1 a τ 1 b τ 2 p cell 1 τ 1 a bin i t i j p cell 2 τ 1 b bin j here p τ 2 is the probability associated with arrival times at x 2l c within a discrete interval τ 2 t i j is an element in the transition matrix and τ 1 a τ 1 b are discrete time intervals to travel across 1 increment l c i e within x 0 l c and x l c 2l c respectively more simply this equation states that the probability of a particle arriving at x 2l c within the interval τ 2 is all combinations where the time to traverse 0 l c plus the time to traverse l c 2l c lies in τ 2 converting breakthrough curves into discrete distributions means that each discrete arrival time interval has an associated empirical probability and can be sorted by velocity class i e p cell 1 τ 1 a bin i is known assuming spatial stationarity of travel time distributions throughout the domain allows p cell 2 τ 1 b binj to be calculated from the discretized breakthrough curve at l c leaving t i j as the only unknown in eq 26 every discrete time from breakthrough curve 2l c has a corresponding equation which form a system of equations that estimates the transition matrix when solved note that when the number of discretized times from breakthrough curve 2l c exceed the number of elements in the transition matrix the system of equations is overconstrained as is the case in sherman et al 2018 the overconstrained system is solved with a least squares method and then transition matrix rows are normalized so that their sum is unity to date application of this inverse model has been both on synthetic sherman et al 2017 as well as more excitingly a non synthetic experimental system sherman et al 2018 in sherman et al 2018 transport of a conservative solute through a 1 2 m long column packed with zeolite clinoptilolite a material with multiscale porosity known to yield anomalous transport is measured a pulse of nacl tracer was injected at the column inlet and breakthrough curve data was obtained at 1 6 2 6 and 5 6 the column s length experiments were run at pe o 100 o 1000 in triplicate a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 13 breakthrough curves sampled at the first two ports were discretized then fed into the inverse algorithm and the transition matrix was estimated the transition matrix and measured breakthrough curves parameterize the forward smm enabling breakthrough curve predictions at port 3 to be compared with experimental data correlation was determined important for both pe numbers as the estimated transition matrices displayed a diagonalized structure indicating fast velocities preferentially remain fast and slow velocity preferentially remain slow as expected correlation increased with increasing pe estimated breakthrough curves using the inferred transition matrix significantly improved upon predictions using an uncorrelated ctrw model as shown in fig 13 specifically both breakthrough curve peak and tailing behavior was better captured when correlation was included for both pe experiments as expected in any inverse modeling process discretization and measurement error in the data induce uncertanties in parameters estimates i e transition matrix entries and the inverse method requires further iteration and optimization sherman et al 2018 did so in a very simple manual manner obtaining excellent agreement with experimental measurements fully automating this secondary optimatization still remains to be done however to date and to our knowledge this remains the only study where a fully parameterized smm i e where the entire matrix correlation structure is faithfully represented is applied in a non synthetic setting 3 6 higher dimension processes training trajectories in 3 d domains while a great deal can be learned by studying the idealized periodic pore systems that we have mentioned it is also important to recognize the limitations the fact that the system is so simple means that while it may display some of the interesting features of a real porous medium such as preferential flow channels and trapping regions these features are of one size unlike a real geologic medium where a broad distribution of channel sizes and trapping regions can exist additionally the completely periodic nature of the system is not reflective of subsurface porous media to overcome some of these limitations and focus on a more realistic system most et al 2016 simulated high resolution trajectories through a series of real geologic media a doddington sandstone whose structure was digitally mapped using micro ct scanning the velocity field and representative trajectories are shown in fig 14 top unlike many previous studies they focused not just on the correlations between successive longitudinal jumps but looked at the full correlation of velocities in all three dimensions of the system finding that there is a strong cross dependence between longitudinal and transverse increments based on an extensive empirical analysis of the 3 d trajectories they concluded that i memory and cross dependence are persistent in and among all directions ii that the dependence is highly nonlinear iii that this co dependency occurs at different temporal scales and iv that it is dependent on the péclet number their work suggests that should one want to extend the smm to predict realistic concentration fields in three dimensions one would need to thoroughly describe the governing statistics of a three dimensional transport problem which would require parameterization of a nine dimensional transition matrix while possible it requires immense effort and computational power recognizing the practical limitations of a 9 d transition matrix most et al 2019 proposed a novel solution called the training trajectory approach tta in it the authors take the full length trajectories that are simulated from the dns fig 14 and use these as a library of plausible paths each trajectory is divided into equidistant segments of length as depicted in the middle row of fig 14 the segments are stored in a database from which the increments for the smm model are sampled giving a transition time and displacement direction the key difference is that this decomposes the 3 d transport into a series of steps that are also 3 d but the steps in the cartesian directions are not simulated independently so the 9 d transition matrices are avoided entirely the necessary assumption is that this archive of training trajectories inherently captures all the processes and correlations required to represent larger scale transport most et al 2019 provide extensive criteria required to ensure this and for a comprehensive discussion we direct the interested reader there 4 velocity transition models the previous section highlighted empirical approaches to modeling the transition matrix reflecting much of the early work in the field more recently theoretical frameworks based on analytical velocity transition models have emerged these are the focus of this section in general the velocity field in steady divergence free flows often satisfies the stationary assumption however particle transport through both fractured and porous media has been found to be quite sensitive to the initial lagrangian velocity distribution kang et al 2017b morales et al 2017 therefore a ctrw framework must properly account for the spatial evolution of the initial lagrangian velocity to this end random walks through velocity space have emerged to characterize the lagrangian velocity evolution through disordered media while still invoking a spatial markov process dentz et al dentz et al 2016 studied the evolution of lagrangian velocity statistics and developed a markov chain ctrw that accounts for such evolution with a stochastic relaxation process to do so the authors established a relationship between the lagrangian and eulerian velocity fields showing that any lagrangian velocity distribution evolves to the flux weighted eulerian distribution for ergodic systems here we highlight some key arguments of dentz et al that lay the framework for velocity space random walks in the absence of diffusion particle trajectories through a heterogeneous steady velocity field u x is described with the advection equation 27 d x t a dt v t a here v t a is the lagrangian velocity and a x t 0 a is the particle location at initial time similarly particle motion can be described along particle trajectories s and in time 28 ds t a dt v t t a dt s a ds 1 v s s a v t t a and v s s a represent t ime lagrangian and s pace lagrangian velocity distributions respectively which represent velocities obtained by uniform sampling in time or space as discussed in the previous sections the smm framework is based on the approximation of v s s a consider the absolute eulerian velocities v e x u x within the domain volume v then the eulerian pdf is defined through spatial sampling as 29 p e v lim v 1 v ω dxδ v v e x with these definitions and under certain assumptions it is possible to link the eulerian and lagragian velocity field distributions by assuming ergodicity of both eulerian and lagrangian velocities sampling lagrangian velocities along one particle trajectory is equivalent to sampling velocities for many particles sampling particle trajectories can be done over fixed temporal or spatial increments to find the t ime lagrangian and s pace lagrangian velocity distributions 30 p t v a lim t 1 t 0 t dt δ v v t t a 31 p s v a lim l 1 l 0 l ds δ v v s s a here t l are a sampling time and length respectively the lagrangian ergodic assumption requires that the particle t velocity distribution is spatially independent and equivalent to the ensemble average over all particles additionally the incompressibility of the flow field and volume conservation requires that the t sampled and eulerian velocity distributions are equivalent p t v p e v through a variable change of s and t dentz et al dentz et al 2016 shows the s lagrangian velocity distribution is linked with the t velocity distribution and thus also the eulerian velocity distribution by flux weighting 32 p s v vp e v v e relating the eulerian and lagrangian velocity distributions is important as it lays the foundation for random walks through velocity space eq 32 indicates that in asymptotic conditions i e distances the s lagrangian velocities converge to flux weighted velocity distributions it also implies that when the initial lagrangian velocity distribution does not coincide with the steady state velocity distribution the lagrangian velocity distribution evolves along streamlines towards this asymptotic limit i e under ergodic assumptions any lagrangian velocity distribution evolves to the flux weighted eulerian distribution given that sampling temporal spatial scales can sufficiently represent all fluctuations in the global flow field as previously emphasized flow properties in the subsurface are often strongly correlated in space because of the inherent correlation structure of porous and fractured media for example gotovac et al 2009 quantifies the correlation length of the inverse of v s also termed as slowness these results show that the integral scale of s lagrangian velocity can be related to the one of the underlying hydraulic conductivity fields for velocity distributions resulting from multi gaussian conductivity fields the integral scale of 1 v s decreases with increasing heterogeneity for σ y 2 6 the slowness integral scale converges to 4 3 of the hydraulic conductivity one these results show that it is possible to define an inherent correlation length to model transport velocity through a markov chain in other words it is reasonable to define a characteristic correlation length scale l c for which velocities persist given l c the characteristic time of particle velocity persistence is l c v t this implies that small velocities will persist for longer times than fast velocities and is consistent with the earlier discussion on intermittent behavior relatively long temporal durations of slow velocities are mixed with sudden abrupt and short lived high velocities periods the characteristic length scale l c naturally informs implementation of random walk models a correlated random walk model will only be useful when model spatial jump lengths are smaller than l c δs l c lag distance δs needs to be large enough to capture correlation properties but sufficiently small such that successive models steps remain correlated the equations describing particle motion in velocity space are as follows 33 s n 1 s n δ s t s n 1 t s n δ s v s s n here δs is a spatial increment along a particle pathline multiple frameworks have emerged for random walks in velocity space that model the evolution of velocity along a particle trajectory following the above framework to this end two methodologies were extensively applied by dentz and co workers and are discussed here i e an orstein uhlenbeck process and a bernoulli ctrw framework 4 1 ornstein uhlenbeck process the ornstein uhlenbeck framework is a classical formalism to express transport through a markov process and has been applied throughout the physics literature for about a century uhlenbeck and ornstein 1930 the reasons for the success of this approach have been extensively reported in the literature e g gillespie 1996 van kampen 1992 in the context of our discussion a relevant feature of the ou framework is that it naturally describes relaxation to an asymptotic state through a markov chain and that it incorporates fluctuations around a stable state through linearization the ou framework therefore provides an ideal candidate to ground the parameterization of the s lagrangian velocities through a smm morales et al morales et al 2017 experimentally traced flow particles in a transparent three dimensional porous medium using particle tracking velocimetry ptv methods which allowed them to quantify correlation and velocity evolution the particle velocity distribution evolved from an initial to steady state distribution which were accurately approximated with a lognormal distribution a benefit of a lognormal distribution is that the log velocity steady state distribution w s s ln v s s is gaussian the evolution of a particle s log velocity can be then modeled as an ornstein uhlenbeck process such that 34 w n 1 w n δ s l c w n m s 2 σ s 2 δ s l c η n t n 1 t n δ s exp w n where m and σ are related to the mean and variance of the velocity distribution and η is a random number drawn from a standard gaussian the gaussian variable simulates subpore scale fluctuations of the velocity magnitude in the presence of general i e non lognormal and non gaussian velocity distributions the scores w s can be defined through a transformation 35 w s φ 1 p s v s s where φ w and p s v represent unit gaussian and v s cumulative distribution functions respectively after approximating the ou process through kelly et al 2017 the velocity is obtained as v s s p s 1 φ w s the velocity is persistent over δs i e w s s decays exponentially exp s l c and δs satisfies the δs l c constraint note through ptv all model input parameters in kelly et al 2017 can be measured experimentally morales et al morales et al 2017 demonstrated that this ornstein uhlenbeck spatial markov framework captured intermittent behavior and the velocity distributions at all time scales as observed in their laboratory ptv experiments the ou smm simulated isochronal particle trajectories faithfully reproduced the magnitude and duration of high velocity events as measured by the ptv t lagrangian particles velocities meaning that the velocity distribution and intermittent behavior is captured at all time scales puyguiraud et al puyguiraud et al 2019a puyguiraud et al 2019b demonstrated that the ornstein uhlenbeck smm correctly predicts the evolution of the s lagrangian distribution in pore scale numerical simulations of transport through a berea sandstone sample over a range of time scales this ou approach enables the evolution of non stationary velocity statistics and intermittent behavior to be faithfully modeled which in turn means that pre asymptotic behavior is well represented ou smm approaches therefore have exciting potential applications in many environmental flows where lagrangian velocity statistics display intermittent behavior and non stationarity over a range of scales a benefit of this framework is that it is parameterized with only the global lagrangian velocity distribution which is related to the eulerian velocity distribution and a characteristic length scale which puyguiraud et al 2019a found is the same order of magnitude as the characteristic pore scale hence the model does not require extensive lagrangian data for parameterization which has been a limitation of most commonly used smm frameworks 4 2 bernoulli ctrw assuming that velocity transitions via a bernoulli process is another method to capture intermittent behavior and model the evolution of velocity statistics along particle streamlines dentz et al 2016 holzner et al 2015 massoudieh et al 2017 hyman et al 2019c puyguiraud et al 2019a puyguiraud et al 2019b in a bernoulli framework particles transition through time and space according to eq 33 velocity correlation is captured by assuming velocity follows a bernoulli process i e particle velocity persists from the last model step with probability p and samples a new velocity otherwise with probability 1 p hence particle trajectories are still conceptualized as a spatial markov process dentz et al dentz et al 2016 first proposed a bernoulli framework where the s lagrangian velocity series is modeled as 36 v s s δ s 1 ξ s v s ξ s ν s where ξ is a bernoulli variable that returns 1 with p and ν s are identically independently distributed velocities that sample from the steady s lagrangian velocity distribution the value of p can be estimated by assuming that velocity transitions at a constant spatial rate inversely proportional to the correlation length l c dentz et al 2016 massoudieh et al 2017 hyman et al 2019c such that p exp δs l c note that the bernoulli ctrw is very similar to the idealized diagonal transition matrix by kang et al kang et al 2015a kang et al 2016 except in their framework sampling from a bin allows particle velocity to fluctuate somewhat even when the bernoulli variable favors a persistent velocity the benefit of the bernoulli ctrw framework is that velocity correlation is parameterized with a correlation velocity scale determined by l c and therefore an entire transition matrix is not required a simple way to estimate l c is to find the distance where particle velocity anti correlates as determined by a velocity correlation function the bernoulli ctrw has been successfully applied in both three dimensional and two dimensional fracture networks hyman et al 2019c kang et al 2019 in fracture networks particle velocity is highly correlated on the fracture scale and then may rapidly transition at a fracture intersection hence the characteristic length scale is on the same order of magnitude as the mean fracture length such a bernoulli ctrw framework has been applied to accurately reproduce breakthrough curves generated from 3d numerical simulations of stochastically generated networks whose fracture radii followed a power law distribution hyman et al 2019c and 2d geologically mapped fracture networks under different stress conditions kang et al 2019 in these studies an additional tortuosity parameter was introduced to account for the fact that the multi dimensional network structure allows for particle motion in transverse directions and so the advective distance a particle travels is greater than the linear distance in the primary flow direction this added distance delays downstream solute breakthrough meaning the travel time between model steps in eq 33 must be modified via a tortuosity parameter χ s 37 x n 1 x n δ x t x n 1 t x n χ s δ x v s here particle velocity transitions along streamlines but traverses only in x space the direction of primary flow because longitudinal spreading is of primary interest χ s is an effective tortuosity parameter that corrects particle travel distances accounting for transverse excursions and thereby delays effective transport in these studies χ s is calculated as the mean particle pathline distance divided by the total linear distance in the primary flow direction note that other definitions of tortuosity such as the ratio of the mean velocity norm over the mean velocity in the mean flow direction are also commonly used koponen et al 1996 ghanbarian et al 2013 and for volumes that are large enough equivalent to this definition hyman et al hyman et al 2019c demonstrated the bernoulli ctrw model accurately captures breakthrough curve tailing behavior for networks whose fracture radii are sampled from power law distributions with varying power law slopes and showed that model accuracy improves when initializing the particle velocities with the inlet velocity distribution kang et al uncovered that under specific stress conditions the correlation length scale is correlated with velocity and proposed a dual correlation length bernoulli ctrw i e p is dependent on velocity the authors applied this dual correlation length bernoulli to predict breakthrough curves in complex 2d networks these findings agree with a study by puyguiraud et al 2019a who found that the convergence rate for velocity evolution in numerical simulated berea sandstone is velocity dependent note that in heterogeneous fractured media a transition matrix may be spatially dependent due to the heterogeneity of the network structure at the scales of interests meaning using the traditional smm parameterized from two initial cells may impose false correlation structures on transport behavior the bernoulli ctrw framework simply assumes that velocities transition over a characteristic length related to fracture radii which relaxes the correlation structure and therefore is more suitable in this context bernoulli ctrws have also been applied to model transport through porous media puyguiraud et al 2019a carrel et al 2018 carrel et al carrel et al 2018 applied a bernoulli ctrw to model transport processes through a porous media with varying degrees of biofilm growth to do so nafion pellets were added to a bacterial inoculum which were packed in a saturated flow cell to create a porous medium the medium was saturated with glucose aqueous solution thereby promoting biofilm growth in the flow cell fluoresecent tracer particles were seeded in the flow and tracked through time with particle tracking velocimetry ptv enabling t lagrangian velocity distributions to be quantified for different periods of biofilm growth particle trajectories displayed intermittent behavior and larger biofilm growth resulted in fewer channels in the flow structure and increased average longitudinal velocity because porosity progressively decreased with increased growth the lagrangian trajectories enabled velocity correlations to be quantified which was shown to increase with increased biofilm growth transport through each biofilm snapshot was modeled with a bernoulli ctrw where velocities moved along streamlines and p exp δs 2λ where exponential decorrelation occurs over twice the correlation length and the correlation length is found as the integral of a correlation function note that the characteristic length scale is similar to that found in puyguiraud et al 2019a which was 2 5 times the average pore length bernoulli ctrw predictions for mean and centered mean squared displacements msd are in good agreements with ptv measurements and the msd exponent increased with biofilm growth suggesting increasing biofilm growth causes an increase in anomalous transport which is consistent with observations in other settings also e g stream beds 4 again the study demonstrates the exciting potential of a bernoulli ctrw framework as it faithfully captures anomalous transport at the pore scale without requiring as extensive a parameterization process as measurement of a full transition matrix 5 mixing and reactions the primary goal of most of the cases presented so far has been to describe or predict the mean transport behavior as a 1 d upscaled approximation the simplification to 1 d is practical in the context of subsurface hydrogeological systems because the inaccessibility of the subsurface introduces significant uncertainty in the 3 d architecture making precise simulations impossible but also because observations are not abundant consider that the most reliable data about subsurface conditions comes from boreholes which are vertically averaged samples at fixed points it is possible to simulate and verify an upscaled model at these points but there are many relevant applications where knowledge of a concentration field or its variance about the mean are necessary instead of time series of concentration at a point for example mixing and chemical reactions depend on local concentrations and concentration gradients e g dentz et al 2011 valocchi et al 2020 meaning that an average concentration is not sufficient to make an accurate prediction in order to be useful for such problems the smm would need to be able to represent concentration fluctuations in an effective manner this section describes some recent work much of it still in early developmental stages that has begun to explore how to do so efficiently 5 1 studies in periodic domains describing mixing in a lagrangian sense generally means estimating specific particle positions over time instead of estimating total travel times sund et al sund et al 2017a who proposed the trajectory based smm in periodic domains suggested that one could make an educated guess as to a particle s specific location if some additional information was stored on each trajectory the goal is to provide a method for downscaling that enables a more complete representation of the spatially variable concentration field and its fluctuations enabling the calculation of mixing measures the approach used by sund et al 2017a was to store a discrete form of each trajectory s i for each trajectory the discretized counterpart can be defined as 38 p s i χ 1 χ 2 χ n η 1 η 2 η n where the pairs χ η ω identify locations along trajectory s i at travel time ω n τ s i with ω 1 n and n is the number of intervals that build the trajectory see fig 15a where blue dots show the locations χ i η i along a single trajectory the collection of points that defined each trajectory were then used to downscale the smm model by linearly interpolating the particle positions between those stored in p s i providing a spatially explicit description of particle positions at all times the model was developed and tested in a simple periodic pore scale setting the authors compared measurements from direct numerical simulations and their modified smm to evaluate predictions of two nonlinear global measures of mixing generally considered to be necessary for the accurate upscaling of mixing driven chemical reactions these are the dilution index or entropy e t and integral of squared concentration m t respectively defined as 39 e t exp ω p x t log p x t d ω m t ω p 2 x t d ω the dns results and the modified smm were compared at two different péclet numbers pe 100 and 1000 using the downscaling procedure exemplified in fig 15 the agreement between the two was excellent over all times considered suggesting that this procedure can effectively model mixing and dilution processes at least in a global sense thereby providing a significant expansion of the simulation capabilities of the smm the rates of many thermodynamically favorable reactions in porous media are limited by mixing rates in porous media this implies that one can use simplified reactions to study mixing instead of the complex multi component geochemical systems in natural systems one of the most commonly studied simplified models is the irreversible bi molecular mixing driven reaction given by a b c where the letters denote generic chemical components sund et al 2017b adopted this reaction in a periodic domain made up of packed cylinders and proposed a scheme with lagrangian transport and eulerian reaction rates stemming from volume averaging their proposed model takes advantage of the fact that the smm can be used to provide accurate predictions of transport but existing eulerian approximations can be used for mixing limited reactions since they do not require the computationally costly calculations of particle particle interactions e g paster et al 2014 bolster et al 2016 benson and bolster 2016 the approach was shown to be effective for representing subscale fluctuations in concentration fields and as such it was also able to accurately predict the amount of product c that is produced note that the downscaling approaches in sund et al 2017a and sund et al 2017b have some slight differences but conceptually they are very similar and interested readers are referred to those papers for more details another family of reactions that are very important in the context of geologic media are surface reactions which are any reactions that involve mobile phases which directly interact with the liquid solid surface within a porous medium examples include sorption and desorption processes where a solute can be temporarily or permanently trapped relative to the flowing fluid or biological reactions where bio organisms living on the surface consume nutrients in the water removing them permanently from the flow among many others under the assumption of dilute conditions these reactions can be modeled using linear approximations so they are amenable to the smm framework without the need for downscaling sund et al sund et al 2015b considered the same periodic pore system as in fig 9 but included a hypothetical biofilm layer that particles could diffuse into where particles were consumed according to a first order rate law while in the biofilm layer this study showed that the main effect of biofilm reactions was to truncate the late times in travel time distributions as these are the ones that spend most time in the biofilm and thus are most likely to react the travel time distribution for this system was split into two parts one that accounted for particles that survive and another that represented a state of limbo equivalent to an infinite residence time the results again showed that accounting for correlations was critical to ensure that fast particles persist at being fast and thus are also more likely to stay alive while slower particles are more likely to become stuck in limbo one difference that they found relative to the conservative transport case is that accounting for correlation effects remained somewhat important even at pe 100 meaning that the sensitivity to correlation effects changes when reactions are involved sherman et al sherman et al 2019 came to a similar conclusion when studying sorption desorption reactions in a similar system in this case particles that hit the liquid solid boundary have a finite probability of being trapped depending on a first order adsorption rate and being trapped for a finite amount of time depending on a desorption rate following the trajectory approach developed by sund et al 2017a the number of times a given trajectory strikes the liquid solid boundary was added as an additional piece of information in the model and combined with the approach proposed by boccardo et al 2018 to link reaction probabilities with sorption rates accounting for the number of impacts proved to be sufficient to transform a simulation of conservative transport into one with probabilistic adsorption desorption the main difference is that the latter adds delays to the conservative transition times based on the rates of adsorption desorption and the number of times a trajectory strikes the liquid solid boundary where the reactive process is taking place later sherman et al 2020b applied the model to a more complex non periodic porous medium 6 discussion so far this paper has reviewed and summarized the spatial markov model over the first decade since its introduction to the porous media community by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2008a the model aims to represent effective upscaled transport in complex porous media from pore to geologic scales by building on previous modeling studies that demonstrated the importance of accounting for correlation effects while the smm has already shown great promise and evolved immensely in that time it is still a work in progress and we are excited to see where the next steps will take us in this final discussion we highlight some of the primary challenges and limitations of smms in their current forms as well as propose our personal views on pathways forward 6 1 challenges and limitations applications to real systems and real data two examples were highlighted where the smm was applied to two sets of real data a field based study kang et al 2015a and a laboratory study sherman et al 2018 the experiments of sherman et al 2018 were in an idealized setting a 1 d column but even in such a controlled environment additional steps were still needed to optimize the fit of the smm model to the data the example of kang et al 2015a used a site with an uncommon level of characterization developed over years of meticulous data collection and the transport experiments were designed using this knowledge while the models could have fit the data well without this characterization interpretation of the results and success were significantly aided by it while theoretical studies are advancing fast towards predictive approaches there is still an important gap between the information required to constrain the model parameters and what is typically available in field scale scenarios recent efforts based on velocity ctrw puyguiraud et al 2019a require knowledge of the eulerian velocity pdf of the system to predict transport this information would rarely be available in a real field setting the vast majority of smm applications have relied on high resolution numerical simulations most of which are a far cry from typical field conditions so there is a clear need for studies designed around the practical limitations of real systems this includes testing the smm in settings with limited characterization incomplete sampling of tracers and developing new approaches to parameterization that can provide accurate results without requiring abundant information these approaches will have to encompass uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of the flow model parameterization on transport dynamics extending current studies janetti et al 2019 stationarity across scales a defining feature of the smm compared to previous popular models for anomalous transport in porous media is that the smm relaxes the reliance on independent identically distributed random variables the justification for this is that it is necessary in order to capture correlation effects but all the smm applications to date have contained an embedded assumption of incremental stationarity for the correlations this assumes that the same transition matrix is valid along the entire smm path but this assumption is not consistent with the complex hierarchical structure of porous media however it may be possible to define transition matrices in a zonal fashion in order to capture the changes in correlations along the smm path doing so confidently would likely require abundant characterization but some geostatistical techniques are able to incorporate conceptual data and incorporating those advances into the smm could help relax the requirement of strict stationarity a related subtle point is that many of the numerical studies described herein used multi gaussian random fields with fixed length scales for their heterogeneity structures and the models worked well because the assumption of stationarity was valid the issue is that the evolving length scales of heterogeneity in natural geologic systems are non stationary studies are needed that use realistic multi scale heterogeneity fields to investigate when the stationarity assumption is valid when it breaks down and how to account for systematic changes as new features in the hierarchy are sampled a recent example attempting to do this is engdahl and bolster 2020 who use the smm to study transport in a variably saturated watershed including overland vadose zone and saturated flow domains defining unique transition matrices for different parts of the flow domain while this preliminary study shows some promise much work is needed here generalization to nonlinear processes the smm is generally designed to represent the mean effective behavior in the evolution of a concentration field and its simplest forms assume that transport processes are linear however many processes in porous media particularly chemical reactions which are ubiquitous in geologic systems are highly nonlinear and so simply predicting mean behavior is not sufficient and some knowledge of fluctuations below the support scale is required additionally many forms of calculating reactions require calculation of concentrations in fixed volumes naturally necessitating an eulerian interpretation with which the smm must be compatible some efforts have been made along these lines e g the trajectory based methods in periodic domains sund et al 2017a sund et al 2017b but generalizing these approaches to more realistic complex settings still remains to be done the training trajectories approach proposed in most et al 2019 shows promise in this regard however it has currently only been applied in a relatively simple setting and validated at a scale o mm well below typical scales of interest o m km enhancing predictive power perhaps one of the biggest criticisms of transport models in porous media in general is that in order to parameterize the models one typically has to run a transport experiment at the same scale that is to predict transport one must first measure it it would be desirable to establish procedures leading to reliable predictions relying only on prior information available about the geologic system e g distribution of permeabilities in space or at most about the flow e g approximate velocity distribution in space and from that information alone predict transport with reasonable uncertainty this would truly take anomalous transport models to the next level in terms of actually helping solve practical engineering problems in the subsurface environment but in order to get there the smm needs to be studied in more diverse settings and the role of uncertainty and sensitivity on its predictions needs to be considered 6 2 vision for next steps while we report here the historical progress of the smm we are also excited to see where it will go over the next decade here we put forward a few of our own personal visions and hopes to try and stimulate future debates engagement and efforts data driven approaches the complexity of real geologic systems is such that uncertainties can be tremendous and these can even be difficult to quantify in 3 d models because of excessive parameters and runtimes using analytical or purely theoretical approaches to approximate real systems is an attractive solution but is not necessarily feasible because of their excessive simplicity this suggests that finding a parsimonious balance between complex models theories and efficient numerical approaches for data assimilation and model parameterization under uncertainty might be an excellent way forward which could build from recent advances in machine and deep learning as well as other model reduction approaches like polynomial chaos or gaussian emulation rajabi 2019 fajraoui et al 2011 generally these are purely numerical approaches unconstrained by physics and this can justifiably make users uneasy about actual predictability or extrapolation of information beyond training data sets however coupling such methods and constraining them with models based on physical processes such as the smm is an exciting pathway forward to leverage the best of both worlds this is a place where the simplicity of the smm is particularly advantageous because it allows one to capture the variability of a complex transport processes using a less complicated model reduced complexity numerical approaches could be used to capture the time dependent nature of model parameters e g due to flow variability or their spatial variability due to the heterogeneity of the subsurface smart tracers most applications of the smm to date have relied on detailed information that can realistically only be measured in high resolution numerical simulations e g direct measurement of correlation by tracking successive travel times of individual particles such methods are not typically possible with current day experimental approaches however the advent and continued emergence of novel tracers e g individual particles tagged with unique dna markers dahlke et al 2015 mcnew et al 2018 makes us believe that some day it might actually be possible to obtain such information in real experiments while none of the authors of this article are experimentalists we find the idea of such smart tracers very exciting more seamlessly blending geostatistics with smms as noted above a major barrier is that most state of the art models require one to run a transport experiment to infer model parameters alternative data sources are needed to break this cycle but the inaccessibility and uncertainty of the subsurface makes it a challenge one source that is largely overlooked is conceptual geological data which is typically known with high confidence we suggest that blending categorical geostatistics using for example transition probability approaches carle and fogg 1996 weissmann et al 1999 engdahl and weissmann 2010 with smms is a natural pairing because both focus on delineating major transitions changes in geology are strong controls on changes in velocity fields so there is good reason to expect positive correlation between them such a model could be based entirely on commonly available field observables like water levels borehole tests well logs and outcrop analogs to inform process parameterization in the smm which would also provide better connections to data as suggested above for instance in the context of heterogeneous conductivity fields characterization bianchi and pedretti 2017 bianchi and pedretti 2018 proposed the link between anomalous transport characteristics and an emerging disorder indicator termed geological entropy future works may be directed towards linking such indicators with smm model parameters extension to transient flows almost all applications of the smm to porous media flows to date have been under the condition of steady flow conditions with one notable exception of sund et al 2015a who considered turbulent flow real hydrogeologic systems are rarely if ever under true steady state flow conditions as they are continuously forced by intermittent rain events and other elements of the hydrologic cycle but also by anthropogenic factors like pumping extending the smm to naturally account for temporal variability would require a model framework that relaxes strict stationarity in time but considering the linear nature of flow and transport in low reynolds number settings it is reasonable to expect that one could do so in a systematic manner that is physically motivated and theoretically based one approach could be to use stationary velocity ranked transition matrices then scale the velocities up or down as the smm evolves to account for the impacts of any changes in forcing this could be as simple as shifting the mean but in some cases models for the evolution of transition matrices over time might also be needed generalizing training trajectories the training trajectory work of most et al 2019 is one of the most exciting for us because it is one of the first smms that truly attempts to build a model that can predict three dimensional concentration fields within a still parsimonious framework trajectory matching might also be a way of using a combination of synthetic models and data to improve field scale predictions however its current limitation is size to date the trajectory based approach has only been applied in the context of relatively simple sandstone at very small scales trajectory reconstructions are needed for more complex porous media but also at different spatial scales this could lead to a robust approach for upscaling predictive purposes where training of the models performed at one scale sample could be used to model transport in a different and or larger sample this would help develop practical tools for simulating 3 d transport but these will need to be verified against detailed simulations and multi scale physical experiments to develop confidence formally connecting lagrangian and eulerian view points for most anomalous transport models that have been used in hydrogeologic systems one can write clear eulerian and lagrangian descriptions of the system e g berkowitz et al 2006 benson and meerschaert 2009 typically the lagrangian picture is written in terms of a discrete equation such as those presented in this paper and the eulerian one as integro differential equation with nonlocal in space and or time terms for the smm while some efforts have been made this is not entirely the case indeed we the authors believe that the success of the smm in periodic systems suggests that one should be able to formally link the lagrangian framework as we have described it here to the eulerian framework that evolves from formal upscaling approaches such as volume averaging where nonlocal in space and time equations can emerge e g wood and valdes parada 2013 davit et al 2012 porta et al 2016 approaches discussed above sund et al 2017a sund et al 2017b have shown that numerical closures can be implemented to relate the smm formulation to subscale features establishing a formal link between eulerian and lagrangian closures would unlock the possibility to merge the two approaches which could be beneficial e g to predict reactive transport processes relying on measurable eulerian characteristics connecting state of the art mixing and spreading models as noted in the previous subsection the smm as described here is most conducive to describing one dimensional effective transport or predicting mean projected behavior another way of expressing this is to say that they do a good job of capturing spreading i e replicating nonlinear scaling of the second centered moment nonlinear processes such as chemical reactions will require further additions to the smm some exciting developments have taken place in recent years using the concept of lamellae to describe mixing and reactions in complex heterogeneous systems ranging from pore to darcy scales e g le borgne et al 2013 de anna et al 2014 elaborating extensively on these would require an entirely new review article but a large element of these theories relies on balances between mixing and spreading le borgne et al 2011b it would be exciting to see the smm and such approaches coupled together more formally to improve our ability to use the smm to predict nonlinear processes also multiphase systems multiple fluid phases typically coexist in the subsurface examples of common interest of multiphase systems and settings include i the unsaturated zone between the earth s surface and the saturated aquifer where air and water both occupy the void space ii geologic carbon sequestration where supercritical co2 is injected into saline aquifers for permanent storage so that it cannot access the atmosphere iii conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction multiphase flows in porous media can be highly complex leading to even stronger anomalous transport than typically observed recent experiments by jiménez martinez et al 2015 jiménez martinez et al 2017 highlight these very clearly another numerical study by triadis et al 2019 highlights that pre asymptotic anomalous transport at pore scales in a multiphase system can persist for much longer than one would anticipate in a single phase flow while such observations have been made applications of the smm to such systems has been limited formally connecting the single phase and multiphase system behaviors within a unified framework with the smm perhaps using auto and cross transition matrices between the phases would provide an ability to make more general predictions in real systems of interest incorporation of further microscale processes from digital rock and soil samples one of the great advances in porous media over the last decade has been our ability to visualize and measure the full range of complexity at the smallest of scales using innovative technologies able to reconstruct the spatial structure of rock and soil 3d samples and or and 2d sections using micro computed tomography nuclear magnetic resonance raman spectroscopy etc to date these techniques have been used to model the structure of porous media or the resulting velocity fields and then impose transport however rich data relating to microporosity mineral composition heterogeneous reactivity organic matter biofilm distributions imaged phase distributions and so on also exist and all may play a role on how contaminants move and react in real porous media being able to incorporate such information in an effective model such as the smm could be a way to reduce the uncertainty that currently plagues numerical modeling of biogeochemical processes in soils e g biodegradation of emerging contaminants and agrochemicals greskowiak et al 2017 porta et al 2018 new paradigms are needed to incorporate micro scale information into emerging properties with the aim of constraining predictions as extensively discussed in a recent review baveye et al 2018 the smm framework has the potential to overcome the limitation of currently employed approaches by providing a flexible tool to upscale multi scale measurements and characterization going beyond just physical heterogeneity but embracing the full range of biogeochemical heterogeneity that is ubiquitous in real systems and that can often play an even more important role than previously thought although there are still many obstacles that currently prevent these visions from being realized today the authors remain optimistic and excited to see the progression of the smm in the coming years in just over a decade from conception significant advances have occurred in smm research we expect nothing less than continued growth through the foreseeable future as field based and computing technologies advance at unprecedented rates such technological advancement will expand applications to larger scale geologic systems and other natural flows while also assisting the scientific community in solving some of the most challenging global problems including improved methods for energy extraction and mitigating climatic effects induced by anthropogenic emissions such advances will also pave the way for new and different models that can hopefully build on the advances presented here in this review we have detailed the progression of the smm and its many successes while also identifying limitations that must be overcome in order to bring the smm or its successors to new frontiers

1462,heterogeneity across a broad range of scales in geologic porous media often manifests in observations of non fickian or anomalous transport while traditional anomalous transport models can successfully make predictions in certain geological systems increasing evidence suggests that assumptions relating to independent and identically distributed increments constrain where and when they can be reliably applied a relatively novel model the spatial markov model smm relaxes the assumption of independence the smm belongs to the family of correlated continuous time random walks and has shown promise across a wide range of transport problems relevant to natural porous media it has been successfully used to model conservative as well as more recently reactive transport in highly complex flows ranging from pore scales to much larger scales of interest in geology and subsurface hydrology in this review paper we summarize its original development and provide a comprehensive review of its advances and applications as well as lay out a vision for its future development 1 introduction heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of natural porous media and the complex geological media that make up the subsurface and their associated flow and transport processes span a vast range of scales from nanometers to hundreds of kilometers cushman 2013 subsurface heterogeneities occur at every scale and specific forms include physical heterogeneities like transitions between hydrofacies dagan 2012 chemical heterogeneities that reflect changing mineralogies allen king et al 2015 and biological heterogeneities like biofilm growth aubeneau et al 2016 among others each kind of heterogeneity can strongly influence the velocity at which substances can move through the porous medium or their residence times one of the most influential parameters on transport is certainly the intrinsic permeability of the medium which governs fluid velocity and pressure through darcy s law permeability is linked to hydraulic conductivity and can vary by orders of magnitude over relatively short distances this extreme variability often yields behaviors that exhibit broad spatial and temporal velocity distributions which are not predicted well by classical continuum based transport theories that model linear scaling of the mean squared displacement i e by specifying fickian dispersion with constant coefficients the transport of contaminants nutrients other dissolved substances such as bacteria colloids nanoparticles viruses etc often exhibits nonlinear temporal scaling of the mean squared displacement x 2 t α α 1 over time scales of practical interest meerschaert et al 2008 dentz et al 2004 and thus is classified as displaying anomalous transport characteristics superdiffusive transport is obtained for α 1 with subdiffusive transport occurring in the opposite case since transport in natural porous media routinely violates the assumptions of the prevailing state of the art models we need models that can capture the influence of heterogeneity across this range of scales that causes these deviations much of the early work on developing effective transport models in porous media built on the pioneering ideas of taylor taylor 1954 and aris aris 1956 these seminal works demonstrated that transport can be described by an effective advection dispersion equation with a fickian dispersion coefficient when a plume is given sufficient time to sample the full distribution of heterogeneous velocity scales common approaches following this idea include the method of moments brenner 2013 volume averaging whitaker 2013 and homogenization hornung 2012 auriault and adler 1995 as powerful and elegant as these upscaling approaches are they are restricted in their application for three main reasons i they are limited to specific ranges of transport regimes e g in terms of péclet or damköhler numbers the latter in the case of reactive transport ii they require the definition of a spatially periodic unit cell to compute effective parameters and iii the effective coefficients so derived may be valid only at asymptotic times which may be prohibitively long depending on the underlying flow structure other pioneering works studying dispersion in porous media include de josselin de jong 1958 saffman 1959 who introduced the concept of residence times to study particle displacement statistics in general anomalous transport behaviors can be predicted starting from a detailed model of the system heterogeneity this for example can be obtained by applying an effective fickian transport model at local scales where the heterogeneity of the system is fully resolved as it is in a multi dimensional spatially distributed model of flow and transport weissmann et al 1999 lee et al 2007 engdahl and maxwell 2015 riva et al 2010 riva et al 2008 once a spatial resolution is chosen to represent heterogeneity this effectively averages out the sub grid heterogeneity allowing transport in each cell to be modeled as a fickian process but the interactions between cells with disparate velocities lead to larger scale non fickian behaviors le borgne et al 2008a engdahl et al 2012 edery et al 2014 bianchi and pedretti 2017 wright et al 2019 the main issue with this approach is that it requires a detailed model of the subsurface heterogeneities the inaccessibility of the subsurface means that geostatistical techniques are required to approximate it carle and fogg 1996 goovaerts 1997 in fully saturated media e g at aquifer scale perturbation approaches may be used to characterize transport statistics as a function of a permeability spatial heterogeneity model e g dagan 1984 however these linearized approaches become inaccurate for increasing degrees of heterogeneity i e when the variance of natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivity exceeds unity even beyond the mere estimation of the intrinsic permeability significant uncertainty exists in the parameter fields e g porosity as well as the initial and boundary conditions and this may require numerically evaluating ensemble statistics to quantify the uncertainty all of which is computationally expensive similar issues arise when considering non fickian behavior emerging from pore scale simulations salles et al 1992 bijeljic and blunt 2006 anomalous transport can be predicted using a pore scale model but this is computationally unfeasible in real large scale applications i e beyond mm scale samples in short the uncertainty and complexity of a distributed parameter model may outweigh its benefits in a predictive capacity and this further motivates the need for simplified or upscaled models a variety of upscaled models have been proposed to describe anomalous transport in geological porous media and have been applied with success some of the most widely used are multi rate mass transfer mrmt haggerty and gorelick 1995 fractional advection dispersion models fade benson et al 2001 and continuous time random walks ctrw berkowitz et al 2006 it is important to emphasize that these are by no means the only anomalous transport models used in porous media but the most widely used due to their demonstrated success across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales their dissemination into the scientific community has been also promoted by openly available computational toolboxes cortis and berkowitz 2005 kelly et al 2017 haggerty et al 2002 despite the specifics of their individual origins it is noteworthy that these models are all highly inter related e g margolin et al 2003 neuman and tartakovsky 2009 berkowitz et al 2002 schumer et al 2003 dentz and berkowitz 2003 choosing any one model over another typically depends on the conceptual model developed by the user which often aligns more naturally with one framework than the others it has been shown that all of these models can be represented by a random walk or by eulerian nonlocal integro differential partial differential equations we focus in this review on lagrangian approaches where particles transition through space and time following prescribed rules benson and meerschaert 2009 berkowitz et al 2006 benson et al 2001 random walks in general are commonly used in the study of transport in porous media as highlighted in a review by noetinger et al noetinger et al 2016 classical fickian transport can be represented as a random walk but the primary difference is that anomalous transport is generated when the distributions of random increments in space or time have infinite variance or mean metzler and klafter 2000 as such the broad or heavy tailed distributions cannot converge by the central limit theorem to classical fickian limiting behavior resulting in anomalous transport it is important to note that in most implementations of lagrangian random walk models fickian or non fickian successive increments are either implicitly or explicitly assumed to be independent and identically distributed while this is a common assumption it is not necessarily correct in this context le borgne and co workers le borgne et al 2007 clearly showed the importance of correlation for geologically realistic heterogeneous porous media and suggested a need to develop models that relax the assumption of independence other authors painter and cvetkovic painter et al 2002 painter and cvetkovic 2005 painter et al 2008 studying transport in fractured geologic media also demonstrated the existence and importance of correlation effects that must be included to upscale transport correctly this can be achieved upon modeling transport by considering probabilistic rules to determine residence times in successive steps using a markov chain as was already envisaged in earlier works de josselin de jong 1958 in a conceptual sense consider that it is more likely for rapidly moving solute particles to continue moving quickly over small time scales than they are to abruptly slow down the latter is possible but less likely on average thus violating the assumption of independent transitions for practical problems relating to transport through porous media the spatial scale where transitions become independent may be larger than the scales of interest for predictions later numerical studies of flow through highly heterogeneous porous media by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2008a le borgne et al 2008b showed similar behavior including a dependence of lagrangian correlations on the local velocity as well as the ability for a particle to experience abrupt changes in velocities from these observations they suggested and then verified that velocities at equidistant positions along a particle trajectory form a markov process in particular they confirmed that fast particles tended to persist at being fast and slow particles tended to remain slow at fixed spatial increments from this they justified a fixed spatial step langevin equation where successive increments in time are correlated reflecting velocity correlation between individual particles steps this kind of model is what we call the spatial markov model smm the smm has shown great promise in replicating simulated and observed transport behaviors across the diverse range of settings and transport scales in geological porous media the model has also gone by the name correlated ctrw and we will use the names interchangeably throughout this article although it should be noted that the name correlated ctrw pertains to a broader family of models than just the smm the objective of this article is to provide an overview of the smm and its many developments and applications over the last decade or so we open with a general overview of the method in section 2 followed by its historical development and applications in porous and fractured media at multiple scales a discussion of random walks defined in terms of analytical models of velocity transitions is then provided complemented with an overview of smm applications to nonlinear transport processes we then close with a critical review of the challenges limitations and avenues for improving the model in the future and consider how to improve parameterizations and parameter identification as well as how to link specific smm model elements with the properties of natural geological media the work presented here focuses exclusively on the development and application of such models in the context of geologic media however it must be noted that correlated ctrws similar in nature to the smm presented here play an important role in other branches of physics also montero and masoliver 2007 tejedor and metzler 2010 as noted by magdziarz et al magdziarz et al 2012 correlations arise when dealing with living systems including bacterial motion rogers et al 2008 the ecology of animal motion nathan et al 2008 and human mobility song et al 2010 as well as in other dynamic systems such as financial markets scalas 2006 montero and masoliver 2017 seismology corral 2006 and chaotic and turbulent flows manneville 2010 2 the spatial markov model the smm is a particle based random walk model that simulates transport the system is described by a large number of particles n where during each step a particle takes a uniform fixed step in space of size l l in this sense it can be seen as a ctrw model or as a time domain random walk model tdrw using the distinction noted by aquino dentz aquino and dentz 2018 the amount of time it takes to perform the step is random but unlike other approaches it is not independent and is conditioned on the time taken to execute the previous step we then describe transport of each particle according to the discrete equation 1 x n 1 x n l t n 1 t n τ n 1 n 0 1 2 where x n l is the particle position at step n t n t denotes the total travel time at step n and the transition time τ n 1 t is sampled from 2 f τ f τ 1 if n 0 f τ n 1 τ n if n 1 2 where f is a joint distribution function of transition times between the discrete travel times in practice smm applications have predominately been 1 d which significantly reduces the complexity and data requirements of the upscaled model but multi dimensional forms also exist e g kang et al 2011a kang et al 2014 most et al 2019 the distribution of transition times f τ 1 is defined as part of the parameterization of a specific smm and f τ 2 τ 1 is modeled using a conditional transition matrix to obtain the transition matrix f τ 1 is separated into n discrete bins typically but not necessarily equiprobable where n is sufficiently large for convergence le borgne et al 2011a bin 1 contains the particles with the fastest travel times and bin n contains particles with the slowest travel times a particle with travel time τ p is in bin i if t c i τ p t c i 1 where t c i is the cutoff time for bin i t c 1 0 and t c n 1 is greater than the maximum value of τ 1 and τ 2 for all particles then the transition matrix is defined by 3 t i j p τ 2 bin j τ 1 bin i f τ 2 τ 1 it is assumed that the process is stationary such that f τ n 1 τ n f τ 2 τ 1 thus each block of the transition matrix t i j describes the probability that a particle will have a travel time in bin j given that its travel time was in bin i in the previous step a typical transition matrix in this case taken from a pore scale flow by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2011a is shown in fig 1 for equiprobable binning of the travel time distribution an uncorrelated ctrw can be obtained in this formulation if t i j 1 n i j this creates a uniformly distributed transition matrix where all bins are equally accessible to all others meaning that the conditional probability f τ n 1 τ n f τ n 1 and there can be no correlation between steps indeed strictly speaking an uncorrelated series of waiting times also represents a markov model a so called markov 0 model thus in this sense any continuous time random walk for the modeling of particle positions in space is based on a spatial markov process a non uniform transition matrix is the distinguishing feature of the smm as we refer to it here relative to their uncorrelated ctrw cousins the travel times τ n for each step along the path is drawn from the conditional distributions and this produces the total time to reach the nth step conceptually the resulting paths share some similarity with stochastic convective transport models simmons et al 1995 ginn et al 2001 or a streamtube ensemble atchley et al 2013 engdahl and maxwell 2014 cirpka et al 2015 3 development applications and implications 3 1 transport in highly heterogeneous permeability fields the first application of the smm in the context of porous media flows was performed by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2008a le borgne et al 2008b who were interested in upscaling transport of a conservative scalar through highly heterogeneous porous media represented by a darcy continuum darcy type flow is described by 4 q x k x h where k x l t is a hydraulic conductivity tensor h l is the head potential and the so called darcy velocity is q x l t the darcy velocity is a mass averaged velocity resulting from the homogenization of pore scale flows that are not explicitly represented in the upscaled model so the influence of all processes below the support scale of the darcy continuum are embedded in the effective parameter k x which is often reduced to a single scalar value k assuming an isotropic medium which is questionable in geologic media but often invoked for simplicity given the size of geologic systems it is typically not feasible not possible and not even desirable to represent pore scales in their full detail for domains larger than a soil column i e beyond the characteristic length scale of cm dm as such an effective continuum perspective is typically considered when studying practical applications of transport in geologic systems i e velocity is approximated through darcy s law the darcy velocity is defined to maintain continuity of the flow and is not the mean pore water velocity v x l that dictates how solutes advect but this can be obtained from v x q x ϕ x where ϕ is the porosity one of the challenges in groundwater hydrology is developing accurate transport models for highly heterogeneous systems for which the variance of the log conductivity field is typically much larger than one σ 2 lnk 1 while it is known that the limit σ 2 lnk 1 may be respected within individual geological depositional units fogg et al 1998 meerschaert et al 2013 the hierarchical nature of large scale geological formations juxtaposes geomaterials with dramatically different k ranges over short distances and this causes σ 2 lnk to grow rapidly le borgne et al investigated 2 d hydraulic conductivity fields that were well above the σ 2 lnk 1 threshold in particular they studied transport in three heterogeneous systems that contain several of the important features of real geologic systems i a multilognormal k field ii a field with identical variance but fully connected highly permeable preferential flow paths and iii a stratified system with σ 2 lnk 9 the k fields were characterized by an isotropic correlation distance λ sample conductivity and associated velocity fields are shown in fig 2 all three fields have identical point distributions of hydraulic conductivity values but clearly vary in their structure and this creates velocity fields that vary by over 10 orders of magnitude the velocity fields also exhibit varying degrees of connectivity in terms of slow regions and longer connected fast flow channels as one moves from i to iii the more connected fields typically result in earlier first arrivals and larger late arrivals with more disperse breakthrough curves reflecting that fast particles persist at being fast to arrive quickly and slow particles persist at being slow trapped to arrive later the fields shown in fig 2 were used to develop a domain wide upscaled model of the longitudinal mean flow direction lagrangian velocities defined as 5 v l x n 1 x n t x n 1 t x n which accounts for diffusive and advective motion the velocities were defined by considering the probability for a particle to transition from velocity v at travel time t to velocity v at travel time t 6 r t v t v t δ v v t t v t t v as well as the probability for a particle to make a transition from velocity v at travel distance x to velocity v at travel distance x 7 r s v x v x δ v v s x v s x v after discretizing the velocity distribution into n equiprobable classes they defined the temporal and spatial velocity transition matrices for temporal increment t and the spatial increment s as 8 t i j t v i v i 1 v j v j 1 r t v t v t d v dv t i j s v i v i 1 v j v j 1 r s v x v x d v dv where t i j is the probability to make a transition from a velocity v c j to a velocity v c i these metrics allowed le borgne et al to demonstrate that the lagrangian velocity fields are characterized by a broad range of correlation times as quantified by t t but a relatively narrow range of correlation distances as quantified by t s based on this observation the authors applied a test for markovian behavior in space and time in order to describe a markov chain the chapman kolmogorov condition requires that the transition matrix must satisfy 9 t ω ω t ω t ω t nω t n ω where ω is a dummy variable the analysis revealed that markovian behavior in time was never observed over the time scales considered owing to a broad distribution of correlation times but that spatial increments greater than λ 2 were markovian these observations motivate the use of an smm as described in 2 and also explain the origin of the name the smm model was proposed by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2008b and applied in le borgne et al 2008a to predict two commonly measured features in porous media i first passage time distributions at a distance 12 5λ corresponding to a flux weighted initial line condition spanning most of the vertical extent of the domain and ii evolution of the spatial variance of the concentration field in both cases the results of a fully resolved direct numerical simulation dns were compared to predictions made with an smm as well as a model that considers no correlation between successive spatial steps referred to in their paper a classical ctrw although we will not adopt that notation here their results are shown in fig 3 and demonstrate that the smm can reproduce the dominant features of the dns whilst the model that does not account for correlation is unable to accurately reproduce the dns most notably the uncorrelated model fails to adequately capture early arrivals but it also under predicts late time arrivals for the multi lognormal case which can be summarized as under estimating spreading over time the example clearly demonstrates the importance of accounting for velocity correlation since both models correlated and uncorrelated used the same limited information in the space time domain of interest to infer velocity distributions at larger scales the concept is simple enough in principle whereby fast particles tend to persist at being fast i e once in a fast channel they can remain their for quite a while and slow particles can also persist at being slow but it has a profound impact on the performance of the upscaled transport model it should be noted that the same numerical dataset was later analyzed by berkowitz and scher 2010 with an uncorrelated ctrw which was also able to accurately reproduce the dns data this can be explained by observing that the correlated model will ultimately converge to an uncorrelated one bolster et al 2014 whose space time transitions pdf is of course different than the one measured on a smaller scale 3 2 transport in fractured media another common setting that is of interest in the geosciences is flow through fractured media where flow rather than occurring through pore spaces in unconsolidated media happens through fractures in an otherwise near impermeable rock matrix such settings are common in nature and the broad range of fracture properties and architectures are known to result in complex flow networks that display anomalous transport e g berkowitz and scher 1997 anomalous transport in such systems may arise from different physical characteristics that define the fractures such as the aperture of individual fractures or the angle between the fracture direction and the average pressure gradient the spatial arrangement of fracture intersections also plays a relevant role in this context painter cvetkovic and coauthors using discrete fracture network models to simulate flow and transport in fractured geologic media demonstrated the existence and importance of correlation effects that must be included to upscale transport correctly painter et al 2002 painter and cvetkovic 2005 painter et al 2008 in the context of the smm kang et al kang et al 2011a studied flow and transport in a fractured medium to focus only on one form of heterogeneity they idealized their fracture network as depicted in fig 4 their lattice is made up of two sets of parallel equidistant links separated by distance l the links are oriented at a fixed angle α with respect to the longitudinal x axis the flow is driven by a unit potential drop in the longitudinal direction φ 1 at the inlet and φ 0 at the outlet along each link flow is governed by darcy type flow an averaged poiseuille flow where the flow velocity depends on the fracture conductivity k length l and potential drop across a fracture such that for a link between node i and j the velocity is u ij k ij φ i φ j l a further physical constraint of incompressibility is imposed such that the sum of all inflows and outflows at a node is zero i e at node i j u ij 0 this results in a linear set of equations that can readily be solved the only form of heterogeneity that the authors considered was in the fracture conductivities k where each link was assigned an independent and identically distributed value they considered lognormal cauchy and truncated power law distributions that is there is no correlation imposed in the medium structure from this setup the set of all realizations of the random fracture network form a statistical ensemble that is both stationary and ergodic they then perform particle tracking simulations neglecting diffusion and assuming complete mixing at each node i e a particle s exit from each node is determined randomly by flux weighted probability considering a point initial condition x t 0 δ x they run simulations over o 1000 realizations and average over realizations to obtain mean particle density p x t as in le borgne et al 2008a kang et al studied individual particle trajectories by considering ensemble statistics of lagrangian velocities and focusing on transition times at fixed space increments as in taylor 1954 they demonstrated that correlation between subsequent transition times does indeed exist despite the fact that the random fracture permeabilities are completely independent the imposition of incompressibility induces correlation in space i e flow develops along minimum resistance pathways that connect inflow to outflow they also successfully demonstrated that a markov model predicted the transition probabilities suggesting that a smm may be a suitable upscaled model they proposed such a correlated ctrw where particle locations are governed by the following equation 10 x n 1 x n l v n v n t n 1 t n l v n successive velocities follow a markov chain with one step transition probability density as in 7 from this the particle density can be written as 11 p x t t l v t r x v t d t dv where r x v t δ x x n δ v v n δ t t n where r x v t represents the particle distribution in space velocity and time after n steps it satisfies kolmogorov type recursion equation 12 r x v t δ x p v δ t r v v δ x x l v v r x v t d x d v which describes how this distribution evolves over successive jumps if one assumes that successive jumps are uncorrelated i e r v v p v then an uncorrelated ctrw model is recovered where 13 p x t 0 t t t r x t ψ x τ d x dτd t with recursion equation 14 r x t δ x δ t r x t ψ x x t t d x d t and joint transition length and time density is given by 15 ψ x t p v δ x l v v δ t l v d v finally kang et al compare the results from fully resolved dns simulations to predictions obtained with both the correlated and uncorrelated ctrw models their results are shown in fig 4 bottom particle density is non gaussian in space having a sharp leading edge and elongated tail as in le borgne et al 2008a an uncorrelated model where subsequent transition times are random and mutually independent and are drawn from numerically measured distributions fails to accurately capture the full behavior of the system similar mismatches not shown here are observed in predictions of first passage times and evolution of second centered moments in time which persist in displaying anomalous superdiffusive growth over the full range of space and times considered it is worth repeating here that there is no correlation in the fracture network permeability field but rather that this correlation structure emerges due to the fact that mass must be balanced at each node and the flow is incompressible the application of this approach to a fractured rock field site kang et al 2015a is described in further detail in 3 5 the model presented in this section has been further elaborated in kang et al 2011b kang et al 2015b other recent applications in random discrete fracture networks of potential interest include kang et al 2017a hyman et al 2019a hyman et al 2019b sherman et al 2020a 3 3 transport at pore scales in porous media working at the continuum darcy scale of flow and transport is practical when studying systems at geologic scales as was the case in the previous two sections but it is also important to recognize that heterogeneity in the flow exists below those scales within individual pores and fractures most natural media are highly complex at this scale and the resulting flows can have a very broad range of transport time and velocity scales leading to anomalous behaviors while this complexity is often ignored and replaced with an effective advection dispersion equation at darcy scales it is well known that such an effective model rests on strong assumptions that are often not met and that can lead to incorrect predictions most of these effective models are built on ideas relating to taylor dispersion taylor 1954 which is strictly only valid at asymptotic times that is at a time τ d l 2 d where l is a characteristic length and d the diffusion coefficient physically this timescale represents the characteristic time it takes a particle to sample a system s full velocity variability depending on the system in question or the problem being solved it may not be possible to reach the characteristic time scale so models capable of representing behaviors below this are needed 3 3 1 pore scale smms le borgne et al in le borgne et al 2011a were the first to apply the smm in the context of a pore scale flow and transport setting they considered a two dimensional porous medium as depicted in fig 5 the medium is made up of voids and circular grains of two diameters that fill the space resulting in a porosity of 0 42 the flow is driven by a uniform pressure drop from top to bottom periodic conditions are imposed for flux on all boundaries this particular domain was chosen as it had been the basis of previous transport upscaling studies tartakovsky and neuman 2008 tartakovsky et al 2007 due to the fact that the velocity field displays interesting features including a braided network of preferential flow paths as well as low velocity and stagnation zones two features that are often associated with anomalous or highly non fickian pre asymptotic transport dispersion in this setting has been observed to be superdiffusive over 2 orders of magnitude in time with higher order moments further reinforcing that transport is strongly anomalous de anna et al 2013 the authors compute the transit time and the transition matrix due to purely advective transport over a distance corresponding to the mean pore length the resulting transition matrix is depicted in fig 1 and as with previous studies depicts a strong diagonal dominance reflecting that particles will most likely persist to move at a similar velocity with the two strongest hot spots at the extremes fast particle persist at being fast i e they are trapped in fast channels and slow particle persist at being slow a comparison of the distribution of longitudinal position of particles from a line injection at the boundary at various times between numerical results from high resolution direct numerical simulation as well as correlated and uncorrelated ctrw models is shown in fig 5 the smm is well able to reproduce the pore scale dns values even at the very earliest times while the uncorrelated model fails 3 3 2 intermittency the results of le borgne et al 2011a are ultimately quite similar to previous studies merely in a different setting when the authors dug deeper into this system in de anna et al 2013 they found something that adds more significantly to the entire story in fig 6 we see the same two dimensional porous medium as above along with the trajectory of a single advective particle superimposed below are the time series along that trajectory for the particle s velocity and acceleration looking carefully at these series the lagrangian acceleration displays an intermittent behavior as it switches between periods of low variability to periods with strong fluctuations in magnitude the low variability regime corresponds to when a particle is in low velocity regions here lagrangian longitudinal velocities and accelerations are small and strongly correlated the large fluctuation regime occurs when the particle is in regions of high velocity such as flow channels where accelerations are large and erratic intermittency is a phenomenon that is observed in many physical settings e g friedrich et al 2011 but some key and unique aspects exist in the context of porous media some insight can be gained by considering the correlation function of the lagrangian acceleration as well as that of its absolute value respectively given by 16 χ a τ a t τ a a t τ a σ a 2 χ a τ a t τ a a t τ a σ a 2 where a denotes acceleration a related and useful measure that is often studied in intermittent systems is the lagrangian velocity increment associated with some time lag τ given by 17 δ τ v v t τ v t or better said the distribution of these accelerations normalized by its standard deviation p δ τ v σ δv τ both of these metrics are displayed for the considered system in fig 7 for the case of acceleration the correlation decreases rapidly in time briefly becoming anti correlated due to the rapid fluctuations in acceleration in high velocity channels noted above in fig 6 on the other hand the correlation for absolute value of acceleration decays more slowly showing something more like a power law decay over the observed timescales in other systems such as turbulent flows intermittency is associated with an exponential decay in correlation of a which in turn leads to a rapid convergence to gaussian like behavior as such this persistence is a unique and important aspect of intermittency in porous media its persistence highlights why it is important to consider as anomalous effects may play a role for longer times than assumed in conventional models the distribution of lagrangian velocity increments at fixed time lags has a sharp peak around 0 with symmetric exponential tails whose slope increases as the lag increases the sharp peak in the center is associated with low velocity regions that correspond to small accelerations as seen in fig 6 such a peak is typically not seen in other intermittent systems such as turbulent flows where the time varying nature of the flow allows particles to sample velocities more quickly also shown in the figure is the gaussian distribution which would arise at asymptotic times but that is never obtained here once again highlighting the persistence of intermittency and anomalous behavior the observations from this study suggest that any upscaled model for transport should ideally capture these behaviors in accelerations in order to be able to replicate intermittent behavior with these specific characteristics de anna et al de anna et al 2013 proposed that the smm is such a model a clear definition of acceleration for comparison with these observation is not obvious in the context of the smm and so de anna et al 2013 suggested the following the acceleration during step n considering spatial increment λ and time increment τ can be seen as 18 λ v n 1 τ n t n t n τ n t n t a n d t d t assuming a constant acceleration over each step and continuity of velocity at turning points 19 a n 2 λ τ n 2 2 v n 1 τ n v n v n 1 a n τ n with this they were able to compare to observations from the full pore scale simulations the smm is able to accurately represent both the correlation of the acceleration and absolute value of acceleration including anticorrelation and long range effects as shown in fig 7 likewise the distribution of velocity increments for different time lags are in excellent agreement for all considered time lags with peaks and tails well represented for comparison a single example for an uncorrelated model is also included such a model leads to an overestimate of probabilities of large increments over small lag times allowing particles to switch velocities too quickly relative to what happens in the real incompressible flow the setting considered by le borgne et al 2011a and de anna et al 2013 is a highly idealized porous medium relative to what a real geologic medium might look like to explore whether their findings extended to more realistic systems the model has been applied to predict solute transport kang et al 2014 in an image based reconstruction of a real rock system their flow field is shown in fig 8 along with velocity and acceleration time series in both longitudinal and transverse directions these time series display the same intermittent behavior as reported in de anna et al 2013 they found that transport is highly anomalous observing superdiffusive spreading in the longitudinal direction and subdiffusive spreading in the transverse one again reflecting a balance that likely arises due to the incompressible nature of the flow in this system they also show that an smm can faithfully reproduce the behavior measured from their dns both in terms of temporal scaling of spatial moments and instantaneous distributions of particle locations at various times it is important to note that the intermittency discussed in this section applies to time series such as those shown in figs 6 and 8 however if one looks at spatial series that is velocities of particles over fixed spatial increments a pretty regular spatial signal emerges where the velocity appears to remain roughly constant correlated for over an almost constant distance see puyguiraud et al 2019a fig 2 for a clear example such observations again justify the choice of a spatial over temporal markov model validating le borgne et al s le borgne et al 2008a le borgne et al 2008b original observations and suggestions 3 4 transport in periodic domains many of the classical upscaling theories that are commonly applied in the context of porous media typically rely on the assumption of some representative elementary volume that is assumed periodic in order to close the resulting mathematical system e g brenner 2013 whitaker 2013 while the smm does not appear to explicitly require such an assumption a reasonable question is whether it can perform well in such a context also in particular many of these classical theories are only valid at asymptotic times and it is often desirable to make predictions at pre asymptotic times while these theories can be generalized to pre asymptotic times the resulting set of differential equations can be highly nonlocal in space and time and almost as difficult to solve as the full microscale problem as noted by davit et al 2012 porta et al 2016 note that a recent paper puyguiraud et al 2020 does demonstrate the existence of an rev as a necessary condition for any ctrw however this rev is not defined in the traditional sense in terms of medium properties but rather in terms of the representativeness of the eulerian flow properties recognizing that a periodic domain has a natural length scale that is the length of the actual cell le borgne et al 2011a proposed that this should be the fixed spatial jump in the smm equations in order to test this they considered a simple benchmark problem that has often been considered as a useful idealization of a porous medium flow through a periodic channel with a sinusoidal boundary as depicted in 9 dykaar and kitanidis 1996 kitanidis and dykaar 1997 one of the reasons that this flow is considered interesting is that it has a fast preferential flow down the center line and depending on the aspect ratio of the pore as well as the considered reynolds number the emergence of recirculation zones which act as traps causing particles to potentially be retained for long times relative to the main flow two simulated trajectories in such a setting are shown in fig 9 reflecting both a very fast as well as a very slow trajectory in particular note that the slow one is repeatedly trapped while the fast one persists at being fast suggesting a correlated process similar to the ones we have discussed in the settings above in le borgne et al 2011a stokes flow is considered and the system behaves in a very similar manner to the more realistic porous medium discussed above and shown in fig 5 later bolster et al bolster et al 2014 considered a diverse range of reynolds numbers to explore the impact of flow inertia on transport in the same periodic geometry in both studies the authors simulated transport across two periodic elements recording the amount of time it took each particle to traverse the first and then the second periodic element from this they measured the transition matrix of the system in particular unlike previous studies which predominantly focused on purely advective transport or only considered one particular péclet number these studies explored behavior over a range of péclet numbers from diffusion to advection dominated here the péclet number is defined as 20 pe 2 uh d where u is the mean velocity h the characteristic half width of the channel and d the diffusion coefficient a typical transition matrix for pe 100 and pe 1000 is shown in fig 10 the pe 1000 case shows the characteristic behavior that we have described in several settings so far that fast particles are most likely to persist at being fast and that slow particles are most likely to persist at being slow reflected by the strong diagonal band predominance of diagonal terms is much less evident in the pe 100 case suggesting that correlation effects here are much less important than for the larger pe case using this result the authors compared breakthrough curve and moment evolution measured from dns to predictions using both correlated and uncorrelated ctrw models where the uncorrelated model draws transition times from the distribution obtained for transition times across a single periodic cell they found that for all cases of pe 100 that the uncorrelated and correlated models performed equally well while for pe o 100 the model that did not include correlation effects failed to reproduce observations in particular missing early arrivals and late time tails samples highlighting this can be seen in the breakthrough curves in fig 10 this threshold has been confirmed by other studies also suggesting that correlation effects should be accounted for any time a system with pe o 100 is considered an additional question that was addressed by le borgne et al 2011a relates to the discrete nature of the transition matrix how many bins should the transition matrix be discretized into to effectively capture large scale behavior via an error analysis they found that as long as more than ten bins were used that smm predictions converged to the reference solution while this is an entirely empirical observation for an isolated case it has been found to hold in other settings also e g sund et al 2015a sund et al 2016 as in previous implementations of the smm for the first set of periodic systems considered le borgne et al 2011a bolster et al 2014 parameterization of the model was conducted by simulating particle transport across two periodic elements in order to measure both the transition time as well as the transition matrix for most other upscaling approaches only one element is typically considered and so some have criticized the smm as gaining an unfair advantage over other models in this regard sund et al sund et al 2017a realized that in a periodic setting this parameterization could actually be done by simulating transport over only one single periodic element the key to their approach was recognizing that a particle s travel time across a single element is dictated by the location where it enters that element given its starting point a particle has a finite range of travel times and exit locations the exit location can then be used as the inlet location for the next element this is depicted pictorially in fig 11 where trajectories are shown for three different start locations across one periodic element for two different péclet numbers pe 100 and 1000 for the lower value of pe there are a broad range of possible outlet locations with significant overlap between the three distinct starting points on the other hand for the higher pe the range of possible outlet locations is much tighter inducing the correlation an effective transition matrix is also shown for the two cases highlighting probability inlet versus outlet location with very similar structural features to that which relates travel times in fig 10 note that this transition matrix is for illustration purposes only as it is never explicitly used the parameterization for this novel approach is developed by simulating trajectories for n ps particles distributed across all possible inlet locations with this one can define a set of s s 1 s n ps of trajectories s i each of which travels from an inlet to an outlet location each trajectory s i has an associated inlet location y in s i an outlet location y out s i and a travel time τ s i a specific order of the trajectories s i is assumed by setting y in s 1 y in s 2 y in s n ps for computational reasons the trajectories are subdivided into a number of n bin subsets similar to the discretization of the transition matrix 21 s j bin s i s y in s jb y in s i y in s jb where 22 j b j bin 1 n bin n ps 1 j b j bin n bin n ps j bin 1 n bin this sets a mapping between a location y in at the inlet section and a bin number j bin which establishes a direct link between the location of the particle at the inlet section and the travel time through the trajectory s i as noted the outlet position associated with trajectory s i serves as the inlet position for the next transition or better said sets the bin from which the next trajectory is sampled sund et al sund et al 2017a chose to study the same geometry as shown in fig 9 by doing this the authors were able to run a fully parameterized smm that performed as well as previous versions but with only half the simulation required for parameterization additionally the actual implementation of the model is more efficient resulting in an even faster model since as noted above no transition matrix step is ever explicitly needed finally as further discussed later in section 5 1 this version of the smm includes the ability to recover particle spatial distributions within each periodic cell this trajectory based framework can be indeed seen as a lagrangian numerical closure for a model that can be used to approximate solute mixing and particle positions below the cell resolution thus retaining close analogy with closure variable invoked in classical eulerian upscaling approaches 3 5 applications to real systems a criticism of the smm is that proper parameterization requires extensive data that cannot readily be obtained in field and laboratory settings in all cases discussed so far this comes from high resolution simulations which directly measure particle travel times and correlations most commonly particle trajectories are measured over two characteristic lengths in high resolution direct numerical simulations that fully resolve flow and transport across the domain of interest this then provides sufficient data to quantify velocity transition probabilities due to this most smm applications have been primarily limited to synthetic numerical systems two approaches have emerged recently aiming to overcome these challenges and enable application of the smm in field scale and laboratory settings in the first kang et al kang et al 2015a assume an idealized simplified diagonal transition matrix structure with a single correlation parameter which can be found by fitting tracer experiments in the second method sherman et al sherman et al 2017 introduce an inverse modeling approach which infers the transition matrix from two successively measured breakthrough curves this method was applied using column experimental data to predict transport at the laboratory scale sherman et al 2018 both of these methods have their associated strengths and weaknesses which are discussed below 3 5 1 fractured media kang et al kang et al 2015a is to our knowledge the first and only study where the smm is applied to non synthetic data at the field scale the setting that they worked on was experimental data collected from a fractured granite at the ploemeur field site in france fig 12 the matrix permeability within the granite at this site is very low and so groundwater flows primarily through the fracture network where four major conductive fracture intersections have been identified two boreholes 83 m and 100 m deep are spaced apart by a distance r c 6m enabling easy injection and extraction of tracer into the network kang et al conducted two types of experiments to quantify transport behavior convergent and push pull tracer tests in the convergent tests a known mass of nonreactive tracer flourescein is injected at borehole 1 and tracer concentration is measured at borehole 2 a pump at borehole 2 creates a stationary pressure field driving flow from borehole 1 to 2 in the push pull tests a known mass of tracer is again injected into borehole 1 followed by a continuous injection of water for a set amount of time push then a pump at borehole 1 is used to reverse the direction of flow pull and the tracer is measured at the point of injection in fractured media the four mechanisms that influence transport are heterogenous advection matrix diffusion hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption with heterogenous advection being partially time reversible while the others are not for this reason solute spreading due to heterogenous advection is partially reversed in the push pull experiments therefore the advective spreading in the push pull experiments is minimized and the observed breakthrough curves display a narrower distribution than the convergent breakthrough curves thereby indicating velocity correlation is important in this system additionally the observed breakthrough curves displayed different power law tailing exponents depending on the fracture upon which tracer was injected indicative of the varying levels of heterogeneity for each fracture these heterogeneities as well as heterogenous advection must be effectively represented in the smm for accurate modeling of solute transport through this fractured media kang et al kang et al 2015a proposed a simplified smm framework to model the observed transport behavior to do so they assume an idealized diagonal transition matrix structure determined by a single constant parameter a the idealized transition matrix has diagonal elements with a value a and the remaining elements have equal probability 1 a n 1 where n is the number of matrix columns 23 t ij a i j 1 a n 1 i j i j 1 n a quantifies the probability of persisting in the same velocity class over successive model steps note that as with many empirically measured transition matrices the fully parameterized transition matrix t converges to a uniform matrix after many model steps lim n t n i j 1 n and thus correlation decays exponentially specifically correlation at the n th model step is related to the second eigenvalue of t c n χ 2 n exp n ln χ 2 the second eigenvalue of the diagonalized transition matrix in eq 23 is χ 2 na 1 n 1 it follows naturally that a dimensionless correlation λ length can be expressed as 24 λ l r c 1 ln n 1 na 1 n 1 l r c 1 ln a 1 here l is the streamwise jump distance of the smm and r c is a characteristic length between the tracer injection and withdrawal points this simplified transition matrix of kang et al kang et al 2015a allows velocity correlation to be described with a single parameter a which is related to the correlation length and allows easier parameterization of smm particle motion in the smm as applied in kang et al 2015a follows 25 r n 1 r n l 2 αl ξ n t n 1 t n lr n k v η n where α is dispersivity ξ is a identical independently distributed gaussian random variable η is a dimensionless time and k v is proportional to discharge divided by the fracture aperture hence in addition to λ the velocity distribution and dispersivity input parameters are required to run the smm in this study the velocity distribution assumed the form of a truncated pareto distribution with power law slope 1 β meaning λ β and α are the only three parameters that need to be estimated for smm application to this end random walk equation parameters α dispersivity β velocity distribution and λ velocity correlation were fitted to measured breakthrough curve data the velocity and dispersivity parameters β α showed best fit values of 0 75 0 03 and 0 85 0 02 for two different fractures respectively the velocity correlation length was determined to be the same order of magnitude as the mean distance between fracture connections suggesting that velocities are strongly correlated through a single fracture and decorrelate at intersections ctrw model predictions show significant improvement when accounting for velocity correlation even with this simple idealized correlation structure note that the same authors later applied this idealized matrix structure to predict transport observed in numerical simulations of a stressed fracture system with heterogeneous aperture and flow fields kang et al 2016 the success of the idealized transition matrix structure in both of these systems is exciting for future field smm applications because it suggests that only certain correlation properties need to be included to faithfully predict transport in certain subsurface media furthermore this simplified structure closely resembles a bernoulli ctrw an emerging subclass of smm models that is discussed further down in section 4 2 we must note that the assumed correlation structure may not reflect universal behavior and therefore it remains an open challenge to fully parameterize the velocity correlation in non synthetic field scale systems 3 5 2 laboratory experiments one of the challenges with real experimental settings is that detailed information on individual lagrangian trajectories is not typically available nor realistically obtainable thus directly measuring the transition matrix is next to impossible in most settings the best one can hope for is breakthrough curve measurements at multiple downstream locations to this end sherman et al sherman et al 2017 introduced an inverse modeling approach to estimate the transition matrix from two successive breakthrough curves specifically breakthrough curves positioned at distances l c and 2l c from the inlet where a pulse injection is introduced the inverse modeling procedure solves the discretized form of the governing smm equation which requires that particle travel times sample from a discrete probability distribution the inverse model like the forward smm assumes that travel time distributions between successive spatial increments l c are stationary therefore the porous medium is conceptualized as a column of identical cells analogous to the periodic pore domains presented previously the travel time distribution for each cell is equivalent to the normalized breakthrough curve at the first cell s outlet a particle s arrival time at the second cell then must be a combination of two times sampled from this travel time distribution the inverse model leverages the stationary assumption to find combinations of times sampled from breakthrough curve 1 that equal times measured in breakthrough curve 2 discretizing breakthrough curves 1 and 2 enables all variables in the discretized smm equation to be known except the transition matrix meaning the transition matrix can be estimated by solving a system of equations the governing discretized smm equation can be expressed as 26 p τ 2 σ i σ j τ 1 a τ 1 b τ 2 p cell 1 τ 1 a bin i t i j p cell 2 τ 1 b bin j here p τ 2 is the probability associated with arrival times at x 2l c within a discrete interval τ 2 t i j is an element in the transition matrix and τ 1 a τ 1 b are discrete time intervals to travel across 1 increment l c i e within x 0 l c and x l c 2l c respectively more simply this equation states that the probability of a particle arriving at x 2l c within the interval τ 2 is all combinations where the time to traverse 0 l c plus the time to traverse l c 2l c lies in τ 2 converting breakthrough curves into discrete distributions means that each discrete arrival time interval has an associated empirical probability and can be sorted by velocity class i e p cell 1 τ 1 a bin i is known assuming spatial stationarity of travel time distributions throughout the domain allows p cell 2 τ 1 b binj to be calculated from the discretized breakthrough curve at l c leaving t i j as the only unknown in eq 26 every discrete time from breakthrough curve 2l c has a corresponding equation which form a system of equations that estimates the transition matrix when solved note that when the number of discretized times from breakthrough curve 2l c exceed the number of elements in the transition matrix the system of equations is overconstrained as is the case in sherman et al 2018 the overconstrained system is solved with a least squares method and then transition matrix rows are normalized so that their sum is unity to date application of this inverse model has been both on synthetic sherman et al 2017 as well as more excitingly a non synthetic experimental system sherman et al 2018 in sherman et al 2018 transport of a conservative solute through a 1 2 m long column packed with zeolite clinoptilolite a material with multiscale porosity known to yield anomalous transport is measured a pulse of nacl tracer was injected at the column inlet and breakthrough curve data was obtained at 1 6 2 6 and 5 6 the column s length experiments were run at pe o 100 o 1000 in triplicate a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 13 breakthrough curves sampled at the first two ports were discretized then fed into the inverse algorithm and the transition matrix was estimated the transition matrix and measured breakthrough curves parameterize the forward smm enabling breakthrough curve predictions at port 3 to be compared with experimental data correlation was determined important for both pe numbers as the estimated transition matrices displayed a diagonalized structure indicating fast velocities preferentially remain fast and slow velocity preferentially remain slow as expected correlation increased with increasing pe estimated breakthrough curves using the inferred transition matrix significantly improved upon predictions using an uncorrelated ctrw model as shown in fig 13 specifically both breakthrough curve peak and tailing behavior was better captured when correlation was included for both pe experiments as expected in any inverse modeling process discretization and measurement error in the data induce uncertanties in parameters estimates i e transition matrix entries and the inverse method requires further iteration and optimization sherman et al 2018 did so in a very simple manual manner obtaining excellent agreement with experimental measurements fully automating this secondary optimatization still remains to be done however to date and to our knowledge this remains the only study where a fully parameterized smm i e where the entire matrix correlation structure is faithfully represented is applied in a non synthetic setting 3 6 higher dimension processes training trajectories in 3 d domains while a great deal can be learned by studying the idealized periodic pore systems that we have mentioned it is also important to recognize the limitations the fact that the system is so simple means that while it may display some of the interesting features of a real porous medium such as preferential flow channels and trapping regions these features are of one size unlike a real geologic medium where a broad distribution of channel sizes and trapping regions can exist additionally the completely periodic nature of the system is not reflective of subsurface porous media to overcome some of these limitations and focus on a more realistic system most et al 2016 simulated high resolution trajectories through a series of real geologic media a doddington sandstone whose structure was digitally mapped using micro ct scanning the velocity field and representative trajectories are shown in fig 14 top unlike many previous studies they focused not just on the correlations between successive longitudinal jumps but looked at the full correlation of velocities in all three dimensions of the system finding that there is a strong cross dependence between longitudinal and transverse increments based on an extensive empirical analysis of the 3 d trajectories they concluded that i memory and cross dependence are persistent in and among all directions ii that the dependence is highly nonlinear iii that this co dependency occurs at different temporal scales and iv that it is dependent on the péclet number their work suggests that should one want to extend the smm to predict realistic concentration fields in three dimensions one would need to thoroughly describe the governing statistics of a three dimensional transport problem which would require parameterization of a nine dimensional transition matrix while possible it requires immense effort and computational power recognizing the practical limitations of a 9 d transition matrix most et al 2019 proposed a novel solution called the training trajectory approach tta in it the authors take the full length trajectories that are simulated from the dns fig 14 and use these as a library of plausible paths each trajectory is divided into equidistant segments of length as depicted in the middle row of fig 14 the segments are stored in a database from which the increments for the smm model are sampled giving a transition time and displacement direction the key difference is that this decomposes the 3 d transport into a series of steps that are also 3 d but the steps in the cartesian directions are not simulated independently so the 9 d transition matrices are avoided entirely the necessary assumption is that this archive of training trajectories inherently captures all the processes and correlations required to represent larger scale transport most et al 2019 provide extensive criteria required to ensure this and for a comprehensive discussion we direct the interested reader there 4 velocity transition models the previous section highlighted empirical approaches to modeling the transition matrix reflecting much of the early work in the field more recently theoretical frameworks based on analytical velocity transition models have emerged these are the focus of this section in general the velocity field in steady divergence free flows often satisfies the stationary assumption however particle transport through both fractured and porous media has been found to be quite sensitive to the initial lagrangian velocity distribution kang et al 2017b morales et al 2017 therefore a ctrw framework must properly account for the spatial evolution of the initial lagrangian velocity to this end random walks through velocity space have emerged to characterize the lagrangian velocity evolution through disordered media while still invoking a spatial markov process dentz et al dentz et al 2016 studied the evolution of lagrangian velocity statistics and developed a markov chain ctrw that accounts for such evolution with a stochastic relaxation process to do so the authors established a relationship between the lagrangian and eulerian velocity fields showing that any lagrangian velocity distribution evolves to the flux weighted eulerian distribution for ergodic systems here we highlight some key arguments of dentz et al that lay the framework for velocity space random walks in the absence of diffusion particle trajectories through a heterogeneous steady velocity field u x is described with the advection equation 27 d x t a dt v t a here v t a is the lagrangian velocity and a x t 0 a is the particle location at initial time similarly particle motion can be described along particle trajectories s and in time 28 ds t a dt v t t a dt s a ds 1 v s s a v t t a and v s s a represent t ime lagrangian and s pace lagrangian velocity distributions respectively which represent velocities obtained by uniform sampling in time or space as discussed in the previous sections the smm framework is based on the approximation of v s s a consider the absolute eulerian velocities v e x u x within the domain volume v then the eulerian pdf is defined through spatial sampling as 29 p e v lim v 1 v ω dxδ v v e x with these definitions and under certain assumptions it is possible to link the eulerian and lagragian velocity field distributions by assuming ergodicity of both eulerian and lagrangian velocities sampling lagrangian velocities along one particle trajectory is equivalent to sampling velocities for many particles sampling particle trajectories can be done over fixed temporal or spatial increments to find the t ime lagrangian and s pace lagrangian velocity distributions 30 p t v a lim t 1 t 0 t dt δ v v t t a 31 p s v a lim l 1 l 0 l ds δ v v s s a here t l are a sampling time and length respectively the lagrangian ergodic assumption requires that the particle t velocity distribution is spatially independent and equivalent to the ensemble average over all particles additionally the incompressibility of the flow field and volume conservation requires that the t sampled and eulerian velocity distributions are equivalent p t v p e v through a variable change of s and t dentz et al dentz et al 2016 shows the s lagrangian velocity distribution is linked with the t velocity distribution and thus also the eulerian velocity distribution by flux weighting 32 p s v vp e v v e relating the eulerian and lagrangian velocity distributions is important as it lays the foundation for random walks through velocity space eq 32 indicates that in asymptotic conditions i e distances the s lagrangian velocities converge to flux weighted velocity distributions it also implies that when the initial lagrangian velocity distribution does not coincide with the steady state velocity distribution the lagrangian velocity distribution evolves along streamlines towards this asymptotic limit i e under ergodic assumptions any lagrangian velocity distribution evolves to the flux weighted eulerian distribution given that sampling temporal spatial scales can sufficiently represent all fluctuations in the global flow field as previously emphasized flow properties in the subsurface are often strongly correlated in space because of the inherent correlation structure of porous and fractured media for example gotovac et al 2009 quantifies the correlation length of the inverse of v s also termed as slowness these results show that the integral scale of s lagrangian velocity can be related to the one of the underlying hydraulic conductivity fields for velocity distributions resulting from multi gaussian conductivity fields the integral scale of 1 v s decreases with increasing heterogeneity for σ y 2 6 the slowness integral scale converges to 4 3 of the hydraulic conductivity one these results show that it is possible to define an inherent correlation length to model transport velocity through a markov chain in other words it is reasonable to define a characteristic correlation length scale l c for which velocities persist given l c the characteristic time of particle velocity persistence is l c v t this implies that small velocities will persist for longer times than fast velocities and is consistent with the earlier discussion on intermittent behavior relatively long temporal durations of slow velocities are mixed with sudden abrupt and short lived high velocities periods the characteristic length scale l c naturally informs implementation of random walk models a correlated random walk model will only be useful when model spatial jump lengths are smaller than l c δs l c lag distance δs needs to be large enough to capture correlation properties but sufficiently small such that successive models steps remain correlated the equations describing particle motion in velocity space are as follows 33 s n 1 s n δ s t s n 1 t s n δ s v s s n here δs is a spatial increment along a particle pathline multiple frameworks have emerged for random walks in velocity space that model the evolution of velocity along a particle trajectory following the above framework to this end two methodologies were extensively applied by dentz and co workers and are discussed here i e an orstein uhlenbeck process and a bernoulli ctrw framework 4 1 ornstein uhlenbeck process the ornstein uhlenbeck framework is a classical formalism to express transport through a markov process and has been applied throughout the physics literature for about a century uhlenbeck and ornstein 1930 the reasons for the success of this approach have been extensively reported in the literature e g gillespie 1996 van kampen 1992 in the context of our discussion a relevant feature of the ou framework is that it naturally describes relaxation to an asymptotic state through a markov chain and that it incorporates fluctuations around a stable state through linearization the ou framework therefore provides an ideal candidate to ground the parameterization of the s lagrangian velocities through a smm morales et al morales et al 2017 experimentally traced flow particles in a transparent three dimensional porous medium using particle tracking velocimetry ptv methods which allowed them to quantify correlation and velocity evolution the particle velocity distribution evolved from an initial to steady state distribution which were accurately approximated with a lognormal distribution a benefit of a lognormal distribution is that the log velocity steady state distribution w s s ln v s s is gaussian the evolution of a particle s log velocity can be then modeled as an ornstein uhlenbeck process such that 34 w n 1 w n δ s l c w n m s 2 σ s 2 δ s l c η n t n 1 t n δ s exp w n where m and σ are related to the mean and variance of the velocity distribution and η is a random number drawn from a standard gaussian the gaussian variable simulates subpore scale fluctuations of the velocity magnitude in the presence of general i e non lognormal and non gaussian velocity distributions the scores w s can be defined through a transformation 35 w s φ 1 p s v s s where φ w and p s v represent unit gaussian and v s cumulative distribution functions respectively after approximating the ou process through kelly et al 2017 the velocity is obtained as v s s p s 1 φ w s the velocity is persistent over δs i e w s s decays exponentially exp s l c and δs satisfies the δs l c constraint note through ptv all model input parameters in kelly et al 2017 can be measured experimentally morales et al morales et al 2017 demonstrated that this ornstein uhlenbeck spatial markov framework captured intermittent behavior and the velocity distributions at all time scales as observed in their laboratory ptv experiments the ou smm simulated isochronal particle trajectories faithfully reproduced the magnitude and duration of high velocity events as measured by the ptv t lagrangian particles velocities meaning that the velocity distribution and intermittent behavior is captured at all time scales puyguiraud et al puyguiraud et al 2019a puyguiraud et al 2019b demonstrated that the ornstein uhlenbeck smm correctly predicts the evolution of the s lagrangian distribution in pore scale numerical simulations of transport through a berea sandstone sample over a range of time scales this ou approach enables the evolution of non stationary velocity statistics and intermittent behavior to be faithfully modeled which in turn means that pre asymptotic behavior is well represented ou smm approaches therefore have exciting potential applications in many environmental flows where lagrangian velocity statistics display intermittent behavior and non stationarity over a range of scales a benefit of this framework is that it is parameterized with only the global lagrangian velocity distribution which is related to the eulerian velocity distribution and a characteristic length scale which puyguiraud et al 2019a found is the same order of magnitude as the characteristic pore scale hence the model does not require extensive lagrangian data for parameterization which has been a limitation of most commonly used smm frameworks 4 2 bernoulli ctrw assuming that velocity transitions via a bernoulli process is another method to capture intermittent behavior and model the evolution of velocity statistics along particle streamlines dentz et al 2016 holzner et al 2015 massoudieh et al 2017 hyman et al 2019c puyguiraud et al 2019a puyguiraud et al 2019b in a bernoulli framework particles transition through time and space according to eq 33 velocity correlation is captured by assuming velocity follows a bernoulli process i e particle velocity persists from the last model step with probability p and samples a new velocity otherwise with probability 1 p hence particle trajectories are still conceptualized as a spatial markov process dentz et al dentz et al 2016 first proposed a bernoulli framework where the s lagrangian velocity series is modeled as 36 v s s δ s 1 ξ s v s ξ s ν s where ξ is a bernoulli variable that returns 1 with p and ν s are identically independently distributed velocities that sample from the steady s lagrangian velocity distribution the value of p can be estimated by assuming that velocity transitions at a constant spatial rate inversely proportional to the correlation length l c dentz et al 2016 massoudieh et al 2017 hyman et al 2019c such that p exp δs l c note that the bernoulli ctrw is very similar to the idealized diagonal transition matrix by kang et al kang et al 2015a kang et al 2016 except in their framework sampling from a bin allows particle velocity to fluctuate somewhat even when the bernoulli variable favors a persistent velocity the benefit of the bernoulli ctrw framework is that velocity correlation is parameterized with a correlation velocity scale determined by l c and therefore an entire transition matrix is not required a simple way to estimate l c is to find the distance where particle velocity anti correlates as determined by a velocity correlation function the bernoulli ctrw has been successfully applied in both three dimensional and two dimensional fracture networks hyman et al 2019c kang et al 2019 in fracture networks particle velocity is highly correlated on the fracture scale and then may rapidly transition at a fracture intersection hence the characteristic length scale is on the same order of magnitude as the mean fracture length such a bernoulli ctrw framework has been applied to accurately reproduce breakthrough curves generated from 3d numerical simulations of stochastically generated networks whose fracture radii followed a power law distribution hyman et al 2019c and 2d geologically mapped fracture networks under different stress conditions kang et al 2019 in these studies an additional tortuosity parameter was introduced to account for the fact that the multi dimensional network structure allows for particle motion in transverse directions and so the advective distance a particle travels is greater than the linear distance in the primary flow direction this added distance delays downstream solute breakthrough meaning the travel time between model steps in eq 33 must be modified via a tortuosity parameter χ s 37 x n 1 x n δ x t x n 1 t x n χ s δ x v s here particle velocity transitions along streamlines but traverses only in x space the direction of primary flow because longitudinal spreading is of primary interest χ s is an effective tortuosity parameter that corrects particle travel distances accounting for transverse excursions and thereby delays effective transport in these studies χ s is calculated as the mean particle pathline distance divided by the total linear distance in the primary flow direction note that other definitions of tortuosity such as the ratio of the mean velocity norm over the mean velocity in the mean flow direction are also commonly used koponen et al 1996 ghanbarian et al 2013 and for volumes that are large enough equivalent to this definition hyman et al hyman et al 2019c demonstrated the bernoulli ctrw model accurately captures breakthrough curve tailing behavior for networks whose fracture radii are sampled from power law distributions with varying power law slopes and showed that model accuracy improves when initializing the particle velocities with the inlet velocity distribution kang et al uncovered that under specific stress conditions the correlation length scale is correlated with velocity and proposed a dual correlation length bernoulli ctrw i e p is dependent on velocity the authors applied this dual correlation length bernoulli to predict breakthrough curves in complex 2d networks these findings agree with a study by puyguiraud et al 2019a who found that the convergence rate for velocity evolution in numerical simulated berea sandstone is velocity dependent note that in heterogeneous fractured media a transition matrix may be spatially dependent due to the heterogeneity of the network structure at the scales of interests meaning using the traditional smm parameterized from two initial cells may impose false correlation structures on transport behavior the bernoulli ctrw framework simply assumes that velocities transition over a characteristic length related to fracture radii which relaxes the correlation structure and therefore is more suitable in this context bernoulli ctrws have also been applied to model transport through porous media puyguiraud et al 2019a carrel et al 2018 carrel et al carrel et al 2018 applied a bernoulli ctrw to model transport processes through a porous media with varying degrees of biofilm growth to do so nafion pellets were added to a bacterial inoculum which were packed in a saturated flow cell to create a porous medium the medium was saturated with glucose aqueous solution thereby promoting biofilm growth in the flow cell fluoresecent tracer particles were seeded in the flow and tracked through time with particle tracking velocimetry ptv enabling t lagrangian velocity distributions to be quantified for different periods of biofilm growth particle trajectories displayed intermittent behavior and larger biofilm growth resulted in fewer channels in the flow structure and increased average longitudinal velocity because porosity progressively decreased with increased growth the lagrangian trajectories enabled velocity correlations to be quantified which was shown to increase with increased biofilm growth transport through each biofilm snapshot was modeled with a bernoulli ctrw where velocities moved along streamlines and p exp δs 2λ where exponential decorrelation occurs over twice the correlation length and the correlation length is found as the integral of a correlation function note that the characteristic length scale is similar to that found in puyguiraud et al 2019a which was 2 5 times the average pore length bernoulli ctrw predictions for mean and centered mean squared displacements msd are in good agreements with ptv measurements and the msd exponent increased with biofilm growth suggesting increasing biofilm growth causes an increase in anomalous transport which is consistent with observations in other settings also e g stream beds 4 again the study demonstrates the exciting potential of a bernoulli ctrw framework as it faithfully captures anomalous transport at the pore scale without requiring as extensive a parameterization process as measurement of a full transition matrix 5 mixing and reactions the primary goal of most of the cases presented so far has been to describe or predict the mean transport behavior as a 1 d upscaled approximation the simplification to 1 d is practical in the context of subsurface hydrogeological systems because the inaccessibility of the subsurface introduces significant uncertainty in the 3 d architecture making precise simulations impossible but also because observations are not abundant consider that the most reliable data about subsurface conditions comes from boreholes which are vertically averaged samples at fixed points it is possible to simulate and verify an upscaled model at these points but there are many relevant applications where knowledge of a concentration field or its variance about the mean are necessary instead of time series of concentration at a point for example mixing and chemical reactions depend on local concentrations and concentration gradients e g dentz et al 2011 valocchi et al 2020 meaning that an average concentration is not sufficient to make an accurate prediction in order to be useful for such problems the smm would need to be able to represent concentration fluctuations in an effective manner this section describes some recent work much of it still in early developmental stages that has begun to explore how to do so efficiently 5 1 studies in periodic domains describing mixing in a lagrangian sense generally means estimating specific particle positions over time instead of estimating total travel times sund et al sund et al 2017a who proposed the trajectory based smm in periodic domains suggested that one could make an educated guess as to a particle s specific location if some additional information was stored on each trajectory the goal is to provide a method for downscaling that enables a more complete representation of the spatially variable concentration field and its fluctuations enabling the calculation of mixing measures the approach used by sund et al 2017a was to store a discrete form of each trajectory s i for each trajectory the discretized counterpart can be defined as 38 p s i χ 1 χ 2 χ n η 1 η 2 η n where the pairs χ η ω identify locations along trajectory s i at travel time ω n τ s i with ω 1 n and n is the number of intervals that build the trajectory see fig 15a where blue dots show the locations χ i η i along a single trajectory the collection of points that defined each trajectory were then used to downscale the smm model by linearly interpolating the particle positions between those stored in p s i providing a spatially explicit description of particle positions at all times the model was developed and tested in a simple periodic pore scale setting the authors compared measurements from direct numerical simulations and their modified smm to evaluate predictions of two nonlinear global measures of mixing generally considered to be necessary for the accurate upscaling of mixing driven chemical reactions these are the dilution index or entropy e t and integral of squared concentration m t respectively defined as 39 e t exp ω p x t log p x t d ω m t ω p 2 x t d ω the dns results and the modified smm were compared at two different péclet numbers pe 100 and 1000 using the downscaling procedure exemplified in fig 15 the agreement between the two was excellent over all times considered suggesting that this procedure can effectively model mixing and dilution processes at least in a global sense thereby providing a significant expansion of the simulation capabilities of the smm the rates of many thermodynamically favorable reactions in porous media are limited by mixing rates in porous media this implies that one can use simplified reactions to study mixing instead of the complex multi component geochemical systems in natural systems one of the most commonly studied simplified models is the irreversible bi molecular mixing driven reaction given by a b c where the letters denote generic chemical components sund et al 2017b adopted this reaction in a periodic domain made up of packed cylinders and proposed a scheme with lagrangian transport and eulerian reaction rates stemming from volume averaging their proposed model takes advantage of the fact that the smm can be used to provide accurate predictions of transport but existing eulerian approximations can be used for mixing limited reactions since they do not require the computationally costly calculations of particle particle interactions e g paster et al 2014 bolster et al 2016 benson and bolster 2016 the approach was shown to be effective for representing subscale fluctuations in concentration fields and as such it was also able to accurately predict the amount of product c that is produced note that the downscaling approaches in sund et al 2017a and sund et al 2017b have some slight differences but conceptually they are very similar and interested readers are referred to those papers for more details another family of reactions that are very important in the context of geologic media are surface reactions which are any reactions that involve mobile phases which directly interact with the liquid solid surface within a porous medium examples include sorption and desorption processes where a solute can be temporarily or permanently trapped relative to the flowing fluid or biological reactions where bio organisms living on the surface consume nutrients in the water removing them permanently from the flow among many others under the assumption of dilute conditions these reactions can be modeled using linear approximations so they are amenable to the smm framework without the need for downscaling sund et al sund et al 2015b considered the same periodic pore system as in fig 9 but included a hypothetical biofilm layer that particles could diffuse into where particles were consumed according to a first order rate law while in the biofilm layer this study showed that the main effect of biofilm reactions was to truncate the late times in travel time distributions as these are the ones that spend most time in the biofilm and thus are most likely to react the travel time distribution for this system was split into two parts one that accounted for particles that survive and another that represented a state of limbo equivalent to an infinite residence time the results again showed that accounting for correlations was critical to ensure that fast particles persist at being fast and thus are also more likely to stay alive while slower particles are more likely to become stuck in limbo one difference that they found relative to the conservative transport case is that accounting for correlation effects remained somewhat important even at pe 100 meaning that the sensitivity to correlation effects changes when reactions are involved sherman et al sherman et al 2019 came to a similar conclusion when studying sorption desorption reactions in a similar system in this case particles that hit the liquid solid boundary have a finite probability of being trapped depending on a first order adsorption rate and being trapped for a finite amount of time depending on a desorption rate following the trajectory approach developed by sund et al 2017a the number of times a given trajectory strikes the liquid solid boundary was added as an additional piece of information in the model and combined with the approach proposed by boccardo et al 2018 to link reaction probabilities with sorption rates accounting for the number of impacts proved to be sufficient to transform a simulation of conservative transport into one with probabilistic adsorption desorption the main difference is that the latter adds delays to the conservative transition times based on the rates of adsorption desorption and the number of times a trajectory strikes the liquid solid boundary where the reactive process is taking place later sherman et al 2020b applied the model to a more complex non periodic porous medium 6 discussion so far this paper has reviewed and summarized the spatial markov model over the first decade since its introduction to the porous media community by le borgne et al le borgne et al 2008a the model aims to represent effective upscaled transport in complex porous media from pore to geologic scales by building on previous modeling studies that demonstrated the importance of accounting for correlation effects while the smm has already shown great promise and evolved immensely in that time it is still a work in progress and we are excited to see where the next steps will take us in this final discussion we highlight some of the primary challenges and limitations of smms in their current forms as well as propose our personal views on pathways forward 6 1 challenges and limitations applications to real systems and real data two examples were highlighted where the smm was applied to two sets of real data a field based study kang et al 2015a and a laboratory study sherman et al 2018 the experiments of sherman et al 2018 were in an idealized setting a 1 d column but even in such a controlled environment additional steps were still needed to optimize the fit of the smm model to the data the example of kang et al 2015a used a site with an uncommon level of characterization developed over years of meticulous data collection and the transport experiments were designed using this knowledge while the models could have fit the data well without this characterization interpretation of the results and success were significantly aided by it while theoretical studies are advancing fast towards predictive approaches there is still an important gap between the information required to constrain the model parameters and what is typically available in field scale scenarios recent efforts based on velocity ctrw puyguiraud et al 2019a require knowledge of the eulerian velocity pdf of the system to predict transport this information would rarely be available in a real field setting the vast majority of smm applications have relied on high resolution numerical simulations most of which are a far cry from typical field conditions so there is a clear need for studies designed around the practical limitations of real systems this includes testing the smm in settings with limited characterization incomplete sampling of tracers and developing new approaches to parameterization that can provide accurate results without requiring abundant information these approaches will have to encompass uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of the flow model parameterization on transport dynamics extending current studies janetti et al 2019 stationarity across scales a defining feature of the smm compared to previous popular models for anomalous transport in porous media is that the smm relaxes the reliance on independent identically distributed random variables the justification for this is that it is necessary in order to capture correlation effects but all the smm applications to date have contained an embedded assumption of incremental stationarity for the correlations this assumes that the same transition matrix is valid along the entire smm path but this assumption is not consistent with the complex hierarchical structure of porous media however it may be possible to define transition matrices in a zonal fashion in order to capture the changes in correlations along the smm path doing so confidently would likely require abundant characterization but some geostatistical techniques are able to incorporate conceptual data and incorporating those advances into the smm could help relax the requirement of strict stationarity a related subtle point is that many of the numerical studies described herein used multi gaussian random fields with fixed length scales for their heterogeneity structures and the models worked well because the assumption of stationarity was valid the issue is that the evolving length scales of heterogeneity in natural geologic systems are non stationary studies are needed that use realistic multi scale heterogeneity fields to investigate when the stationarity assumption is valid when it breaks down and how to account for systematic changes as new features in the hierarchy are sampled a recent example attempting to do this is engdahl and bolster 2020 who use the smm to study transport in a variably saturated watershed including overland vadose zone and saturated flow domains defining unique transition matrices for different parts of the flow domain while this preliminary study shows some promise much work is needed here generalization to nonlinear processes the smm is generally designed to represent the mean effective behavior in the evolution of a concentration field and its simplest forms assume that transport processes are linear however many processes in porous media particularly chemical reactions which are ubiquitous in geologic systems are highly nonlinear and so simply predicting mean behavior is not sufficient and some knowledge of fluctuations below the support scale is required additionally many forms of calculating reactions require calculation of concentrations in fixed volumes naturally necessitating an eulerian interpretation with which the smm must be compatible some efforts have been made along these lines e g the trajectory based methods in periodic domains sund et al 2017a sund et al 2017b but generalizing these approaches to more realistic complex settings still remains to be done the training trajectories approach proposed in most et al 2019 shows promise in this regard however it has currently only been applied in a relatively simple setting and validated at a scale o mm well below typical scales of interest o m km enhancing predictive power perhaps one of the biggest criticisms of transport models in porous media in general is that in order to parameterize the models one typically has to run a transport experiment at the same scale that is to predict transport one must first measure it it would be desirable to establish procedures leading to reliable predictions relying only on prior information available about the geologic system e g distribution of permeabilities in space or at most about the flow e g approximate velocity distribution in space and from that information alone predict transport with reasonable uncertainty this would truly take anomalous transport models to the next level in terms of actually helping solve practical engineering problems in the subsurface environment but in order to get there the smm needs to be studied in more diverse settings and the role of uncertainty and sensitivity on its predictions needs to be considered 6 2 vision for next steps while we report here the historical progress of the smm we are also excited to see where it will go over the next decade here we put forward a few of our own personal visions and hopes to try and stimulate future debates engagement and efforts data driven approaches the complexity of real geologic systems is such that uncertainties can be tremendous and these can even be difficult to quantify in 3 d models because of excessive parameters and runtimes using analytical or purely theoretical approaches to approximate real systems is an attractive solution but is not necessarily feasible because of their excessive simplicity this suggests that finding a parsimonious balance between complex models theories and efficient numerical approaches for data assimilation and model parameterization under uncertainty might be an excellent way forward which could build from recent advances in machine and deep learning as well as other model reduction approaches like polynomial chaos or gaussian emulation rajabi 2019 fajraoui et al 2011 generally these are purely numerical approaches unconstrained by physics and this can justifiably make users uneasy about actual predictability or extrapolation of information beyond training data sets however coupling such methods and constraining them with models based on physical processes such as the smm is an exciting pathway forward to leverage the best of both worlds this is a place where the simplicity of the smm is particularly advantageous because it allows one to capture the variability of a complex transport processes using a less complicated model reduced complexity numerical approaches could be used to capture the time dependent nature of model parameters e g due to flow variability or their spatial variability due to the heterogeneity of the subsurface smart tracers most applications of the smm to date have relied on detailed information that can realistically only be measured in high resolution numerical simulations e g direct measurement of correlation by tracking successive travel times of individual particles such methods are not typically possible with current day experimental approaches however the advent and continued emergence of novel tracers e g individual particles tagged with unique dna markers dahlke et al 2015 mcnew et al 2018 makes us believe that some day it might actually be possible to obtain such information in real experiments while none of the authors of this article are experimentalists we find the idea of such smart tracers very exciting more seamlessly blending geostatistics with smms as noted above a major barrier is that most state of the art models require one to run a transport experiment to infer model parameters alternative data sources are needed to break this cycle but the inaccessibility and uncertainty of the subsurface makes it a challenge one source that is largely overlooked is conceptual geological data which is typically known with high confidence we suggest that blending categorical geostatistics using for example transition probability approaches carle and fogg 1996 weissmann et al 1999 engdahl and weissmann 2010 with smms is a natural pairing because both focus on delineating major transitions changes in geology are strong controls on changes in velocity fields so there is good reason to expect positive correlation between them such a model could be based entirely on commonly available field observables like water levels borehole tests well logs and outcrop analogs to inform process parameterization in the smm which would also provide better connections to data as suggested above for instance in the context of heterogeneous conductivity fields characterization bianchi and pedretti 2017 bianchi and pedretti 2018 proposed the link between anomalous transport characteristics and an emerging disorder indicator termed geological entropy future works may be directed towards linking such indicators with smm model parameters extension to transient flows almost all applications of the smm to porous media flows to date have been under the condition of steady flow conditions with one notable exception of sund et al 2015a who considered turbulent flow real hydrogeologic systems are rarely if ever under true steady state flow conditions as they are continuously forced by intermittent rain events and other elements of the hydrologic cycle but also by anthropogenic factors like pumping extending the smm to naturally account for temporal variability would require a model framework that relaxes strict stationarity in time but considering the linear nature of flow and transport in low reynolds number settings it is reasonable to expect that one could do so in a systematic manner that is physically motivated and theoretically based one approach could be to use stationary velocity ranked transition matrices then scale the velocities up or down as the smm evolves to account for the impacts of any changes in forcing this could be as simple as shifting the mean but in some cases models for the evolution of transition matrices over time might also be needed generalizing training trajectories the training trajectory work of most et al 2019 is one of the most exciting for us because it is one of the first smms that truly attempts to build a model that can predict three dimensional concentration fields within a still parsimonious framework trajectory matching might also be a way of using a combination of synthetic models and data to improve field scale predictions however its current limitation is size to date the trajectory based approach has only been applied in the context of relatively simple sandstone at very small scales trajectory reconstructions are needed for more complex porous media but also at different spatial scales this could lead to a robust approach for upscaling predictive purposes where training of the models performed at one scale sample could be used to model transport in a different and or larger sample this would help develop practical tools for simulating 3 d transport but these will need to be verified against detailed simulations and multi scale physical experiments to develop confidence formally connecting lagrangian and eulerian view points for most anomalous transport models that have been used in hydrogeologic systems one can write clear eulerian and lagrangian descriptions of the system e g berkowitz et al 2006 benson and meerschaert 2009 typically the lagrangian picture is written in terms of a discrete equation such as those presented in this paper and the eulerian one as integro differential equation with nonlocal in space and or time terms for the smm while some efforts have been made this is not entirely the case indeed we the authors believe that the success of the smm in periodic systems suggests that one should be able to formally link the lagrangian framework as we have described it here to the eulerian framework that evolves from formal upscaling approaches such as volume averaging where nonlocal in space and time equations can emerge e g wood and valdes parada 2013 davit et al 2012 porta et al 2016 approaches discussed above sund et al 2017a sund et al 2017b have shown that numerical closures can be implemented to relate the smm formulation to subscale features establishing a formal link between eulerian and lagrangian closures would unlock the possibility to merge the two approaches which could be beneficial e g to predict reactive transport processes relying on measurable eulerian characteristics connecting state of the art mixing and spreading models as noted in the previous subsection the smm as described here is most conducive to describing one dimensional effective transport or predicting mean projected behavior another way of expressing this is to say that they do a good job of capturing spreading i e replicating nonlinear scaling of the second centered moment nonlinear processes such as chemical reactions will require further additions to the smm some exciting developments have taken place in recent years using the concept of lamellae to describe mixing and reactions in complex heterogeneous systems ranging from pore to darcy scales e g le borgne et al 2013 de anna et al 2014 elaborating extensively on these would require an entirely new review article but a large element of these theories relies on balances between mixing and spreading le borgne et al 2011b it would be exciting to see the smm and such approaches coupled together more formally to improve our ability to use the smm to predict nonlinear processes also multiphase systems multiple fluid phases typically coexist in the subsurface examples of common interest of multiphase systems and settings include i the unsaturated zone between the earth s surface and the saturated aquifer where air and water both occupy the void space ii geologic carbon sequestration where supercritical co2 is injected into saline aquifers for permanent storage so that it cannot access the atmosphere iii conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction multiphase flows in porous media can be highly complex leading to even stronger anomalous transport than typically observed recent experiments by jiménez martinez et al 2015 jiménez martinez et al 2017 highlight these very clearly another numerical study by triadis et al 2019 highlights that pre asymptotic anomalous transport at pore scales in a multiphase system can persist for much longer than one would anticipate in a single phase flow while such observations have been made applications of the smm to such systems has been limited formally connecting the single phase and multiphase system behaviors within a unified framework with the smm perhaps using auto and cross transition matrices between the phases would provide an ability to make more general predictions in real systems of interest incorporation of further microscale processes from digital rock and soil samples one of the great advances in porous media over the last decade has been our ability to visualize and measure the full range of complexity at the smallest of scales using innovative technologies able to reconstruct the spatial structure of rock and soil 3d samples and or and 2d sections using micro computed tomography nuclear magnetic resonance raman spectroscopy etc to date these techniques have been used to model the structure of porous media or the resulting velocity fields and then impose transport however rich data relating to microporosity mineral composition heterogeneous reactivity organic matter biofilm distributions imaged phase distributions and so on also exist and all may play a role on how contaminants move and react in real porous media being able to incorporate such information in an effective model such as the smm could be a way to reduce the uncertainty that currently plagues numerical modeling of biogeochemical processes in soils e g biodegradation of emerging contaminants and agrochemicals greskowiak et al 2017 porta et al 2018 new paradigms are needed to incorporate micro scale information into emerging properties with the aim of constraining predictions as extensively discussed in a recent review baveye et al 2018 the smm framework has the potential to overcome the limitation of currently employed approaches by providing a flexible tool to upscale multi scale measurements and characterization going beyond just physical heterogeneity but embracing the full range of biogeochemical heterogeneity that is ubiquitous in real systems and that can often play an even more important role than previously thought although there are still many obstacles that currently prevent these visions from being realized today the authors remain optimistic and excited to see the progression of the smm in the coming years in just over a decade from conception significant advances have occurred in smm research we expect nothing less than continued growth through the foreseeable future as field based and computing technologies advance at unprecedented rates such technological advancement will expand applications to larger scale geologic systems and other natural flows while also assisting the scientific community in solving some of the most challenging global problems including improved methods for energy extraction and mitigating climatic effects induced by anthropogenic emissions such advances will also pave the way for new and different models that can hopefully build on the advances presented here in this review we have detailed the progression of the smm and its many successes while also identifying limitations that must be overcome in order to bring the smm or its successors to new frontiers

possible use as a building material further toxicity analysis of leachate from the solidified rha was also studied for probable leaching of ofl the effects of adsorption parameters such as initial ph the dosage of rha m initial ofl concentration c 0 and contact time t on the responses ofl removal x1 and adsorption capacity mg g x2 were evaluated using the central composite design ccd based on

have been broadly used to treat the many bacterial infectious diseases in humans and animals the primary role of these antibiotics is to abate the dna replication in bacteria by hampering the usual activity of dna topoisomerase lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 an enormous quantity of antibiotics are being used and regularly discharged into the atmosphere from pharmaceutical industries hospitals domestic wastewater and excretion from living beings el ghenymy et al 2013 during the rainy season these antibiotics could be leached out and thus contaminate the groundwater the major health risk due to the antibiotics available in the environment has attracted the interest of the scientific community out of all the antibiotics the fluoroquinolones class of antibiotics has been observed everywhere in wastewater surface soil and sediments due to its extensive use and the fact that it is not easily degradable zaidi et al 2016 ofloxacin ofl a fluoroquinolone fq antibiotic finds its application against gram positive and gram negative bacteria ofl is suggested to the patients with urinary tract infections respiratory tract infections prostatitis and skin infection the concentration of ofl in treated effluents was found in the range of 0 005 31 7 μg l in different countries the excessive use of this antibiotic causes side effects like tendon damage peripheral neuropathy and in serious cases it can result in lifetime disabilities vasquez et al 2013 due to the non biodegradable nature of ofl conventional treatment techniques can eliminate only a small fraction of it remaining runs off to surface water paul et al 2010 fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been detected in different concentration ranges in hospital sewage 60 120 000 ng l in surface waters 5 1300 ng l and in wastewater treatment plant effluents 2 580 ng l all over the world wammer et al 2013 about 20 90 of fluoroquinolones ingested are released in their pharmacologically active forms foremost to considerable loads being discharged into domestic wastewater li et al 2013 currently many treatment methods like adsorption hao et al 2012 chemical oxidation mehrjouei et al 2014 photocatalytic and photolytic treatment li et al 2012 electro oxidation kaur et al 2018 kaur et al 2019 and biodegradation vasquez et al 2013 are usually adapted for the elimination of toxic antibiotics from the aquatic system out of these available methods adsorption is an efficient and favorable technique as it offers great effectiveness little expenditure and simple operation ahmed et al 2015 adsorption is one of the broadly utilized techniques for toxin elimination from the polluted system many materials are being used as sorbents which include activated carbon polymeric adsorbents molecular sieves and some other low cost materials worldwide a huge amount of agricultural solid waste generates every year this waste piles up in the agro industrial yards and has no important industrial application and commercial value consequently it becomes a matter of concern and contributes to severe environmental problems thus the utilization of such low cost and abundantly available agricultural waste is most judicious for wastewater treatment soltani et al 2017 the potential of several affluently available adsorbents such as rice husk barley straw almond shell poplar walnut sawdust orange peel sugarcane bagasse and coconut burch waste have been studied previously hameed et al 2008 however the use of agricultural waste as adsorbent is associated with few drawbacks like low sorption capacity poor physical stability partial solubility need of modification by physical or chemical methods and variation in adsorption capacities by the structure of the components inherent in it omo okoro et al 2018 among various biomass or agricultural waste materials rice husk ash is the most valuable material due to its noble physical and chemical characteristics bahrami et al 2018 soltani et al 2020 the natural agricultural waste rice husk is a form of biomass that is not only a source of energy but also has several applications in various fields such as cement industry pharmaceutical industry rubber industry etc it is estimated that on a global scale 500 million tons of rice is harvested annually rice grain contains 20 husk which is converted into ash after combustion and called rice husk ash rha the rha mainly contains si mg na ca k p fe and cu soltani et al 2015 since the major constituents of rha is silica more than 80 which is responsible for high specific surface area and high porosity so it has the great potential to be used as an effective adsorbent celekli and bozkurt 2013 due to this reason rha is used by various industries worldwide than other agricultural waste residues bahrami et al 2017 bahrami et al 2016 in the present work the adsorption capacity of rice husk ash rha for adsorption of ofl antibiotic was investigated from synthetic wastewater the ofl loaded exhausted rha was studied for its safer disposability by solidification stabilization with portland cement and its possible use as a building material further toxicity analysis of leachate from the solidified rha was also studied for probable leaching of ofl the effects of adsorption parameters such as initial ph the dosage of rha m contact time t and initial ofl concentration c 0 on the responses ofl removal x1 and adsorption capacity mg g x2 were studied using the central composite design ccd based on response surface method rsm at optimized parameters kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption process have been studied with the adsorption mechanism exploration for the representation of adsorption equilibrium data langmuir redlich peterson r p and temkin isotherm models were used 2 experimental 2 1 materials rha obtained from satyam agro solvex khanna punjab india was cleaned with hot water at 80 c the samples were dried at 70 c temperature overnight and sieved to a fraction with a particle size of 180 600 μm using is sieves is 437 1979 the adsorbate ofloxacin ofl with a chemical formula c18h20fn3o4 and a molecular weight of 361 37 g mol was provided by shri ramesth industries himachal pradesh india all other chemicals used for the study were of analytical reagent ar grade 2 2 rha characterization methods the characteristics of the rha structure was evaluated by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k within various relative pressure values asap 2010 micromeritics instrument and micromeritics software were used the specific surface area was evaluated by using brunaer emmett teller bet method and the barrett joyner halenda bjh method was used to calculate the mesopore distribution the total pore volume was computed by the t plot procedure the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of rha was also measured employing a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer bruker germany with cu kα radiation λ 1 541 å over the 2θ range of 10 80 the surface organic functional groups of the rha before and after adsorption were analyzed using a fourier transforms infrared ftir spectrophotometer nicolet 6700 spectrometer usa spectra were obtained between 4000 and 400 cm 1 ranges of at room temperature 2 3 design of experiments and optimization experiments for the ofl adsorption on rha were designed and performed by central composite design ccd based on response surface methodology rsm the rsm is a statistical tool that facilitates in designing of experiments with a reduced number of experiments analysis of the interaction between parameters on responses and optimization of the process parameters for required responses soo et al 2004 ph 2 10 adsorbent dosage 0 5 2 5 g 100 ml ofl concentration 10 90 mg l and time 10 750 min coded with five level ccd supplementary table s1 were considered as independent adsorption process variables while ofl removal x1 and ofl adsorption capacity x2 were selected as responses the following quadratic

precision studentized residuals plots normal probability plots coefficient of determination r2 predicted r2 and adjusted r2 and f and p values a multi response optimization tool was applied for the optimization of two responses x1 and x2 using the desirability function of rsm the multi response optimization tool in rsm optimizes the responses depending on the set target the target may be set as smaller the best stb larger the best ltb and nominal the best ntb kushwaha et al 2011 sangal et al 2013 whereas the desirability function converts the individual desirability d i 0 1 of the responses x1 and x2 into one single desirability value of the system in this study the ltb type target was set for the responses x1 ofl removal and x2 ofl adsorption capacity optimization 2 4 adsorption batch experiments and data analysis in the present study a total of 30 experiments in the batch mode were conducted as designed by ccd rsm table 1 and ofl removal x1 and ofl adsorption capacity x2 were measured for each set of experiments in 100 ml ofl solution of specified initial concentration and previously adjusted desired ph known dose of rha as per design matrix was added the mixture was then agitated at a constant speed of 150 rpm and 303 k temperature in a temperature controlled orbital shaker incubator remi elektronik ltd india cis 24 plus for initial ph adjustment 0 1 n h2so4 and 0 1 n naoh solutions were used the maximum absorption of ofl was found at λmax 288 nm at this λmax value calibration curve was prepared by making ofl solution of different known concentrations for each set of experiments after the equilibrium predetermined time of adsorption process the mixture was drawn and adsorbent was separated by filtration further the absorbance of filtrate was observed at λmax 288 nm using uv visible spectrophotometer electronic corporation india ltd and equilibrium residual ofl concentration was evaluated from calibration curve ofl removal x1 and adsorption capacity x2 of rha was then calculated using the following relation 2 ofl removal x 1 c 0 c f c 0 100 furthermore the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e mg g was calculated as 3 absorption capacity q e x 2 c 0 c e m v where co cf and ce represent the initial final and equilibrium ofl concentrations mg l in the aqueous phase respectively v represents the volume l of the adsorbate solution and m g l to the mass of adsorbent 2 5 solidification stabilization s s studies of exhausted rha the appropriate management of exhausted adsorbent waste is essential to avoid the release of antibiotics in ecosystems and its adverse impacts on the human being for this purpose the solidification stabilization s s technique was adopted due to its well known advantages kogbara et al 2013 loaded adsorbent having different ofl concentrations and portland cement were mixed in different mass ratios supplementary table s2 to observe the effect of binder on the leachability behavior of ofl for this purpose loaded adsorbent and cement were mixed using the required amount of water to make the paste the beads of approximately 2 cm diameter were made and incubated at room temperature for 24 h the incubated beads were then soaked in 100 ml distilled water for 15 days maintaining water level throughout the experimentation after 15 days the concentration of ofl in water was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer to observe the leachability of ofl the capsulation percentage of ofl was calculated using the following relation 4 capsulation percentage c a c l c a 100 where c a and c l represent the ofl concentrations mg l in adsorbent and leachate respectively 2 5 1 bacterial toxicity test after solidification the toxicity of leachate samples was also determined by bacterial toxicity analysis using the agar cup method tambe et al 2001 two bacterial strains e coli and bacillus subtilis culture procured from the department of biotechnology thapar institute of engineering technology patiala was revived in nutrient broth mueller and hinton agar mha was sterilized and 25 ml media was poured in petri plates the 24 h old culture of e coli and bacillus subtilis was spread on agar plates further four to five holes were made in each plate with the help of a cork borer 0 25 μl of each leachate sample from various experiments were added in each hole plates were then incubated at 35 0 1 c for 24 h and observed the zone of inhibition through bacterial growth similarly toxicity analysis of ofl solutions of different concentrations 0 1 10 ppm was also studied for comparison purposes with leachate toxicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the brunauere emmette teller bet surface area and barrette joynere hanlenda bjh adsorption desorption surface area of rha was found to be 32 6 and 10 96 m2 g respectively the average bet pore diameter was found 6 5 nm indicating that rha is mesoporous and appropriate adsorbent for the adsorption of ofl having a high molecular weight bahrami et al 2016 the xrd spectra fig 1 of bare rha showed a single diffuse band centered at around 22 this indicates that the silica in the sample was in an amorphous state although weak peaks at 21 27 and 31 36 68 were identified as trydimite and cristobalite phases respectively azmi et al 2016 no change was observed in the xrd spectra of ofl loaded rha fig 1 ftir fourier transform infrared spectra provide the information of various existing functional groups ftir spectra of bared and ofl loaded rha are presented in fig 2 a broader peak between 3000 and 3700 cm 1 is attributed to the existence of free and hydrogen bonded oh group and si oh owing to adsorbed water on the surface srivastava et al 2006 abou mesalam 2003 a broader but not intensive the peak can be seen at 1636 cm 1 is due to the carbonyl groups stretching from aldehydes and ketones another broader and intense peak at 1092 cm 1 represents the si o si and c o h stretching and oh deformation however comparatively lower intense and narrow peaks at 795 and 469 cm 1 are attributed to the sih srivastava et al 2006 shifting in all the peaks can be seen in fig 2 due to the loading of ofl on rha which indicates that the functional groups present on the surface of rha are participating in the adsorption 3 2 model fitting and statistical analysis experiments advocated as per ccd table 2 were performed and responses x1 and x2 were determined experimental results with process parameters were then statistically analyzed using rsm design expert software version 6 06 stat ease inc minneapolis us sequential f test model summary statistics and subsequent anova table 3 analysis suggested a quadratic model fit the experimental data the adequate precision 35 509 and 34 373 for the responses x1 and x2 respectively revealed the capability and efficiency of the suggested quadratic model in analyzing variables and responses relation further other tools such as outlier residual plots studentized residuals plots and normal probability plots are not shown here well explained the efficiency of quadratic model fittings model f the value of 94 61 and 75 12 for responses x1 and x2 respectively table 3 supported the significance of the quadratic model further the coefficient of determination r2 predicted r2 and adjusted r2 showed a good correlation of actual and predicted responses table 4 values of prob f higher to 0 1 designate the parameters in the model insignificant the significant quadratic model terms from anova were observed as x1 ph m t ph2 m2 c2 t2 ph m ph c m c m t and x2 m c

values for the adsorptive removal of ofl antibiotic are shown in table 2 and the corresponding 3 d response surface graphs obtained from rsm is shown in fig 3 these plots were further analyzed for individual and interactive effects of the adsorption parameters on responses x1 and x2 fig 3a f shows the interaction of ph m g l t min and c mg l on the ofl removal x1 and capacity x2 respectively the simultaneous effects of ph and c on the responses ofl removal and capacity are shown in fig 3a and d respectively at constant m and t value at any ph the ofl removal was observed increasing sharply with the increase in c value up to more than 90 however at higher c ofl removal starts decreasing this indicates that the adsorption of ofl is limited by the adsorbate concentration and the rha possesses higher adsorption capacity whereas the capacity was always found increasing at all ph with increased c on the other hand there is no significant change in capacity with ph change at any c value fig 3d further to confirm the presence of silica and integrity of the rha in respect to the dissolution precipitation at high ph elemental analysis through edx was conducted for both the bare and loaded rha table 5 the elemental analysis showed the presence of same elements i e c o na mg si k and ca in the bare rha and loaded rha after adsorption the presence of si in loaded rha after adsorption with the nearly same weight explains the wholesomeness of the rha after adsorption the slight decrease in the si weight value may be due to the loading of ofloxacin on the rha which in turn increased the weight value of c fig 3b and e explains them and t interaction on the ofl removal and capacity respectively at lower m values an increase in adsorption time t increases the ofl removal which becomes nearly constant at higher t values however at higher m values ofl removal first increases with t and at higher t values it starts decreasing this behavior in ofl removal at higher t values may be due to the desorption of ofl from the rha at higher t values the capacity was found increasing with t at a lower value of m and capacity was observed first marginally increasing and then after decreasing with t at higher m values fig 3e this may be because at higher m the ofl removal first increases and then decreases with t value fig 3b fig 3c and f describes the interaction of m and c on the ofl removal and capacity ofl removal decreases with an increase in c value at lower m value however at higher m ofl removal increases with increased c this change in ofl removal is due to the higher active sites availability at a higher dose and the adsorption of ofl on rha can be regarded as adsorbate limiting whereas at lower m capacity increases with an increase in c and negligible change were observed in capacity at higher m with increased c value this indicates the higher adsorption capacity of rha towards ofl ofl adsorption on rha was optimized for maximizing responses x1 removal and x2 adsorption capacity by the rsm the constraints applied for optimization are mentioned in table s1 the optimum values in the study range as suggested by rsm were found to be m 7 94 g l t 430 min and ph 6 with responses x1 and x2 being 79 54 and 6 01 respectively the optimum result from rsm was further validated by conducting three experiments on optimum parameters and the average value of responses x1 and x2 were found to be 79 71 and 6 28 which is in good agreement with the suggested values table 6 3 4 adsorption kinetics and diffusivity kinetics of adsorption and hence kinetic parameters are necessary for designing of adsorption columns at optimum parameters m 7 94 g l t 430 min and ph 6 the kinetics of ofl adsorption on rha was studied using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models eqs 7 and 8 at three ofl initial concentration co 10 40 and 70 mg l the pseudo first order model is given as malik 2003 7 q t q e 1 exp k f t where qt and qe are the amount of ofl adsorbed mg g at any time t and at equilibrium respectively and kf is the rate constant per min pseudo second order model is represented as ho and mckay 1999 8 q t t k s q e 2 1 t k s q e where ks is the rate constant g mg min the initial adsorption rate h g mg min is defined as 9 h k s q e 2 fitting of experimental data to the kinetic models was performed using nonlinear regression herein marquardt s percent standard deviation mpsd error function was applied the calculated kinetic parameters coefficient of determination r2 and error values as mpsd are presented in table 7 and fitting is shown in the fig 4 high r2 low mpsd values at all co values 10 40 and 70 mg l for pseudo first order kinetic model fitting concludes the suitability of the pseudo first order kinetic model for ofl adsorption on rha from table 7 it is observed that the q e and k f values were found increasing with c o indicating the adsorption is limited by the adsorbate concentration of ofl antibiotic pseudo second order kinetic modeling was also performed and experimental data were found in good agreement at lower ofl concentration however at higher concentrations very poor fitting was observed not shown here further the adsorption process is controlled by the intra particle diffusion when adsorbate is present in high concentration and adsorbents are of larger particle sizes aravindhan et al 2007 during adsorption of ofl on rha intra particle diffusion may be the rate controlling since rha is granular the intra particle diffusion model is expressed by the following equation weber and morris 1963 10 q t k id t 1 2 i where k id intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min1 2 i intercept representing the boundary layer thickness on rha the larger the intercept the thicker is the boundary layer kavitha and namasivayam 2007 plot of qt vs t1 2 if linear intra particle diffusion controls the process in the present study two linear portions can be seen fig 5 the first linear part shows the gradual reach of adsorption equilibrium however the second part is attributed to the final adsorption equilibrium stage originated due to lower intraparticle diffusion owing lower ofl concentration left gercel et al 2007 also for these linear parts intercepts i 1 and i 2 are not zero table 7 which indicates surface adsorption is also controlling the adsorption rate of ofl on rha further kid 1 and kid 2 slopes of the linear portions table 7 were found increasing with co due to increased driving force and adsorption of ofl in meso and micropores of rha 3 5 isotherm modeling and thermodynamics adsorption isotherms provide the necessary information for adsorption system designing for this purpose various isotherms such as langmuir redlich peterson r p and tempkin belhachemi and addoun 2011 isotherms table 8 were studied and analyzed for the adsorption of ofl on to rha at 288 318 k temperatures t with c 0 5 70 mg l all the other experiments were conducted at optimum condition m 7 94 g l t 430 min and ph 6 further the experimental isotherm data were then fitted to various isotherm models using nonlinear regression techniques fig 6 chi2 error function was used for this purpose and the estimated isotherm parameters with r2 and chi2 error values are presented in table 8 it can be observed that at a higher t value ofl adsorption capacity is higher which indicates the endothermic nature of ofl adsorption onto rha fig 6 at higher t value new active surface creation and increased intra particle diffusion enhance the adsorption capacity rameshraja et al 2012 from table 4 temkin isotherm was found best fitting the experimental isotherm data with the highest r2 and lowest chi2 values at all the temperatures table 8 however other isotherms langmuir and r p are also in good agreement qm and kl of langmuir isotherm explain the affinity of ofl to the rha acar and eren 2006 increasing t value from 288 to 318 k increases the qm and kl values 5 68 8 48 mg g and 0 0574 0 0709 l mg respectively indicating strong affinity and hence strong bonding of ofl molecule to rha β r p isotherm model s parameter was found between 0 and 1 which signifies favorable ofl adsorption on to rha lakshmi et al 2009 table 8 represents thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures calculated from classical thermodynamics a positive value of δh 0 and δs 0 indicates the endothermic and favorable adsorption sharma 2011 and the negative δg 0 concludes spontaneous nature of ofl adsorption onto rha kushwaha et al 2010 3 6 solidification stabilization and toxicity test the leachability of ofl from the solidified adsorbent as explained above in section 2 5 the solidified beads were examined by measuring the ofl concentration in leachate and the capsulation percentage of ofl was calculated results depicted in fig 7 indicates that cement could successfully stabilize the ofl present in the exhausted adsorbent even at a higher ofl to cement ratio 5 1 significant amount of ofl 95 was encapsulated for all three studied adsorbent concentrations to ensure the safe disposal of stabilized adsorbent further toxicity analysis of leachate was performed using the agar cup method the toxicity of prepared ofl solutions of different concentrations 0 1 10 ppm was also studied for comparison purposes for prepared ofl solutions the maximum zone of inhibition around the agar cup was observed 28 mm and 25 mm for e coli and bacillus subtilis respectively obviously for 10 ppm ofl solution fig 8a and b the minimum inhibition observed in e coli and bacillus subtilis were 12 mm for 0 4 ppm ofl and 11 mm for 1 ppm ofl respectively no zone of inhibition was found for ofl concentration less than 0 4 ppm for e coli and less than 1 ppm for bacillus subtilis the results for toxicity analysis of leachate are represented in fig 8c and d it can be seen that no inhibition in the growth of e coli and bacillus subtilis was observed on plates which indicated that a sufficient amount of ofl was not present in the leachate to kill the growth of bacteria around the agar cup this study concludes that the exhausted ofl loaded rha encapsulation stabilization with cement can be a better approach to fix the exhausted loaded ofl rha 4 conclusion rha was found to be an effective adsorbent for the removal of ofl from aqueous solutions showing x1 79 71 and x2 6 28 mg g at the optimized condition the adsorption of ofl is found to be maximum in the ph range of 4 8 optimum ph 6 and the intra particle diffusion was found controlling mechanism the equilibrium adsorption isotherm data of ofl by rha could be well represented by the langmuir and redlich peterson isotherm however temkin isotherm was found in the best agreement with the experimental data the positive

have been broadly used to treat the many bacterial infectious diseases in humans and animals the primary role of these antibiotics is to abate the dna replication in bacteria by hampering the usual activity of dna topoisomerase lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 an enormous quantity of antibiotics are being used and regularly discharged into the atmosphere from pharmaceutical industries hospitals domestic wastewater and excretion from living beings el ghenymy et al 2013 during the rainy season these antibiotics could be leached out and thus contaminate the groundwater the major health risk due to the antibiotics available in the environment has attracted the interest of the scientific community out of all the antibiotics the fluoroquinolones class of antibiotics has been observed everywhere in wastewater surface soil and sediments due to its extensive use and the fact that it is not easily degradable zaidi et al 2016 ofloxacin ofl a fluoroquinolone fq antibiotic finds its application against gram positive and gram negative bacteria ofl is suggested to the patients with urinary tract infections respiratory tract infections prostatitis and skin infection the concentration of ofl in treated effluents was found in the range of 0 005 31 7 μg l in different countries the excessive use of this antibiotic causes side effects like tendon damage peripheral neuropathy and in serious cases it can result in lifetime disabilities vasquez et al 2013 due to the non biodegradable nature of ofl conventional treatment techniques can eliminate only a small fraction of it remaining runs off to surface water paul et al 2010 fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been detected in different concentration ranges in hospital sewage 60 120 000 ng l in surface waters 5 1300 ng l and in wastewater treatment plant effluents 2 580 ng l all over the world wammer et al 2013 about 20 90 of fluoroquinolones ingested are released in their pharmacologically active forms foremost to considerable loads being discharged into domestic wastewater li et al 2013 currently many treatment methods like adsorption hao et al 2012 chemical oxidation mehrjouei et al 2014 photocatalytic and photolytic treatment li et al 2012 electro oxidation kaur et al 2018 kaur et al 2019 and biodegradation vasquez et al 2013 are usually adapted for the elimination of toxic antibiotics from the aquatic system out of these available methods adsorption is an efficient and favorable technique as it offers great effectiveness little expenditure and simple operation ahmed et al 2015 adsorption is one of the broadly utilized techniques for toxin elimination from the polluted system many materials are being used as sorbents which include activated carbon polymeric adsorbents molecular sieves and some other low cost materials worldwide a huge amount of agricultural solid waste generates every year this waste piles up in the agro industrial yards and has no important industrial application and commercial value consequently it becomes a matter of concern and contributes to severe environmental problems thus the utilization of such low cost and abundantly available agricultural waste is most judicious for wastewater treatment soltani et al 2017 the potential of several affluently available adsorbents such as rice husk barley straw almond shell poplar walnut sawdust orange peel sugarcane bagasse and coconut burch waste have been studied previously hameed et al 2008 however the use of agricultural waste as adsorbent is associated with few drawbacks like low sorption capacity poor physical stability partial solubility need of modification by physical or chemical methods and variation in adsorption capacities by the structure of the components inherent in it omo okoro et al 2018 among various biomass or agricultural waste materials rice husk ash is the most valuable material due to its noble physical and chemical characteristics bahrami et al 2018 soltani et al 2020 the natural agricultural waste rice husk is a form of biomass that is not only a source of energy but also has several applications in various fields such as cement industry pharmaceutical industry rubber industry etc it is estimated that on a global scale 500 million tons of rice is harvested annually rice grain contains 20 husk which is converted into ash after combustion and called rice husk ash rha the rha mainly contains si mg na ca k p fe and cu soltani et al 2015 since the major constituents of rha is silica more than 80 which is responsible for high specific surface area and high porosity so it has the great potential to be used as an effective adsorbent celekli and bozkurt 2013 due to this reason rha is used by various industries worldwide than other agricultural waste residues bahrami et al 2017 bahrami et al 2016 in the present work the adsorption capacity of rice husk ash rha for adsorption of ofl antibiotic was investigated from synthetic wastewater the ofl loaded exhausted rha was studied for its safer disposability by solidification stabilization with portland cement and its possible use as a building material further toxicity analysis of leachate from the solidified rha was also studied for probable leaching of ofl the effects of adsorption parameters such as initial ph the dosage of rha m contact time t and initial ofl concentration c 0 on the responses ofl removal x1 and adsorption capacity mg g x2 were studied using the central composite design ccd based on response surface method rsm at optimized parameters kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption process have been studied with the adsorption mechanism exploration for the representation of adsorption equilibrium data langmuir redlich peterson r p and temkin isotherm models were used 2 experimental 2 1 materials rha obtained from satyam agro solvex khanna punjab india was cleaned with hot water at 80 c the samples were dried at 70 c temperature overnight and sieved to a fraction with a particle size of 180 600 μm using is sieves is 437 1979 the adsorbate ofloxacin ofl with a chemical formula c18h20fn3o4 and a molecular weight of 361 37 g mol was provided by shri ramesth industries himachal pradesh india all other chemicals used for the study were of analytical reagent ar grade 2 2 rha characterization methods the characteristics of the rha structure was evaluated by

by using brunaer emmett teller bet method and the barrett joyner halenda bjh method was used to calculate the mesopore distribution the total pore volume was computed by the t plot procedure the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of rha was also measured employing a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer bruker germany with cu kα radiation λ 1 541 å over the 2θ range of 10 80 the surface organic functional groups of the rha before and after adsorption were analyzed using a fourier transforms infrared ftir spectrophotometer nicolet 6700 spectrometer usa spectra were obtained between 4000 and 400 cm 1 ranges of at room temperature 2 3 design of experiments and optimization experiments for the ofl adsorption on rha were designed and performed by central composite design ccd based on response surface methodology rsm the rsm is a statistical tool that facilitates in designing of experiments with a reduced number of experiments analysis of the interaction between parameters on responses and optimization of the process parameters for required responses soo et al 2004 ph 2 10 adsorbent dosage 0 5 2 5 g 100 ml ofl concentration 10 90 mg l and time 10 750 min coded with five level ccd supplementary table s1 were considered as independent adsorption process variables while ofl removal x1 and ofl adsorption capacity x2 were selected as responses the following quadratic model was applied for the experimental data fittings analysis and optimization of process parameters eq 1 1 x ψ 0 i 1 k ψ i x i i 1 k ψ ii x i 2 i j ψ ij x i x j d r where ѱ0 constant coefficient ѱ i ѱ ii ѱ ij interaction coefficients xi and xj variables d r error analysis of variance anova was used for the parameter interaction analysis further the model adequacy was assessed by adequate precision studentized residuals plots normal probability plots coefficient of determination r2 predicted r2 and adjusted r2 and f and p values a multi response optimization tool was applied for the optimization of two responses x1 and x2 using the desirability function of rsm the multi response optimization tool in rsm optimizes the responses depending on the set target the target may be set as smaller the best stb larger the best ltb and nominal the best ntb kushwaha et al 2011 sangal et al 2013 whereas the desirability function converts the individual desirability d i 0 1 of the responses x1 and x2 into one single desirability value of the system in this study the ltb type target was set for the responses x1 ofl removal and x2 ofl adsorption capacity optimization 2 4 adsorption batch experiments and data analysis in the present study a total of 30 experiments in the batch mode were conducted as designed by ccd rsm table 1 and ofl removal x1 and ofl adsorption capacity x2 were measured for each set of experiments in 100 ml ofl solution of specified initial concentration and previously adjusted desired ph known dose of rha as per design matrix was added the mixture was then agitated at a constant speed of 150 rpm and 303 k temperature in a temperature controlled orbital shaker incubator remi elektronik ltd india cis 24 plus for initial ph adjustment 0 1 n h2so4 and 0 1 n naoh solutions were used the maximum absorption of ofl was found at λmax 288 nm at this λmax value calibration curve was prepared by making ofl solution of different known concentrations for each set of experiments after the equilibrium predetermined time of adsorption process the mixture was drawn and adsorbent was separated by filtration further the absorbance of filtrate was observed at λmax 288 nm using uv visible spectrophotometer electronic corporation india ltd and equilibrium residual ofl concentration was evaluated from calibration curve ofl removal x1 and adsorption capacity x2 of rha was then calculated using the following relation 2 ofl removal x 1 c 0 c f c 0 100 furthermore the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e mg g was calculated as 3 absorption capacity q e x 2 c 0 c e m v where co cf and ce represent the initial final and equilibrium ofl concentrations mg l in the aqueous phase respectively v represents the volume l of the adsorbate solution and m g l to the mass of adsorbent 2 5 solidification stabilization s s studies of exhausted rha the appropriate management of exhausted adsorbent waste is essential to avoid the release of antibiotics in ecosystems and its adverse impacts on the human being for this purpose the solidification stabilization s s technique was adopted due to its well known advantages kogbara et al 2013 loaded adsorbent having different ofl concentrations and portland cement were mixed in different mass ratios supplementary table s2 to observe the effect of binder on the leachability behavior of ofl for this purpose loaded adsorbent and cement were mixed using the required amount of water to make the paste the beads of approximately 2 cm diameter were made and incubated at room temperature for 24 h the incubated beads were then soaked in 100 ml distilled water for 15 days maintaining water level throughout the experimentation after 15 days the concentration of ofl in water was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer to observe the leachability of ofl the capsulation percentage of ofl was calculated using the following relation 4 capsulation percentage c a c l c a 100 where c a and c l represent the ofl concentrations mg l in adsorbent and leachate respectively 2 5 1 bacterial toxicity test after solidification the toxicity of leachate samples was also determined by bacterial toxicity analysis using the agar cup method tambe et al 2001 two bacterial strains e coli and bacillus subtilis culture procured from the department of biotechnology thapar institute of engineering technology patiala was revived in nutrient broth mueller and hinton agar mha was sterilized and 25 ml media was poured in petri plates the 24 h old culture of e coli and bacillus subtilis was spread on agar plates further four to five holes were made in each plate with the help of a cork borer 0 25 μl of each leachate sample from various experiments were added in each hole plates were then incubated at 35 0 1 c for 24 h and observed the zone of inhibition through bacterial growth similarly toxicity analysis of ofl solutions of different concentrations 0 1 10 ppm was also studied for comparison purposes with leachate toxicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the brunauere emmette teller bet surface area and barrette joynere hanlenda bjh adsorption desorption surface area of rha was found to be 32 6 and 10 96 m2 g respectively the average bet pore diameter was found 6 5 nm indicating that rha is mesoporous and appropriate adsorbent for the adsorption of ofl having a high molecular weight bahrami et al 2016 the xrd spectra fig 1 of bare rha showed a single diffuse band centered at around 22 this indicates that the silica in the sample was in an amorphous state although weak peaks at 21 27 and 31 36 68 were identified as trydimite and cristobalite phases respectively azmi et al 2016 no change was observed in the xrd spectra of ofl loaded rha fig 1 ftir fourier transform infrared spectra provide the information of various existing functional groups ftir spectra of bared and ofl loaded rha are presented in fig 2 a broader peak between 3000 and 3700 cm 1 is attributed to the existence of free and hydrogen bonded oh group and si oh owing to adsorbed water on the surface srivastava et al 2006 abou mesalam 2003 a broader but not intensive the peak can be seen at 1636 cm 1 is due to the carbonyl groups stretching from aldehydes and ketones another broader and intense peak at 1092 cm 1 represents the si o si and c o h stretching and oh deformation however comparatively lower intense and narrow peaks at 795 and 469 cm 1 are attributed to the sih srivastava et al 2006 shifting in all the peaks can be seen in fig 2 due to the loading of ofl on rha which indicates that the functional groups present on the surface of rha are participating in the adsorption 3 2 model fitting and statistical analysis experiments advocated as per ccd table 2 were performed and responses x1 and x2 were determined experimental results with process parameters were then statistically analyzed using rsm design expert software version 6 06 stat ease inc minneapolis us sequential f test model summary statistics and subsequent anova table 3 analysis suggested a quadratic model fit the experimental data the adequate precision 35 509 and 34 373 for the responses x1 and x2 respectively revealed the capability and efficiency of the suggested quadratic model in analyzing variables and responses relation further other tools such as outlier residual plots studentized residuals plots and normal probability plots are not shown here well explained the efficiency of quadratic model fittings model f the value of 94 61 and 75 12 for responses x1 and x2 respectively table 3 supported the significance of the quadratic model further the coefficient of determination r2 predicted r2 and adjusted r2 showed a good correlation of actual and predicted responses table 4 values of prob f higher to 0 1 designate the parameters in the model insignificant the significant quadratic model terms from anova were observed as x1 ph m t ph2 m2 c2 t2 ph m ph c m c m t and x2 m c

values for the adsorptive removal of ofl antibiotic are shown in table 2 and the corresponding 3 d response surface graphs obtained from rsm is shown in fig 3 these plots were further analyzed for individual and interactive effects of the adsorption parameters on responses x1 and x2 fig 3a f shows the interaction of ph m g l t min and c mg l on the ofl removal x1 and capacity x2 respectively the simultaneous effects of ph and c on the responses ofl removal and capacity are shown in fig 3a and d respectively at constant m and t value at any ph the ofl removal was observed increasing sharply with the increase in c value up to more than 90 however at higher c ofl removal starts decreasing this indicates that the adsorption of ofl is limited by the adsorbate concentration and the rha possesses higher adsorption capacity whereas the capacity was always found increasing at all ph with increased c on the other hand there is no significant change in capacity with ph change at any c value fig 3d further to confirm the presence of silica and integrity of the rha in respect to the dissolution precipitation at high ph elemental analysis through edx was conducted for both the bare and loaded rha table 5 the elemental analysis showed the presence of same elements i e c o na mg si k and ca in the bare rha and loaded rha after adsorption the presence of si in loaded rha after adsorption with the nearly same weight explains the wholesomeness of the rha after adsorption the slight decrease in the si weight value may be due to the loading of ofloxacin on the rha which in turn increased the weight value of c fig 3b and e explains them and t interaction on the ofl removal and capacity respectively at lower m values an increase in adsorption time t increases the ofl removal which becomes nearly constant at higher t values however at higher m values ofl removal first increases with t and at higher t values it starts decreasing this behavior in ofl removal at higher t values may be due to the desorption of ofl from the rha at higher t values the capacity was found increasing with t at a lower value of m and capacity was observed first marginally increasing and then after decreasing with t at higher m values fig 3e this may be because at higher m the ofl removal first increases and then decreases with t value fig 3b fig 3c and f describes the interaction of m and c on the ofl removal and capacity ofl removal decreases with an increase in c value at lower m value however at higher m ofl removal increases with increased c this change in ofl removal is due to the higher active sites availability at a higher dose and the adsorption of ofl on rha can be regarded as adsorbate limiting whereas at lower m capacity increases with an increase in c and negligible change were observed in capacity at higher m with increased c value this indicates the higher adsorption capacity of rha towards ofl ofl adsorption on rha was optimized for maximizing responses x1 removal and x2 adsorption capacity by the rsm the constraints applied for optimization are mentioned in table s1 the optimum values in the study range as suggested by rsm were found to be m 7 94 g l t 430 min and ph 6 with responses x1 and x2 being 79 54 and 6 01 respectively the optimum result from rsm was further validated by conducting three experiments on optimum parameters and the average value of responses x1 and x2 were found to be 79 71 and 6 28 which is in good agreement with the suggested values table 6 3 4 adsorption kinetics and diffusivity kinetics of adsorption and hence kinetic parameters are necessary for designing of adsorption columns at optimum parameters m 7 94 g l t 430 min and ph 6 the kinetics of ofl adsorption on rha was studied using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models eqs 7 and 8 at three ofl initial concentration co 10 40 and 70 mg l the pseudo first order model is given as malik 2003 7 q t q e 1 exp k f t where qt and qe are the amount of ofl adsorbed mg g at any time t and at equilibrium respectively and kf is the rate constant per min pseudo second order model is represented as ho and mckay 1999 8 q t t k s q e 2 1 t k s q e where ks is the rate constant g mg min the initial adsorption rate h g mg min is defined as 9 h k s q e 2 fitting of experimental data to the kinetic models was performed using nonlinear regression herein marquardt s percent standard deviation mpsd error function was applied the calculated kinetic parameters coefficient of determination r2 and error values as mpsd are presented in table 7 and fitting is shown in the fig 4 high r2 low mpsd values at all co values 10 40 and 70 mg l for pseudo first order kinetic model fitting concludes the suitability of the pseudo first order kinetic model for ofl adsorption on rha from table 7 it is observed that the q e and k f values were found increasing with c o indicating the adsorption is limited by the adsorbate concentration of ofl antibiotic pseudo second order kinetic modeling was also performed and experimental data were found in good agreement at lower ofl concentration however at higher concentrations very poor fitting was observed not shown here further the adsorption process is controlled by the intra particle diffusion when adsorbate is present in high concentration and adsorbents are of larger particle sizes aravindhan et al 2007 during adsorption of ofl on rha intra particle diffusion may be the rate controlling since rha is granular the intra particle diffusion model is expressed by the following equation weber and morris 1963 10 q t k id t 1 2 i where k id intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min1 2 i intercept representing the boundary layer thickness on rha the larger the intercept the thicker is the boundary layer kavitha and namasivayam 2007 plot of qt vs t1 2 if linear intra particle diffusion controls the process in the present study two linear portions can be seen fig 5 the first linear part shows the gradual reach of adsorption equilibrium however the second part is attributed to the final adsorption equilibrium stage originated due to lower intraparticle diffusion owing lower ofl concentration left gercel et al 2007 also for these linear parts intercepts i 1 and i 2 are not zero table 7 which indicates surface adsorption is also controlling the adsorption rate of ofl on rha further kid 1 and kid 2 slopes of the linear portions table 7 were found increasing with co due to increased driving force and adsorption of ofl in meso and micropores of rha 3 5 isotherm modeling and thermodynamics adsorption isotherms provide the necessary information for adsorption system designing for this purpose various isotherms such as langmuir redlich peterson r p and tempkin belhachemi and addoun 2011 isotherms table 8 were studied and analyzed for the adsorption of ofl on to rha at 288 318 k temperatures t with c 0 5 70 mg l all the other experiments were conducted at optimum condition m 7 94 g l t 430 min and ph 6 further the experimental isotherm data were then fitted to various isotherm models using nonlinear regression techniques fig 6 chi2 error function was used for this purpose and the estimated isotherm parameters with r2 and chi2 error values are presented in table 8 it can be observed that at a higher t value ofl adsorption capacity is higher which indicates the endothermic nature of ofl adsorption onto rha fig 6 at higher t value new active surface creation and increased intra particle diffusion enhance the adsorption capacity rameshraja et al 2012 from table 4 temkin isotherm was found best fitting the experimental isotherm data with the highest r2 and lowest chi2 values at all the temperatures table 8 however other isotherms langmuir and r p are also in good agreement qm and kl of langmuir isotherm explain the affinity of ofl to the rha acar and eren 2006 increasing t value from 288 to 318 k increases the qm and kl values 5 68 8 48 mg g and 0 0574 0 0709 l mg respectively indicating strong affinity and hence strong bonding of ofl molecule to rha β r p isotherm model s parameter was found between 0 and 1 which signifies favorable ofl adsorption on to rha lakshmi et al 2009 table 8 represents thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures calculated from classical thermodynamics a positive value of δh 0 and δs 0 indicates the endothermic and favorable adsorption sharma 2011 and the negative δg 0 concludes spontaneous nature of ofl adsorption onto rha kushwaha et al 2010 3 6 solidification stabilization and toxicity test the leachability of ofl from the solidified adsorbent as explained above in section 2 5 the solidified beads were examined by measuring the ofl concentration in leachate and the capsulation percentage of ofl was calculated results depicted in fig 7 indicates that cement could successfully stabilize the ofl present in the exhausted adsorbent even at a higher ofl to cement ratio 5 1 significant amount of ofl 95 was encapsulated for all three studied adsorbent concentrations to ensure the safe disposal of stabilized adsorbent further toxicity analysis of leachate was performed using the agar cup method the toxicity of prepared ofl solutions of different concentrations 0 1 10 ppm was also studied for comparison purposes for prepared ofl solutions the maximum zone of inhibition around the agar cup was observed 28 mm and 25 mm for e coli and bacillus subtilis respectively obviously for 10 ppm ofl solution fig 8a and b the minimum inhibition observed in e coli and bacillus subtilis were 12 mm for 0 4 ppm ofl and 11 mm for 1 ppm ofl respectively no zone of inhibition was found for ofl concentration less than 0 4 ppm for e coli and less than 1 ppm for bacillus subtilis the results for toxicity analysis of leachate are represented in fig 8c and d it can be seen that no inhibition in the growth of e coli and bacillus subtilis was observed on plates which indicated that a sufficient amount of ofl was not present in the leachate to kill the growth of bacteria around the agar cup this study concludes that the exhausted ofl loaded rha encapsulation stabilization with cement can be a better approach to fix the exhausted loaded ofl rha 4 conclusion rha was found to be an effective adsorbent for the removal of ofl from aqueous solutions showing x1 79 71 and x2 6 28 mg g at the optimized condition the adsorption of ofl is found to be maximum in the ph range of 4 8 optimum ph 6 and the intra particle diffusion was found controlling mechanism the equilibrium adsorption isotherm data of ofl by rha could be well represented by the langmuir and redlich peterson isotherm however temkin isotherm was found in the best agreement with the experimental data the positive values of δh 0 change in enthalpy revealed that the adsorption of ofl on rha is an endothermic process loaded exhausted rha fixation through solidification stabilization with cement and its use as building material revealed this safe and effective disposal technique toxicity analysis of leachate from solidified rha indicated that most of the ofl was encapsulated inside the cement and the ofl present in leachate is not sufficient to eradicate the growth of e coli and bacillus subtilis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

events zeta potential values were measured in the laboratory for bacillus globigii and bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki two common surrogates used to represent bacillus anthracis in synthetic baseline ultrapure water and laboratory prepared stormwater zeta potential curves were also determined for materials representative of urban infrastructure concrete and asphalt these data were used to predict the interaction energy between the spores and urban materials using derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo modeling b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki sourced from yakibou inc were found to have similar zeta potential curves whereas spores sourced from the u s military s dugway laboratory were found to diverge in the ultrapure water the modeling results use the laboratory data to demonstrate that the energy barriers between the spores and the urban materials were tunable through compression of the electrical double layer of the spores via changes of ionic strength and ph of the water in the runoff water charge neutralization dominated surface processes the cations metals and natural organic matter nom in the runoff water contributed to equalizing the zeta potential values for dugway b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki and drastically modified the surface of the concrete and asphalt all dlvo energy curves using the runoff water were repulsive the highest energy barrier predicted in this study was for dugway b globigii spores interacting with a concrete surface in runoff water suggesting that this would be the most challenging combination to detach through water

adverse environments for many years gopal et al 2015 spore formers are highly prevalent in soils and the gastrointestinal tracts of warm blooded animals griffin et al 2014 since spore forming bacteria are resistant to extreme pressure temperature drought famine and biocides they often present a challenge in disinfection efforts such as hospital sterilization and in food preservation rutala et al 1993 weber et al 2010 magnusson et al 2007 some species of spore forming bacteria are particularly dangerous to humans and contact can result in severe illness and even death bacillus anthracis the causative agent of anthrax is a global public health concern both as a naturally occurring contaminant and as a biological weapon guh et al 2010 d amelio et al 2015 sinclair et al 2008 weis et al 2002 meselson et al 1994 due to b anthracis s bioterrorism history many researchers have studied its dispersion in an aerosolized form and have evaluated the disinfection efficacy of decontaminants against b anthracis spores wood et al 2011 szabo et al 2017 reshetin and regens 2003 during a contamination incident e g a terrorist attack spores could be deposited over a large urban area where they could persist for years after the initial contamination event spores can be redistributed even more broadly throughout the urban environment due to rain and wind as well as by humans through vehicular and foot traffic developing numerical models that include the stormwater driven fate and transport of spores can be useful to predict contamination extent as it evolves over time during emergency response and recovery informing activities such as creating sampling maps deciding where to stage waste and developing strategic decontamination plans mikelonis et al 2018 conventional stormwater models have been used to predict water quality concentrations of common contaminants such as solids or metals at various points in a conveyance system mcpherson et al 2005 smith et al 2007 tiveron et al 2017 aceves et al 2017 lee et al 2010 however existing models have not been used to model the fate and transport of low probability high consequence pathogens such as b anthracis therefore laboratory and field studies are necessary to quantitatively represent these contaminants in stormwater models since working with b anthracis spores directly poses risks to laboratory workers surrogates have been used for many different types of research experiments greenberg et al 2010 however a de facto surrogate for stormwater based transport studies does not exist this paper presents a comparison of surface charge changes for two frequently used surrogates bacillus globigii and bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki in both an amended baseline ultrapure water and two stormwater runoff matrices we also calculate the microorganisms corresponding energies of interaction with two types of roadway materials to better understand the dominant environmental conditions influencing adhesion to urban impervious surfaces a better understanding of these adhesion mechanisms will improve model representations and parameterizations of stormwater driven transport processes related to spore forming biological contaminants selecting an appropriate surrogate for a specific research intention is not a straightforward task and often involves compromise both b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki have been used as a surrogate for b anthracis in aerosol research van cuyk et al 2011 layshock et al 2012 in more recent literature b thuringiensis kurstaki has been recommended as the most representative aerosol surrogate due to its similar shape hydrophobicity and exosporium with the presence of a hairy nap tufts et al 2014 on the other hand water based experimental work focused on drinking water treatment processes has primarily used b globigii as a surrogate szabo and minamyer 2014 szabo et al 2007 b globigii is more resistant to chlorine than b anthracis and is therefore considered a conservative surrogate for drinking water disinfection studies brazis et al 1958 b globigii is also an attractive surrogate for aqueous transport applications because it produces orange colored colonies when cultured which enables enumeration in environmental samples with high background levels of microorganisms however unlike b anthracis b globigii does not have an exosporium with a hairy nap which may impact how accurately it represents b anthracis in transport processes the behavior of colloids in water treatment plants ground waters and surface waters has been well studied and may be drawn from for conceptual application to spores hermansson 1999 ryan and elimelech 1996 elimelech et al 2013 kim et al 2006 these and many other researchers have used the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory of aqueous colloidal stability to predict the conditions under which particles adhere to each other and or surfaces dlvo theory is a summation of van der waals interactions typically attractive and electrical double layer interactions edl typically repulsive to predict the energy of the interaction between two surfaces derjaguin 1940 verwey et al 1999 our study focuses on comparing how b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki s zeta potential measurements change in different environmentally relevant stormwater conditions and understanding how these changes influence the dlvo predictions of spore adhesion to asphalt and concrete i e how do these spores behave in stormwater runoff and puddles on infrastructure such as roads and sidewalks stormwater quality varies substantially by location and is potentially affected by factors such as nearby land use climatic zone season and the percentage of impervious cover in the drainage area pitt et al 2004 to produce a typical reproducible laboratory synthetic runoff water representative of cities in the united states we included low levels of metals two levels of soil humic acid one representative of a more concentrated first flush and a second representative of more prolonged runoff a combination of naturally occurring salts and used the median value of hardness 38 mg l caco3 from version 4 02 of the national stormwater quality database pitt et al 2018 table 1 spore surface properties can be affected by the growth media and processing e g sonicating even for the same strain white et al 2014 the outer structures of b anthracis and its surrogates that include an exosporium are a complicated landscape of glycoproteins lequette et al 2011 for this research both b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki from two different sources yakibou inc apex north carolina usa and the u s army dugway proving ground laboratory dugway utah usa were tested in the initial subset of ultrapure baseline experiments spores from dugway were then subsequently used in experiments with the stormwater matrices the spores produced by dugway are milled both b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki and fluidized only b globigii 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of spores the spores from yakibou inc apex north carolina were received in a 29 ethanol solution b globigii atcc 9372 had an as

108 spores ml spores were stored at 4 0c and populations were checked the week of experimentation by plating samples onto tryptic soy agar bd difco houston tx incubating at 35 2 c for 18 3 h and enumerating colony forming units 2 2 water recipes four different waters were used during this research table 1 a sartorius cp3246 goettingen germany and an ohaus hsr 011 adventurer pro parsippany new

and sodium chloride nacl were all acs grade reagents metals were included in the synthetic stormwater matrices because stormwater in urban areas usually contain copper zinc lead cadmium chromium and or nickel leached from car parts copper and zinc were selected as representative metals because they demonstrate markedly different chemical behaviors regarding speciation and complexation with environmental chelators metals such as lead and nickel behave much like copper and complex strongly with organic matter whereas cadmium and zinc predominantly exist as free divalent ions dean et al

soil humic acid to represent build up and washoff of solids during stormwater runoff processes the nom used in this work was an elliott soil humic acid standard iv international humic acid substances society st paul minnesota usa a stock solution of nom was made by dissolving the humic acid in ultrapure water at a ph of 9 22 adjusted using acs grade naoh and stirring overnight the stock solution s total organic carbon concentration was then measured using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer kyoto japan using glassware baked at 120 0c and a total carbon standard stock of 1000 mg l potassium hydrogen phthalate diluted for standard points at 0 40 80 120 160 and 200 mg l carbon the instrument calibration had an r2 value of 0 9984 and the stock nom standard diluted to the target concentration for the synthetic stormwater was determined to have a concentration of 54 02 mg l carbon 2 3 zeta potential measurements spore zeta potential measurements were performed using a zen3600 malvern zetasizer malvern england and the malvern dts1070 sample cell malvern dts 1235 42 zeta potential standards were used each day of measurement to ensure the instrument was working properly the standard s acceptable range 42 mv 4 2 mv was achieved to proceed with measurement collection on the spore samples per recommendation of the manufacturer the sample cells where flushed on initial use with ethanol once followed by five flushes with deionized water a unique sample cell was used for the four different spore strains sources and in between each measurement point the cell was flushed three times with deionized water and one time with the sample solution spores were prepared for measurement by sonicating for one minute followed by vortexing for ten seconds and diluting the stock spore solutions in deionized water to a concentration of 106 spores ml a 2 5 m stock solution of kcl was used to adjust the ionic strength to either 10 mm or 100 mm naoh and hcl were used for ph adjustment and accounted for in ionic strength calculations a daily 3 point calibration was performed on the ph probe and all experiments achieved r2 values greater than 0 95 for obtaining the zeta potentials of roadway materials concrete quikrete concrete home depot durham nc usa and asphalt north carolina department of transportation youngsville north carolina usa were pulverized using an angle grinder and a blade skil 9295 01 4 5 in lowes raleigh north carolina usa inside a blasting chamber with a hand glove compartment the generated particles were then sieved using mesh opens of 1000 μm 500 μm 250 μm and 106 μm and the fraction of particles collected between the 250 μm and the 106 μm mesh were used for streaming potential measurements these particles were soaked and rinsed with water prior to measurement to remove any finer particles and dust streaming potential measurements were collected on a surpass electrokinetic analyzer anton paar ashland virgina usa using approximately 3 g of compacted pulverized sample in the cylindrical cell surpass sample holder accessory a pressure ramp from 600 mbar to 200 mbar was employed for the test and the ph of the electrolyte solution was adjusted by addition of 0 05 m or 0 1 m naoh or 0 05 m or 0 1 m hcl lower molarities were used for the stormwater matrices ph adjustment at each ph condition the sample was rinsed with the electrolyte solution for five minutes prior to determining the zeta potential 2 4 dlvo modeling theoretical calculations dlvo calculations depend upon the ionic strength of the bulk solution valency of ions the distance between the particle and the surface the hamaker constant a material property that describes the strength of interactions between surfaces and bulk solution and the charge of the two interacting surfaces dlvo theory is extended when it includes adjustments for characteristics such as surface roughness steric interactions from features such as appendages magnetic interaction and or short range acid base reactions vegetative bacteria and spores have been considered inert particles for adhesion modeling purposes although not to our knowledge in stormwater matrices chung et al 2009 chung et al 2014 chen et al 2010 based on the experimentally measured zeta potentials of the spores and the roadway materials the interaction energy i e dlvo energy between them were modeled spore shape was approximated as a rod with the cylindrical radius of 0 6 μm and van der waals vdw attraction and electrical double layer edl repulsion were calculated from cylinder flat surface interaction equations provided by israelachvili 2011 the total interaction energy j as a function of the separation distance between the spore and the roadway material is the sum of vdw and edl interactions the vdw interaction energy was calculated using the following equation 1 e vdw a h r 12 2 d 2 3 where ah is the hamaker constant r is the cylindrical radius and d is the separation distance the effective hamaker constant i e a geometrical mean of the hamaker constants of the two interacting surfaces in a medium was used elimelech et al 2013 previously reported hamaker values for water spore and roadway materials were used in the calculations brown and jaffé 2006 lomboy et al 2011 morrison et al 1994 israelachvili 2011 the effective hamaker constants were 1 5e 20 j and 6 1e 21 j for spore water asphalt and spore water concrete scenarios respectively for the edl interaction the linearized poisson boltzmann equation is used instead of a numerical solution for the following reason the linearized poisson boltzmann equation can minimize the numerical burden on modeling while providing a reasonable approximation to exact solutions if the surface potential is less than 25 7 mv benjamin and lawler 2013 most spore roadway interaction scenarios considered and presented in this paper had low surface potential values that satisfied such condition however it should be noted that dugway b globigii spores in the low ionic strength baseline water had surface potentials lower than 25 7 mv care must be taken interpreting this scenario the edl energy was obtained from following equation 2 e edl κ 1 2 r 2 π z e κd where κ is the inverse of the debye length r is the cylindrical radius and d is the separation distance z is the interaction constant defined as follow 3 z 64 π ε 0 ε k b t e 2 tanh 2 ze ψ 0 4 kt where z is the electrolyte valency ψ 0 is surface potential in mv kb is the boltzmann constant t is absolute temperature in kelvin e is elementary charge ε0 is permittivity in vacuum ε is relative permittivity of water edl interaction between the spores and the flat surfaces were modeled with linear superposition approximation lsa with constant surface potential by using a geometrical mean of the interaction constants for the two interacting surfaces 3 results 3 1 zeta potential measurements in the baseline waters all spore zeta potential values were increasingly positive with decreasing ph fig 1 overall increasing the ionic strength i from 10 mm to 100 mm reduced the magnitude of the zeta potentials this is consistent with theory stating that the diffuse layers of charged surfaces are compressed with increased ionic strengths elimelech et al 2013 the yakibou spores experienced isoelectric points iep near a ph value of two fig 1b for both sources of b thuringiensis kurstaki and the yakibou b globigii zeta potential values clustered together across the range of ph values however for both ionic strengths the dugway b globigii spores zeta potentials diverged from the others dugway b globigii had greater negative zeta potential values at all but one ph measurement near the iep fig 1a from ph 4 to ph 12 dugway spore zeta potentials also stayed relatively constant indicating surface reactions were occurring between the electrolyte and the spore e g at an intermediate ph range most carboxyl groups on the spore surface are likely to be deprotonated while most amino groups are protonated benjamin and lawler 2013 due to this clustering between both yakibou spore species and the dugway b thuringiensis kurstaki only b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki spores from dugway were subsequently tested in synthetic stormwater matrices and compared to the i 10 mm baseline water fig 2 in general zeta potential values did not drastically change for the dugway b thuringiensis kurstaki in stormwater although the ascent to the iep occurred more gradually in the stormwater runoff nonetheless the dugway b globigii spores experienced a decrease in the magnitude of the zeta potentials across the entire range of ph values when exposed to the stormwater runoff except at ph 3 for both dugway b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki there were little observable differences in zeta potential values between the first flush level of nom 10 mg l total organic carbon toc and the lower prolonged runoff level of nom 1 mg l toc conversely the synthetic stormwater drastically changed the surface potential of the concrete and asphalt particles indicating changing surface chemistry during the interactions fig 3 in the baseline water the asphalt behaved as expected the iep remained the same in a higher ionic strength solution and the zeta potential s magnitude decreased with decreasing ph due to the compaction of the edl on the other hand the iep changed at higher ionic strength for the concrete the iep dropped from a ph of 7 9 to a ph of 6 3 when the ionic strength was increased also for i 100 mm the zeta potential values for the concrete samples were relatively similar between ph 6 and 10 the same trend occurred at i 10 mm but with a sign change this static zeta potential magnitude over a range of ph is an indication of reactions between the electrolyte and the surface these chemistry changes were even more drastic in the stormwater runoff for both asphalt and concrete zeta potential values did not change over the range of tested ph values as the nom concentration was increased from 1 mg l to 10 mg l toc the zeta potentials became more negative for both materials 3 2 dlvo modeling for all spore and baseline water types dlvo modeling was performed at ph values of 5 and 7 to predict the energy of interaction between the spores and the roadway materials predictions were also calculated for concrete for all spore and baseline water types at ph 10 over all combinations dugway b globigii spores demonstrated the least attraction to the roadway materials followed by dugway b thuringiensis kurstaki yakibou b thuringiensis kurstaki and yakibou b globigii fig 4 in line with the clustering of the spores measured zeta potential values dugway b globigii was consistently an outlier in its interaction energy with the roadway materials compared to the other spore types further an energy barrier between dugway b globigii and asphalt existed at both ph conditions 5 7 when i 10 mm but not for either ph condition at i 100 mm on the other hand the ph value of the water not just the ionic strength controlled the existence of an energy barrier between dugway b globigii and concrete fig 5 under both ionic strength conditions at ph 5 and at a high ph value with i 10 mm dugway b globigii spores interacting with concrete exhibited an energy barrier however the energy barrier was not predicted at the neutral ph conditions for either ionic strength dlvo modeling was also performed at multiple ph values 5 and 7 for asphalt 5 7 and 10 for concrete using the zeta potential values for both stormwater matrices fig 6 whereas the baseline water dlvo predictions produced energy barriers only during certain material water combinations an energy barrier persisted under all stormwater conditions for both dugway b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki in the absence of the stormwater matrix the interaction between the dugway spores and concrete is attractive i e negative interaction energy at all separation distances however spore concrete interactions became repulsive i e positive interaction energy in the presence of the stormwater matrix fig 6a b if the barrier already existed in the baseline water its magnitude increased in the stormwater matrices fig 6c d as zeta potential measurements indicated the surface potentials of both materials became more negative due to the adsorption of nom divalent cations and or metals onto the surfaces of those materials this suggests that dugway spores will not easily attach nor detach from concrete or asphalt surfaces in stormwater runoff these results are consistent with other studies that consider adsorption of nom in aquatic systems and suggest that nom plays an important role in understanding surface interactions between biological contaminants e g spores and flat surfaces e g roadway material in stormwater runoff dai and hozalski 2002 pham et al 2009 4 discussion the zeta potential data indicate that two different mechanisms double layer compression and charge neutralization influence the adhesion of spores to submerged urban surfaces for both b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki compression of the double layer was dependent on the i of the water where a larger i lowered the magnitude of the zeta potential on the other hand charge neutralization introduced in the runoff water through divalent cations metals and nom only affected the b globigii zeta potentials further the results showed that small amounts of nom were as impactful as larger quantities both the low prolonged washoff value of 1 mg l toc and the first flush value of 10 mg l toc reduced the magnitude of the b globigii zeta potentials the same degree also this amount of zeta potential change was similar to that induced by increasing the ionic strength to 100 mm ultimately the runoff water rendered the zeta potential differences indistinguishable for b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki for the tested dugway strains whereas the baseline water adjustment modifying only i preserved variation between spore strains variations between spore strains is likely due to differences in surface functional groups these vary by strain and most notably include those functional groups associated with the collagen like bcia on the b thuringiensis exosporium sylvestre et al 2002 goodacre et al 2000 and pydridin 2 6 dicarboxylic acid deposits on b globigii s sport coat goodacre et al 2000 this difference directly impacted the baseline water modeling results and demonstrated that there are multiple routes to modify adhesion in clean water i e ionic strengths ph values urban surface or spore strain others have studied the surface properties of b anthracis and found it to be the least electronegative when compared to b megaterium b cereus b globigii b subtilis and b thuringiensis subsp israelensis white et al 2014 the authors recommended that b thuringiensis kurstaki was most representative as a surrogate for b anthracis in tap water because it was the least electronegative organic matter is ubiquitous in the outdoor environment and therefore runoff water holds the potential to equalize b thuringiensis kurstaki and b globigii s zeta potential values although care should be taken when selecting a surrogate with a similar electronegativity to b anthracis in clean tap water these data document that b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki could be used interchangeably in stormwater from an edl perspective the dlvo modeling presented in this paper does not account for extended forces attributable to soft particle effects such as steric hinderance from the b thuringiensis kurstaki s hairy nap the surface roughness of the concrete and asphalt or lewis acid base interactions classic dlvo calculations have been shown to be consistent with atomic force microscopy measurements for b thuringiensis kurstaki interacting with planar surfaces in aqueous solutions chung et al 2014 if the nap roughness and acid base interactions are accounted for they are expected to lower the energy barrier wu et al 2018 chen et al 2010 a harmonic oscillator model has also been implemented to describe how bacteria with fibrillar tethers couple to surfaces van der westen et al 2018 exploring these newer modeling techniques and accounting for extended forces not included in traditional dlvo modeling is an essential area of future investigations to better understand the fate and transport of high risk pathogens but require advanced imaging and analytical techniques to quantify the spacing and conformation of spore structures outside the scope of this paper and in many cases are very challenging to perform on these sample types without modifying the surfaces the classic dlvo modeling results predicted that the presence of an energy barrier was sensitive to ph and ionic strength conditions in the baseline water across tested combinations of water urban material and spore type dugway b globigii consistently had the highest energy barrier likely due to its processing but with modifications of i and or ph adhesion or washoff can be promoted while water characteristics caused subtle changes in the spore s surface properties the modeling results suggested the dominant mechanism controlling adhesion was the charge neutralization reactions of concrete and asphalt urban materials in the runoff water this is consistent with literature documenting that nom alters the charge of metal oxide surfaces zhang et al 2009 the modeling results predicted that under stormwater conditions there was a barrier to attachment detachment at all ph spore and material combinations since the runoff water did not notably change the b thuringiensis kurstaki zeta potentials and b globigii became less not more electronegative the presence of an energy barrier was attributable to the surface reactions with the concrete and asphalt because the highest predicted energy barrier existed between the dugway b globigii and concrete in stormwater runoff we expect this would be the most difficult combination to remove through wetting by rain or by washing the surface with a hose if spores were already attached 5 conclusion the laboratory data collected in this study demonstrated that the runoff water composition equalizes the surface charge differences between different surrogates for b anthracis and drastically changes the surface charge characteristics of urban materials from a surface charge perspective these findings provide greater flexibility in selecting a surrogate microorganism to use in field and laboratory studies focused on stormwater transport since the nom salts and metals found in runoff water coat the spores and therefore exert a more dominant control on spore adhesion processes than the surface properties of the spores themselves the laboratory results are useful building blocks in the application of models that theorize how to remove pathogenic spores from the surface of materials classic dlvo modeling predicts that stormwater constituents could make the removal of spores from these surfaces by water more challenging and reinforce that surface differences between concrete and asphalt have a bigger impact on spore adhesion than variations in spore strain testing these predictions is an area of active research in the homeland security research program at the u s environmental protection agency epa ongoing experiments are being performed measuring the washoff of both types of spores from concrete and asphalt coupons using a rainfall simulator this study coupled with ongoing washoff experiments provides information to aid in modeling the spread of biological

may be drawn from for conceptual application to spores hermansson 1999 ryan and elimelech 1996 elimelech et al 2013 kim et al 2006 these and many other researchers have used the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory of aqueous colloidal stability to predict the conditions under which particles adhere to each other and or surfaces dlvo theory is a summation of van der waals interactions typically attractive and electrical double layer interactions edl typically repulsive to predict the energy of the interaction between two surfaces derjaguin 1940 verwey et al 1999 our study focuses on comparing how b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki s zeta potential measurements change in different environmentally relevant stormwater conditions and understanding how these changes influence the dlvo predictions of spore adhesion to asphalt and concrete i e how do these spores behave in stormwater runoff and puddles on infrastructure such as roads and sidewalks stormwater quality varies substantially by location and is potentially affected by factors such as nearby land use climatic zone season and the percentage of impervious cover in the drainage area pitt et al 2004 to produce a

outer structures of b anthracis and its surrogates that include an exosporium are a complicated landscape of glycoproteins lequette et al 2011 for this research both b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki from two different sources yakibou inc apex north carolina usa and the u s army dugway proving ground laboratory dugway utah usa were tested in the initial subset of ultrapure baseline experiments spores from dugway were then subsequently used in experiments with the stormwater matrices the spores produced by dugway are milled both b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki and fluidized only b globigii 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of spores the spores from yakibou inc apex north carolina were received in a 29 ethanol solution b globigii atcc 9372 had an as

enumerating colony forming units 2 2 water recipes four different waters were used during this research table 1 a sartorius cp3246 goettingen germany and an ohaus hsr 011 adventurer pro parsippany new jersey usa analytical balances were used to weigh all dry chemicals the potassium chloride kcl magnesium sulfate heptahydrate mgso4 7h2o potassium nitrate kno3 calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o and sodium chloride nacl were all acs grade reagents metals were included in the synthetic stormwater matrices because stormwater in urban areas usually contain copper zinc lead cadmium chromium and or nickel leached from car parts copper and zinc were selected as representative metals because they demonstrate markedly different chemical behaviors regarding speciation and complexation with environmental chelators metals such as lead and nickel behave much like copper and complex strongly with organic matter whereas cadmium and zinc predominantly exist as free divalent ions dean et al

soil humic acid to represent build up and washoff of solids during stormwater runoff processes the nom used in this work was an elliott soil humic acid standard iv international humic acid substances society st paul minnesota usa a stock solution of nom was made by dissolving the humic acid in ultrapure water at a ph of 9 22 adjusted using acs grade naoh and stirring overnight the stock solution s total organic carbon concentration was then measured using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer kyoto japan using glassware baked at 120 0c and a total carbon standard stock of 1000 mg l potassium hydrogen phthalate diluted for standard points at 0 40 80 120 160 and 200 mg l carbon the instrument calibration had an r2 value of 0 9984 and the stock nom standard diluted to the target concentration for the synthetic stormwater was determined to have a concentration of 54 02 mg l carbon 2 3 zeta potential measurements spore zeta potential measurements were performed using a zen3600 malvern zetasizer malvern england and the malvern dts1070 sample cell malvern dts 1235 42 zeta potential standards were used each day of measurement to ensure the instrument was working properly the standard s acceptable range 42 mv 4 2 mv was achieved to proceed with measurement collection on the spore samples per recommendation of the manufacturer the sample cells where flushed on initial use with ethanol once followed by five flushes with deionized water a unique sample cell was used for the four different spore strains sources and in between each measurement point the cell was flushed three times with deionized water and one time with the sample solution spores were prepared for measurement by sonicating for one minute followed by vortexing for ten seconds and diluting the stock spore solutions in deionized water to a concentration of 106 spores ml a 2 5 m stock solution of kcl was used to adjust the ionic strength to either 10 mm or 100 mm naoh and hcl were used for ph adjustment and accounted for in ionic strength calculations a daily 3 point calibration was performed on the ph probe and all experiments achieved r2 values greater than 0 95 for obtaining the zeta potentials of roadway materials concrete quikrete concrete home depot durham nc usa and asphalt north carolina department of transportation youngsville north carolina usa were pulverized using an angle grinder and a blade skil 9295 01 4 5 in lowes raleigh north carolina usa inside a blasting chamber with a hand glove compartment the generated particles were then sieved using mesh opens of 1000 μm 500 μm 250 μm and 106 μm and the fraction of particles collected between the 250 μm and the 106 μm mesh were used for streaming potential measurements these particles were soaked and rinsed with water prior to measurement to remove any finer particles and dust streaming potential measurements were collected on a surpass electrokinetic analyzer anton paar ashland virgina usa using approximately 3 g of compacted pulverized sample in the cylindrical cell surpass sample holder accessory a pressure ramp from 600 mbar to 200 mbar was employed for the test and the ph of the electrolyte solution was adjusted by addition of 0 05 m or 0 1 m naoh or 0 05 m or 0 1 m hcl lower molarities were used for the stormwater matrices ph adjustment at each ph condition the sample was rinsed with the electrolyte solution for five minutes prior to determining the zeta potential 2 4 dlvo modeling theoretical calculations dlvo calculations depend upon the ionic strength of the bulk solution valency of ions the distance between the particle and the surface the hamaker constant a material property that describes the strength of interactions between surfaces and bulk solution and the charge of the two interacting surfaces dlvo theory is extended when it includes adjustments for characteristics such as surface roughness steric interactions from features such as appendages magnetic interaction and or short range acid base reactions vegetative bacteria and spores have been considered inert particles for adhesion modeling purposes although not to our knowledge in stormwater matrices chung et al 2009 chung et al 2014 chen et al 2010 based on the experimentally measured zeta potentials of the spores and the roadway materials the interaction energy i e dlvo energy between them were modeled spore shape was approximated as a rod with the cylindrical radius of 0 6 μm and van der waals vdw attraction and electrical double layer edl repulsion were calculated from cylinder flat surface interaction equations provided by israelachvili 2011 the total interaction energy j as a function of the separation distance between the spore and the roadway material is the sum of vdw and edl interactions the vdw interaction energy was calculated using the following equation 1 e vdw a h r 12 2 d 2 3 where ah is the hamaker constant r is the cylindrical radius and d is the separation distance the effective hamaker constant i e a geometrical mean of the hamaker constants of the two interacting surfaces in a medium was used elimelech et al 2013 previously reported hamaker values for water spore and roadway materials were used in the calculations brown and jaffé 2006 lomboy et al 2011 morrison et al 1994 israelachvili 2011 the effective hamaker constants were 1 5e 20 j and 6 1e 21 j for spore water asphalt and spore water concrete scenarios respectively for the edl interaction the linearized poisson boltzmann equation is used instead of a numerical solution for the following reason the linearized poisson boltzmann equation can minimize the numerical burden on modeling while providing a reasonable approximation to exact solutions if the surface potential is less than 25 7 mv benjamin and lawler 2013 most spore roadway interaction scenarios considered and presented in this paper had low surface potential values that satisfied such condition however it should be noted that dugway b globigii spores in the low ionic strength baseline water had surface potentials lower than 25 7 mv care must be taken interpreting this scenario the edl energy was obtained from following equation 2 e edl κ 1 2 r 2 π z e κd where κ is the inverse of the debye length r is the cylindrical radius and d is the separation distance z is the interaction constant defined as follow 3 z 64 π ε 0 ε k b t e 2 tanh 2 ze ψ 0 4 kt where z is the electrolyte valency ψ 0 is surface potential in mv kb is the boltzmann constant t is absolute temperature in kelvin e is elementary charge ε0 is permittivity in vacuum ε is relative permittivity of water edl interaction between the spores and the flat surfaces were modeled with linear superposition approximation lsa with constant surface potential by using a geometrical mean of the interaction constants for the two interacting surfaces 3 results 3 1 zeta potential measurements in the baseline waters all spore zeta potential values were increasingly positive with decreasing ph fig 1 overall increasing the ionic strength i from 10 mm to 100 mm reduced the magnitude of the zeta potentials this is consistent with theory stating that the diffuse layers of charged surfaces are compressed with increased ionic strengths elimelech et al 2013 the yakibou spores experienced isoelectric points iep near a ph value of two fig 1b for both sources of b thuringiensis kurstaki and the yakibou b globigii zeta potential values clustered together across the range of ph values however for both ionic strengths the dugway b globigii spores zeta potentials diverged from the others dugway b globigii had greater negative zeta potential values at all but one ph measurement near the iep fig 1a from ph 4 to ph 12 dugway spore zeta potentials also stayed relatively constant indicating surface reactions were occurring between the electrolyte and the spore e g at an intermediate ph range most carboxyl groups on the spore surface are likely to be deprotonated while most amino groups are protonated benjamin and lawler 2013 due to this clustering between both yakibou spore species and the dugway b thuringiensis kurstaki only b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki spores from dugway were subsequently tested in synthetic stormwater matrices and compared to the i 10 mm baseline water fig 2 in general zeta potential values did not drastically change for the dugway b thuringiensis kurstaki in stormwater although the ascent to the iep occurred more gradually in the stormwater runoff nonetheless the dugway b globigii spores experienced a decrease in the magnitude of the zeta potentials across the entire range of ph values when exposed to the stormwater runoff except at ph 3 for both dugway b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki there were little observable differences in zeta potential values between the first flush level of nom 10 mg l total organic carbon toc and the lower prolonged runoff level of nom 1 mg l toc conversely the synthetic stormwater drastically changed the surface potential of the concrete and asphalt particles indicating changing surface chemistry during the interactions fig 3 in the baseline water the asphalt behaved as expected the iep remained the same in a higher ionic strength solution and the zeta potential s magnitude decreased with decreasing ph due to the compaction of the edl on the other hand the iep changed at higher ionic strength for the concrete the iep dropped from a ph of 7 9 to a ph of 6 3 when the ionic strength was increased also for i 100 mm the zeta potential values for the concrete samples were relatively similar between ph 6 and 10 the same trend occurred at i 10 mm but with a sign change this static zeta potential magnitude over a range of ph is an indication of reactions between the electrolyte and the surface these chemistry changes were even more drastic in the stormwater runoff for both asphalt and concrete zeta potential values did not change over the range of tested ph values as the nom concentration was increased from 1 mg l to 10 mg l toc the zeta potentials became more negative for both materials 3 2 dlvo modeling for all spore and baseline water types dlvo modeling was performed at ph values of 5 and 7 to predict the energy of interaction between the spores and the roadway materials predictions were also calculated for concrete for all spore and baseline water types at ph 10 over all combinations dugway b globigii spores demonstrated the least attraction to the roadway materials followed by dugway b thuringiensis kurstaki yakibou b thuringiensis kurstaki and yakibou b globigii fig 4 in line with the clustering of the spores measured zeta potential values dugway b globigii was consistently an outlier in its interaction energy with the roadway materials compared to the other spore types further an energy barrier between dugway b globigii and asphalt existed at both ph conditions 5 7 when i 10 mm but not for either ph condition at i 100 mm on the other hand the ph value of the water not just the ionic strength controlled the existence of an energy barrier between dugway b globigii and concrete fig 5 under both ionic strength conditions at ph 5 and at a high ph value with i 10 mm dugway b globigii spores interacting with concrete exhibited an energy barrier however the energy barrier was not predicted at the neutral ph conditions for either ionic strength dlvo modeling was also performed at multiple ph values 5 and 7 for asphalt 5 7 and 10 for concrete using the zeta potential values for both stormwater matrices fig 6 whereas the baseline water dlvo predictions produced energy barriers only during certain material water combinations an energy barrier persisted under all stormwater conditions for both dugway b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki in the absence of the stormwater matrix the interaction between the dugway spores and concrete is attractive i e negative interaction energy at all separation distances however spore concrete interactions became repulsive i e positive interaction energy in the presence of the stormwater matrix fig 6a b if the barrier already existed in the baseline water its magnitude increased in the stormwater matrices fig 6c d as zeta potential measurements indicated the surface potentials of both materials became more negative due to the adsorption of nom divalent cations and or metals onto the surfaces of those materials this suggests that dugway spores will not easily attach nor detach from concrete or asphalt surfaces in stormwater runoff these results are consistent with other studies that consider adsorption of nom in aquatic systems and suggest that nom plays an important role in understanding surface interactions between biological contaminants e g spores and flat surfaces e g roadway material in stormwater runoff dai and hozalski 2002 pham et al 2009 4 discussion the zeta potential data indicate that two different mechanisms double layer compression and charge neutralization influence the adhesion of spores to submerged urban surfaces for both b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki compression of the double layer was dependent on the i of the water where a larger i lowered the magnitude of the zeta potential on the other hand charge neutralization introduced in the runoff water through divalent cations metals and nom only affected the b globigii zeta potentials further the results showed that small amounts of nom were as impactful as larger quantities both the low prolonged washoff value of 1 mg l toc and the first flush value of 10 mg l toc reduced the magnitude of the b globigii zeta potentials the same degree also this amount of zeta potential change was similar to that induced by increasing the ionic strength to 100 mm ultimately the runoff water rendered the zeta potential differences indistinguishable for b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki for the tested dugway strains whereas the baseline water adjustment modifying only i preserved variation between spore strains variations between spore strains is likely due to differences in surface functional groups these vary by strain and most notably include those functional groups associated with the collagen like bcia on the b thuringiensis exosporium sylvestre et al 2002 goodacre et al 2000 and pydridin 2 6 dicarboxylic acid deposits on b globigii s sport coat goodacre et al 2000 this difference directly impacted the baseline water modeling results and demonstrated that there are multiple routes to modify adhesion in clean water i e ionic strengths ph values urban surface or spore strain others have studied the surface properties of b anthracis and found it to be the least electronegative when compared to b megaterium b cereus b globigii b subtilis and b thuringiensis subsp israelensis white et al 2014 the authors recommended that b thuringiensis kurstaki was most representative as a surrogate for b anthracis in tap water because it was the least electronegative organic matter is ubiquitous in the outdoor environment and therefore runoff water holds the potential to equalize b thuringiensis kurstaki and b globigii s zeta potential values although care should be taken when selecting a surrogate with a similar electronegativity to b anthracis in clean tap water these data document that b globigii and b thuringiensis kurstaki could be used interchangeably in stormwater from an edl perspective the dlvo modeling presented in this paper does not account for extended forces attributable to soft particle effects such as steric hinderance from the b thuringiensis kurstaki s hairy nap the surface roughness of the concrete and asphalt or lewis acid base interactions classic dlvo calculations have been shown to be consistent with atomic force microscopy measurements for b thuringiensis kurstaki interacting with planar surfaces in aqueous solutions chung et al 2014 if the nap roughness and acid base interactions are accounted for they are expected to lower the energy barrier wu et al 2018 chen et al 2010 a harmonic oscillator model has also been implemented to describe how bacteria with fibrillar tethers couple to surfaces van der westen et al 2018 exploring these newer modeling techniques and accounting for extended forces not included in traditional dlvo modeling is an essential area of future investigations to better understand the fate and transport of high risk pathogens but require advanced imaging and analytical techniques to quantify the spacing and conformation of spore structures outside the scope of this paper and in many cases are very challenging to perform on these sample types without modifying the surfaces the classic dlvo modeling results predicted that the presence of an energy barrier was sensitive to ph and ionic strength conditions in the baseline water across tested combinations of water urban material and spore type dugway b globigii consistently had the highest energy barrier likely due to its processing but with modifications of i and or ph adhesion or washoff can be promoted while water characteristics caused subtle changes in the spore s surface properties the modeling results suggested the dominant mechanism controlling adhesion was the charge neutralization reactions of concrete and asphalt urban materials in the runoff water this is consistent with literature documenting that nom alters the charge of metal oxide surfaces zhang et al 2009 the modeling results predicted that under stormwater conditions there was a barrier to attachment detachment at all ph spore and material combinations since the runoff water did not notably change the b thuringiensis kurstaki zeta potentials and b globigii became less not more electronegative the presence of an energy barrier was attributable to the surface reactions with the concrete and asphalt because the highest predicted energy barrier existed between the dugway b globigii and concrete in stormwater runoff we expect this would be the most difficult combination to remove through wetting by rain or by washing the surface with a hose if spores were already attached 5 conclusion the laboratory data collected in this study demonstrated that the runoff water composition equalizes the surface charge differences between different surrogates for b anthracis and drastically changes the surface charge characteristics of urban materials from a surface charge perspective these findings provide greater flexibility in selecting a surrogate microorganism to use in field and laboratory studies focused on stormwater transport since the nom salts and metals found in runoff water coat the spores and therefore exert a more dominant control on spore adhesion processes than the surface properties of the spores themselves the laboratory results are useful building blocks in the application of models that theorize how to remove pathogenic spores from the surface of materials classic dlvo modeling predicts that stormwater constituents could make the removal of spores from these surfaces by water more challenging and reinforce that surface differences between concrete and asphalt have a bigger impact on spore adhesion than variations in spore strain testing these predictions is an area of active research in the homeland security research program at the u s environmental protection agency epa ongoing experiments are being performed measuring the washoff of both types of spores from concrete and asphalt coupons using a rainfall simulator this study coupled with ongoing washoff experiments provides information to aid in modeling the spread of biological
