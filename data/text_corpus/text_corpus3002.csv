15010,the presence of cylindrospermopsin cyn a potent cyanotoxin in drinking water sources poses a tremendous risk to humans and the environment detailed kinetic studies herein demonstrate ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi mediated oxidation of cyn and the model compound 6 hydroxymethyl uracil 6 homu lead to their effective degradation under neutral and alkaline solution ph a transformation product analysis indicated oxidation of the uracil ring which has functionality critical to the toxicity of cyn the oxidative cleavage of the c5 c6 double bond resulted in fragmentation of the uracil ring amide hydrolysis is a contributing pathway leading to the fragmentation of the uracil ring under extended treatment hydrolysis and extensive oxidation lead to complete destruction of the uracil ring skeleton resulting in the generation of a variety of products including nontoxic cylindrospermopsic acid the elisa biological activity of the cyn product mixtures produced during fe vi treatment parallels the concentration of cyn these results suggest the products do not possess elisa biological activity at the concentrations produced during treatment the fe vi mediated degradation was also effective in the presence of humic acid and unaffected by the presence of common inorganic ions under our experimental conditions the fe vi remediation of cyn and uracil based toxins appears a promising drinking water treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate oxidation toxin mechanism biological activity humic acid data availability data will be made

drinking water supply is a serious environmental issue yilmaz et al 2022 gągała borowska et al 2022 global warming and eutrophication have contributed to more frequent hab events xu et al 2021 noteworthy is the incident of habs in the public water sources in toledo where more than 400 000 residents were deemed at risk due to a hab event and presence of cyanotoxins in the treated water of the water treatment plan davis et al 2015 cyanobacteria can produce a variety of potent toxins and pose a tremendous risk to humans wildlife and the environment rasuli et al 2022 vione and rosario ortiz 2021 among the most problematic cyanotoxins is cylindrospermopsin cyn an alkaloid with uracil ring tricyclic guanidine and sulfate group fig 1 the presence of cyn has been primarily limited to warm weather regions however the occurrences of cyn may extend to more temperate regions in europe such as italy germany and france de la cruz et al 2013 scarlett et al 2020 cyn has been shown to be genotoxic and carcinogenic and has been reported to cause damage of main target organs including the liver kidneys thymus lungs and adrenal glands yilmaz et al 2022 de la cruz et al 2013 yang et al 2021 the toxic activity of cyn partly results from the uracil moiety which inhibits protein translation or binds to dna to cause strand breakage banker et al 2001 the most notorious cyn poisoning incident occurred on palm island australia in 1979 resulting in hepatoenteritis in 138 children and 10 adults griffiths and saker 2003 with the increasing global need for clean water identification of sustainable treatment processes for eliminating naturally occurring cyanotoxins from drinking water is critical conventional water treatment methods such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration are often ineffective and or require secondary treatments for removal of cyanotoxins de la cruz et al 2013 yang et al 2021 activated carbon has been shown to be effective for the removal of cyanotoxins merel et al 2013 however treatment of large volumes of contaminated waters with high natural organic matter nom contents are time consuming and not economically applicable abbas et al 2020 a variety of chemical oxidants have been reported for remediation of cyanotoxins such as chlorine ozone and permanganate laszakovits and mackay 2019 rodríguez et al 2007 onstad et al 2007 but may lead to by products with serious environmental impacts zamyadi et al 2012 advanced oxidation processes aops have been shown to be effective for the degradation of cyanotoxins zhang et al 2015a he et al 2014 schneider et al 2022 aops involve hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation as the predominant degradation process but can suffer from the non selective nature of hydroxyl radical a limited number of

environmentally friendly method for remediating a wide variety of pollutants sharma et al 2022 zheng et al 2020 zhang and jiang 2021 rougé et al 2022 yngard et al 2008 pan et al 2022 tian et al 2022 liu et al 2022 fe vi offers distinct advantages over other chemical oxidants used to treat water because by products are iron oxides which are ubiquitous in natural waters jiang et al 2015 spellman et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 in addition these iron oxides may act to agglomerate biomass associated with hab and to sorb toxic metals and phosphate prucek et al 2013 lee et al 2009 sharma et al 2017 the current paper gives the first detailed report on the degradation of cyn by fe vi the present paper has the following aims i determine the kinetics of fe vi reactions of cyn and its model compound 6

high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol were purchased from fisher scientific the humic acid was obtained from fluka all reagents were used as received the model compound 6 hydroxymethyl uracil was synthesized according to standard organic functional group transformations adamski et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 potassium ferrate k2feo4 of high purity 98 was prepared using a wet method sharma 2011 fe vi solutions were prepared by adding to 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm na2b4o7 10 h2o buffer at ph 9 0 luo et al 2011 all aqueous solutions were prepared with millipore filtered water 2 2 kinetic measurements kinetic experiments were conducted at room temperature using pseudo first order conditions with fe vi 40 50 0 μm 6 homu or cyn 2 0 μm samples were collected at specific time intervals and then immediately quenched with hydroxylamine before subjecting to analyses by hplc the hydroxylamine concentration employed was in large excess 20 times higher compared to fe vi concentrations to ensure prompt and extensive quenching of fe vi the fe vi concentration was measured by a colorimetric method lee et al 2005 at specific time intervals with 6 homu concentration the second order rate constants of fe vi with cyn and 6 homu were determined using the method described by hu hu et al 2009 details in results section in the ph range of 7 0 9 5 the solution ph was controlled using a phosphate buffer solution 2 3 analysis of cylindrospermopsin and identification of oxidation products the concentration of cyn was monitored by hplc varian prostar equipped with a prostar 410 autosampler and a prostar 335 photodiode array detector under the following conditions a luna rp c18 column 5 μm 250 4 6 mm 50 μl injection volume and 1 0 ml min flow rate the mobile phase consisted of a linear gradient starting at 5 methanol 95 water increased to 60 methanol in 6 min and then held constant for an additional 5 min the detection wavelength was at 262 nm 6 homu concentration was monitored using a modified hplc analytical method zhao et al 2014 in the experiments to identify oxidized products of cyn 15 0 μm cyn was mixed with 50 0 μm fe vi the analyses of cyn and the degradation products were carried out at ph 8 0 using an agilent 1200 lc coupled to an agilent 6530 high resolution accurate mass quadrupole time of flight q tof mass spectrometer lc qtof ms the samples were separated on an agilent zobax eclipse plus c 18 rapid resolution hd 3 0 100 mm 1 8 micron particle size equipped with a guard column 3 0 5 mm of the same packing material the mobile phase consisted of a 2 acetonitrile 0 2 acetic acid in h2o and b 2 h2o 0 2 acetic acid in acetonitrile with a gradient elution of 5 b for 1 min followed by a linear increase to 95 b in 10 0 min back

and analysis were performed using the agilent mass hunter software version b 05 0 2 4 biological activity measurements abraxis enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits were used to measure cyn biological activity following manufacture s instruction abraxis llc warminster pa usa the cyn elisa is an immunoassay for the quantitative and sensitive detection of cyn in water samples at ng ml 1 levels elisa involves cyn antibodies binding with second specific antibodies to generate color signal measured at 450 nm chen et al 2015 to be specific cyn and cyn hrp conjugate compete for the binding sites of rabbit anti cyn antibodies the anti cylindrospermopsin antibodies are then bound by a second antibody goat anti rabbit immobilized on the wells of the microtiter plate a color signal is produced after a washing step and the addition of substrate solution the color of the unknown sample is compared to the color of the calibrators and the cyn concentration of the sample is derived the blue color intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of cylindrospermopsin present in the sample in our study the calibration range was from 0 05 to 2 ng ml 1 cyn with ic50 concentration of 0 17 ng ml 1 samples showing a lower concentration than 0 05 ng ml 1 of cyn were considered to be negative a similar procedure was used in our previous study jiang et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics study the initial reaction between fe vi and cyn under or near stoichiometric conditions can be represented as a bimolecular reaction eq 1 the reactions kinetics for the reaction of fe vi with cyn was studied under pseudo first order conditions in which fe vi cyn the second order rate constants for the reaction of cyn and fe vi were determined using the dependence of the observed pseudo first order rate constant as a function of cyn eq 2 1 d cyn d t k 2 fe vi cyn 2 ln cyn 0 cyn t k 2 0 t f e v i d t fe vi exposure which is the integral of fe vi concentration over time the plot of ln cyn 0 cyn t versus the fe vi exposure shown in fig sm 1 in the plot of fig sm 1 ct mgfe min l is the time integrated exposure to fe vi as the reaction proceeded t 0 fe vi d t hu et al 2012 the slope of the plot the bimolecular rate constant k 2 3 8 0 10 101 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 a similar approach was applied to study the reaction between fe vi and 6 homu fig sm 1 the second order rate constant of 6 homu and fe vi was obtained as 1 12 0 08 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 next the second order rate constants k obs for the reactions of fe vi with cyn and 6 homu as a function of ph were determined fig 2 and table sm 1 in general the values of k of individual reactions of fe vi with cyn and 6 homu decrease with the increase of ph this is consistent with results of previous studies yngard et al 2008 tian et al 2022 karlesa et al 2014 results of fig 2 may be interpreted using the speciation of fe vi h3feo4 h h2feo4 pk a1 1 9 rush et al 1996 h2feo4 h hfeo4 pk a2 3 5 carr 2008 hfeo4 h feo4 2 pk a3 7 23 sharma et al 2001 and cyn o4s cyn nh uracil h o4s cyn n uracil pk a 8 8 onstad et al 2007 and homu nh h homu n pk a 9 27 privat and sowers 1996 fig 1 based on the pk a of fe vi h3feo4 and h2feo4 species may not be involved in the reactivity of fe vi with cyn or 6 homu under solution ph employed in our studies hence four possible reactions 3 6 were considered in describing the trend seen in fig 2 3 hfeo4 o4s cyn nh uracil fe iii ops 4 hfeo4 o4s cyn n uracil fe iii ops 5 feo4 2 o4s cyn nh uracil fe iii ops 6 feo4 2 o4s cyn n uracil fe iii ops the following model may be used for the reactivity of fe vi with cyn in fig 2 eq 7 7 k fe vi tot cyn tot σ k ij α i β j fe vi tot cyn tot i 1 2 j 1 2 where fe vi tot hfeo4 feo4 2 and cyn tot o4s cyn nh uracil o4s cyn n uracil α i and β j represent the species distribution coefficients for fe vi i e for hfeo4 and feo4 2 and cyn i e for o4s cyn nh uracil and o4s cyn n uracil respectively and i and j represent each of the two species of fe vi and each of the two species of cyn respectively the distribution coefficients were calculated as follows α hfeo4 h h 10 7 23 α feo4 2 10 7 23 h 10 7 23 β o4s cyn nh uracil h h 10 9 27 and β o4s cyn n uracil 10 9 27 h 10 9 27 of the possible four reactions involved in reactions of fe vi with cyn i e reactions 3 6 only reactions 3 4 and 5 were needed to reasonably fit the experimental data a solid line in fig 2 the addition of reaction 6 in the model did not statistically improve the fitting of the experimental data the estimated rate constants for the reactivity of hfeo4 and feo4 2 with cyn obtained from the non linear regression fitting of the experimental values of rate constants are presented in table 1 the same approach was applied to fit the rate constants of the reactions between fe vi with 6 tomu a solid line in fig 2 and the calculated species specific rate constants are reported in table 1 the protonated fe vi species hfeo4 reacted much faster than the deprotonated species feo4 2 with o4s cyn nh uracil or 6 homu nh the results are consistent with previous reports on the influence of ph of fe vi transformation of organic compounds hu et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 kim et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 the shift in speciation of the hfeo4 to the less reactive feo4 2 with increasing ph caused the observed decrease in the rate constants with increasing ph see fig 2 the values of k at ph 8 0 given in table 1 were calculated using the model i e eq 7 in which the reactions 3 5 were considered the reactivity of fe vi with cyn is compared with other oxidants associated with potential and or current water treatments including permanganate mno4 chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide clo2 ozone o3 and hydroxyl radical oh table 1 the calculated half lives t1 2 at oxidant dosages of 1 0 mg l 1 ph 8 0 are also presented in table 1 the reaction of permanganate with cyn is very slow ineffective while the second order rate constant was reported to be independent of ph rodríguez et al 2007 another study also showed that permanganate was not able to degrade cyn cheng et al 2009 oxidation of cyn with chlorine dioxide is a slow process t1 2 14 4 h chloramine has a relatively low oxidation potential and thus slow reactivity towards cyn table 1 rodríguez et al 2007 chlorine can effectively oxidize cyn with t1 2 1 7 min ozone is highly reactive with cyn with second order rate constant that is orders of magnitude faster than those reported for fe vi and chlorine the trend in rate constants for ozone was also opposite to the reactions of cyn with fe vi and chlorine i e generally increase with increase in ph in the alkaline medium rodríguez et al 2007 ozone can react with the uracil and amine functionalities in cyn onstad et al 2007 the highly reactive non selective hydroxyl radical oh exhibits the highest reactivity with cyn primarily via attack of the uracil ring accounting for 84 of the initial degradation song et al 2012 however the steady state concentration of oh is very low under the reaction conditions see table 1 and degradation of cyn is relatively slow because of the dependence on the concentration of oh during aops zhang et al 2015a fotiou et al 2015 3 2 oxidized products ops cyn possesses a number of functional groups susceptible to oxidative attack by fe vi a number of ops were observed in the oxidation of cyn by fe vi fig sm 2 the ops seen in our study are similar with several other studies dealing with aops also similar pathways of cyn degradation using aops he et al 2014 chen et al 2015 2015 hao et al 2020 the characteristic fragmentation patterns in the tandem ms ms spectrum were used to support the presence of specific structural features in the transformation products cyn exhibited the characteristic fragmentation pattern of m z 416 336 318 274 194 176 as previously reported guzmán guillén et al 2012 fig sm 2 the fragment ions at m z 336 and 318 resulted from the loss of sulfate group 80 da with a subsequent loss of h2o 18 da the fragment ion at m z 274 was assigned to the loss of hydroxymethyl uracil group 142 da the fragment ions at m z 194 and 176 corresponded to the loss of sulfate group 80 da and h2o 18 da from the fragment ion at m z 274 overall fe vi attacks the electron rich c5 c6 double bond and nitrogen atoms of the uracil rings of cyn and 6 homu fig 1 comparatively product studies on the degradation of cyn by aops have shown that the uracil ring is the predominant reaction site with the initial products including hydroxylated ring products and oxidation of the hydroxyl methylene group to the ketone de la cruz et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a he et al 2014 song et al 2012 3 3 plausible reaction pathways based on the assignment of the ops the intermediates and reaction pathways are proposed in scheme 1 the reaction of fe vi with cyn is initiated by electrophilic attack at the unsaturated double bond c5 c6 the formation of a cyclic ester from a 3 2 electrocyclic addition of fe vi to the double bond is proposed as a reaction pathway hu et al 2009 this pathway leads to the formation of product p448 m z 448 with key observed fragments of m z 368 and 350 the hydrolysis of the c6 o n1h group in the uracil ring is assigned to the observed product p350 m z 350 cylindrospermopsic acid song et al 2012 merel et al 2010 fe vi can undergo electron abstraction at the carboxylate anion in cylindrospermopsic acid m z 350 leading to loss of co2 and subsequent hydrolysis to product p322 m z 322 fe vi has been reported to selectively oxidize alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes ketones lee and gai 1993 in our study the product p322 can be oxidized to the aldehyde product p304 m z 304 abstraction of a proton from p304 r cho can result in oxidation to product p320 m z 320 although the products p322 and p304 were not observed under our experimental conditions the detected product p320 is in agreement with the proposed degradation pathway based on known functional group transformations the observed p375 m z 375 product is assigned to the hydrolysis of the urea functional group nhconh in the uracil moiety this ring opened product can be transformed to product p320 by subsequent oxidation processes hydrolysis of the urea groups has been observed during fe vi oxidation of carbamazepine hu et al 2009 and acid hydrolysis of phenylurea in previous studies o connor and barnett 1973 the reaction pathways proposed in scheme 1 are analogous to uv h2o2 initiated degradation of cyn he et al 2014 decarboxylation and hydrolysis of product p320 yields product p292 m z 292 which upon further oxidation yields ketone product p290 m z 290 we observed two ions with m z 292 and the same mass fragments of 292 212 194 in our study consistent with previous findings of tio2 photocatalytic degradation of cyn zhang et al 2015b the ring opening processes lead to the transformation of m z 292a to m z 292b sheu and foote 1995 garrison 1987 garrison et al 1970 the retention time of m z 292a on c18 non polar column was slightly longer than m z 292b which indicates the product structure with m z 292a was less polar than that of the m z 292b product this observation is rationalized from the contribution of hydroxyl group on c8 leading to a less polar product m z 292a as previously reported zhang et al 2015b 3 4 detoxification analysis of ops a limited number of studies have been reported on the assessment of the biological activity of cyn oxidation products and product mixtures chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b our product studies demonstrated the fe vi mediated oxidation of cyn primarily occurs on the uracil moiety and predominantly leads to open ring products since the toxicity of the products and product mixtures is unknown it is important to assess the biological activity as a function of the fe vi mediated degradation in order to evaluate the environmental and health risks of degradation products a calibration curve in the elisa measurements for b b0 as a function of the cyn standards is shown in fig sm 3 b and b0 represent the numbers at time t and zero time the b b0 for each standard was calculated by dividing the mean absorbance value for each standard by the average absorbance of zero standard the calibration curve was from 0 05 to 2 0 ng ml 1 cyn with ic50 i e ic is defined as the concentration of antigen that blocks 50 of the anti body binding to immobilized antigen concentration of 0 17 ng ml 1 samples showing a lower concentration than 0 05 ng ml 1 of cyn were considered to be negative the samples taken following specific fe vi doses were subjected to parallel analysis by hplc and elisa the samples were diluted 500 fold to make sure that the residual cyn concentration was within the range of the calibration curve for elisa measurements as shown in fig 3 fe vi treatment significantly decreased the biological activities of cyn product mixture which paralleled the cyn concentration as determined by hplc the biological activity concentration determined by elisa was not higher than the cyn concentration determined by hplc indicating that based on the product studies the initially formed intermediates were uracil ring open products with less toxicity than cyn which is consistent with our elisa studies up to 96 of the biological activity was removed following fe vi treatment for 120 min the minimal activity detected at 120 min by elisa is at the detection limit of the calibration curve and was considered to be insignificant the completed degradation of cyn was also obtained as shown in fig sm 4 under fe vi treatment our observations suggest that fe vi treatment can readily degrade cyn and subsequent oxidation products do not exhibit significant biological activity after the treatment similar results were observed with another cyanotoxin mc lr in which fe vi was also able to degrade it by attacking the double bond jiang et al 2014 sharma et al 2017 a moiety usually associated with the toxicity of mc lr 3 5 removal study fe vi treatment of cyn was also evaluated in the presence of no3 cl na and ca2 ions at ph 7 0 the results indicate that the presence of no3 cl na and ca2 ions had no measurable effects on cyn removal efficiency over a concentration range of 0 20 mg l 1 fig 4 a the removal efficiency was largely unaffected by these inorganic ions present in water our results are in agreement with previous studies on the removal of micropollutants by fe vi feng et al 2016 luo et al 2019 dissolved organic matter dom derived from the decomposed biomass is composed of large carbon based structures and is widely present in natural environment effects of water quality on cyn removal were studied using buffer solution at ph 7 0 the influence of dissolved organic matter dom was conducted using humic acid ha the concentration of ha was varied from 0 to 20 mg l 1 the cyn removal percentage was 40 using 40 0 μm fe vi at ph 7 0 fig 4b shows that the cyn removal efficiency decreased when ha concentration increased similar observation was also reported in the effect of humic acid on fe vi treatment of microcystin lr jiang et al 2014 the added amount of fe vi was consumed by competing reaction with humic acid to observe decrease in efficiency of the removal of cyn effects of water samples on cyn removal were also studied by spiking cyn into the water samples which were collected from different locations from lake harsha ohio shown in table sm 2 water samples named as efls buoy and emb were collected from the surface water water sample named as efld was obtained in the same latitude and longitude as efls sample but taken at approximately 25 ft below the surface as shown in fig sm 5 cyn can be completely degraded in di water after 2 0 h treatment using 50 0 μm fe vi at ph 8 0 however under same treatment conditions cyn removal percentages decreased to 40 60 in the real water samples likely due to dom present in these water samples shown in fig 4b application of activated fe vi may decrease the amount of the oxidant dosage needed to remove cyn sharma et al 2022 spellman et al 2022 4 conclusions the second order rate constants for the reaction of fe vi with cyn and a model compound 6 homu decrease with increase in ph the species specific rate constants for the oxidation of cyn by fe vi using the species of fe vi and target toxins could explain the trend of decreasing rates with increase in ph the results of degradation kinetics clearly demonstrated that cyn can be degraded by fe vi within minutes the identified oxidized products showed the attack on toxic uracil moiety of cyn by fe vi elisa test suggested complete elimination of biological activity of cyn by fe vi the presence of dissolved organic matter dom may decrease the degradation of cyn by fe vi and higher dose of fe vi would be required than water in absence of dom in order to completely remove cyn in natural waters the activated ferrate that involves highly reactive iron v and iron iv may also be applied to improve the removal efficiency of cyn declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

biological activity following manufacture s instruction abraxis llc warminster pa usa the cyn elisa is an immunoassay for the quantitative and sensitive detection of cyn in water samples at ng ml 1 levels elisa involves cyn antibodies binding with second specific antibodies to generate color signal measured at 450 nm chen et al 2015 to be specific cyn and cyn hrp conjugate compete for the binding sites of rabbit anti cyn antibodies the anti cylindrospermopsin antibodies are then bound by a second antibody goat anti rabbit immobilized on the wells of the microtiter plate a color signal is produced after a washing step and the addition of substrate solution the color of the unknown sample is compared to the color of the calibrators and the cyn concentration of the sample is derived the blue color intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of cylindrospermopsin present in the sample in our study the calibration range was from 0 05 to 2 ng ml 1 cyn with ic50 concentration of 0 17 ng ml 1 samples showing a lower concentration than 0 05 ng ml 1 of cyn were considered to be negative a similar procedure was used in our previous study jiang et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics study the initial reaction between fe vi and cyn under or near stoichiometric conditions can be represented as a bimolecular reaction eq 1 the reactions kinetics for the reaction of fe vi with cyn was studied under pseudo first order conditions in which fe vi cyn the second order rate constants for the reaction of cyn and fe vi were determined using the dependence of the observed pseudo first order rate constant as a function of cyn eq 2 1 d cyn d t k 2 fe vi cyn 2 ln cyn 0 cyn t k 2 0 t f e v i d t fe vi exposure which is the integral of fe vi concentration over

al 2012 the slope of the plot the bimolecular rate constant k 2 3 8 0 10 101 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 a similar approach was applied to study the reaction between fe vi and 6 homu fig sm 1 the second order rate constant of 6 homu and fe vi was obtained as 1 12 0 08 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 next the second order rate constants k obs for the reactions of fe vi with cyn and 6 homu as a function of ph were determined fig 2 and table sm 1 in general the values of k of individual reactions of fe vi with cyn and 6 homu decrease with the increase of ph this is consistent with results of previous studies yngard et al 2008 tian et al 2022 karlesa et al 2014 results of fig 2 may be interpreted using the speciation of fe vi h3feo4 h h2feo4 pk a1 1 9 rush et al 1996 h2feo4 h hfeo4 pk a2 3 5 carr 2008

vi h3feo4 and h2feo4 species may not be involved in the reactivity of fe vi with cyn or 6 homu under solution ph employed in our studies hence four possible reactions 3 6 were considered in describing the trend seen in fig 2 3 hfeo4 o4s cyn nh uracil fe iii ops 4 hfeo4 o4s cyn n uracil fe iii ops 5 feo4 2 o4s cyn nh uracil fe iii ops 6 feo4 2 o4s cyn n uracil fe iii ops the following model may be used for the reactivity of fe vi with cyn in fig 2 eq 7 7 k fe vi tot cyn tot σ k ij α i β j fe vi tot cyn tot i 1 2 j 1 2 where fe vi tot hfeo4 feo4 2 and cyn tot o4s cyn nh uracil o4s cyn n uracil α i and β j represent the species distribution coefficients for fe vi i e for hfeo4 and feo4 2 and cyn i e for o4s cyn nh uracil and o4s cyn n uracil respectively and i and j represent each of the two species of fe vi and each of the two species of cyn respectively the distribution coefficients were calculated as follows α hfeo4 h h 10 7 23 α feo4 2 10 7 23 h 10 7 23 β o4s cyn nh uracil h h 10 9 27 and β o4s cyn n uracil 10 9 27 h 10 9 27 of the possible four reactions involved in reactions of fe vi with cyn i e reactions 3 6 only reactions 3 4 and 5 were needed to reasonably fit the experimental data a solid line in fig 2 the addition of reaction 6 in the model did not statistically improve the fitting of the experimental data the estimated rate constants for the reactivity of hfeo4 and feo4 2 with cyn obtained from the non linear regression fitting of the experimental values of rate constants are presented in table 1 the same approach was applied to fit the rate constants of the reactions between fe vi with 6 tomu a solid line in fig 2 and the calculated species specific rate constants are reported in table 1 the protonated fe vi species hfeo4 reacted much faster than the deprotonated species feo4 2 with o4s cyn nh uracil or 6 homu nh the results are consistent with previous reports on the influence of ph of fe vi transformation of organic compounds hu et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 kim et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 the shift in speciation of the hfeo4 to the less reactive feo4 2 with increasing ph caused the observed decrease in the rate constants with increasing ph see fig 2 the values of k at ph 8 0 given in table 1 were calculated using the model i e eq 7 in which the reactions 3 5 were considered the reactivity of fe vi with cyn is compared with other oxidants associated with potential and or current water treatments including permanganate mno4 chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide clo2 ozone o3 and hydroxyl radical oh table 1 the calculated half lives t1 2 at oxidant dosages of 1 0 mg l 1 ph 8 0 are also presented in table 1 the reaction of permanganate with cyn is very slow ineffective while the second order rate constant was reported to be independent of ph rodríguez et al 2007 another study also showed that permanganate was not able to degrade cyn cheng et al 2009 oxidation of cyn with chlorine dioxide is a slow process t1 2 14 4 h chloramine has a relatively low oxidation potential and thus slow reactivity towards cyn table 1 rodríguez et al 2007 chlorine can effectively oxidize cyn with t1 2 1 7 min ozone is highly reactive with cyn with second order rate constant that is orders of magnitude faster than those reported for fe vi and chlorine the trend in rate constants for ozone was also opposite to the reactions of cyn with fe vi and chlorine i e generally increase with increase in ph in the alkaline medium rodríguez et al 2007 ozone can react with the uracil and amine functionalities in cyn onstad et al 2007 the highly reactive non selective hydroxyl radical oh exhibits the highest reactivity with cyn primarily via attack of the uracil ring accounting for 84 of the initial degradation song et al 2012 however the steady state concentration of oh is very low under the reaction conditions see table 1 and degradation of cyn is relatively slow because of the dependence on the concentration of oh during aops zhang et al 2015a fotiou et al 2015 3 2 oxidized products ops cyn possesses a number of functional groups susceptible to oxidative attack by fe vi a number of ops were observed in the oxidation of cyn by fe vi fig sm 2 the ops seen in our study are similar with several other studies dealing with aops also similar pathways of cyn degradation using aops he et al 2014 chen et al 2015 2015 hao et al 2020 the characteristic fragmentation patterns in the tandem ms ms spectrum were used to support the presence of specific structural features in the transformation products cyn exhibited the characteristic fragmentation pattern of m z 416 336 318 274 194 176 as previously reported guzmán guillén et al 2012 fig sm 2 the fragment ions at m z 336 and 318 resulted from the loss of sulfate group 80 da with a subsequent loss of h2o 18 da the fragment ion at m z 274 was assigned to the loss of hydroxymethyl uracil group 142 da the fragment ions at m z 194 and 176 corresponded to the loss of sulfate group 80 da and h2o 18 da from the fragment ion at m z 274 overall fe vi attacks the electron rich c5 c6 double bond and nitrogen atoms of the uracil rings of cyn and 6 homu fig 1 comparatively product studies on the degradation of cyn by aops have shown that the uracil ring is the predominant reaction site with the initial products including hydroxylated ring products and oxidation of the hydroxyl methylene group to the ketone de la cruz et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a he et al 2014 song et al 2012 3 3 plausible reaction pathways based on the assignment of the ops the intermediates and reaction pathways are proposed in scheme 1 the reaction of fe vi with cyn is initiated by electrophilic attack at the unsaturated double bond c5 c6 the formation of a cyclic ester from a 3 2 electrocyclic addition of fe vi to the double bond is proposed as a reaction pathway hu et al 2009 this pathway leads to the formation of product p448 m z 448 with key observed fragments of m z 368 and 350 the hydrolysis of the c6 o n1h group in the uracil ring is assigned to the observed product p350 m z 350 cylindrospermopsic acid song et al 2012 merel et al 2010 fe vi can undergo electron abstraction at the carboxylate anion in cylindrospermopsic acid m z 350 leading to loss of co2 and subsequent hydrolysis to product p322 m z 322 fe vi has been reported to selectively oxidize alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes ketones lee and gai 1993 in our study the product p322 can be oxidized to the aldehyde product p304 m z 304 abstraction of a proton from p304 r cho can result in oxidation to product p320 m z 320 although the products p322 and p304 were not observed under our experimental conditions the detected product p320 is in agreement with the proposed degradation pathway based on known functional group transformations the observed p375 m z 375 product is assigned to the hydrolysis of the urea functional group nhconh in the uracil moiety this ring opened product can be transformed to product p320 by subsequent oxidation processes hydrolysis of the urea groups has been observed during fe vi oxidation of carbamazepine hu et al 2009 and acid hydrolysis of phenylurea in previous studies o connor and barnett 1973 the reaction pathways proposed in scheme 1 are analogous to uv h2o2 initiated degradation of cyn he et al 2014 decarboxylation and hydrolysis of product p320 yields product p292 m z 292 which upon further oxidation yields ketone product p290 m z 290 we observed two ions with m z 292 and the same mass fragments of 292 212 194 in our study consistent with previous findings of tio2 photocatalytic degradation of cyn zhang et al 2015b the ring opening processes lead to the transformation of m z 292a to m z 292b sheu and foote 1995 garrison 1987 garrison et al 1970 the retention time of m z 292a on c18 non polar column was slightly longer than m z 292b which indicates the product structure with m z 292a was less polar than that of the m z 292b product this observation is rationalized from the contribution of hydroxyl group on c8 leading to a less polar product m z 292a as previously reported zhang et al 2015b 3 4 detoxification analysis of ops a limited number of studies have been reported on the assessment of the biological activity of cyn oxidation products and product mixtures chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b our product studies demonstrated the fe vi mediated oxidation of cyn primarily occurs on the uracil moiety and predominantly leads to open ring products since the toxicity of the products and product mixtures is unknown it is important to assess the biological activity as a function of the fe vi mediated degradation in order to evaluate the environmental and health risks of degradation products a calibration curve in the elisa measurements for b b0 as a function of the cyn standards is shown in fig sm 3 b and b0 represent the numbers at time t and zero time the b b0 for each standard was calculated by dividing the mean absorbance value for each standard by the average absorbance of zero standard the calibration curve was from 0 05 to 2 0 ng ml 1 cyn with ic50 i e ic is defined as the concentration of antigen that blocks 50 of the anti body binding to immobilized antigen concentration of 0 17 ng ml 1 samples showing a lower concentration than 0 05 ng ml 1 of cyn were considered to be negative the samples taken following specific fe vi doses were subjected to parallel analysis by hplc and elisa the samples were diluted 500 fold to make sure that the residual cyn concentration was within the range of the calibration curve for elisa measurements as shown in fig 3 fe vi treatment significantly decreased the biological activities of cyn product mixture which paralleled the cyn concentration as determined by hplc the biological activity concentration determined by elisa was not higher than the cyn concentration determined by hplc indicating that based on the product studies the initially formed intermediates were uracil ring open products with less toxicity than cyn which is consistent with our elisa studies up to 96 of the biological activity was removed following fe vi treatment for 120 min the minimal activity detected at 120 min by elisa is at the detection limit of the calibration curve and was considered to be insignificant the completed degradation of cyn was also obtained as shown in fig sm 4 under fe vi treatment our observations suggest that fe vi treatment can readily degrade cyn and subsequent oxidation products do not exhibit significant biological activity after the treatment similar results were observed with another cyanotoxin mc lr in which fe vi was also able to degrade it by attacking the double bond jiang et al 2014 sharma et al 2017 a moiety usually associated with the toxicity of mc lr 3 5 removal study fe vi treatment of cyn was also evaluated in the presence of no3 cl na and ca2 ions at ph 7 0 the results indicate that the presence of no3 cl na and ca2 ions had no measurable effects on cyn removal efficiency over a concentration range of 0 20 mg l 1 fig 4 a the removal efficiency was largely unaffected by these inorganic ions present in water our results are in agreement with previous studies on the removal of micropollutants by fe vi feng et al 2016 luo et al 2019 dissolved organic matter dom derived from the decomposed biomass is composed of large carbon based structures and is widely present in natural environment effects of water quality on cyn removal were studied using buffer solution at ph 7 0 the influence of dissolved organic matter dom was conducted using humic acid ha the concentration of ha was varied from 0 to 20 mg l 1 the cyn removal percentage was 40 using 40 0 μm fe vi at ph 7 0 fig 4b shows that the cyn removal efficiency decreased when ha concentration increased similar observation was also reported in the effect of humic acid on fe vi treatment of microcystin lr jiang et al 2014 the added amount of fe vi was consumed by competing reaction with humic acid to observe decrease in efficiency of the removal of cyn effects of water samples on cyn removal were also studied by spiking cyn into the water samples which were collected from different locations from lake harsha ohio shown in table sm 2 water samples named as efls buoy and emb were collected from the surface water water sample named as efld was obtained in the same latitude and longitude as efls sample but taken at approximately 25 ft below the surface as shown in fig sm 5 cyn can be completely degraded in di water after 2 0 h treatment using 50 0 μm fe vi at ph 8 0 however under same treatment conditions cyn removal percentages decreased to 40 60 in the real water samples likely due to dom present in these water samples shown in fig 4b application of activated fe vi may decrease the amount of the oxidant dosage needed to remove cyn sharma et al 2022 spellman et al 2022 4 conclusions the second order rate constants for the reaction of fe vi with cyn and a model compound 6 homu decrease with increase in ph the species specific rate constants for the oxidation of cyn by fe vi using the species of fe vi and target toxins could explain the trend of decreasing rates with increase in ph the results of degradation kinetics clearly demonstrated that cyn can be degraded by fe vi within minutes the identified oxidized products showed the attack on toxic uracil moiety of cyn by fe vi elisa test suggested complete elimination of biological activity of cyn by fe vi the presence of dissolved organic matter dom may decrease the degradation of cyn by fe vi and higher dose of fe vi would be required than water in absence of dom in order to completely remove cyn in natural waters the activated ferrate that involves highly reactive iron v and iron iv may also be applied to improve the removal efficiency of cyn declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15011,there is a growing interest to implement aerobic granular sludge ags in existing conventional activated sludge cas systems with a continuous flow through configuration the mode of anaerobic contact of raw sewage with the sludge is an important aspect in the adaptation of cas systems to accommodate ags it remains unclear how the distribution of substrate over the sludge by a conventional anaerobic selector compares to the distribution via bottom feeding applied in sequencing batch reactors sbrs this study investigated the effect of the anaerobic contact mode on the substrate and storage distribution by operating two lab scale sbrs one with the traditional bottom feeding through a settled sludge bed similar to full scale ags systems and one where the synthetic wastewater was fed as a pulse at the start of the anaerobic phase while the reactor was mixed through sparging of nitrogen gas mimicking a plug flow anaerobic selector in continuous flow through systems the distribution of the substrate over the sludge particle population was quantified via pha analysis combined with the obtained granule size distribution bottom feeding was found to primarily direct substrate towards the large granular size classes i e large volume and close to the bottom while completely mixed pulse feeding gives a more equal distribution of substrate over all granule sizes i e surface area dependant the anaerobic contact mode directly controls the substrate distribution over the different granule sizes irrespective of the solids retention time of a granule as an entity preferential feeding of the larger granules will enhance and stabilise the granulation compared to pulse feeding certainly under less advantageous conditions imposed by real sewage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerobic granular sludge pha bottom feeding pulse feeding anaerobic selector continuous flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a novel technology for compact treatment of wastewater applied mainly in sequencing batch reactors sbrs at full scale pronk et al 2015 there is a growing interest to implement ags in existing conventional activated sludge as systems mostly with a continuous flow through configuration kent et al 2018 winkler and van loosdrecht 2022 the increased settleability of ags compared to conventional as would allow for a higher mixed liquor suspended solids mlss for the same volumetric loading rate yielding an increase in biological treatment capacity simultaneous nutrient removal processes within the biofilms also could be utilized to a larger extent strubbe et al 2022 for a similar successful implementation of ags in conventional as systems the required selective pressures for the formation and retention of ags must be translated from the sbrs to continuous flow through systems the anaerobic storage of readily biodegradable cod rbcod as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas ensures dense growth of heterotrophic biomass during subsequent aeration by preventing transport limited growth de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 at full scale the fraction of rbcod in municipal wastewater is often limited and the more slowly biodegradable especially the particulate cod fraction has been hypothesized to result in flocculent growth under aerobic conditions layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015 ensuring that anaerobic storage of the limited rbcod is performed by the sludge fraction with the highest settling velocity speeds up the formation of granular sludge when starting from a flocculent morphology and results in a larger mean granule size van dijk et al 2022 the selection criterion for ags is therefore not only to ensure anaerobic uptake of rbcod and storage as phas but to concentrate the available rbcod in the best settling sludge fraction as well i e selective feeding in bottom fed sequencing batch reactors both criteria are automatically achieved since the best settling granules have a higher probability to accumulate at the bottom of the sludge bed in other reactor configurations particularly in continuous flow through reactors this might be more difficult to achieve the method of anaerobic contact of raw sewage with the sludge is an important aspect in the adaptation of continuous flow through activated sludge systems to accommodate ags continuous activated sludge systems designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal generally employ a plug flow anaerobic selector zone in which part of the recycled sludge is contacted with the influent while in suspension martins et al 2004 the applied loading rate mass of rbcod mass of sludge amount time aims to minimise diffusion gradients of rbcod inside the sludge flocs and the sludge loading mass of rbcod mass of sludge sets the amount of flocs over which the incoming rbcod is distributed these parameters respectively determine the initial penetration depth of rbcod and the total amount of stored cod per sludge particle floc resulting in relatively dense and well settling flocs wanner et al 1987 since the sludge is kept in suspension sludge particles with a larger surface area to volume ratio can achieve a higher volumetric rbcod uptake rate if the penetration depth is limited this favours a flocculent morphology over a granular morphology a higher initial concentration gradient of rbcod i e an increased loading rate can partially counteract the lower surface to volume ratio of granules compared to flocs due to full penetration of even the largest granules whether this can be achieved to such an extent that granules can be formed that are substantially larger than flocs likely depends on the fraction of rbcod compared to the total cod in the wastewater van dijk et al 2022 some full scale studies have investigated the relation between the design of an anaerobic selector and the sludge morphology with a focus on aerobic granulation redmond et al 2019 investigated the effect of the sludge settleability of a wwtp which had the flow pattern of the anaerobic selector converted from a tanks in series configuration to a step feed the characteristics of the sludge settleability were very similar to that of aerobic granular sludge in the tanks in series configuration with a svi5 svi30 ratio close to unity the ratio gradually increased after the transition to a more flocculent morphology in the step feed configuration these findings demonstrated the adverse effect of a decrease in initial rbcod loading and initial rbcod loading rate on the granular sludge morphology wei et al 2020 investigated the process conditions of several full scale conventional as facilities in the usa with varying levels of spontaneous granulation no correlation was found between the cod loading rate of the anaerobic selector and the level of granulation observed the rbcod loading rates were not reported the level of granulation did correlate strongly with the fraction of phosphate accumulating organisms paos found in the granular sludge fraction compared to the flocculent fraction indicative of an increased enrichment for anaerobic uptake of rbcod in the granular fraction it remains unclear how the distribution of substrate over the sludge by a conventional anaerobic selector compares to the distribution via bottom feeding applied in sbrs and how it impacts the granulation process the implementation of stable ags into existing continuous flow through wwtps thus requires further study on the impact of the anaerobic contact mode of sewage with sludge to investigate the effect of the anaerobic contact mode on the substrate and storage distribution the granulation potential the size distribution and related conversions we operated two lab scale sbrs one with the traditional bottom feeding through a settled sludge bed similar to full scale ags systems and one where the synthetic wastewater was fed as a pulse at the start of the anaerobic phase while the reactor was mixed by sparging of nitrogen gas the latter generates exposure of the sludge to a high substrate concentration at the start of the anaerobic period which gradually decreases to zero from a biological process view this can be considered a scaled down version of a plug flow anaerobic selector as employed in conventional as systems starting from flocculent sludge the formation of aerobic granular sludge was followed the effect of the contact method on the distribution of the substrate over the sludge particle population was quantified via pha analysis combined with the granule size distribution the interactions between the anaerobic contact mode and aerobic conversion processes were investigated implications for application in continuous systems and the nutrient removal process are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two cylindrical lab scale reactors i e one pulse fed one bottom fed each with a working volume of 3 l during aeration and an aspect ratio of 20 were operated as a sequential batch reactor with a volume exchange ratio of 0 47 the reactors were operated continuously in 205 min cycles during 144 days after settling and discharge of effluent the working volume of the reactor was 1 6 l a cycle started with an anaerobic phase in which synthetic wastewater was fed a different anaerobic contact mode was used in each reactor the pulse fed reactor was first sparged with dinitrogen gas 5 min with 5 l min 1 superficial gas velocity of 3 5 cm s 1 to deplete the bulk liquid of dissolved oxygen the batch of synthetic wastewater was then fed while sparging and mixing continued 2 min the pulse fed reactor was subsequently mixed with dinitrogen gas for the remainder of the anaerobic phase 53 min for the bottom fed reactor synthetic wastewater was fed through the bottom of the settled sludge bed with a superficial liquid velocity of 0 46 m h 1 60 min the remainder of the cycles were identical for both reactors an aeration phase maximum duration of 137 min a settling period minimum duration of 3 min and finally the discharge of effluent 1 min and a waiting phase to allow packing of the sludge bed 4 min all sludge unable to meet the settleability criterion was discharged with the effluent during start up the settling period started at 30 min at the expense of the aeration phase and was gradually decreased to 5 min while maintaining a constant total cycle duration the temperature was controlled at 20 1 c through the double jacketed reactor wall using a water bath with thermostat the ph was controlled during aeration and during the mixed anaerobic phase of the pulse fed reactor at 7 0 0 1 by dosage of either a 1 m solution of hydrochloric acid or a 1 m sodium hydroxide solution a conductivity sensor was used to monitor the anaerobic release and aerobic removal of ortho phosphate weissbrodt et al 2014 during aeration a recirculation gas flow was maintained at 6 l min 1 superficial gas velocity of 4 2 cm s 1 a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mg l 1 was maintained during the aeration phase via addition of compressed air or dinitrogen gas using mass flow controllers the total organic loading rate 1 12 g cod l 1 d 1 was kept constant over the course of the study granular sludge previously enriched under the same conditions as applied in the bottom fed reactor and with the same synthetic influent was used as inoculum the inoculum was crushed using an ultra turrax homogenizer t 18 ika staufen im breisgau germany after which the sieve fraction between 63 µm and 100 µm added to both reactors to yield an initial mlss concentration of 0 5 g l 1 2 2 composition of synthetic wastewater a synthetic wastewater of 1 4 l per cycle was used as anaerobic feed and consisted of 1 2 l of deionized water together with 100 ml carbon source medium a and 100 ml nitrogen and phosphorous source medium b medium a contained 65 6 mm nach3coo 3h2o 4 1 mm mgso4 7h2o and 5 4 mm kcl medium b contained 15 mm nh4cl 1 3 mm k2hpo4 2 1 mm kh2po4 and 16 6 ml l 1 trace elements solution vishniac and santer 1957 but using 2 2 mg l 1 znso4 7h2o instead of 22 mg l 1 pronk et al 2015 the combination of medium a medium b and tap water led to a synthetic wastewater composition of 300 mg cod l 1 15 mg nh4 n l 1 and 7 5 mg po4 3 p l 1 allylthiourea atu 5 mg l 1 synthetic wastewater was dosed to suppress nitrification this enabled the calculation of biomass yield directly from the consumption of ammonium and ensured anaerobic conditions at the start of the feeding phase due to the absence of nitrate from the previous cycle all media were dosed using peristaltic pumps 2 3 batch test for determination of anaerobic kinetics and acetate storage capacity anaerobic batch tests were performed on the granule size fractions obtained by sieving once a dynamic equilibrium had been reached in the granule size distribution in both reactors after 140 days a mixed sludge sample was obtained at the end of the aeration phase and fractionated over a stack of sieves with varying mesh size fractions 400 800 µm 800 1000 µm 1000 1400 µm and 1400 µm each fraction was added to a separate container with filtered reactor effluent 63 μm to obtain a total volume of 200 ml containing 0 1 m hepes acting as a buffer to ensure a constant ph throughout the experiment equivalent to normal reactor operation the ph was set to 7 0 5 using a 4 m solution of sodium hydroxide temperature was constant throughout the experiment at 20 c each container was sparged with dinitrogen gas 1 l min 1 for 5 min to strip dissolved oxygen from the liquid after which a sample was taken for the initial ortho phosphate concentration sparging continued throughout the remainder of the experiment to maintain anaerobic conditions the experiment was initiated by addition of a concentrated solution of sodium acetate to obtain an initial concentration of 500 mg ac l 1 to prevent incomplete penetration of the largest granule size full penetration up to largest granule size of 1 5 mm and t90 penetration time of 5 3 min according to stewart 2003 using d 0 87 10 9 m2 s 1 van den berg et al 2021b and qac max 0 15 g ac g vss 1 h 1 this work after addition of the sodium acetate a sample approximately 2 5 ml was taken every 5 min up to 30 min and immediately filtered through a 0 45 µm syringe filter ca membrane millipore and put on ice for later determination of ortho phosphate and acetate concentration profiles a final sample was taken after 100 min to determine total release of ortho phosphate and uptake of acetate negligible biomass was removed during sampling the decrease in liquid volume due to sampling was determined after the experiment had finished which was used in the calculation of the specific activity of the biomass the biomass in each container was sampled for determination of the mlvss concentration after the experiment had finished 2 4 analytical procedures 2 4 1 determination of ml vss solute concentrations and sludge volume index nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were measured by using a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyser thermo fisher scientific waltham usa the concentration of acetate was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with an aminex hpx 87h column from biorad coupled to an uv detector using 0 01 m phosphoric acid as eluent mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations in the reactor were determined according to the standard methods 2540 solids 2017 the sludge volume after 5 min of settling sv5 was determined in situ in between cycles 2 4 2 biomass density within granules the biomass density of the granules was measured using a dextran blue method beun et al 2002 van den berg et al 2021a a dilution series of dextran blue 2000 was prepared in the filtered effluent 0 45 µm ca membrane millipore up to 2 g l 1 and the absorption of light at a wavelength 620 nm measured with a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach as a calibration line the whole sludge volume from a reactor was transferred to a measuring cylinder and effluent was added to a total volume of 1 l effluent collected from the previous cycle was decanted and filtered through a 0 45 µm filter 1 g of dextran blue 2000 was added to the measuring cylinder and subsequently the whole cylinder was mixed the total volume and settled sludge volume were measured after five min of settling samples were in taken from the supernatant in triplicate and filtered through a 0 45 µm after determination of the concentration of dextran blue 2000 by spectrophotometry the volume occupied by the biomass was calculated and combined with the vss previously determined to yield the biomass density 2 4 3 level of phas in granule sieve fractions before and after anaerobic feeding mixed biomass samples were taken after the anaerobic reaction phase and at the end of the aeration phase of both reactors to determine the average acetate stored as phas per granule sieve fraction the bottom fed reactor was modified to accommodate anaerobic sampling after the feeding during the feeding the liquid above the sludge bed was stripped with nitrogen gas to remove residual oxygen without disturbing the influent flow through the bed after anaerobic feeding the bottom fed reactor was mixed by sparging dinitrogen gas and a mixed biomass sample was taken the biomass was inactivated with formaldehyde and subsequently sieved fractions 400 µm 400 800 µm 800 1000 µm 1000 1400 µm and 1400 µm to prepare for determination of the p3hb and p3hv content of each size fraction according to the method of johnson et al johnson et al 2009 2 4 4 stereozoom microscopy for counting individual granules sludge was collected from the reactor at the end of the aeration phase and from the effluent directly after discharge while kept in suspension a mixed sample from either source was transferred to a glass petri dish and examined according to gjaltema et al 1995 by the means of an olympus reverse microscope coupled with a leica digital camera together with its software qwin pro version 3 1 the granule size distribution was determined by counting individual granules with a minimum of 1000 hits the equivalent diameter of each granule was calculated based on the projected area of a granule which was used to calculate the volume assuming the shape of a sphere false hits were identified by manual inspection of a subset of the images obtained in one measurement these false hits were consistently caused by aberrations in the glass dish containing the sample and were smaller than 100 µm therefore hits with an equivalent diameter smaller than 100 µm were discarded 2 4 5 fluorescent in situ hybridization fish the handling fixation and staining of fish samples was performed as described by bassin et al 2011 a mixture of pao462 pao651 and pao846 probes paomix was used for visualizing polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao crocetti et al 2000 a mixture of gaoq431 and gaoq989 probes gaomix was used for visualizing glycogen accumulating organisms gao crocetti et al 2002 a mixture of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii probes was used for staining all bacteria amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 images were taken with a zeiss axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with filter set 26 bp 575e625 ft645 bp 660e710 20 bp 546 12 ft560 bp 575e640 and 17 bp 485 20 ft 510 bp 5515e565 for cy5 cy3 and fluos respectively 2 5 calculation procedures 2 5 1 granule size distribution hits from counting individual granules through stereozoom microscopy were binned in size fractions 400 µm 400 800 µm 800 1000 µm 1000 1400 µm and 1400 µm based on the equivalent diameter a volume was calculated for each granule in every bin by assuming sphericity finally the mass distribution over each bin was calculated by multiplying the volume fraction of a bin of the total volume of all counted granules assuming a constant biomass density not dependant on granule size 2 5 2 conversion of pha mass fractions to acetate equivalents a ratio of 0 75 c mol acetate c mol p3hb was used to calculate the anaerobically consumed acetate equivalents for the measured p3hb for both pam and gam smolders et al 1995b zeng et al 2003 besides p3hb the accumulation of p3hv in acetate fed communities dominated by pao occurs in the case of low phosphate availability silva et al 2020 welles et al 2017 the energy required for the sequestration of acetate is then derived partly from glycolysis besides the hydrolysis of poly phosphate the surplus reduction equivalents from glycolysis are used to reduce either part of the acetyl coa glyoxylate shunt or of the glycolysis products reductive branch of the tri carboxylic acid tca cycle both yield propionyl coa which is subsequently converted with p3hb to p3hv and to small amounts of ph2mv disregarded in this analysis based on the conditions applied it was assumed that all p3hv originated from pure gam metabolism yielding a ratio of acetate carbon incorporated in p3hv of 0 26 c mol c mol zeng et al 2003 2 5 3 calculation of anaerobic acetate distribution the anaerobic acetate distribution over the sludge population was calculated by combining the granule size distribution f i total sludge volume v s biomass density ρ x vss and acetate equivalents calculated from the difference of pha levels at the end of the aerated phase and the end of the anaerobic phase δ ac i the procedure for the fraction of acetate fed ac fed in a size fraction f i a c is depicted in eq 1 1 f i a c f i v s ρ x vss δ ac i ac fed 2 5 4 determination of srt of granule size fractions the srt for the granule size fractions at steady state were calculated based on the cumulative excess sludge removed during one day via selective wasting and the granule size distribution in the reactor the collected excess sludge was fractioned via a stack of sieves with mesh sizes 1400 µm 1000 µm 800 µm and 400 µm and the amounts tss were subsequently determined for all fractions wsi g tss d 1 the fraction smaller than 400 µm was negligible at steady state and was therefore discarded the total mass of sludge of each fraction was calculated from the granule size distribution and mlss concentration in the reactor si the srt of a size fraction srti day was calculated from through the eq 2 2 sr t i w s i s i 3 results 3 1 start up the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors were both inoculated with approximately 0 5 g tss l 1 of crushed aerobic granular sludge previously enriched in a laboratory reactor operated under similar conditions haaksman et al 2020 the crushed seed sludge was sieved over a cascade of a 100 µm and a 63 µm sieve after which the fraction retained at the 63 µm sieve was used as inoculum fig 1 both the reactors were immediately operated under the same volumetric substrate acetate loading rate of 1 12 g cod l 1 d 1 the initial settling rate selection criterion was set at 1 m h 1 and was gradually increased to 10 m h 1 over the course of 19 days for both reactors 3 1 1 settleability and morphology development of the granular sludge in terms of svi5 and mlss in the reactors is depicted in fig 1 both reactors developed well settling granular sludge svi5 between 30 and 40 ml g 1 but the granulation occurred faster in the bottom fed reactor 26 µm d 1 for the pulse fed reactor versus 40 µm d 1 for the bottom fed reactor the amount of dry mass increased at a similar rate regardless of the anaerobic feeding regime the initial growth morphology of both systems was characterized by flocculent as well as granular growth fig 1 a b flocs were identified as translucent clusters using stereo zoom microscopy while small granules 100 200 µm appeared as non translucent and dense aggregates flocculent growth could not be detected in the pulse fed reactor after 15 days fig 2 c while flocs were observed in the bottom fed reactor up to 28 days of operation these observations coincided with the development of the sludge volume index svi5 fig 1 a the further development of the granular morphology was similar for both anaerobic feeding regimes 3 1 2 anaerobic acetate uptake efficiency the anaerobic acetate uptake was monitored on line by conductivity measurements see figure s1 for the estimated completeness of acetate uptake as function of time the pulse fed system developed complete anaerobic acetate uptake within two weeks after start up the bottom fed reactor took four weeks for obtaining full anaerobic acetate uptake this was due to short cut flow of the influent through the sludge bed during the first month after start up decreasing the effective anaerobic contact time with the sludge therefore part of the fed acetate was then not taken up anaerobically this can be considered a scale effect due to the limited sludge bed height and less optimized influent distribution manifold compared to full scale reactors this prolonged the aerobic availability of acetate compared to the pulse fed reactor and caused the extended presence of flocs in the bottom fed reactor the disappearance of flocculent growth coincided in both reactors with the moment of full anaerobic acetate uptake in the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors at days 15 and 28 respectively 3 2 steady state operation the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors were operated for a duration of 5 months until a stable granule size distribution had been achieved both systems were characterized and typical process parameters for both reactors are listed in table 1 the reactors have been operated at a similar average mlvss concentration substrate loading rate and srt considering the fluctuations in mlvss concentration sampled over the course of five weeks centred around 144th day of operation the biomass characteristics had developed to a similar level in both reactors the bottom fed reactor showed a slightly higher svi which had been observed since the start of the experiment other than that the difference in anaerobic feeding regime did not result in differences in biomass characteristics fish microscopy indicated an enrichment of ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i at similar high levels in both reactors figure s3 the mass distribution over the granules size fractions showed a higher unevenness for the bottom fed reactor compared to the pulse fed reactor 81 of the mass was present in granules larger than 1 mm in the bottom fed reactor compared to 66 in the pulse fed reactor fig 3 the main difference in biological nutrient removal was the substantially higher anaerobic p cod ratio and higher aerobic specific phosphate uptake rate of the pulse fed reactor other reactor characteristics relevant for further analysis of the effect of the anaerobic feeding regime on aerobic granulation are reported below 3 3 pha storage polymer distribution over granule size fractions the impact of the anaerobic feeding regime on the distribution of acetate over the granule size fractions was assessed once the granule population had stabilized in both the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors samples were taken from the mixed granular sludge suspension before and after the anaerobic feeding stage within the same cycle the mass fractions of p3hb and p3hv in the sludge samples were quantified after fractionation by sieving the majority of the pha storage pool was p3hb but considerable amounts of p3hv were detected in both the pulse fed and bottom fed systems table s1 the levels of phb and phv in the biomass were converted to the equivalent amount of acetate consumed before and after the anaerobic phase per amount of vss fig 4 a decreasing trend was observed for the relative amount of acetate consumed in the pulse fed system for increasing granule size fraction on the other hand the anaerobic bottom feeding favoured substrate uptake by the largest granule size fraction a considerable amount of pha remained in the bottom fed reactor at the end of aeration and this amount increased with granule size the pulse fed system showed a complete depletion of the pha storage pool negligible differences were observed between anaerobic acetate uptake rates and maximal storage capacities between both reactors and per sieve fraction in batch tests table 1 therefore the observed differences can be attributed to the difference in anaerobic contact mode applied in each reactor 3 4 anaerobic acetate load distribution and solids residence time to show the acetate load difference between the anaerobic feeding regimes the amounts of acetate converted to pha were combined with the measured vss distributions over the granule size fractions in each reactor fig 5 using this approach 94 and 81 of the acetate loads per cycle were recovered for the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors respectively in the bottom fed reactor a negligible expansion of the settled sludge bed was observed during the anaerobic phase and no acetate could be detected in the bulk liquid above the sludge bed throughout the anaerobic phase the acetate concentration in the bulk liquid therefore decreased from the initial level in the synthetic wastewater at the inlet to depletion before exiting at the top of the sludge bed although both reactors had fully granulated with similar size distributions the net acetate distribution differed substantially the pulse fed system showed minor differences in acetate load distribution over the granule size fractions while most of the acetate load was anaerobically consumed by the largest granule size fractions 1 mm present in the bottom fed reactor the acetate load distribution data were subsequently used to calculate the sludge loading rate per size fraction in both reactors the mass distribution over the granule size fractions in the reactor sludge wasted selectively with the effluent and sludge wasted manually were then used to calculate the srt of the individual granule size fractions the granule size distribution of all sludge removed from the reactor was averaged over a period of five days in the same week as the samples for measurement of the pha content had been taken both the sludge loading rate and srt per granule size fraction are depicted in fig 6 both systems showed an increase in srt for an increasing granule size regardless of the anaerobic feeding strategy the srt of the fraction 1400 µm was shorter in the pulse fed reactor than in the bottom fed reactor due to unintended accumulation of large granules in the effluent discharge port during aeration this had only a minor effect on the obtained size distribution compared to the bottom fed reactor in the pulse fed reactor the loading rate decreased as the granule size increased for the bottom fed reactor the sludge loading rate increased with increasing granule size 4 discussion two sequencing batch aerobic granular sludge reactors were operated to investigate the effect of the anaerobic contact mode on acetate distribution over granular size fractions and its effect on sludge granulation and dynamics of ebpr organisms synthetic wastewater was anaerobically pulse fed in one reactor while bottom feeding was applied in the other both reactors were inoculated with the same crushed aerobic granular sludge and were operated in the same way except for the aforementioned anaerobic phase the observed differences in the steady state characterization will be discussed next in more detail in relation to the applied anaerobic contact mode 4 1 acetate distribution over granule size fractions the biomass specific anaerobic acetate uptake mmol c ac equivalents g 1 vss and storage as pha was nearly independent of granule size for the pulse fed reactor while for the bottom fed reactor there was a clear increasing acetate uptake with increasing granule size fig 6 experimental estimation of the maximum acetate storage capacity 150 mg ac g 1 vss specific anaerobic acetate uptake rate 150 mg ac g 1 vss h 1 and biomass concentration were similar for both reactors table 1 also the dominant pao clade determined by fish was the same in both reactors clade i this indicates that the potential of the microbial ebpr population was highly similar between both operating regimes and in both systems the maximum acetate uptake capacity was not limiting the observed acetate uptake granules close to the influent distributor in the bottom fed reactor could only just be saturated at the end of the 60 minute feeding period this indicates that the differences in cod loading can be explained by the differences in liquid biofilm mass transfer to the granules for the two anaerobic feeding modes the driving force from the concentration of acetate in the bulk liquid over time and place experienced by granules and mass transfer rate are the main differentiating variables for the pulse fed reactor both the acetate concentration and effective contact time were the same for all granules due to the mixed anaerobic reaction phase therefore the liquid biofilm mass transfer was the determining mechanism the mass transfer coefficient through a liquid biofilm interface depends on liquid velocity local around the biofilm and the surface area since the surface to volume ratio decreases with increasing granule size the overall mass transfer coefficient decreases for increasing granule size cussler 2009 nicolella et al 1998 effectively the efficiency of the granular volume usage decreases with increasing granule size liu et al 2005 the extent of the actual difference in loading between depends on the initial penetrated volume the near equal acetate loading with a slightly decreasing trend with increasing granule size observed in the pulse fed reactor is consistent with substrate uptake limited by surface to volume ratio the effect is limited due to the high initial acetate concentration acetate loading rate and selective retention of larger granules if an anaerobic zone with mixed tanks in series would get continuous feeding with real wastewater as in a continuous flow system with both lower concentrations of rbcod and rbcod loading rate the advantage for smaller granules would be more pronounced the same analysis yields a different result for the bottom fed reactor the observed increase in anaerobic acetate loading with increasing granule size is due to a decreasing acetate concentration together with a potentially decreasing average granule size over the height of the sludge bed the mass transfer limitation for granules of increasing size due to the decreasing surface to volume ratio is thus counteracted and reversed by the higher probability for larger granules to experience a higher bulk liquid substrate concentration the importance of this selective feeding of the largest granule size fraction has recently been underlined as one of the main mechanisms for stable aerobic granulation in bottom fed ags reactors in practice van dijk et al 2022 bottom feeding through a sludge bed thus favours increased anaerobic substrate uptake by the larger granule size fractions the difference in the distribution of stored substrate forced by the anaerobic contact mode is illustrated in fig 7 4 2 cod loading rate versus srt both the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors showed an increasing srt for increasing granule size fractions fig 6 a such a trend was expected based on the preferential wasting of slower settling sludge fraction as means of granular sludge selection for the cod loading rate on the other hand fig 6 b the pulse fed system showed a slight decrease with granule size while in the bottom fed reactor the acetate loading rate increased substantially with granule size in continuous flow through cas systems the sludge loading rate decreases on average with increasing srt for all sludge particles metcalf and eddy 2013 this relation does also apply to ags systems on average in cas systems however the probability distributions around the average of both substrate and sludge discharge follow the hydraulic residence time distribution without any impact of the properties of sludge particles e g size or difference in settling rate in this study the average sludge yield was the same for both reactors however the difference between granules sizes indicates that the internal redistribution of biomass growth between size fractions was different in the pulse fed reactor compared to the bottom fed reactor the redistribution of biomass from larger to smaller aggregates is a common property of biofilm systems which balances growth and biomass removal pereboom 1994 this yields an increase of srt deeper into a biofilm tijhuis et al 1994 and is specifically of interest for aerobic granular sludge systems performing ebpr morgenroth and wilderer 1999 winkler et al 2012 while the srt distribution of biofilm aggregates of different sizes can be influenced via selective wasting and process conditions affecting detachment adjusting the distribution of substrate i e the distribution of biomass growth over size fractions is more difficult the kinetics of substrate uptake and mass transfer determine the distribution of growth in biofilm systems with completely mixed reactors as was previously discussed for the pulse fed reactor the comparison with a bottom fed reactor in the current study shows that the uncoupling of cod uptake in the anaerobic phase from growth in the aerobic phase in aerobic granular sludge systems provides a means of control over the distribution of biomass growth this has two main implications first the granule size distribution can be influenced by directing the available cod towards smaller or larger granules second the anaerobic penetration depth of cod can be influenced which in turn influences the location of microbial conversions within granules the anaerobic contact mode thus provides an additional tool that can be used to optimize the granule size distribution and biological nutrient removal in aerobic granular sludge processes for wastewater treatment 4 3 residual levels of pha after aeration a remarkable difference in residual pha levels at the end of aeration was observed between the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors the bottom fed reactor showed substantial levels of residual pha after aeration for all granule size fractions while the fractions were depleted of pha in the pulse fed reactor fig 4 cultures enriched for ebpr have been shown to exhibit flexibility in the residual pha content depending on the operational parameters including srt smolders et al 1995a influent p cod ratio welles et al 2017 polyphosphate storage levels acevedo et al 2012 ph filipe et al 2001a and cycle length kuba et al 1997 the operational conditions during the aerobic phase were the same for both reactors i e kla dissolved oxygen concentration and duration and thus did not cause the difference in remaining pha the remaining pha was observed in all granule size classes of the bottom fed reactor indicating the residual levels of pha were not affected by the differences between the granule size distributions of the reactors therefore the anaerobic contact mode likely caused this difference specifically the ratio of anaerobic loading of acetate of a granule size fraction to aerobic time in completely mixed enrichment cultures and in the pulse fed granular system presented here most organisms in the active layer of all granular size fractions experience the same conditions each cycle i e same amount of acetate taken up same penetration depth and same aerobic time to convert it this gives the organisms the opportunity to fully optimise their resource allocation to maximal growth silva et al 2019 in the bottom fed reactor all granules are distributed over the settled bed prior to the anaerobic feeding the largest granules will be more distributed towards the bottom of the sludge bed while the smallest granules would be more towards the top it was estimated that the acetate front reached up to 36 of the sludge bed from the bottom of the reactor based on the measured specific acetate uptake rate bed porosity and superficial liquid velocity during feeding figure s4 the partial anaerobic contact of the sludge bed with acetate led to a highly variable acetate uptake for a granule per cycle depending on its position in the sludge bed after settling although larger granules have a higher probability of settling more towards the bottom of the sludge bed the applied superficial liquid velocity during feeding i e 0 46 m h 1 is well below the minimum fluidization velocity therefore negligible bed expansion and no further stratification were observed during feeding granules of all size fractions thus had a substantial probability of residing in the bottom part of the sludge bed and thus be in contact with acetate during feeding this might force the organisms storage metabolism into a more resilient state so it can deal with variations in substrate availability this would underline the flexibility of ca accumulibacter phosphatis to modulate the metabolism for optimal carbon utilization to the prevailing conditions silva et al 2020 another possible explanation is that the fixed length of the aerobic phase was too short to fully convert all pha for that part of the granules that received a peak anaerobic loading during a specific cycle granules at the bottom of the bottom fed reactor will have been exposed to acetate during the full 60 min of feeding and these granules will have therefore a higher pha content than average the aerobic time is equal for all granules and potentially too short when a granules has been near the inlet at the bottom during feeding this would on average lead to a residual level of pha this hypothesis could not be investigated any further based on the available data and could the topic of future study some work has been done studying the effect of fluctuating operational conditions on the performance of ebpr schuler et al 2011 mainly due to the residence time distribution in continuous flow through reactors however the width of the anaerobic load distribution as observed in the bottom fed reactor used here was substantially larger and cannot be directly compared furthermore full scale aerobic granular sludge systems will be even more variable than the lab scale systems this effect has not been considered well in the literature but is essential to further optimise ebpr systems especially when employing ags 4 4 impact of contact method on anaerobic storage metabolism the anaerobic conversion stoichiometry of acetate to phas was surprisingly different for the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors as well as for different granule size fractions within each reactor the ratio of p3hv p3hb accumulated during the anaerobic phase was on average twofold higher in bottom fed reactor compared to the pulse fed reactor with the largest granule size fraction having the highest ratio table s1 both reactors were dominated by ca accumulibacter phosphatis figure s1 the observed amount of ortho phosphate released anaerobically was lower in the bottom fed reactor compared to the pulse fed reactor these two observations are congruent the trend continued further during the aerobic phase where a nearly two fold lower specific aerobic phosphate uptake rate was observed in the bottom fed reactor compared to the pulse fed reactor table 1 it has been indicated before that ca accumulibacter phosphatis has a flexible metabolism and can operate between a full phosphate accumulation metabolism pam and a full glycogen accumulating metabolism gam oyserman et al 2016 silva et al 2020 welles et al 2015 it seems that the pulse fed system operated at full pam while the bottom fed system exhibited a mixed pam gam phenotype fish has confirmed a full absence of known gaos in the microbial population while ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i was dominant figure s3 these observations underline again the ability of ca accumulibacter phosphatis to modulate its metabolism depending on the environmental conditions silva et al 2020 although the driver for the differences in metabolism were not determined a decrease of the p cod ratio in the influent has been found to increase the ratio of gam pam in suspended growth systems welles et al 2017 in this study this was likely not a factor since the influent composition was the same sufficient polyphosphate was present in both reactors at the applied average srt for full pam to take place if the differences are examined at the aggregate level i e assuming similar microbial activity throughout each granule with negligible spatial gradients the difference in pam gam metabolism could be related to the aforementioned difference in pha remaining at the end of the aeration phase in that case the pam metabolism could be the most optimal metabolism for systems with stable substrate loading while gam metabolism contributes to resilience to more dynamic substrate loading per granule another hypothesis is that differences in spatial gradients within granules contributed to the observed difference in pam gam ratios between both reactors the anaerobic penetration depth of acetate in the granules in the bottom fed reactor is larger compared to granules in the pulse fed reactor fig 7 the aerobic penetration depth of oxygen was estimated to be similar for both reactors due to the same operational conditions i e the same transfer resistances for gas liquid and liquid biofilms during uptake of phosphate and always more shallow than acetate oxygen only penetrates further into the granules once the phosphate in the bulk liquid has been depleted thereby limiting the interior of the granules to perform gam the outer regions initially penetrated with oxygen are able to perform full pam the spatial separation between metabolisms would be most pronounced for the granules in the bottom fed reactor which could in turn contribute the observed difference in pam gam ratio between anaerobic pulse feeding and bottom feeding at the reactor level these observations warrant further investigation into the effect on the metabolism of ca accumulibacter phosphatis of both the dynamic anaerobic loading as well as the effect of differences in penetration depth of acetate and oxygen on potential spatial separation of pam and gam within individual granules which could not be separated in this study if the impact of dynamic operational conditions is also reflected in the pam gam ratio for ca accumulibacter phosphatis it might form a proxy for the study of the occurring variability on the cellular level 4 5 practical implications the influent with acetate as sole carbon source combined with an anaerobic contact phase selects completely for granular growth morphology and low svis martins et al 2004 regardless of the anaerobic contact mode applied municipal sewage contains lower concentrations of volatile fatty acids henze et al 2000 than the synthetic wastewater used in this study in full scale ebpr systems easy hydrolysable and fermentable cod after biological conversion into vfa also contribute to the growth of ebpr organisms brdjanovic et al 2016 chap 2 2 enhanced biological phosphorus removal drewnowski and makinia 2011 tykesson et al 2002 these extra microbial conversions will have to be considered when translating the observations here to full scale systems however general principles can be deducted of the present work design of the anaerobic feeding is an important aspect for obtaining stable aerobic granular sludge the current implemented full scale aerobic granular sludge process nereda technology applies bottom feeding and excess sludge extraction from the top of the bed this removes the weakest settling part of the sludge and provides most substrate to the best settling large granules fraction of the sludge van dijk et al 2022 thereby enhancing stability of the granular sludge bed there are ongoing developments for alternative implementations of the ags technology in sbr as well as continuous systems a completely mixed anaerobic feeding sbr has been proposed and tested at pilot scale rocktäschel et al 2015 however there it was shown that this only resulted in stable operation if the wastewater has already high acetate concentrations in the influent with a large rbcod fraction in the influent like in this study selective wasting based on sludge settleability becomes the main driver for stable granulation this can be deduced from the similarity in the granule size distribution of both reactors with different anaerobic feeding modes this underlines the observations in this study that granulation can be obtained independent of anaerobic feeding mode but that bottom feeding more readily results in stable operation if the influent composition is less favourable with the aim to further develop ags technology in conventional continuous operated wastewater treatment systems kent et al 2018 the attention for the design of the anaerobic contact tank is likely even more critical as has been reported in existing plants with strong plug flow conditions granule formation is already induced redmond et al 2019 wei et al 2020 indicating the advantage of having a strong concentration gradient as in the pulse fed system in this study in a completely mixed anaerobic tank acetate concentrations remain very low and diffusion limitation will likely prevent ca accumulibacter phosphatis microcolonies to grow out into larger granules especially for real wastewater where only a limited amount of readily biodegradable cod is available for anaerobic conversion and storage it is important to preferentially feed the largest granules the challenge for stable granulation will be to design a system where also under continuous feeding conditions the readily biodegradable cod is directed preferentially to the largest granule fraction interestingly we observed quite a difference in ebpr metabolism between the two feeding modes with respect to ratio of pam gam metabolism and pha remaining at the end of the aerated period this is not well recognised yet in the literature and would need further attention our initial data seem to indicate that the bio p removal capacity is not directly influenced but the overall stability and response to disturbances e g monday effect might be related to these differences brdjanovic et al 1998 rieger et al 2001 filipe et al 2001b indeed indicated that stabilising the feed to an ebpr process minimized disturbances however the effect of different pam gam metabolism was not yet well recognised and evaluated at the time it might be relevant for the batch scheduling of the existing aerobic granular sludge facilities for example 5 conclusion an experimental study was performed at lab scale to investigate the anaerobic contact mode of aerobic granular sludge with substrate on the distribution of substrate storage over the granule size fractions and the effects on sludge characteristics two reactors were operated identically except for the anaerobic feeding phases one reactor was fed from the bottom through the sludge bed while the other was fed in a short pulse and subsequently mixed anaerobically the following conclusions were derived from the observations bottom feeding primarily directs substrate towards the large granular size classes i e large volume and closer to the bottom while completely mixed pulse feeding gives a more equal distribution of substrate over all granule sizes i e surface area dependant both feeding methods resulted in stable granulation with large granules however in the completely mixed pulse fed system the smaller granules are preferentially supplied with substrate due to their relatively higher surface to volume ratio the preferential feeding of the larger granules in bottom feeding will enhance and stabilise the granulation in such systems certainly under less advantageous wastewater compositions then the acetate feed used in this study the anaerobic contact mode directly impacts the substrate distribution over the different granule sizes irrespective of the solids retention time of a granule as a unit the systems showed very similar microbial populations with mainly ca accumulibacter phosphatis present in the biomass they differed strongly in their phenotype with respect to pam gam metabolism aerobic phosphate uptake rate and residual pha at the end of the aeration phase these phenomena need attention in future ebpr studies since they are likely relevant for the full scale stability of ebpr processes funding this work was funded by the delfland water authority delfluent

15011,there is a growing interest to implement aerobic granular sludge ags in existing conventional activated sludge cas systems with a continuous flow through configuration the mode of anaerobic contact of raw sewage with the sludge is an important aspect in the adaptation of cas systems to accommodate ags it remains unclear how the distribution of substrate over the sludge by a conventional anaerobic selector compares to the distribution via bottom feeding applied in sequencing batch reactors sbrs this study investigated the effect of the anaerobic contact mode on the substrate and storage distribution by operating two lab scale sbrs one with the traditional bottom feeding through a settled sludge bed similar to full scale ags systems and one where the synthetic wastewater was fed as a pulse at the start of the anaerobic phase while the reactor was mixed through sparging of nitrogen gas mimicking a plug flow anaerobic selector in continuous flow through systems the distribution of the substrate over the sludge particle population was quantified via pha analysis combined with the obtained granule size distribution bottom feeding was found to primarily direct substrate towards the large granular size classes i e large volume and close to the bottom while completely mixed pulse feeding gives a more equal distribution of substrate over all granule sizes i e surface area dependant the anaerobic contact mode directly controls the substrate distribution over the different granule sizes irrespective of the solids retention time of a granule as an entity preferential feeding of the larger granules will enhance and stabilise the granulation compared to pulse feeding certainly under less advantageous conditions imposed by real sewage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerobic granular sludge pha bottom feeding pulse feeding anaerobic selector continuous flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a novel technology for compact treatment of wastewater applied mainly in sequencing batch reactors sbrs at full scale pronk et al 2015 there is a growing interest to implement ags in existing conventional activated sludge as systems mostly with a continuous flow through configuration kent et al 2018 winkler and van loosdrecht 2022 the increased settleability of ags compared to conventional as would allow for a higher mixed liquor suspended solids mlss for the same volumetric loading rate yielding an increase in biological treatment capacity simultaneous nutrient removal processes within the biofilms also could be utilized to a larger extent strubbe et al 2022 for a similar successful implementation of ags in conventional as systems the required selective pressures for the formation and retention of ags must be translated from the sbrs to continuous flow through systems the anaerobic storage of readily biodegradable cod rbcod as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas ensures dense growth of heterotrophic biomass during subsequent aeration by preventing transport limited growth de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 at full scale the fraction of rbcod in municipal wastewater is often limited and the more slowly biodegradable especially the particulate cod fraction has been hypothesized to result in flocculent growth under aerobic conditions layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015 ensuring that anaerobic storage of the limited rbcod is performed by the sludge fraction with the highest settling velocity speeds up the formation of granular sludge when starting from a flocculent morphology and results in a larger mean granule size van dijk et al 2022 the selection criterion for ags is therefore not only to ensure anaerobic uptake of rbcod and storage as phas but to concentrate the available rbcod in the best settling sludge fraction as well i e selective feeding in bottom fed sequencing batch reactors both criteria are automatically achieved since the best settling granules have a higher probability to accumulate at the bottom of the sludge bed in other reactor configurations particularly in continuous flow through reactors this might be more difficult to achieve the method of anaerobic contact of raw sewage with the sludge is an important aspect in the adaptation of continuous flow through activated sludge systems to accommodate ags continuous activated sludge systems designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal generally employ a plug flow anaerobic selector zone in which part of the recycled sludge is contacted with the influent while in suspension martins et al 2004 the applied loading rate mass of rbcod mass of sludge amount time aims to minimise diffusion gradients of rbcod inside the sludge flocs and the sludge loading mass of rbcod mass of sludge sets the amount of flocs over which the incoming rbcod is distributed these parameters respectively determine the initial penetration depth of rbcod and the total amount of stored cod per sludge particle floc resulting in relatively dense and well settling flocs wanner et al 1987 since the sludge is kept in suspension sludge particles with a larger surface area to volume ratio can achieve a higher volumetric rbcod uptake rate if the penetration depth is limited this favours a flocculent morphology over a granular morphology a higher initial concentration gradient of rbcod i e an increased loading rate can partially counteract the lower surface to volume ratio of granules compared to flocs due to full penetration of even the largest granules whether this can be achieved to such an extent that granules can be formed that are substantially larger than flocs likely depends on the fraction of rbcod compared to the total cod in the wastewater van dijk et al 2022 some full scale studies have investigated the relation between the design of an anaerobic selector and the sludge morphology with a focus on aerobic granulation redmond et al 2019 investigated the effect of the sludge settleability of a wwtp which had the flow pattern of the anaerobic selector converted from a tanks in series configuration to a step feed the characteristics of the sludge settleability were very similar to that of aerobic granular sludge in the tanks in series configuration with a svi5 svi30 ratio close to unity the ratio gradually increased after the transition to a more flocculent morphology in the step feed configuration these findings demonstrated the adverse effect of a decrease in initial rbcod loading and initial rbcod loading rate on the granular sludge morphology wei et al 2020 investigated the process conditions of several full scale conventional as facilities in the usa with varying levels of spontaneous granulation no correlation was found between the cod loading rate of the anaerobic selector and the level of granulation observed the rbcod loading rates were not reported the level of granulation did correlate strongly with the fraction of phosphate accumulating organisms paos found in the granular sludge fraction compared to the flocculent fraction indicative of an increased enrichment for anaerobic uptake of rbcod in the granular fraction it remains unclear how the distribution of substrate over the sludge by a conventional anaerobic selector compares to the distribution via bottom feeding applied in sbrs and how it impacts the granulation process the implementation of stable ags into existing continuous flow through wwtps thus requires further study on the impact of the anaerobic contact mode of sewage with sludge to investigate the effect of the anaerobic contact mode on the substrate and storage distribution the granulation potential the size distribution and related conversions we operated two lab scale sbrs one with the traditional bottom feeding through a settled sludge bed similar to full scale ags systems and one where the synthetic wastewater was fed as a pulse at the start of the anaerobic phase while the reactor was mixed by sparging of nitrogen gas the latter generates exposure of the sludge to a high substrate concentration at the start of the anaerobic period which gradually decreases to zero from a biological process view this can be considered a scaled down version of a plug flow anaerobic selector as employed in conventional as systems starting from flocculent sludge the formation of aerobic granular sludge was followed the effect of the contact method on the distribution of the substrate over the sludge particle population was quantified via pha analysis combined with the granule size distribution the interactions between the anaerobic contact mode and aerobic conversion processes were investigated implications for application in continuous systems and the nutrient removal process are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two cylindrical lab scale reactors i e one pulse fed one bottom fed each with a working volume of 3 l during aeration and an aspect ratio of 20 were operated as a sequential batch reactor with a volume exchange ratio of 0 47 the reactors were operated continuously in 205 min cycles during 144 days after settling and discharge of effluent the working volume of the reactor was 1 6 l a cycle started with an anaerobic phase in which synthetic wastewater was fed a different anaerobic contact mode was used in each reactor the pulse fed reactor was first sparged with dinitrogen gas 5 min with 5 l min 1 superficial gas velocity of 3 5 cm s 1 to deplete the bulk liquid of dissolved oxygen the batch of synthetic wastewater was then fed while sparging and mixing continued 2 min the pulse fed reactor was subsequently mixed with dinitrogen gas for the remainder of the anaerobic phase 53 min for the bottom fed reactor synthetic wastewater was fed through the bottom of the settled sludge bed with a superficial liquid velocity of 0 46 m h 1 60 min the remainder of the cycles were identical for both reactors an aeration phase maximum duration of 137 min a settling period minimum duration of 3 min and finally the discharge of effluent 1 min and a waiting phase to allow packing of the sludge bed 4 min all sludge unable to meet the settleability criterion was discharged with the effluent during start up the settling period started at 30 min at the expense of the aeration phase and was gradually decreased to 5 min while maintaining a constant total cycle duration the temperature was controlled at 20 1 c through the double jacketed reactor wall using a water bath with thermostat the ph was controlled during aeration and during the mixed anaerobic phase of the pulse fed reactor at 7 0 0 1 by dosage of either a 1 m solution of hydrochloric acid or a 1 m sodium hydroxide solution a conductivity sensor was used to monitor the anaerobic release and aerobic removal of ortho phosphate weissbrodt et al 2014 during aeration a recirculation gas flow was maintained at 6 l min 1 superficial gas velocity of 4 2 cm s 1 a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mg l 1 was maintained during the aeration phase via addition of compressed air or dinitrogen gas using mass flow controllers the total organic loading rate 1 12 g cod l 1 d 1 was kept constant over the course of the study granular sludge previously enriched under the same conditions as applied in the bottom fed reactor and with the same synthetic influent was used as inoculum the inoculum was crushed using an ultra turrax homogenizer t 18 ika staufen im breisgau germany after which the sieve fraction between 63 µm and 100 µm added to both reactors to yield an initial mlss concentration of 0 5 g l 1 2 2 composition of synthetic wastewater a synthetic wastewater of 1 4 l per cycle was used as anaerobic feed and consisted of 1 2 l of deionized water together with 100 ml carbon source medium a and 100 ml nitrogen and phosphorous source medium b medium a contained 65 6 mm nach3coo 3h2o 4 1 mm mgso4 7h2o and 5 4 mm kcl medium b contained 15 mm nh4cl 1 3 mm k2hpo4 2 1 mm kh2po4 and 16 6 ml l 1 trace elements solution vishniac and santer 1957 but using 2 2 mg l 1 znso4 7h2o instead of 22 mg l 1 pronk et al 2015 the combination of medium a medium b and tap water led to a synthetic wastewater composition of 300 mg cod l 1 15 mg nh4 n l 1 and 7 5 mg po4 3 p l 1 allylthiourea atu 5 mg l 1 synthetic wastewater was dosed to suppress nitrification this enabled the calculation of biomass yield directly from the consumption of ammonium and ensured anaerobic conditions at the start of the feeding phase due to the absence of nitrate from the previous cycle all media were dosed using peristaltic pumps 2 3 batch test for determination of anaerobic kinetics and acetate storage capacity anaerobic batch tests were performed on the granule size fractions obtained by sieving once a dynamic equilibrium had been reached in the granule size distribution in both reactors after 140 days a mixed sludge sample was obtained at the end of the aeration phase and fractionated over a stack of sieves with varying mesh size fractions 400 800 µm 800 1000 µm 1000 1400 µm and 1400 µm each fraction was added to a separate container with filtered reactor effluent 63 μm to obtain a total volume of 200 ml containing 0 1 m hepes acting as a buffer to ensure a constant ph throughout the experiment equivalent to normal reactor operation the ph was set to 7 0 5 using a 4 m solution of sodium hydroxide temperature was constant throughout the experiment at 20 c each container was sparged with dinitrogen gas 1 l min 1 for 5 min to strip dissolved oxygen from the liquid after which a sample was taken for the initial ortho phosphate concentration sparging continued throughout the remainder of the experiment to maintain anaerobic conditions the experiment was initiated by addition of a concentrated solution of sodium acetate to obtain an initial concentration of 500 mg ac l 1 to prevent incomplete penetration of the largest granule size full penetration up to largest granule size of 1 5 mm and t90 penetration time of 5 3 min according to stewart 2003 using d 0 87 10 9 m2 s 1 van den berg et al 2021b and qac max 0 15 g ac g vss 1 h 1 this work after addition of the sodium acetate a sample approximately 2 5 ml was taken every 5 min up to 30 min and immediately filtered through a 0 45 µm syringe filter ca membrane millipore and put on ice for later determination of ortho phosphate and acetate concentration profiles a final sample was taken after 100 min to determine total release of ortho phosphate and uptake of acetate negligible biomass was removed during sampling the decrease in liquid volume due to sampling was determined after the experiment had finished which was used in the calculation of the specific activity of the biomass the biomass in each container was sampled for determination of the mlvss concentration after the experiment had finished 2 4 analytical procedures 2 4 1 determination of ml vss solute concentrations and sludge volume index nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were measured by using a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyser thermo fisher scientific waltham usa the concentration of acetate was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with an aminex hpx 87h column from biorad coupled to an uv detector using 0 01 m phosphoric acid as eluent mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations in the reactor were determined according to the standard methods 2540 solids 2017 the sludge volume after 5 min of settling sv5 was determined in situ in between cycles 2 4 2 biomass density within granules the biomass density of the granules was measured using a dextran blue method beun et al 2002 van den berg et al 2021a a dilution series of dextran blue 2000 was prepared in the filtered effluent 0 45 µm ca membrane millipore up to 2 g l 1 and the absorption of light at a wavelength 620 nm measured with a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach as a calibration line the whole sludge volume from a reactor was transferred to a measuring cylinder and effluent was added to a total volume of 1 l effluent collected from the previous cycle was decanted and filtered through a 0 45 µm filter 1 g of dextran blue 2000 was added to the measuring cylinder and subsequently the whole cylinder was mixed the total volume and settled sludge volume were measured after five min of settling samples were in taken from the supernatant in triplicate and filtered through a 0 45 µm after determination of the concentration of dextran blue 2000 by spectrophotometry the volume occupied by the biomass was calculated and combined with the vss previously determined to yield the biomass density 2 4 3 level of phas in granule sieve fractions before and after anaerobic feeding mixed biomass samples were taken after the anaerobic reaction phase and at the end of the aeration phase of both reactors to determine the average acetate stored as phas per granule sieve fraction the bottom fed reactor was modified to accommodate anaerobic sampling after the feeding during the feeding the liquid above the sludge bed was stripped with nitrogen gas to remove residual oxygen without disturbing the influent flow through the bed after anaerobic feeding the bottom fed reactor was mixed by sparging dinitrogen gas and a mixed biomass sample was taken the biomass was inactivated with formaldehyde and subsequently sieved fractions 400 µm 400 800 µm 800 1000 µm 1000 1400 µm and 1400 µm to prepare for determination of the p3hb and p3hv content of each size fraction according to the method of johnson et al johnson et al 2009 2 4 4 stereozoom microscopy for counting individual granules sludge was collected from the reactor at the end of the aeration phase and from the effluent directly after discharge while kept in suspension a mixed sample from either source was transferred to a glass petri dish and examined according to gjaltema et al 1995 by the means of an olympus reverse microscope coupled with a leica digital camera together with its software qwin pro version 3 1 the granule size distribution was determined by counting individual granules with a minimum of 1000 hits the equivalent diameter of each granule was calculated based on the projected area of a granule which was used to calculate the volume assuming the shape of a sphere false hits were identified by manual inspection of a subset of the images obtained in one measurement these false hits were consistently caused by aberrations in the glass dish containing the sample and were smaller than 100 µm therefore hits with an equivalent diameter smaller than 100 µm were discarded 2 4 5 fluorescent in situ hybridization fish the handling fixation and staining of fish samples was performed as described by bassin et al 2011 a mixture of pao462 pao651 and pao846 probes paomix was used for visualizing polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao crocetti et al 2000 a mixture of gaoq431 and gaoq989 probes gaomix was used for visualizing glycogen accumulating organisms gao crocetti et al 2002 a mixture of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii probes was used for staining all bacteria amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 images were taken with a zeiss axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with filter set 26 bp 575e625 ft645 bp 660e710 20 bp 546 12 ft560 bp 575e640 and 17 bp 485 20 ft 510 bp 5515e565 for cy5 cy3 and fluos respectively 2 5 calculation procedures 2 5 1 granule size distribution hits from counting individual granules through stereozoom microscopy were binned in size fractions 400 µm 400 800 µm 800 1000 µm 1000 1400 µm and 1400 µm based on the equivalent diameter a volume was calculated for each granule in every bin by assuming sphericity finally the mass distribution over each bin was calculated by multiplying the volume fraction of a bin of the total volume of all counted granules assuming a constant biomass density not dependant on granule size 2 5 2 conversion of pha mass fractions to acetate equivalents a ratio of 0 75 c mol acetate c mol p3hb was used to calculate the anaerobically consumed acetate equivalents for the measured p3hb for both pam and gam smolders et al 1995b zeng et al 2003 besides p3hb the accumulation of p3hv in acetate fed communities dominated by pao occurs in the case of low phosphate availability silva et al 2020 welles et al 2017 the energy required for the sequestration of acetate is then derived partly from glycolysis besides the hydrolysis of poly phosphate the surplus reduction equivalents from glycolysis are used to reduce either part of the acetyl coa glyoxylate shunt or of the glycolysis products reductive branch of the tri carboxylic acid tca cycle both yield propionyl coa which is subsequently converted with p3hb to p3hv and to small amounts of ph2mv disregarded in this analysis based on the conditions applied it was assumed that all p3hv originated from pure gam metabolism yielding a ratio of acetate carbon incorporated in p3hv of 0 26 c mol c mol zeng et al 2003 2 5 3 calculation of anaerobic acetate distribution the anaerobic acetate distribution over the sludge population was calculated by combining the granule size distribution f i total sludge volume v s biomass density ρ x vss and acetate equivalents calculated from the difference of pha levels at the end of the aerated phase and the end of the anaerobic phase δ ac i the procedure for the fraction of acetate fed ac fed in a size fraction f i a c is depicted in eq 1 1 f i a c f i v s ρ x vss δ ac i ac fed 2 5 4 determination of srt of granule size fractions the srt for the granule size fractions at steady state were calculated based on the cumulative excess sludge removed during one day via selective wasting and the granule size distribution in the reactor the collected excess sludge was fractioned via a stack of sieves with mesh sizes 1400 µm 1000 µm 800 µm and 400 µm and the amounts tss were subsequently determined for all fractions wsi g tss d 1 the fraction smaller than 400 µm was negligible at steady state and was therefore discarded the total mass of sludge of each fraction was calculated from the granule size distribution and mlss concentration in the reactor si the srt of a size fraction srti day was calculated from through the eq 2 2 sr t i w s i s i 3 results 3 1 start up the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors were both inoculated with approximately 0 5 g tss l 1 of crushed aerobic granular sludge previously enriched in a laboratory reactor operated under similar conditions haaksman et al 2020 the crushed seed sludge was sieved over a cascade of a 100 µm and a 63 µm sieve after which the fraction retained at the 63 µm sieve was used as inoculum fig 1 both the reactors were immediately operated under the same volumetric substrate acetate loading rate of 1 12 g cod l 1 d 1 the initial settling rate selection criterion was set at 1 m h 1 and was gradually increased to 10 m h 1 over the course of 19 days for both reactors 3 1 1 settleability and morphology development of the granular sludge in terms of svi5 and mlss in the reactors is depicted in fig 1 both reactors developed well settling granular sludge svi5 between 30 and 40 ml g 1 but the granulation occurred faster in the bottom fed reactor 26 µm d 1 for the pulse fed reactor versus 40 µm d 1 for the bottom fed reactor the amount of dry mass increased at a similar rate regardless of the anaerobic feeding regime the initial growth morphology of both systems was characterized by flocculent as well as granular growth fig 1 a b flocs were identified as translucent clusters using stereo zoom microscopy while small granules 100 200 µm appeared as non translucent and dense aggregates flocculent growth could not be detected in the pulse fed reactor after 15 days fig 2 c while flocs were observed in the bottom fed reactor up to 28 days of operation these observations coincided with the development of the sludge volume index svi5 fig 1 a the further development of the granular morphology was similar for both anaerobic feeding regimes 3 1 2 anaerobic acetate uptake efficiency the anaerobic acetate uptake was monitored on line by conductivity measurements see figure s1 for the estimated completeness of acetate uptake as function of time the pulse fed system developed complete anaerobic acetate uptake within two weeks after start up the bottom fed reactor took four weeks for obtaining full anaerobic acetate uptake this was due to short cut flow of the influent through the sludge bed during the first month after start up decreasing the effective anaerobic contact time with the sludge therefore part of the fed acetate was then not taken up anaerobically this can be considered a scale effect due to the limited sludge bed height and less optimized influent distribution manifold compared to full scale reactors this prolonged the aerobic availability of acetate compared to the pulse fed reactor and caused the extended presence of flocs in the bottom fed reactor the disappearance of flocculent growth coincided in both reactors with the moment of full anaerobic acetate uptake in the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors at days 15 and 28 respectively 3 2 steady state operation the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors were operated for a duration of 5 months until a stable granule size distribution had been achieved both systems were characterized and typical process parameters for both reactors are listed in table 1 the reactors have been operated at a similar average mlvss concentration substrate loading rate and srt considering the fluctuations in mlvss concentration sampled over the course of five weeks centred around 144th day of operation the biomass characteristics had developed to a similar level in both reactors the bottom fed reactor showed a slightly higher svi which had been observed since the start of the experiment other than that the difference in anaerobic feeding regime did not result in differences in biomass characteristics fish microscopy indicated an enrichment of ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i at similar high levels in both reactors figure s3 the mass distribution over the granules size fractions showed a higher unevenness for the bottom fed reactor compared to the pulse fed reactor 81 of the mass was present in granules larger than 1 mm in the bottom fed reactor compared to 66 in the pulse fed reactor fig 3 the main difference in biological nutrient removal was the substantially higher anaerobic p cod ratio and higher aerobic specific phosphate uptake rate of the pulse fed reactor other reactor characteristics relevant for further analysis of the effect of the anaerobic feeding regime on aerobic granulation are reported below 3 3 pha storage polymer distribution over granule size fractions the impact of the anaerobic feeding regime on the distribution of acetate over the granule size fractions was assessed once the granule population had stabilized in both the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors samples were taken from the mixed granular sludge suspension before and after the anaerobic feeding stage within the same cycle the mass fractions of p3hb and p3hv in the sludge samples were quantified after fractionation by sieving the majority of the pha storage pool was p3hb but considerable amounts of p3hv were detected in both the pulse fed and bottom fed systems table s1 the levels of phb and phv in the biomass were converted to the equivalent amount of acetate consumed before and after the anaerobic phase per amount of vss fig 4 a decreasing trend was observed for the relative amount of acetate consumed in the pulse fed system for increasing granule size fraction on the other hand the anaerobic bottom feeding favoured substrate uptake by the largest granule size fraction a considerable amount of pha remained in the bottom fed reactor at the end of aeration and this amount increased with granule size the pulse fed system showed a complete depletion of the pha storage pool negligible differences were observed between anaerobic acetate uptake rates and maximal storage capacities between both reactors and per sieve fraction in batch tests table 1 therefore the observed differences can be attributed to the difference in anaerobic contact mode applied in each reactor 3 4 anaerobic acetate load distribution and solids residence time to show the acetate load difference between the anaerobic feeding regimes the amounts of acetate converted to pha were combined with the measured vss distributions over the granule size fractions in each reactor fig 5 using this approach 94 and 81 of the acetate loads per cycle were recovered for the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors respectively in the bottom fed reactor a negligible expansion of the settled sludge bed was observed during the anaerobic phase and no acetate could be detected in the bulk liquid above the sludge bed throughout the anaerobic phase the acetate concentration in the bulk liquid therefore decreased from the initial level in the synthetic wastewater at the inlet to depletion before exiting at the top of the sludge bed although both reactors had fully granulated with similar size distributions the net acetate distribution differed substantially the pulse fed system showed minor differences in acetate load distribution over the granule size fractions while most of the acetate load was anaerobically consumed by the largest granule size fractions 1 mm present in the bottom fed reactor the acetate load distribution data were subsequently used to calculate the sludge loading rate per size fraction in both reactors the mass distribution over the granule size fractions in the reactor sludge wasted selectively with the effluent and sludge wasted manually were then used to calculate the srt of the individual granule size fractions the granule size distribution of all sludge removed from the reactor was averaged over a period of five days in the same week as the samples for measurement of the pha content had been taken both the sludge loading rate and srt per granule size fraction are depicted in fig 6 both systems showed an increase in srt for an increasing granule size regardless of the anaerobic feeding strategy the srt of the fraction 1400 µm was shorter in the pulse fed reactor than in the bottom fed reactor due to unintended accumulation of large granules in the effluent discharge port during aeration this had only a minor effect on the obtained size distribution compared to the bottom fed reactor in the pulse fed reactor the loading rate decreased as the granule size increased for the bottom fed reactor the sludge loading rate increased with increasing granule size 4 discussion two sequencing batch aerobic granular sludge reactors were operated to investigate the effect of the anaerobic contact mode on acetate distribution over granular size fractions and its effect on sludge granulation and dynamics of ebpr organisms synthetic wastewater was anaerobically pulse fed in one reactor while bottom feeding was applied in the other both reactors were inoculated with the same crushed aerobic granular sludge and were operated in the same way except for the aforementioned anaerobic phase the observed differences in the steady state characterization will be discussed next in more detail in relation to the applied anaerobic contact mode 4 1 acetate distribution over granule size fractions the biomass specific anaerobic acetate uptake mmol c ac equivalents g 1 vss and storage as pha was nearly independent of granule size for the pulse fed reactor while for the bottom fed reactor there was a clear increasing acetate uptake with increasing granule size fig 6 experimental estimation of the maximum acetate storage capacity 150 mg ac g 1 vss specific anaerobic acetate uptake rate 150 mg ac g 1 vss h 1 and biomass concentration were similar for both reactors table 1 also the dominant pao clade determined by fish was the same in both reactors clade i this indicates that the potential of the microbial ebpr population was highly similar between both operating regimes and in both systems the maximum acetate uptake capacity was not limiting the observed acetate uptake granules close to the influent distributor in the bottom fed reactor could only just be saturated at the end of the 60 minute feeding period this indicates that the differences in cod loading can be explained by the differences in liquid biofilm mass transfer to the granules for the two anaerobic feeding modes the driving force from the concentration of acetate in the bulk liquid over time and place experienced by granules and mass transfer rate are the main differentiating variables for the pulse fed reactor both the acetate concentration and effective contact time were the same for all granules due to the mixed anaerobic reaction phase therefore the liquid biofilm mass transfer was the determining mechanism the mass transfer coefficient through a liquid biofilm interface depends on liquid velocity local around the biofilm and the surface area since the surface to volume ratio decreases with increasing granule size the overall mass transfer coefficient decreases for increasing granule size cussler 2009 nicolella et al 1998 effectively the efficiency of the granular volume usage decreases with increasing granule size liu et al 2005 the extent of the actual difference in loading between depends on the initial penetrated volume the near equal acetate loading with a slightly decreasing trend with increasing granule size observed in the pulse fed reactor is consistent with substrate uptake limited by surface to volume ratio the effect is limited due to the high initial acetate concentration acetate loading rate and selective retention of larger granules if an anaerobic zone with mixed tanks in series would get continuous feeding with real wastewater as in a continuous flow system with both lower concentrations of rbcod and rbcod loading rate the advantage for smaller granules would be more pronounced the same analysis yields a different result for the bottom fed reactor the observed increase in anaerobic acetate loading with increasing granule size is due to a decreasing acetate concentration together with a potentially decreasing average granule size over the height of the sludge bed the mass transfer limitation for granules of increasing size due to the decreasing surface to volume ratio is thus counteracted and reversed by the higher probability for larger granules to experience a higher bulk liquid substrate concentration the importance of this selective feeding of the largest granule size fraction has recently been underlined as one of the main mechanisms for stable aerobic granulation in bottom fed ags reactors in practice van dijk et al 2022 bottom feeding through a sludge bed thus favours increased anaerobic substrate uptake by the larger granule size fractions the difference in the distribution of stored substrate forced by the anaerobic contact mode is illustrated in fig 7 4 2 cod loading rate versus srt both the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors showed an increasing srt for increasing granule size fractions fig 6 a such a trend was expected based on the preferential wasting of slower settling sludge fraction as means of granular sludge selection for the cod loading rate on the other hand fig 6 b the pulse fed system showed a slight decrease with granule size while in the bottom fed reactor the acetate loading rate increased substantially with granule size in continuous flow through cas systems the sludge loading rate decreases on average with increasing srt for all sludge particles metcalf and eddy 2013 this relation does also apply to ags systems on average in cas systems however the probability distributions around the average of both substrate and sludge discharge follow the hydraulic residence time distribution without any impact of the properties of sludge particles e g size or difference in settling rate in this study the average sludge yield was the same for both reactors however the difference between granules sizes indicates that the internal redistribution of biomass growth between size fractions was different in the pulse fed reactor compared to the bottom fed reactor the redistribution of biomass from larger to smaller aggregates is a common property of biofilm systems which balances growth and biomass removal pereboom 1994 this yields an increase of srt deeper into a biofilm tijhuis et al 1994 and is specifically of interest for aerobic granular sludge systems performing ebpr morgenroth and wilderer 1999 winkler et al 2012 while the srt distribution of biofilm aggregates of different sizes can be influenced via selective wasting and process conditions affecting detachment adjusting the distribution of substrate i e the distribution of biomass growth over size fractions is more difficult the kinetics of substrate uptake and mass transfer determine the distribution of growth in biofilm systems with completely mixed reactors as was previously discussed for the pulse fed reactor the comparison with a bottom fed reactor in the current study shows that the uncoupling of cod uptake in the anaerobic phase from growth in the aerobic phase in aerobic granular sludge systems provides a means of control over the distribution of biomass growth this has two main implications first the granule size distribution can be influenced by directing the available cod towards smaller or larger granules second the anaerobic penetration depth of cod can be influenced which in turn influences the location of microbial conversions within granules the anaerobic contact mode thus provides an additional tool that can be used to optimize the granule size distribution and biological nutrient removal in aerobic granular sludge processes for wastewater treatment 4 3 residual levels of pha after aeration a remarkable difference in residual pha levels at the end of aeration was observed between the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors the bottom fed reactor showed substantial levels of residual pha after aeration for all granule size fractions while the fractions were depleted of pha in the pulse fed reactor fig 4 cultures enriched for ebpr have been shown to exhibit flexibility in the residual pha content depending on the operational parameters including srt smolders et al 1995a influent p cod ratio welles et al 2017 polyphosphate storage levels acevedo et al 2012 ph filipe et al 2001a and cycle length kuba et al 1997 the operational conditions during the aerobic phase were the same for both reactors i e kla dissolved oxygen concentration and duration and thus did not cause the difference in remaining pha the remaining pha was observed in all granule size classes of the bottom fed reactor indicating the residual levels of pha were not affected by the differences between the granule size distributions of the reactors therefore the anaerobic contact mode likely caused this difference specifically the ratio of anaerobic loading of acetate of a granule size fraction to aerobic time in completely mixed enrichment cultures and in the pulse fed granular system presented here most organisms in the active layer of all granular size fractions experience the same conditions each cycle i e same amount of acetate taken up same penetration depth and same aerobic time to convert it this gives the organisms the opportunity to fully optimise their resource allocation to maximal growth silva et al 2019 in the bottom fed reactor all granules are distributed over the settled bed prior to the anaerobic feeding the largest granules will be more distributed towards the bottom of the sludge bed while the smallest granules would be more towards the top it was estimated that the acetate front reached up to 36 of the sludge bed from the bottom of the reactor based on the measured specific acetate uptake rate bed porosity and superficial liquid velocity during feeding figure s4 the partial anaerobic contact of the sludge bed with acetate led to a highly variable acetate uptake for a granule per cycle depending on its position in the sludge bed after settling although larger granules have a higher probability of settling more towards the bottom of the sludge bed the applied superficial liquid velocity during feeding i e 0 46 m h 1 is well below the minimum fluidization velocity therefore negligible bed expansion and no further stratification were observed during feeding granules of all size fractions thus had a substantial probability of residing in the bottom part of the sludge bed and thus be in contact with acetate during feeding this might force the organisms storage metabolism into a more resilient state so it can deal with variations in substrate availability this would underline the flexibility of ca accumulibacter phosphatis to modulate the metabolism for optimal carbon utilization to the prevailing conditions silva et al 2020 another possible explanation is that the fixed length of the aerobic phase was too short to fully convert all pha for that part of the granules that received a peak anaerobic loading during a specific cycle granules at the bottom of the bottom fed reactor will have been exposed to acetate during the full 60 min of feeding and these granules will have therefore a higher pha content than average the aerobic time is equal for all granules and potentially too short when a granules has been near the inlet at the bottom during feeding this would on average lead to a residual level of pha this hypothesis could not be investigated any further based on the available data and could the topic of future study some work has been done studying the effect of fluctuating operational conditions on the performance of ebpr schuler et al 2011 mainly due to the residence time distribution in continuous flow through reactors however the width of the anaerobic load distribution as observed in the bottom fed reactor used here was substantially larger and cannot be directly compared furthermore full scale aerobic granular sludge systems will be even more variable than the lab scale systems this effect has not been considered well in the literature but is essential to further optimise ebpr systems especially when employing ags 4 4 impact of contact method on anaerobic storage metabolism the anaerobic conversion stoichiometry of acetate to phas was surprisingly different for the pulse fed and bottom fed reactors as well as for different granule size fractions within each reactor the ratio of p3hv p3hb accumulated during the anaerobic phase was on average twofold higher in bottom fed reactor compared to the pulse fed reactor with the largest granule size fraction having the highest ratio table s1 both reactors were dominated by ca accumulibacter phosphatis figure s1 the observed amount of ortho phosphate released anaerobically was lower in the bottom fed reactor compared to the pulse fed reactor these two observations are congruent the trend continued further during the aerobic phase where a nearly two fold lower specific aerobic phosphate uptake rate was observed in the bottom fed reactor compared to the pulse fed reactor table 1 it has been indicated before that ca accumulibacter phosphatis has a flexible metabolism and can operate between a full phosphate accumulation metabolism pam and a full glycogen accumulating metabolism gam oyserman et al 2016 silva et al 2020 welles et al 2015 it seems that the pulse fed system operated at full pam while the bottom fed system exhibited a mixed pam gam phenotype fish has confirmed a full absence of known gaos in the microbial population while ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i was dominant figure s3 these observations underline again the ability of ca accumulibacter phosphatis to modulate its metabolism depending on the environmental conditions silva et al 2020 although the driver for the differences in metabolism were not determined a decrease of the p cod ratio in the influent has been found to increase the ratio of gam pam in suspended growth systems welles et al 2017 in this study this was likely not a factor since the influent composition was the same sufficient polyphosphate was present in both reactors at the applied average srt for full pam to take place if the differences are examined at the aggregate level i e assuming similar microbial activity throughout each granule with negligible spatial gradients the difference in pam gam metabolism could be related to the aforementioned difference in pha remaining at the end of the aeration phase in that case the pam metabolism could be the most optimal metabolism for systems with stable substrate loading while gam metabolism contributes to resilience to more dynamic substrate loading per granule another hypothesis is that differences in spatial gradients within granules contributed to the observed difference in pam gam ratios between both reactors the anaerobic penetration depth of acetate in the granules in the bottom fed reactor is larger compared to granules in the pulse fed reactor fig 7 the aerobic penetration depth of oxygen was estimated to be similar for both reactors due to the same operational conditions i e the same transfer resistances for gas liquid and liquid biofilms during uptake of phosphate and always more shallow than acetate oxygen only penetrates further into the granules once the phosphate in the bulk liquid has been depleted thereby limiting the interior of the granules to perform gam the outer regions initially penetrated with oxygen are able to perform full pam the spatial separation between metabolisms would be most pronounced for the granules in the bottom fed reactor which could in turn contribute the observed difference in pam gam ratio between anaerobic pulse feeding and bottom feeding at the reactor level these observations warrant further investigation into the effect on the metabolism of ca accumulibacter phosphatis of both the dynamic anaerobic loading as well as the effect of differences in penetration depth of acetate and oxygen on potential spatial separation of pam and gam within individual granules which could not be separated in this study if the impact of dynamic operational conditions is also reflected in the pam gam ratio for ca accumulibacter phosphatis it might form a proxy for the study of the occurring variability on the cellular level 4 5 practical implications the influent with acetate as sole carbon source combined with an anaerobic contact phase selects completely for granular growth morphology and low svis martins et al 2004 regardless of the anaerobic contact mode applied municipal sewage contains lower concentrations of volatile fatty acids henze et al 2000 than the synthetic wastewater used in this study in full scale ebpr systems easy hydrolysable and fermentable cod after biological conversion into vfa also contribute to the growth of ebpr organisms brdjanovic et al 2016 chap 2 2 enhanced biological phosphorus removal drewnowski and makinia 2011 tykesson et al 2002 these extra microbial conversions will have to be considered when translating the observations here to full scale systems however general principles can be deducted of the present work design of the anaerobic feeding is an important aspect for obtaining stable aerobic granular sludge the current implemented full scale aerobic granular sludge process nereda technology applies bottom feeding and excess sludge extraction from the top of the bed this removes the weakest settling part of the sludge and provides most substrate to the best settling large granules fraction of the sludge van dijk et al 2022 thereby enhancing stability of the granular sludge bed there are ongoing developments for alternative implementations of the ags technology in sbr as well as continuous systems a completely mixed anaerobic feeding sbr has been proposed and tested at pilot scale rocktäschel et al 2015 however there it was shown that this only resulted in stable operation if the wastewater has already high acetate concentrations in the influent with a large rbcod fraction in the influent like in this study selective wasting based on sludge settleability becomes the main driver for stable granulation this can be deduced from the similarity in the granule size distribution of both reactors with different anaerobic feeding modes this underlines the observations in this study that granulation can be obtained independent of anaerobic feeding mode but that bottom feeding more readily results in stable operation if the influent composition is less favourable with the aim to further develop ags technology in conventional continuous operated wastewater treatment systems kent et al 2018 the attention for the design of the anaerobic contact tank is likely even more critical as has been reported in existing plants with strong plug flow conditions granule formation is already induced redmond et al 2019 wei et al 2020 indicating the advantage of having a strong concentration gradient as in the pulse fed system in this study in a completely mixed anaerobic tank acetate concentrations remain very low and diffusion limitation will likely prevent ca accumulibacter phosphatis microcolonies to grow out into larger granules especially for real wastewater where only a limited amount of readily biodegradable cod is available for anaerobic conversion and storage it is important to preferentially feed the largest granules the challenge for stable granulation will be to design a system where also under continuous feeding conditions the readily biodegradable cod is directed preferentially to the largest granule fraction interestingly we observed quite a difference in ebpr metabolism between the two feeding modes with respect to ratio of pam gam metabolism and pha remaining at the end of the aerated period this is not well recognised yet in the literature and would need further attention our initial data seem to indicate that the bio p removal capacity is not directly influenced but the overall stability and response to disturbances e g monday effect might be related to these differences brdjanovic et al 1998 rieger et al 2001 filipe et al 2001b indeed indicated that stabilising the feed to an ebpr process minimized disturbances however the effect of different pam gam metabolism was not yet well recognised and evaluated at the time it might be relevant for the batch scheduling of the existing aerobic granular sludge facilities for example 5 conclusion an experimental study was performed at lab scale to investigate the anaerobic contact mode of aerobic granular sludge with substrate on the distribution of substrate storage over the granule size fractions and the effects on sludge characteristics two reactors were operated identically except for the anaerobic feeding phases one reactor was fed from the bottom through the sludge bed while the other was fed in a short pulse and subsequently mixed anaerobically the following conclusions were derived from the observations bottom feeding primarily directs substrate towards the large granular size classes i e large volume and closer to the bottom while completely mixed pulse feeding gives a more equal distribution of substrate over all granule sizes i e surface area dependant both feeding methods resulted in stable granulation with large granules however in the completely mixed pulse fed system the smaller granules are preferentially supplied with substrate due to their relatively higher surface to volume ratio the preferential feeding of the larger granules in bottom feeding will enhance and stabilise the granulation in such systems certainly under less advantageous wastewater compositions then the acetate feed used in this study the anaerobic contact mode directly impacts the substrate distribution over the different granule sizes irrespective of the solids retention time of a granule as a unit the systems showed very similar microbial populations with mainly ca accumulibacter phosphatis present in the biomass they differed strongly in their phenotype with respect to pam gam metabolism aerobic phosphate uptake rate and residual pha at the end of the aeration phase these phenomena need attention in future ebpr studies since they are likely relevant for the full scale stability of ebpr processes funding this work was funded by the delfland water authority delfluent

15012,quorum sensing qs is an ideal strategy for boosting the operating performance of electroactive biofilms eabs but its potential effects on the protection of electroactive biofilms against environmental shocks e g hypersaline shock have been rarely revealed in this study a qs signaling molecule the n 3 oxo dodecanoyl l homoserine lactone was employed to promote the anti shock property of the eabs against extreme saline shock the maximum current density of the qs regulated biofilm recovered to 0 17 ma cm2 after 10 salinity exposure which was much higher than those of its counterparts the laser scanning confocal microscope confirmed a thicker and more compact biofilm with the presence of the qs signaling molecule the extracellular polymeric substances eps might play a crucial role in the anti shocking behaviors as the polysaccharides in eps of qs biofilm had doubled compared to the groups with acylase the qs quencher the microbial community analysis indicated that the qs molecule enriched the relative abundance of key species including pseudomonas sp and geobacter sp which were both beneficial to the stability and electroactivity of the biofilms the functional genes related to the bacterial community were also up regulated with the presence of the qs molecule these results highlight the importance of qs effects in protecting electroactive biofilm under extreme environmental shock which provides effective and feasible strategies for the future development of microbial electrochemical technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quorum sensing electroactive biofilms extracellular polymeric substances hypersaline shock protective strategy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the electroactive microorganisms eams feature the unique nature of efficient extracellular electron transfer eet within their neighboring environments like other microbial species minerals and redox active chemicals lovley and holmes 2022 shi et al 2016 based on that the eams play key roles in the development of versatile bioelectrochemical systems bes with great potencies in the domains of microbial electrosynthesis in organic pollutants removal and resource recovery in water matrices kelly and he 2014 kracke et al 2015 the environmentalists have also continued to enrich the bes configurations and develop bes into larger pilot reactors for municipal wastewater treatments and bioremediation of polluted environment feng et al 2014 liang et al 2018 zhang and angelidaki 2014 either way eams frequently live and exert effects in dense and diverse communities called electroactive biofilms eabs and it is the well being of eabs that drives bes functioning properly for a given environmental issue ter heijne et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 accordingly while the universal bioelectrochemical apparatuses are in the midst of research and development the physiology and pertinent regulation of eab are gaining more interest actually the eab has long been criticized as fragile to accidental shocks like ph fluctuation heavy metals interference and toxicity of some chemicals du et al 2017 hou et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b those environmental disturbances consequentially pose undesirable chaos to eet correlated metabolic activities and the community structure of eabs hou et al 2020 researchers recently proposed several protection strategies for improving the anti shocking properties of eab by equipping extra microbial compatible layers on biofilms to increase resistance against environmental shocks for example q du et al encapsulated eab with self assembled polydopamine to form a shell like polymer layer du et al 2017 this arrangement preserved considerate cell viability after severe acidic shocks ph 0 5 and 1 5 additionally the dopamine polymer was also beneficial to interconnecting transmembrane embedded electron conduits for better eet performance yu et al 2020 anyway the selections of macromolecules were primarily concentrated in the chemicals with outstanding biocompatibility abundant functional groups and superior adhesive effects interestingly the extracellular polymeric substances eps that spontaneously derived from microorganisms are also responsible for the eet process and importantly the protective behaviors of eab cai et al 2022 the eps usually compromises polysaccharides proteins and humic substances containing various functional groups that actively participate in versatile biochemical processes cai et al 2022 recently r hou and co workers provided significant evidence explaining that the eps from eab could act as a barrier against toxic ag ions hou et al 2020 they also pointed out that the components of eps could be regulated by varying cultivating conditions i e different anode potentials in this case however anode potential as a key parameter controlling metabolic activities of eab is unbefitting to be freely changed when facing a given environmental issue in this regard some alternative strategies for eps regulation are waiting to further exploitation previous research had shown that quorum sensing qs a basic intercellular communication process guided by specific chemical signals could positively alter the physiochemical properties of microbiota and consequently upgrade the performance of electroactive biofilms paquete et al 2022 especially the n acyl homoserine lactones ahls as exogenous qs signals were reported effective in the expression of eps related genes chen et al 2017 however the effects of ahls on the protection of eab are still rarely reported here in this study we used one of the ahls as qs signals to investigate the possible effects on the anti shocking property of electroactive biofilms the high salinity of up to 10 calculated as the mass of nacl was simulated to challenge the stability and robustness of eabs with or without the addition of qs signals the components of eps and the evolution of microbial communities were also therewith investigated and discussed the results of this work are expected to explore feasible eab associated protective strategies against harsh environmental shocks 2 materials and methods 2 1 electroactive biofilm construction and high salinity exposure each electroactive biofilm in this work was cultivated onto a graphite plate 3 cm 2 5 cm 0 1 cm as the working electrode in a typical three electrode system with a working volume of 100 ml fig 1a note that the graphite plate was polished by sandpaper grit type 400 and soaked in 3 m hno3 solution for 12 h to improve hydrophilicity a 0 2 v potential against an ag agcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs she was constantly applied to the working electrode by a potentiostat chi 1040c ch instrument china this anode potential was favored for eab cultivation hou et al 2020 a titanium wire 0 5 mm in diameter placed near the reference electrode was employed as the counter electrode the nutrient medium within 10 mm sodium acetate as the electron donor was artificially prepared as previously described balch et al 1979 kim and logan 2011 zhou et al 2018a the inoculum used in this work was obtained from a running long term sediment microbial fuel cell in which the anode chamber was incubated with the shoreside sediment sludge ca 10 20 cm beneath the water surface of the pearl river estuary at nansha district guangzhou china one of the typical n acylhomoserine lactones ahls named n 3 oxo dodecanoyl l homoserine lactone 3oc12 hsl was used as the exogenous qs signal molecular that has been proved capable of stimulating mix culture eabs jing et al 2019 the acylase i from aspergillus sp at a concentration of 6 μg ml was used as the qs quencher overall there were four groups of eabs constructed in this work one experimental group qs group was added with the 3oc12 hsl at a final concentration of 10 μm and another group qs ac group in which both the 3oc12 hsl and acylase i were simultaneously added was also set for comparison note that the acylase is a commonly used agents for specifically quenching both exogenous and endogenous qs signals ahls chen et al 2017 the eab with the only addition of acylase ac group was constructed to investigate the potential effects of endogenous ahl while the blank group without any acylase or ahl was also set as control all experiments were conducted in fed batch mode at an ambient temperature around 25 c the nutrient medium was replaced when the system current dropped below 0 15 ma and the qs signals and quenchers were added along with the nutrient medium the three electrode systems were operated for 4 cycles around 25 days of cultivation to achieve mature eabs the eabs were considered maturely stable when the system currents reached their peaks and were repeatable in at least two successive cycles all eab related tests involved duplicate mature eabs samples from parallelly operating reactors unless otherwise stated the saline solution of 10 salinity was prepared by dissolving 10 g nacl in 100 ml deionized water the graphite plates with mature eabs from all the groups were taken out and entirely soaked into the saline solution for 4 h to mimic a hypersaline shock after that the graphite plates were carefully and tenderly washed with running deionized water and then reinstalled in the three electrode systems for further analysis 2 2 biofilm characterization the biofilms were transferred into a phosphate buffer pbs 50 mm ph 7 0 before and after high salinity exposure and the biofilms were stained using a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit l7012 thermo fisher scientific inc usa following the manufacturer s instruction the stained biofilms were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope lsm 700 carl zeiss germany for cell survival examination the metabolic activities of eabs were also assessed by the consumption rate of total organic carbon toc that was measured using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan at certain intervals other than constantly monitoring the current variation during experiments the cyclic voltammetry cv tests were in situ conducted anaerobically in the same three electrode system the scan rate was constant at 5 mv s from 0 8 v to 0 6 v each cv test was independently performed at least three times at room temperature 25 c 2 3 eps extraction and analysis the extracellular polymeric substances were extracted from mature eabs cultivated for at least three cycles following the previously reported procedures zhou et al 2021 in brief the biofilms on the graphite plates were carefully scraped into pbs solution and then manually vibrated for five minutes the mixed solutions were heated in a water bath at 60 for 30 min subsequently the solutions were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 25 min and the supernatants were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters to exclude all unwanted solids or cells the final eps solutions were obtained after 30 min dialysis using several dialysis bags to remove salts and micromolecular medium residues 500 da md 34 union carbide usa the three main components of eps were determined by spectrophotometry zhou et al 2021 details of quantitative analysis on proteins humic substances and polysaccharides were described in the supplementary information text s1 additionally the excitation emission matrix eem spectra of each eps sample were examined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fs5 edinburgh instruments u k to further investigate the eps variation influenced by qs signals the eem fluorescence spectra were scanned at increments of 5 nm in an excitation range and an emission range of 200 500 nm and 250 550 nm wavelengths respectively 2 4 high throughput sequencing analysis the dna of biofilms from the different treatments was extracted using the e z n a bacterial dna kit d3350 02 omega bio tek usa the dna samples were quantified using an ultramicro spectrophotometer nanodrop one technologies thermo scientific usa and only the samples with 30 ng ul dna concentration were qualified and sent for high throughput sequencing analysis the extracted dna samples were stored at 80 c for further analysis the primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were selected to amplify the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of microbial 16s rrna genes liu et al 2021 the high throughput sequencing analysis was conducted on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc usa by magigene co ltd guangzhou china the raw data of sequencing analysis were processed as previously described liu et al 2021 the compositions of microbial communities were analyzed via tools of microbiomeanalyst www microbiomeanalyst ca and r language chong et al 2020 the annotation of functional genes was identified counted and compared via tax4fun2 in r language moreira et al 2022 3 results and discussions 3 1 the qs effects on eabs against extreme salinity shock the current densities of the three electrode systems were continuously recorded as illustrated in fig 1b the current densities varied with the eabs cultivating conditions the qs signal 3oc12 hsl could help to elevate the electroactivities of the biofilms specifically the qs group reached the highest current density up to above 0 3 ma cm2 by contrast the evidently inferior current was recorded in response to the addition of qs quenching agents the acylase group those benign manifestations have confirmed the positive regulation of qs signals on the enhancement of eab electroactivities as indicated in a rich collection of similar studies jing et al 2019 liu et al 2015 other than the satisfactory power generation performance here we demonstrated the indirect protective effects of qs signals under hypersaline attack for the first time the blank and acylase group encountered significant decreases 70 0 and 93 3 respectively in the current densities in the following cycle right after the 10 salinity attack fig 1c indicating the biofilms might be seriously damaged in these two groups surprisingly the eabs cultivated in the presence of qs signals seemed less brittle to the salinity attack as 50 7 of the current density recovered though it was unlikely to completely escape from decreases in current density the results explicitly suggested that the qs signals could significantly increase the robustness of eabs against hypersaline conditions 3 2 qs regulated bacterial physiology for enhancing halotolerance of the eab further characterizations of the biofilms were conducted to ascertain the qs effects on the augmentation of eab s anti shocking properties firstly the biofilm morphology visualized by clsm indicated that the spatial structures of mature eabs were critically regulated by qs effects fig 2 the qs signals induced extensive and tight biofilm formed on the graphite plates compared with relatively sparser biofilms in the other three groups it would also promote cellular cooperation in biofilms van gestel et al 2014 yan et al 2017 which would confirm the reasonableness of stabilizing biofilm performance in extreme environments abisado et al 2018 as for the spatial arrangement after hypersaline shock severe decay of biofilms was observed in response to the high salinity stresses fig 2 especially for the groups in which the qs was quenched the cell viability was demolished as the red fluorescent pixels dramatically emerged indicating massive death in such biofilms the less amount and inactive cells attached to the electrodes would to some extent explain the inferior current densities of qs signals quenched biofilms in this regard the results of clsm have provided direct evidence confirming the positive role of qs on biofilm robustness this robustness might have notable benefits on the paths to practical applications of bioelectrochemical systems in salinity fluctuating scenarios the salinity fluctuation which frequently happens in wastewater treatments is one of the most serious challenges to the microbial structure generally the salinity fluctuates between 2 and 3 while in extreme situations it would peak beyond 5 feng et al 2015 the overmuch salinity might introduce cell plasmolysis and even the death of microorganisms due to osmotic pressure increases causing colonization fading and dispersal of eams as illustrated in fig 2 feng et al 2015 thus such protective manipulation of qs is of great practical interest to relieve the stress of hypersaline shock the metabolic activities of eabs were estimated by comparing the consumption rates of the toc and the results are presented in figure s1 surprisingly the acylase did not exert a negative influence on the uptake of the carbon sources that was possible because of the differentiated distribution of biomass in reactors as acylase in its concentration of 6 μg ml mainly interfered with microbial aggregating behaviors paul et al 2009 cells would scatter in bulk solution which would in turn accidentally gain access to the organic sources with a greater chance on the contrary the condensed biofilm might hinder the outside in transportation of carbon sources that would probably explain the higher consumption of toc in the acylase group over the qs group however the rate constants k values calculated via first order dynamic simulation had undergone dramatic decreases after the 10 salinity shock without the addition of qs signals for the blank and acylase groups the k values dropped nearly 64 1 and 44 1 respectively caused by the loss of bacteria not only in the bulk solution but in the biofilm matrix the electroactivities of eabs were investigated via cv curves under the turnover condition in the presence of acetate as shown in fig 3 the responses of the catalytic current in the qs group were superior to those of the other three groups which was consistent with the former finding jing et al 2019 the pair of redox peaks observed at 0 29 v reduction peak and 0 08 v oxidation peak were tagged with characteristic extracellular electron transfer signals liu et al 2008 zhu et al 2012 which directly implied better interactions between the electrode and metabolic activity of biofilm in the qs group meanwhile the extreme salinity shock led to decreases in current densities of all groups due to the severe disperse of living cells shown in fig 2 notably apart from the limiting current densities the cv curves had not been re shaped after hypersaline shock indicating that the dominant redox pairs may not be affected during this process in sum the biofilm matrix collapses rather than metabolic chaos might be the key reason for the degeneration of microbial electroactivities the results also strongly implied that the qs mainly functioned on the physiological regulation for the protection of electroactive biofilms from bacteria loss in the hypersaline environment since the formation of biofilm was closely related to the eps yin et al 2019 in the present work the differences in eps samples extracted from each treatment were analyzed to further investigate the qs effects on the halotolerance of the eab 3 3 qs altered the components of eps microbes grow in structured communities in which cell aggregates are encased in a self produced extracellular matrix i e eps the secretion of eps was acknowledged as an indirect response of both the cells and biofilms to the surrounding environment and the variation of the components in eps might be able to express different biofilm behaviors decho and gutierrez 2017 yin et al 2019 from the 3d eem spectra figure s2 and table s1 despite there was the slight variation of fluorescence in the region i and ii corresponding to aromatic proteins no remarkable differences had shown in terms of fluorescent organic matters in the four eps samples from different treatments however those eps isolates showed various contents of three main components i e proteins humic substances and polysaccharides revealed by the quantitative analysis fig 4a especially the eps obtained from the qs group showed the highest polysaccharides indicating that the biosynthesis and secretion of polysaccharides were up regulated by quorum sensing the polysaccharides were the key structure for cell aggregation and biofilm formation vu et al 2009 and the positive regulation of qs on the expression of relevant genes had also been previously confirmed parsek and greenberg 2005 it could then be explainable why the most condensed biofilm of the qs group had been observed in the clsm unlike artificial skin like structures e g polydopamine the eps was originally secreted during biomass growth and iteration therefore its biocompatibility would not be an issue for electroactive biofilms because of the high redox activity mainly reflected in the high potential bias of the bulk biofilm the biofilm shared intimate contact in which more frequent and complicated interactions with environmental media would occur lovley and holmes 2022 sometimes this intimacy caused unwanted settling of nonbiologically born chemicals e g transition metals or organic polymers onto the biofilm surface lovley and holmes 2022 the eps compared with the artificial protective screen could provide a more powerful defense against outside in metal invasion like ag of the biofilms hou et al 2020 in the meantime it maintained a basic tunnel for microbes environment communication decho and gutierrez 2017 this is meaningful to improve the resistance of electroactive biofilm by the regulation of eps previous research had agreed that the exopolymers from bacteria especially extracellular glycol like polymers might have a strong metal binding capability and particularly showed a high affinity for na over other soluble metal ions geddie and sutherland 1993 gutierrez et al 2008 as discovered that the polysaccharide increased in the eps derived from qs regulated biofilm it would to some extent slow down the diffusion of sodium ions due to the thick hydration shell introduced by the extracellular polysaccharide zhao et al 2016 additionally the thicker biofilm of the qs group also provided significant redundancy against the hypersaline shock in sum the eps was not only a connection between biofilms and their habitats but also an essential consolidation of cells physical states survival and adaptation that could be strongly altered by quorum sensing fig 4b 3 4 microbial communities of eabs were controlled by qs signals the microbial communities under different treatments were subsequently analyzed in this study the common and unique otus were shown in the venn diagram figure s3 the ratios of the unique otus in the four groups qs qs ac ac and blank could be as high as 56 1 36 0 41 9 and 70 2 respectively indicating the structures of electroactive biofilms were largely varied in the presence of the qs molecule and or qs quencher as shown in fig 5a the positive electric bias has significantly altered the community structure of which the proteobacteria and the firmicutes become the dominant bacterial phyla accounting for 77 3 97 2 of the four eabs it was not surprising since previous research had confirmed a similar phenomenon and many electroactive bacteria were classified in the two phyla hou et al 2020 yan et al 2017 as for the relative abundance at the genus level the bacterial communities could be largely varied fig 5b the abundance of pseudomonas sp petrimonas sp proteiniphilum sp and thiobacillus sp in the qs group was significantly increased from the standardized abundance profiles figure s4 for more details the pseudomonas sp which was a disadvantageous group in the inoculum evolved in the electroactive biofilms of four groups its relative abundance had increased to 20 0 and 12 5 in the qs and blank groups respectively while in the ac involved groups this species only occupied less than 2 0 of the biofilm communities the pseudomonas sp was reported as a typical electroactive species that had an interconnected network of ahl based quorum sensing systems papenfort and bassler 2016 venkataraman et al 2010 in terms of the anti shocking properties the pseudomonas sp also played a significant role in biofilm protection by secreting exopolysaccharides in the eps matrix to establish tolerance against the severe environment colvin et al 2011 jennings et al 2015 the petrimonas sp which increased its relative abundance to 12 5 in the qs group was also reported particularly correlating to the long chain ahls e g 3oc12 hsl in this case peng et al 2021 similarly the geobacter sp had also become one of the dominant species though its relative abundance fluctuated in four experimental groups fig 5 the geobacter sp accounting for 25 0 to 55 2 of electroactive biofilms was well known exoelectrogenic bacteria that predominated in the close to electrode area of the acetate consuming biofilm since they had to keep direct contact with solid electrodes via their cytochrome conduits and e pili for extracellular electron transfer cao et al 2020 yan et al 2021 in this case the stability of geobacter sp might be conducive to the recovery of eab after hyper salinity shock the electrode fixed at 0 2 v vs ag agcl reference electrode could simultaneously serve as an external electron acceptor and inhabitant for exoelectrogens microorganisms for the electrode respiring species e g geobacter sp that favored direct contact with the electrode they lay at the heart of electroactive biofilm and exported electrons generated during metabolism or from electron transfer with other species for the generation of system current fessler et al 2022 as discussed above the salinity might have less influence on the inner biofilm due to the higher contents of polysaccharides in the eps of the qs group therefore the stability of the inner biofilm protected by the qs regulated eps might contribute to the quick current recovery of the qs group after hypersaline shock the predicted functional features of microbial metabolism in three eabs could bring a better understanding of the qs effects on anti shock properties basically the functional genes were categorized into four metabolic groups genetic information processing cellular processes metabolism and environmental information processing fig 6 generally the genes in groups of cellular processes and environmental information processing had been suppressed with the addition of the qs quenching molecule acylase specifically the cellular community 5 86 for the ac group 6 67 for the qs group and 6 88 for the blank group respectively was the main pathway in the group of cellular processes which was intimately relative to the biofilm formation and quorum sensing in microbial consortia bandara et al 2012 the metabolism pathways membrane transport and signal transduction belonging to the group of environmental information processing were closely related to extracellular electron transfer and regulation of diverse cellular functions respectively bandara et al 2012 zhao et al 2022 importantly the proportions of glycan biosynthesis and metabolism increased with the addition of the qs signaling molecule 0 70 for the ac group 0 82 for the qs group and 0 78 for the blank group respectively these results indicated a positive regulation of qs the biofilm formation and its potential anti shock properties 4 conclusions overall this study demonstrated efficient protection of electroactive biofilms from hypersaline shock by biocompatible qs

15012,quorum sensing qs is an ideal strategy for boosting the operating performance of electroactive biofilms eabs but its potential effects on the protection of electroactive biofilms against environmental shocks e g hypersaline shock have been rarely revealed in this study a qs signaling molecule the n 3 oxo dodecanoyl l homoserine lactone was employed to promote the anti shock property of the eabs against extreme saline shock the maximum current density of the qs regulated biofilm recovered to 0 17 ma cm2 after 10 salinity exposure which was much higher than those of its counterparts the laser scanning confocal microscope confirmed a thicker and more compact biofilm with the presence of the qs signaling molecule the extracellular polymeric substances eps might play a crucial role in the anti shocking behaviors as the polysaccharides in eps of qs biofilm had doubled compared to the groups with acylase the qs quencher the microbial community analysis indicated that the qs molecule enriched the relative abundance of key species including pseudomonas sp and geobacter sp which were both beneficial to the stability and electroactivity of the biofilms the functional genes related to the bacterial community were also up regulated with the presence of the qs molecule these results highlight the importance of qs effects in protecting electroactive biofilm under extreme environmental shock which provides effective and feasible strategies for the future development of microbial electrochemical technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quorum sensing electroactive biofilms extracellular polymeric substances hypersaline shock protective strategy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the electroactive microorganisms eams feature the unique nature of efficient extracellular electron transfer eet within their neighboring environments like other microbial species minerals and redox active chemicals lovley and holmes 2022 shi et al 2016 based on that the eams play key roles in the development of versatile bioelectrochemical systems bes with great potencies in the domains of microbial electrosynthesis in organic pollutants removal and resource recovery in water matrices kelly and he 2014 kracke et al 2015 the environmentalists have also continued to enrich the bes configurations and develop bes into larger pilot reactors for municipal wastewater treatments and bioremediation of polluted environment feng et al 2014 liang et al 2018 zhang and angelidaki 2014 either way eams frequently live and exert effects in dense and diverse communities called electroactive biofilms eabs and it is the well being of eabs that drives bes functioning properly for a given environmental issue ter heijne et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 accordingly while the universal bioelectrochemical apparatuses are in the midst of research and development the physiology and pertinent regulation of eab are gaining more interest actually the eab has long been criticized as fragile to accidental shocks like ph fluctuation heavy metals interference and toxicity of some chemicals du et al 2017 hou et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b those environmental disturbances consequentially pose undesirable chaos to eet correlated metabolic activities and the community structure of eabs hou et al 2020 researchers recently proposed several protection strategies for improving the anti shocking properties of eab by equipping extra microbial compatible layers on biofilms to increase resistance against environmental shocks for example q du et al encapsulated eab with self assembled polydopamine to form a shell like polymer layer du et al 2017 this arrangement preserved considerate cell viability after severe acidic shocks ph 0 5 and 1 5 additionally the dopamine polymer was also beneficial to interconnecting transmembrane embedded electron conduits for better eet performance yu et al 2020 anyway the selections of macromolecules were primarily concentrated in the chemicals with outstanding biocompatibility abundant functional groups and superior adhesive effects interestingly the extracellular polymeric substances eps that spontaneously derived from microorganisms are also responsible for the eet process and importantly the protective behaviors of eab cai et al 2022 the eps usually compromises polysaccharides proteins and humic substances containing various functional groups that actively participate in versatile biochemical processes cai et al 2022 recently r hou and co workers provided significant evidence explaining that the eps from eab could act as a barrier against toxic ag ions hou et al 2020 they also pointed out that the components of eps could be regulated by varying cultivating conditions i e different anode potentials in this case however anode potential as a key parameter controlling metabolic activities of eab is unbefitting to be freely changed when facing a given environmental issue in this regard some alternative strategies for eps regulation are waiting to further exploitation previous research had shown that quorum sensing qs a basic intercellular communication process guided by specific chemical signals could positively alter the physiochemical properties of microbiota and consequently upgrade the performance of electroactive biofilms paquete et al 2022 especially the n acyl homoserine lactones ahls as exogenous qs signals were reported effective in the expression of eps related genes chen et al 2017 however the effects of ahls on the protection of eab are still rarely reported here in this study we used one of the ahls as qs signals to investigate the possible effects on the anti shocking property of electroactive biofilms the high salinity of up to 10 calculated as the mass of nacl was simulated to challenge the stability and robustness of eabs with or without the addition of qs signals the components of eps and the evolution of microbial communities were also therewith investigated and discussed the results of this work are expected to explore feasible eab associated protective strategies against harsh environmental shocks 2 materials and methods 2 1 electroactive biofilm construction and high salinity exposure each electroactive biofilm in this work was cultivated onto a graphite plate 3 cm 2 5 cm 0 1 cm as the working electrode in a typical three electrode system with a working volume of 100 ml fig 1a note that the graphite plate was polished by sandpaper grit type 400 and soaked in 3 m hno3 solution for 12 h to improve hydrophilicity a 0 2 v potential against an ag agcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs she was constantly applied to the working electrode by a potentiostat chi 1040c ch instrument china this anode potential was favored for eab cultivation hou et al 2020 a titanium wire 0 5 mm in diameter placed near the reference electrode was employed as the counter electrode the nutrient medium within 10 mm sodium acetate as the electron donor was artificially prepared as previously described balch et al 1979 kim and logan 2011 zhou et al 2018a the inoculum used in this work was obtained from a running long term sediment microbial fuel cell in which the anode chamber was incubated with the shoreside sediment sludge ca 10 20 cm beneath the water surface of the pearl river estuary at nansha district guangzhou china one of the typical n acylhomoserine lactones ahls named n 3 oxo dodecanoyl l homoserine lactone 3oc12 hsl was used as the exogenous qs signal molecular that has been proved capable of stimulating mix culture eabs jing et al 2019 the acylase i from aspergillus sp at a concentration of 6 μg ml was used as the qs quencher overall there were four groups of eabs constructed in this work one experimental group qs group was added with the 3oc12 hsl at a final concentration of 10 μm and another group qs ac group in which both the 3oc12 hsl and acylase i were simultaneously added was also set for comparison note that the acylase is a commonly used agents for specifically quenching both exogenous and endogenous qs signals ahls chen et al 2017 the eab with the only addition of acylase ac group was constructed to investigate the potential effects of endogenous ahl while the blank group without any acylase or ahl was also set as control all experiments were conducted in fed batch mode at an ambient temperature around 25 c the nutrient medium was replaced when the system current dropped below 0 15 ma and the qs signals and quenchers were added along with the nutrient medium the three electrode systems were operated for 4 cycles around 25 days of cultivation to achieve mature eabs the eabs were considered maturely stable when the system currents reached their peaks and were repeatable in at least two successive cycles all eab related tests involved duplicate mature eabs samples from parallelly operating reactors unless otherwise stated the saline solution of 10 salinity was prepared by dissolving 10 g nacl in 100 ml deionized water the graphite plates with mature eabs from all the groups were taken out and entirely soaked into the saline solution for 4 h to mimic a hypersaline shock after that the graphite plates were carefully and tenderly washed with running deionized water and then reinstalled in the three electrode systems for further analysis 2 2 biofilm characterization the biofilms were transferred into a phosphate buffer pbs 50 mm ph 7 0 before and after high salinity exposure and the biofilms were stained using a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit l7012 thermo fisher scientific inc usa following the manufacturer s instruction the stained biofilms were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope lsm 700 carl zeiss germany for cell survival examination the metabolic activities of eabs were also assessed by the consumption rate of total organic carbon toc that was measured using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan at certain intervals other than constantly monitoring the current variation during experiments the cyclic voltammetry cv tests were in situ conducted anaerobically in the same three electrode system the scan rate was constant at 5 mv s from 0 8 v to 0 6 v each cv test was independently performed at least three times at room temperature 25 c 2 3 eps extraction and analysis the extracellular polymeric substances were extracted from mature eabs cultivated for at least three cycles following the previously reported procedures zhou et al 2021 in brief the biofilms on the graphite plates were carefully scraped into pbs solution and then manually vibrated for five minutes the mixed solutions were heated in a water bath at 60 for 30 min subsequently the solutions were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 25 min and the supernatants were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters to exclude all unwanted solids or cells the final eps solutions were obtained after 30 min dialysis using several dialysis bags to remove salts and micromolecular medium residues 500 da md 34 union carbide usa the three main components of eps were determined by spectrophotometry zhou et al 2021 details of quantitative analysis on proteins humic substances and polysaccharides were described in the supplementary information text s1 additionally the excitation emission matrix eem spectra of each eps sample were examined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fs5 edinburgh instruments u k to further investigate the eps variation influenced by qs signals the eem fluorescence spectra were scanned at increments of 5 nm in an excitation range and an emission range of 200 500 nm and 250 550 nm wavelengths respectively 2 4 high throughput sequencing analysis the dna of biofilms from the different treatments was extracted using the e z n a bacterial dna kit d3350 02 omega bio tek usa the dna samples were quantified using an ultramicro spectrophotometer nanodrop one technologies thermo scientific usa and only the samples with 30 ng ul dna concentration were qualified and sent for high throughput sequencing analysis the extracted dna samples were stored at 80 c for further analysis the primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were selected to amplify the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of microbial 16s rrna genes liu et al 2021 the high throughput sequencing analysis was conducted on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc usa by magigene co ltd guangzhou china the raw data of sequencing analysis were processed as previously described liu et al 2021 the compositions of microbial communities were analyzed via tools of microbiomeanalyst www microbiomeanalyst ca and r language chong et al 2020 the annotation of functional genes was identified counted and compared via tax4fun2 in r language moreira et al 2022 3 results and discussions 3 1 the qs effects on eabs against extreme salinity shock the current densities of the three electrode systems were continuously recorded as illustrated in fig 1b the current densities varied with the eabs cultivating conditions the qs signal 3oc12 hsl could help to elevate the electroactivities of the biofilms specifically the qs group reached the highest current density up to above 0 3 ma cm2 by contrast the evidently inferior current was recorded in response to the addition of qs quenching agents the acylase group those benign manifestations have confirmed the positive regulation of qs signals on the enhancement of eab electroactivities as indicated in a rich collection of similar studies jing et al 2019 liu et al 2015 other than the satisfactory power generation performance here we demonstrated the indirect protective effects of qs signals under hypersaline attack for the first time the blank and acylase group encountered significant decreases 70 0 and 93 3 respectively in the current densities in the following cycle right after the 10 salinity attack fig 1c indicating the biofilms might be seriously damaged in these two groups surprisingly the eabs cultivated in the presence of qs signals seemed less brittle to the salinity attack as 50 7 of the current density recovered though it was unlikely to completely escape from decreases in current density the results explicitly suggested that the qs signals could significantly increase the robustness of eabs against hypersaline conditions 3 2 qs regulated bacterial physiology for enhancing halotolerance of the eab further characterizations of the biofilms were conducted to ascertain the qs effects on the augmentation of eab s anti shocking properties firstly the biofilm morphology visualized by clsm indicated that the spatial structures of mature eabs were critically regulated by qs effects fig 2 the qs signals induced extensive and tight biofilm formed on the graphite plates compared with relatively sparser biofilms in the other three groups it would also promote cellular cooperation in biofilms van gestel et al 2014 yan et al 2017 which would confirm the reasonableness of stabilizing biofilm performance in extreme environments abisado et al 2018 as for the spatial arrangement after hypersaline shock severe decay of biofilms was observed in response to the high salinity stresses fig 2 especially for the groups in which the qs was quenched the cell viability was demolished as the red fluorescent pixels dramatically emerged indicating massive death in such biofilms the less amount and inactive cells attached to the electrodes would to some extent explain the inferior current densities of qs signals quenched biofilms in this regard the results of clsm have provided direct evidence confirming the positive role of qs on biofilm robustness this robustness might have notable benefits on the paths to practical applications of bioelectrochemical systems in salinity fluctuating scenarios the salinity fluctuation which frequently happens in wastewater treatments is one of the most serious challenges to the microbial structure generally the salinity fluctuates between 2 and 3 while in extreme situations it would peak beyond 5 feng et al 2015 the overmuch salinity might introduce cell plasmolysis and even the death of microorganisms due to osmotic pressure increases causing colonization fading and dispersal of eams as illustrated in fig 2 feng et al 2015 thus such protective manipulation of qs is of great practical interest to relieve the stress of hypersaline shock the metabolic activities of eabs were estimated by comparing the consumption rates of the toc and the results are presented in figure s1 surprisingly the acylase did not exert a negative influence on the uptake of the carbon sources that was possible because of the differentiated distribution of biomass in reactors as acylase in its concentration of 6 μg ml mainly interfered with microbial aggregating behaviors paul et al 2009 cells would scatter in bulk solution which would in turn accidentally gain access to the organic sources with a greater chance on the contrary the condensed biofilm might hinder the outside in transportation of carbon sources that would probably explain the higher consumption of toc in the acylase group over the qs group however the rate constants k values calculated via first order dynamic simulation had undergone dramatic decreases after the 10 salinity shock without the addition of qs signals for the blank and acylase groups the k values dropped nearly 64 1 and 44 1 respectively caused by the loss of bacteria not only in the bulk solution but in the biofilm matrix the electroactivities of eabs were investigated via cv curves under the turnover condition in the presence of acetate as shown in fig 3 the responses of the catalytic current in the qs group were superior to those of the other three groups which was consistent with the former finding jing et al 2019 the pair of redox peaks observed at 0 29 v reduction peak and 0 08 v oxidation peak were tagged with characteristic extracellular electron transfer signals liu et al 2008 zhu et al 2012 which directly implied better interactions between the electrode and metabolic activity of biofilm in the qs group meanwhile the extreme salinity shock led to decreases in current densities of all groups due to the severe disperse of living cells shown in fig 2 notably apart from the limiting current densities the cv curves had not been re shaped after hypersaline shock indicating that the dominant redox pairs may not be affected during this process in sum the biofilm matrix collapses rather than metabolic chaos might be the key reason for the degeneration of microbial electroactivities the results also strongly implied that the qs mainly functioned on the physiological regulation for the protection of electroactive biofilms from bacteria loss in the hypersaline environment since the formation of biofilm was closely related to the eps yin et al 2019 in the present work the differences in eps samples extracted from each treatment were analyzed to further investigate the qs effects on the halotolerance of the eab 3 3 qs altered the components of eps microbes grow in structured communities in which cell aggregates are encased in a self produced extracellular matrix i e eps the secretion of eps was acknowledged as an indirect response of both the cells and biofilms to the surrounding environment and the variation of the components in eps might be able to express different biofilm behaviors decho and gutierrez 2017 yin et al 2019 from the 3d eem spectra figure s2 and table s1 despite there was the slight variation of fluorescence in the region i and ii corresponding to aromatic proteins no remarkable differences had shown in terms of fluorescent organic matters in the four eps samples from different treatments however those eps isolates showed various contents of three main components i e proteins humic substances and polysaccharides revealed by the quantitative analysis fig 4a especially the eps obtained from the qs group showed the highest polysaccharides indicating that the biosynthesis and secretion of polysaccharides were up regulated by quorum sensing the polysaccharides were the key structure for cell aggregation and biofilm formation vu et al 2009 and the positive regulation of qs on the expression of relevant genes had also been previously confirmed parsek and greenberg 2005 it could then be explainable why the most condensed biofilm of the qs group had been observed in the clsm unlike artificial skin like structures e g polydopamine the eps was originally secreted during biomass growth and iteration therefore its biocompatibility would not be an issue for electroactive biofilms because of the high redox activity mainly reflected in the high potential bias of the bulk biofilm the biofilm shared intimate contact in which more frequent and complicated interactions with environmental media would occur lovley and holmes 2022 sometimes this intimacy caused unwanted settling of nonbiologically born chemicals e g transition metals or organic polymers onto the biofilm surface lovley and holmes 2022 the eps compared with the artificial protective screen could provide a more powerful defense against outside in metal invasion like ag of the biofilms hou et al 2020 in the meantime it maintained a basic tunnel for microbes environment communication decho and gutierrez 2017 this is meaningful to improve the resistance of electroactive biofilm by the regulation of eps previous research had agreed that the exopolymers from bacteria especially extracellular glycol like polymers might have a strong metal binding capability and particularly showed a high affinity for na over other soluble metal ions geddie and sutherland 1993 gutierrez et al 2008 as discovered that the polysaccharide increased in the eps derived from qs regulated biofilm it would to some extent slow down the diffusion of sodium ions due to the thick hydration shell introduced by the extracellular polysaccharide zhao et al 2016 additionally the thicker biofilm of the qs group also provided significant redundancy against the hypersaline shock in sum the eps was not only a connection between biofilms and their habitats but also an essential consolidation of cells physical states survival and adaptation that could be strongly altered by quorum sensing fig 4b 3 4 microbial communities of eabs were controlled by qs signals the microbial communities under different treatments were subsequently analyzed in this study the common and unique otus were shown in the venn diagram figure s3 the ratios of the unique otus in the four groups qs qs ac ac and blank could be as high as 56 1 36 0 41 9 and 70 2 respectively indicating the structures of electroactive biofilms were largely varied in the presence of the qs molecule and or qs quencher as shown in fig 5a the positive electric bias has significantly altered the community structure of which the proteobacteria and the firmicutes become the dominant bacterial phyla accounting for 77 3 97 2 of the four eabs it was not surprising since previous research had confirmed a similar phenomenon and many electroactive bacteria were classified in the two phyla hou et al 2020 yan et al 2017 as for the relative abundance at the genus level the bacterial communities could be largely varied fig 5b the abundance of pseudomonas sp petrimonas sp proteiniphilum sp and thiobacillus sp in the qs group was significantly increased from the standardized abundance profiles figure s4 for more details the pseudomonas sp which was a disadvantageous group in the inoculum evolved in the electroactive biofilms of four groups its relative abundance had increased to 20 0 and 12 5 in the qs and blank groups respectively while in the ac involved groups this species only occupied less than 2 0 of the biofilm communities the pseudomonas sp was reported as a typical electroactive species that had an interconnected network of ahl based quorum sensing systems papenfort and bassler 2016 venkataraman et al 2010 in terms of the anti shocking properties the pseudomonas sp also played a significant role in biofilm protection by secreting exopolysaccharides in the eps matrix to establish tolerance against the severe environment colvin et al 2011 jennings et al 2015 the petrimonas sp which increased its relative abundance to 12 5 in the qs group was also reported particularly correlating to the long chain ahls e g 3oc12 hsl in this case peng et al 2021 similarly the geobacter sp had also become one of the dominant species though its relative abundance fluctuated in four experimental groups fig 5 the geobacter sp accounting for 25 0 to 55 2 of electroactive biofilms was well known exoelectrogenic bacteria that predominated in the close to electrode area of the acetate consuming biofilm since they had to keep direct contact with solid electrodes via their cytochrome conduits and e pili for extracellular electron transfer cao et al 2020 yan et al 2021 in this case the stability of geobacter sp might be conducive to the recovery of eab after hyper salinity shock the electrode fixed at 0 2 v vs ag agcl reference electrode could simultaneously serve as an external electron acceptor and inhabitant for exoelectrogens microorganisms for the electrode respiring species e g geobacter sp that favored direct contact with the electrode they lay at the heart of electroactive biofilm and exported electrons generated during metabolism or from electron transfer with other species for the generation of system current fessler et al 2022 as discussed above the salinity might have less influence on the inner biofilm due to the higher contents of polysaccharides in the eps of the qs group therefore the stability of the inner biofilm protected by the qs regulated eps might contribute to the quick current recovery of the qs group after hypersaline shock the predicted functional features of microbial metabolism in three eabs could bring a better understanding of the qs effects on anti shock properties basically the functional genes were categorized into four metabolic groups genetic information processing cellular processes metabolism and environmental information processing fig 6 generally the genes in groups of cellular processes and environmental information processing had been suppressed with the addition of the qs quenching molecule acylase specifically the cellular community 5 86 for the ac group 6 67 for the qs group and 6 88 for the blank group respectively was the main pathway in the group of cellular processes which was intimately relative to the biofilm formation and quorum sensing in microbial consortia bandara et al 2012 the metabolism pathways membrane transport and signal transduction belonging to the group of environmental information processing were closely related to extracellular electron transfer and regulation of diverse cellular functions respectively bandara et al 2012 zhao et al 2022 importantly the proportions of glycan biosynthesis and metabolism increased with the addition of the qs signaling molecule 0 70 for the ac group 0 82 for the qs group and 0 78 for the blank group respectively these results indicated a positive regulation of qs the biofilm formation and its potential anti shock properties 4 conclusions overall this study demonstrated efficient protection of electroactive biofilms from hypersaline shock by biocompatible qs signaling molecules the protection could be attributed to two aspects the positive regulation of bacterial physiology involving cell aggregating behaviors and extracellular electron transfer capability as well as the compositional and structural advantages in microbial communities like phenotypic diversity and gene expression within these advantages the electroactive biofilms performed better electroactivity before and after the 10 salinity exposure the study provides insights into how qs effects protect eabs from being killed by severe environmental shocks and extends the utilizing

15013,20 years since the first report on the biofouling potential of chemicals used for scale control still antiscalants with high bacterial growth potential are used in practice evaluating the bacterial growth potential of commercially available antiscalants is therefore essential for a rational selection of these chemicals previous antiscalant growth potential tests were conducted in drinking water or seawater inoculated with model bacterial species which do not represent natural bacterial communities to reflect better on the conditions of desalination systems we investigated the bacterial growth potential of eight different antiscalants in natural seawater and an autochthonous bacterial population as inoculum the antiscalants differed strongly in their bacterial growth potential varying from 1 to 6 μg easily biodegradable c equivalents mg antiscalant the six phosphonate based antiscalants investigated showed a broad range of growth potential which depended on their chemical composition whilst the biopolymer and the synthetic carboxylated polymers based antiscalants showed limited or no significant bacterial growth moreover nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scans enabled antiscalant fingerprinting identifying components and contaminants providing a rapid and sensitive characterization and opening opportunities for rational selection of antiscalants for biofouling control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphonates flow cytometry green antiscalant biofilm growth potential nmr chemical fingerprint seawater reverse osmosis swro membrane module data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the most economic viable option to obtain fresh water in arid or water stress regions is to desalinate seawater seawater desalination by reverse osmosis ro provides freshwater at a current rate of 65 5 million m3 day which accounts for 69 of the volume of desalinated water produced worldwide jones et al 2019 the fact that seawater is vast can give a false notion that obtaining freshwater from desalination is a straightforward solution to our ever increasing water scarcity problem however seawater desalination uses large amounts of energy and chemicals and generates wastes in the form of brine and about 14 000 tons of membrane module waste that is globally landfilled yearly senán salinas et al 2019 therefore every effort to reduce the environmental and economic impacts of seawater desalination is of relevance in the ro process high hydrostatic pressure is applied about 55 to 70 bar to force water passage through a semi permeable membrane the water recovery of a seawater ro installation is about 35 to 45 miyakawa et al 2021 and up to 50 schunke et al 2020 nevertheless ro is currently the most reliable and cost effective seawater desalination method qasim et al 2019 although the technology is well established experts recognize that innovations in membrane technology operation and management are critical to improving the sustainability of delivering freshwater qasim et al 2019 the accumulation of unwanted material on the membrane surface collectively called fouling is recognized as one top difficulties to improve ro desalination for future sustainable water supplies matin et al 2021 fouling includes deposition of inorganic minerals accumulation of particulate matter and biofouling which refers to biofilm formation resulting from deposition of organic matter and microbial deposition and growth flemming 2020 goh et al 2018 nagaraj et al 2018 layers of fouling and biofouling of a few micrometers thick are enough to induce increased energy for water production decrease membrane efficiency and ultimately early membrane failure gonzalez gil et al 2021 the deposition of inorganic minerals or scaling occurs when the concentration of rejected salts along the ro membrane exceeds their solubility limit common mineral scaling includes gypsum caso4 2h2o calcium carbonate caco3 barite baso4 and silica sio2 tong et al 2019 to mitigate scaling problems various methods including feed water pretreatment the optimization of operational processes the development of new membrane materials and the addition of antiscalants have been developed matin et al 2019 yu et al 2020 thus far the addition of antiscalants during pretreatment of the feed water is the most cost effective and convenient method for membrane scaling control at high water recoveries antiscalants are chemicals that inhibit the formation of minerals through chelation dispersion and or by blocking crystal growth sites yu et al 2020 current commercial antiscalants are mainly based on phosphonates or synthetic organic polymers or co polymers hasson et al 2011 phosphonates are characterized by phosphonic groups attached to a carbon atom c po3h2 which give them high stability under wide ph range and high temperatures polymeric antiscalants are constituted by polycarboxylic acids cooh on an aliphatic chain due to concerns that phosphonates can promote eutrophication when discharged and that polymeric antiscalants may remain in the environment for several years matin et al 2019 green or environmental friendly antiscalants were developed these are based on succinic or aspartic acid polymers rabizadeh et al 2019 or the carboxymethylation of inulin a polysaccharide extracted from the chicory plant roots boels and witkamp 2011 although antiscalants mitigate inorganic fouling they can increase the potential of biofouling which is regarded as the most difficult fouling problem to deal with flemming 2020 depending on their chemical components antiscalants can function as phosphorus and or carbon sources for microbial growth antiscalants and acids added to freshwater enhanced bacterial growth causing a significant blockage in a laboratory ro membrane fouling simulator vrouwenvelder et al 2000 and a pilot scale ro van der hoek et al 2000 similarly an unknown phosphonate and a polyacrylate based antiscalant added to seawater or brackish water increased the biofilm formation rate on the surface of ro membranes sweity et al 2013 2015 consequently evaluating the bacterial growth potential of commercially available antiscalants is essential for a rational selection of these chemicals previous evaluations on the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants substantially helped realize that the prevention of a scale problem could translate into a ro feed spacer and membrane biofouling problem araújo et al 2012 vrouwenvelder et al 2009 however those evaluations suffer from several limitations among others previous antiscalant growth potential studies were conducted using drinking water inoculated with two single bacterial species isolated from freshwater vrouwenvelder et al 2000 or seawater inoculated with a model bacterial species sweity et al 2015 these conditions however are in stark contrast to those in natural seawater with diverse bacterial populations furthermore previous studies provide no or limited information regarding the chemical composition of the tested antiscalants which is relevant to understanding why and to what extent chemically different antiscalants may promote bacterial growth moreover the number of commercially available antiscalants for ro systems is large new antiscalants are constantly introduced in the market and providers do not disclose the antiscalants chemical composition testing all available antiscalants for their growth potential is not practical therefore there is a need to determine the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants under relevant seawater conditions and ideally for predictive purposes relate the antiscalants biological response to their chemical composition here we used a high throughput single bacterial cell detection method flow cytometry fcm to assess the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants using natural seawater and an autochthonous bacterial population from the same seawater sample as inoculum moreover nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scans allowed the classifying of all tested commercial antiscalants even if their chemical identity was undisclosed helping to understand their biological response the bacterial growth potential and the nmr scans enabled sensitive antiscalants fingerprinting which allows an informed selection of antiscalants achievable and contributes to biofouling control in seawater desalination 2 materials and methods 2 1 antiscalants we obtained eight technical antiscalants commonly used in seawater treatment applications from four commercial suppliers four antiscalants had no chemical information three antiscalants were labeled as atmp amino trimethylene phosphonic acid and one was labeled as based on polyacrylate acrylic acid copolymer table 1 2 2 chemical characterization of antiscalants since most suppliers did not provide the antiscalants chemical composition we determined their elemental composition i e c p and their chemical structure by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy 2 2 1 total organic carbon toc and total phosphorus the toc concentration of antiscalants was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu kyoto japan and quantification was based upon calibration by a series of external standards 0 to 10 mg toc l 1 prepared using a certified toc solution 20 ppm c ricca chemical co to measure the phosphorus concentration we used stock solutions of antiscalants 3 g l 1 and diluted them with 1 v v hno3 then the phosphorus content was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 5110 quantification with the phosphorus line p 177 434 nm was based upon calibration by a series of external standards prepared with 1 v v hno3 using a certified inorganic phosphorus solution msp 100ppm inorganic ventures the detection limit of the method is about 20 μg p l 1 2 2 2 nmr about 5 to 10 mg of lyophilized antiscalant sample were transferred to a 3 ml glass bottle and dissolved in 600 μl of d2o 99 9 then 550 μl of solution were transferred to a 5 mm nmr tube a bruker 600 avanac iii spectrometer equipped with bbof bruker probe brukerbiospin rheinstetten germany was used to record all nmr spectra the 1h nmr spectra were recorded as described before abdul jameel et al 2016 the 31p nmr are collected according to published parameters tomah al masri et al 2012 the 13c nmr spectra were recorded using 30 flip angle pulse sequence by collecting 2048 scans with 5 s recycle delay abdul jameel et al 2018 bruker topspin 3 5pl7 software was used for both data collection and analyses to classify the antiscalants based on their nmr chemical fingerprints we concatenated their 1h 13c and 31p nmr spectra and performed a hierarchical cluster analysis hca using the chemospec package in r core team 2017 the hca was derived from euclidian distances on zero to one normalized spectra using the complete linkage method mestrenova v 14 1 0 24037 was used to predict the 1h 13c and 31p nmr spectra of various defined chemicals widely used as antiscalants the results of predicted nmr spectra were compared to the measured nmr spectra of the studied antiscalants to elucidate their chemical structure 2 3 determining the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants eight commercial antiscalants were tested for their microbial growth potential in other words we measured the growth of bacterial and archaeal cells in the seawater when exposed to antiscalants since our previous study showed that bacteria largely dominate over archaea phylotypes in the seawater elcik et al 2022 for simplicity we will refer to the microbial growth potential as bacterial growth potential tests of the different antiscalants were run simultaneously to eliminate any impact of seasonal changes in seawater composition on the results seawater from the red sea was collected in assimilable organic carbon free aoc borosilicate glass bottles in july 2021 from the intake of the seawater desalination pilot plant in kaust saudi arabia the collected seawater had an initial measured bacterial cell concentration of 200 000 cells ml 1 therefore seawater was filtered to remove microbial cells and to set a desired low initial cell concentration for the growth potential assay within approximately 10 000 to 20 000 bacterial cells ml 1 one liter of seawater was serially filtered through pre cleaned 0 45 μm pore size and 0 2 μm pore size polyethersulfone filters satorius stedium minisart the filters were replaced every 100 ml filtration allowed removing protozoa to avoid bacterial grazing kuuppo leinikki 1990 which could result in a large underestimation of a sample s bacterial growth potential then 30 ml of the resulting filtered seawater with a bacterial cell concentration of 21 000 1200 cells ml 1 was added to aoc free 40 ml borosilicate glass vials with screw caps containing ptfe lined silicone septa antiscalants were added from stock solutions 3 g l 1 to the vials at a final concentration of 50 mg l 1 vials with no antiscalant addition were included as a control the vials were then incubated at 30 c in the dark and bacterial growth was determined by measuring cell concentrations over time using flow cytometry each growth potential test was conducted in three independent biological replicates here we chose to test antiscalants at 50 mg of provided antiscalant l 1 since in practice i their dosing range varies widely 1 50 mg l 1 ii this value is in the upper dosing range and iii the concentration of added antiscalants will increase along the ro membrane modeules arranged in series in the pressure vessel as a result of solute retention leading to a higher concentration on the membrane surface than in the bulk liquid i e concentration polarization flow cytometry fcm was used to measure the bacterial cell concentration in the vials every 24 h to this end 5 μl sybr green i invitrogen 100 diluted in 10 mm tris buffer ph 8 1 were added to a final 0 5 ml vial samples in amber microfuge tubes followed by mixing and incubation for 10 min in the dark at 35 c stained cells were measured with a bd accuri c6 instrument in fixed 50 μl volume mode with a sample flow rate of 35 μl min 1 the blue 488 nm laser 50 mw was used to collect the green fluorescence at fl1 533 30 nm the red fluorescence fl3 670 nm as well as intrinsic cell parameters given by the side scattered ssh and forward scattered fsh light signals electronic gating was used to separate positive microbial stained signals from instrument and water background noise as described by prest et al 2013 filtered sterilized 0 1 μm ultrapure water as well as unstained samples were used as controls in all runs the instrument performance was verified using spherotech 8 peak validation beads to evaluate whether bacterial growth on antiscalants was greater than the control the bacterial growth curves were compared using a one tailed paired wilcoxon signed rank test at a significance level α 0 05 2 4 flow cytometry based bacterial community analysis the bacterial communities in the growth potential tests were characterized through flow cytometric fingerprinting following the procedure of props et al 2016 using the phenoflow and flowcore packages in r core team 2017 briefly the fluorescence and scatter parameters in signal to height format i e fl1 h fl2 h ssc h and fsc h from the raw fcs files were extracted and rescaled using the arcsine hyperbolic option then a fixed gate was placed on the fluorescence signals to separate bacteria from noise and other background sources and two further gates were applied to determine the proportion of cells with high and low nucleic acid contents i e hna and lna as defined by prest et al 2013 the distribution of normalized nucleic acid i e fl1 h fl2 h and morphology signals i e ssc h fsc h were used to calculate the phenotypic alpha diversity expressed as hill numbers from which d2 corresponds to the inverse simpson index props et al 2018 to this end the diversity rf function was used with default parameters except that the grid resolution was increased to 256 the beta diversity was determined by principal coordinates analysis pcoa of the phenotypic fingerprints using the bray curtis dissimilarity the group differences in beta diversity were assessed by analysis of similarity anosim using the vegan package in r 3 results 3 1 chemical characterization of antiscalants chemical suppliers do not disclose the specific chemical formulation of antiscalants which is relevant to understanding their growth potential therefore we investigated their chemical composition and structure the eight antiscalants investigated had different commercial names and were from four different manufacturers each manufacturer provided two products recommended as antiscalants these are globally used in practice in desalination plants for commercial reasons we coded the antiscalants as as 1 to as 8 table 1 3 1 1 carbon and phosphorus content in antiscalants considering that a biodegradable antiscalant would provide carbon for bacterial growth we measured the toc in the antiscalants fig 1 a most antiscalants had low carbon contents at levels 40 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 among them as 3 had the lowest carbon content 2 6 0 7 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 in contrast the toc in antiscalants as 6 115 23 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 and as 8 110 2 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that in the other six antiscalants fig 1a besides carbon the phosphorous in antiscalants may promote microbial growth except for as 6 all antiscalants contained phosphorus fig 1b four antiscalants had contents of 60 to 100 μg p mg antiscalant 1 as 8 had the lowest measured p content at 0 2 μg p mg antiscalant 1 the two antiscalants with the highest carbon content had phosphorus below detection limit or the lowest phosphorus content fig 1a and b 3 1 2 antiscalants nmr spectra and structure since the chemical composition of antiscalants can determine their growth potential we analyzed their nmr based chemical fingerprint fig 1c the 1h 13c and 31p nmr spectra show that the antiscalants as 3 as 4 and as 5 were chemically highly similar fig 1c antiscalants as 6 and as 8 were chemically the most complex presenting a multitude of peaks in their 1h and 13c spectra except for as 6 all antiscalants produced 31p nmr signals fig 1c hierarchical cluster analysis allowed the grouping of the antiscalants based on their chemical nmr fingerprint the resulting dendrogram showed that as 4 and as 5 are the most similar and together with as 3 they form a cluster and closer to this cluster is as 2 in contrast as 6 and as 8 have a distinct chemical structure that separates them from the rest of the antiscalants fig 1d moreover the chemical structure of the antiscalants was identified or approximated by comparing their nmr spectra to predicted spectra of common antiscalants see figs s1 to s7 in the supplemental material for details the antiscalants as 3 as 4 as 5 and as 1 were identified as phosphonate based table 1 the 1h peak at 3 3 3 7 ppm corresponds to h in the methylene group ch2 the 13c peak at 72 57 ppm corresponds to the c in the n c p bond and the 31p peak at 7 8 ppm is the c p signal fig 1c collectively these chemical shifts correspond to amino trimethylene phosphonic acid atmp an antiscalant with three phosphonic acid groups fig s1 as 2 is also a phosphonate but with four phosphonic acid groups and was identified as hexamethylenediamine tetra methylenephosphonic acid hdtmp fig s2 the 31p nmr spectra showed that all atmp as 3 as 4 as 5 and as 1 and the hdtmp as 2 phosphonates based antiscalants tested contained contaminants i e peaks besides the nominal phosphonate peak particularly orthophosphates and phosphate esters yield nmr peaks below 5 ppm fig 1c as 7 is also a phosphonate but chemically different from the other phosphonate based antiscalants we identified as 7 as 1 hydroxyethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp the 1h peak at 1 4 1 5 ppm ch3 the 13c peaks at 19 ppm ch3 and 70 ppm p c p and the 31p peak at 19 ppm p c p are characteristic of the antiscalant hedp fig s3 in contrast as 6 and as 8 are polymers as 6 had 1h shifts at 3 5 and 4 5 ppm which can be assigned to methine groups ch in hexose and pentoses respectively the 13c shifts at ca 60 70 and 75 80 ppm were assigned to ch2 and ch respectively furthermore as 6 had a typical carboxylic cooh shift at 178 ppm fig 1c no 31p signal was detected for as 6 thus this was the only phosphorus free antiscalant fig 1c the nmr spectra of as 6 resemble those of inulin a carboxy polyfructose figs s4 and s5 on the other hand as 8 spectra resemble those of the copolymer of maleic and acrylic acid ma aa figs s6 and s7 which is a common antiscalant as 8 contains other components besides ma aa for example 31p shifts at 2 and 4 5 ppm may indicate the presence of phosphate esters at trace amounts considering the low phosphorus contents 0 2 μg p mg antiscalant 1 of as 8 overall the antiscalants studied could be grouped into phosphonates and bio and synthetic polymers having determined the antiscalants chemical fingerprints the next step was to determine their bacterial growth potential 3 2 the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants in seawater with an autochthonous bacterial population to determine whether antiscalants would promote seawater bacterial growth seawater with an initial bacterial cell concentration of 20 000 cells ml 1 was incubated in the absence reference control and in the presence of 50 mg l 1 of eight chemically diverse antiscalants the bacterial growth of antiscalants was compared to that of the reference seawater microorganisms respond to the presence of antiscalants the phosphonate based antiscalants as 1 and as 2 resulted in the highest bacterial growth the reference bacterial growth in the seawater without added antiscalant reached about 1 5 106 cells ml 1 after 8 days of incubation in contrast when phosphonate based atmp as 1 as 3 as 4 as 5 and hdtmp as 2 antiscalants were added the bacterial growth curves significantly differed from that of the reference p 0 05 one tail wilcoxon signed rank test with cell numbers reaching about 2 106 to 3 106 cells ml 1 fig 2 a the biopolymeric antiscalant as 6 slightly promoted microbial growth distinctively the antiscalants similar to the phosphonate hedp as 7 and the synthetic polymer aa ma as 8 did not promote growth p 0 05 and their resulting bacterial growth resembled that of the reference fig 2a the amount of bacteria that grew in the presence of antiscalant in excess to that of the control without antiscalant can be expressed in terms of carbon utilized from antiscalant to produce such number of bacteria comparing those values with the measured toc in antiscalants may inform on the antiscalants biodegradability to this end we considered the net number of cells produced after 8 days of incubation fig 2a and a yield for seawater bacteria of 4 6 106 cells μg c 1 reported by dhakal et al 2021 the results were expressed in terms of assimilable organic carbon from the antiscalant μg aoc mg antiscalant 1 fig 2b the polymeric antiscalants as 6 and as 8 and the hedp like phosphonate as 7 were hardly biodegradable for example the estimated aoc from as 8 under the tested conditions was about 1 μg aoc mg antiscalant 1 which represents a biodegradability of 1 for this antiscalant fig 2b in contrast the aoc derived from the growth potential on all phosphonates atmp like antiscalants ranged from 3 to 6 μg aoc mg antiscalant 1 in particular the biodegradability of as 3 derived from its growth potential was above by about 40 the measured toc content for this antiscalant fig 2b thus indicating that phosphorus in the antiscalant promoted bacterial growth and that the growth of microorganisms in the seawater during the growth potential test was phosphorus limited 3 3 bacterial community dynamics during growth potential of antiscalants to explore whether bacterial growth in the presence of the antiscalants would result in differing bacterial communities we used a flow cytometric fingerprint approach which consists in analyzing and tagging bacterial phenotypes based on their optical characteristics i e cells fluorescence and morphology based on their fluorescence intensities bacteria were grouped into high nucleic acid hna or low nucleic acid lna content bacteria hammes and egli 2010 these may represent different bacterial communities or different metabolic status of the same microbial community at the start of the growth potential tests only 30 of the cells were hna independent of the presence of antiscalants the population of hna cells readily increased to about 90 after 1 2 days of incubation thereafter their proportion decreased fig 3 the bacterial diversity derived from the flow cytometric fluorescence and morphology signals i e phenotypic alpha diversity decreased during the microbial growth potential fig 4 a the decrease was independent of the addition and type of antiscalants suggesting a preferential growth of certain microbial types moreover the bacterial communities that developed in the control without antiscalants were not considerably different from those in the presence of antiscalants the bacterial communities in all samples however differed significantly p 0 05 over the incubation time the phenotypic beta diversity expressed as the bray curtis dissimilarities between samples and analyzed by principal coordinates pcoa shows how the communities shifted as a function of the incubation time fig 4b the largest changes in the bacterial communities occurred at day 2 and at day 4 8 fig s8 4 discussion desalination plants use antiscalants to prevent scale formation on the ro membranes in practice the selection of an antiscalant mainly focuses on the type of scales it avoids and does not consider its bacterial growth potential bacterial growth at the point of antiscalant dosage or later on in the ro membrane is detrimental to membrane performance due to membrane and spacer biofouling thus a rational selection of antiscalants should include information regarding their bacterial growth potential to enable biofilm control 4 1 not all phosphorus based antiscalants promote bacterial growth even at phosphorus limiting conditions based on their chemical structure antiscalants are broadly classified as phosphorus and non phosphorus based systems containing organic carbon and none or insufficient bioavailable phosphorus for bacterial growth are regarded as phosphorus limiting duhamel et al 2021 lehtola et al 2002 previous research showed that phosphonate based antiscalants promote biofilm growth of freshwater bacteria vrouwenvelder et al 2010 vibrio fischeri sweity et al 2013 or pseudomonas fluorescence sweity et al 2015 on ro membranes under phosphorus limiting conditions here we infer that the bacteria in the seawater at the time of the growth potential were phosphorus limited this is because as 3 with a phosphorus content of 4 7 0 2 μg p mg antiscalant 1 and with the lowest carbon content among all antiscalants 2 6 0 7 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 fig 1a and b had a bacterial growth potential that exceeded by 40 its carbon content fig 2a and b six of the different antiscalants investigated had a phosphorus content ranging from 4 7 to 100 μg p mg antiscalant 1 however not all promoted bacterial growth distinctively as 7 did not promote growth despite having three times more phosphorus than as 3 which promoted substantial growth thus understanding why the phosphorus based as 7 did not promote growth calls for details on the chemical structure of the tested antiscalants 4 2 advantages of grouping antiscalants through their nmr fingerprints there is a large number of antiscalants in the market and for the majority their chemical composition is undisclosed this represents a limitation towards a rational selection for their application in ro systems since the chemical structure of antiscalants inherently determines their potential to promote or not bacterial growth of course besides their effectiveness as antiscalant with the help of an nmr fingerprint approach it is possible to group antiscalants by their chemical signatures even if the identity of the antiscalant is unknown nmr analysis yields unique spectral fingerprints for different molecules and functional groups we did not know the main component of most of the antiscalants studied for example the chemical structure of the main component in as 3 as 5 as 6 as 7 and as 8 was unknown a hierarchical analysis of antiscalants nmr spectra can reveal clusters allowing for approximating the chemical structure of their main components the nmr spectra of as 3 as 4 and as 5 were highly similar fig 1c and hence made a cluster distance of about 10 in fig 1d technical data were only available for as 4 referred to it as atmp which is a phosphonate antiscalant hence from their clustering we infer that as 5 and as 3 which were from other different manufacturers were also atmp antiscalants as 2 as 1 and as 7 were closer to the atmp closer than as 6 and as 8 suggesting that as 7 was also a phosphonate antiscalant indeed 31p nmr spectra from all those antiscalants show phosphate peaks from 7 to 20 ppm fig 1c which are characteristic of phosphonates sannigrahi and ingall 2005 however in contrast to the other phosphonates as 7 phosphonate peak was distinctively at 20 ppm thus given a set of nmr spectra of chemically defined antiscalants and their clustering it would be possible to classify commercial antiscalants for which no chemical information is provided 4 3 the majority of antiscalants are phosphonate based identifying the main component of antiscalants is paramount to understanding their bacterial growth potential we identified or approximate the main component of antiscalants for which no technical information was provided by comparing their measured nmr spectra with the predicted spectra of commonly used antiscalants see details in si six out of the eight antiscalants tested were phosphonates suggesting a large representation of these chemicals in the market despite their potential environmental burden among the phosphonates as 7 was identified as hedp and as 2 was identified as hdtmp half of the commercial antiscalants tested were the same phosphonate namely atmp as 1 as 3 as 4 and as 5 thus the majority of the antiscalants were the same phosphonate meaning that various manufacturers supply the same atmp antiscalant just with some variations only two of the eight antiscalants studied were polymers as 8 was a maleic acid acrylic acid copolymer mixed with trace contents of phosphate esters as 6 was a biopolymer namely carboxylated inulin 4 4 the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants is related to their chemical fingerprint the bacterial growth potential of eight antiscalants was measured in natural seawater and with a seawater autochthonous bacterial community the antiscalants bacterial growth potential reflected their chemical nmr fingerprint previous studies on antiscalants growth potential used pure bacterial cultures mainly freshwater isolates which are not representative of marine bacterial communities 4 4 1 the phosphonate based antiscalants made of atmp and hdtmp promoted bacterial growth all phosphonate antiscalants made of atmp and hdtmp promoted bacterial growth under the conditions tested we found that at the time of the tests phosphorus was limiting in the seawater hence the marine bacteria readily utilized the phosphorus in the antiscalant global surveys show that the ocean surface is phosphorus depleted with varying concentrations from ca 0 3 to 1 μg l 1 duhamel et al 2021 microorganisms have flexible phosphorus demands to cope with such low and varying phosphorus availability for example the molar c p ratio of marine bacterioplankton can range from 35 to 178 vrede et al 2002 considering a c p mid value of 100 and the measured aoc of atmp and hdtmp antiscalants of 3 to 6 μg c mg antiscalant 1 fig 2b the corresponding bacterial phosphorus uptake would be 0 09 to 0 16 μg p mg antiscalant 1 this uptake translates to 0 1 to 0 25 of the phosphorus content measured in the antiscalants as 5 as 4 as 2 and as 1 and 2 of that in as 3 would atmp antiscalants promote microbial growth at lower dosages the growth potential tests were done with 50 mg l 1 the dosage of antiscalants varies and though this value is in the upper range yu et al 2020 we expect that antiscalants concentrations will increase inside ro modules due to concentration polarization based on our results we can extrapolate that even at dosages of 5 mg l 1 the phosphorus contribution by as 3 the atmp based antiscalant with the lowest content of the nominal compound lowest c and p content fig 1a and b would be 0 47 μg p mg antiscalant 1 this means that 5 mg l 1 of as 8 contains 0 47 μg p mg antiscalant 1 which is still five times higher than the estimated phosphorus uptake 0 09 μg p mg antiscalant 1 for the measured microbial growth potential at 50 mg l 1 of as 3 hence atmp and hdtmp antiscalants need careful decisions for usage to what extent the phosphorus supplied by atmp and hdtmp antiscalants was due to the degradation of the phosphonate or by phosphorus in antiscalants as contaminants from the 31p nmr spectra of these phosphonate antiscalants we infer that other phosphorus components besides the phosphonate are present specifically the measured 31p chemical shifts below 5 ppm are in the range of orthophosphate and phosphate esters sannigrahi and ingall 2005 this supports recent findings that atmp antiscalants contain other phosphorus compounds besides the nominal product using anion exchange chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry armbruster et al found that the contribution of inorganic phosphorus in atmp products is 5 10 armbruster et al 2019 which is a considerable value since we found that only 0 1 to 0 25 from the phosphorus in atmp can significantly promote microbial growth this means that even if the phosphorus in the phosphonate is not utilized inorganic phosphorus contaminants can be utilized diverse environmental parameters are important when assessing the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants for example in previous studies as 5 atmp based did not promote extensive bacterial growth and only minor biomass accumulation occurred in membrane fouling simulators operated with groundwater duiven et al 2010 given that as 1 to as 5 can provide phosphorus for bacterial growth we expect that the bacterial growth potential of these phosphonate based antiscalants would be low in waters with low carbon contents moreover considering that phosphonate antiscalants strongly chelate the microbially essential metal iron deluchat et al 1997 we could expect low effects under iron limiting conditions since seawater chemical and microbial composition are dynamic al otaibi et al 2020 fuhrman et al 2015 it would be relevant to assess the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants over various seasons 4 4 2 antiscalant hedp is a phosphonate that did not promote bacterial growth although as 7 is a phosphonate the bacterial growth potential of this antiscalant was not significantly different from that of the control without an antiscalant we identified as 7 as hedp similar to our results steber and wierich 1986 found no indication of aerobic or anaerobic biodegradability of hedp in stark contrast to atmp and hdtmp antiscalants the 31p nmr spectra of as 7 did not show contaminant phosphorus peaks the only phosphorus peak detected was assigned to the phosphonate hedp fig 1c thus this antiscalant did not contribute to easily available phosphorus to the bacteria this highlights the importance of the chemical fingerprints to scan for antiscalants suitability and suggests that phosphorus contaminants e g orthophosphate as in the case of atmp and hdtmp can readily promote unwanted bacterial growth under phosphorus limiting conditions regarding the persistence of phosphonates in the environment we know that the c p bond of phosphonates is chemically stable however some bacteria can hydrolyze this bond agarwal et al 2011 specifically pseudomonas fluorescence a bacterium used in previous growth potential tests on antiscalants can hydrolyze various phosphonates zboińska et al 1992 another study showed that arthrobacter sp and bacterial enrichments from compost and activated sludge could break hedp schowanek and verstraete 1990 however genes for phosphonate catabolism by c p lyase are not widespread in marine microbial communities lockwood et al 2022 specifically based on a global ocean survey it was found that the presence of bacterial genes encoding the breakage of c p bonds in seawater was limited to only 30 of the sites sampled and in only 2 to 5 of the sampled genomes villarreal chiu et al 2012 thus the relevance to conducting bacterial growth potential of antiscalants for ro purposes under seawater conditions and with autochthonous microbial communities in summary the hedp antiscalant as 7 did not promote bacterial growth this antiscalant did not contain detectable levels of contaminant bioavailable phosphorus 4 4 3 phosphorus free antiscalants a bio and a synthetic polymer are less susceptible to promoting bacterial growth with the drive to protect the environment phosphorus free antiscalants have been developed one example is carboxymethyl inulin a biopolymer produced from the carboxylation of a polysaccharide of fructose extracted from chicory plant roots due to its biological origin carboxymethyl inulin is tagged as a biodegradable green antiscalant with a capacity to inhibit caco3 precipitation comparable to phosphonates boels and witkamp 2011 we identified as 6 as carboxymethyl inulin despite being tagged as biodegradable limited information is available regarding the biodegradability of this antiscalant in membrane fouling simulators fed with groundwater treated with as 6 moderate biomass accumulation occurred duiven et al 2010 in our study we found that under the conditions tested the biodegradability of as 6 was only 1 after eight days of incubation with red sea bacterial communities this suggests that this antiscalant is either hardly degradable i e recalcitrant or that it may degrade after longer times further experiments that run for a longer incubation time are essential to determine the degradability of the inulin antiscalant however in practice this antiscalant having low short term biodegradability seems a reasonable option as caco3 precipitation inhibitor another type of phosphorus free antiscalants is synthetic polymers these antiscalants are rich in carboxylic groups and show a good scale inhibition yu et al 2020 as 8 is a synthetic polymer its main component is similar to the copolymer acrylic maleic acid ma aa a polycarboxylate antiscalant during the 8 days of bacterial growth potential only about 1 of as 8 was biodegraded fig 2b hence this antiscalant is difficult to degrade and some bacteria in the seawater degrade it only to a minor degree longer incubation times under e g non p n fe limiting conditions would be needed to determine the extent of the antiscalant degradation since some polymeric antiscalants are made of organic acids they are regarded as biodegradable however little information is available regarding their microbial growth potential sweity et al found that a polyacrylate antiscalant did not promote the growth of the bacteria pseudomonas fluorescens f113 when cultured in a flask containing brackish water sweity et al 2015 results of biodegradation test using 14c labeled ma aa in river water and sediment showed that this copolymer was not readily biodegradable in those tests only after long incubation times 100 days about 10 to 30 of the compound was transformed to 14co2 which indicates partial degradation of the copolymer hera 2010 thus our results are in line with previous findings since as 8 did not significantly promote bacterial growth taken together polymer based antiscalants are hardly biodegradable and in our study the antiscalant based on the copolymer ma aa did not significantly increase bacterial growth if compared with the reference seawater without antiscalant previous research showed that polyacrylate leads to biofouling by promoting initial bacterial attachment instead of bacterial growth sweity et al 2015 hence further studies with ro membranes are recommended to explore the additional effects of the ma aa copolymer further studies are needed on antiscalants biomass interactions organic molecules may act as chelators and or may hinder nucleation and crystal growth van driessche et al 2019 and some bacteria may promote scale formation ashfaq et al 2020 van driessche et al 2019 4 5 the bacterial communities changed as a function of time but not as a function of antiscalant type we tested whether the antiscalants would drive distinctive changes in the bacterial community during the growth potential tests this information is relevant since different bacterial taxa have different metabolic traits and capacities to form biofilms guillonneau et al 2018 for example gamma proteobacteria accounted for 30 of the biofilm community on a desalination plant ro membrane zhang et al 2011 flow cytometry allows for studying dynamic changes in bacterial community structures koch et al 2014 rubbens and props 2021 differences in nucleic acid content and cell morphology in bacterial communities are associated with differing taxa rubbens et al 2019 or with cells having higher metabolic rates bowman et al 2017 servais et al 2003 during the bacterial growth potential the population of cells operationally defined as having high nucleic acid hna content readily increased from 30 to 90 within one day of incubation this trend was independent of the presence of antiscalants fig 3 moreover the number of hna cells positively correlated with the number of growing cells fig s9 which reflects the high metabolic activity of hna bacteria in line with our results bowman et al 2017 found a positive correlation between the fraction of hna and bacterial productivity in a large dataset comprising freshwater and marine samples other studies also found that hna cells were metabolically more active than lna cells from marine brackish and freshwater ecosystems and that these subpopulations were composed of the same dominant bacterial species servais et al 2003 considering that previous studies showed correlations between flow cytometry based phenotypic diversity and taxonomic diversity rubbens et al 2019 and references therein we used the phenotypic diversity index as a proxy to gain insights on shifts in the bacterial communities of the growth potential on antiscalants we found that in all tests the phenotypic diversity alpha diversity rapidly declined suggesting the enrichment i e preferential growth of certain taxa the enriched bacterial communities with or without antiscalant did not differ substantially under the conditions tested i e they had similar pcoa coordinates fig 4b however the bacterial communities differ significantly as a function of time anosim p 0 0001 r 0 69 specifically from day 0 during maximum growth day 2 3 and when the maximum cell numbers were reached day 4 to 8 since time and not antiscalants structured the bacterial communities it is possible that antiscalants did not significantly provide a distinct carbon under the conditions and period tested this finding may support the notion that during relatively short times the greatest danger of antiscalants particularly atmp is their growth potential by providing a phosphorus source under phosphorus limiting conditions although there can be links between taxonomy and the structure of the flow cytometry data as found in cooling water systems props et al 2016 and natural lake bacterioplankton props et al 2018 we should beware that the resolution of flow cytometric fingerprinting is lower compared to genetic fingerprinting for example different taxa can be grouped within the same cytometric category and the same taxa may be represented by different cytometric categories if its size changes over growth cycles therefore genomic sequencing approaches should be included in future studies for increased resolution when comparing the bacterial communities of the growth potential on antiscalants 4 6 practical implications and research needs in addition to its anti scaling efficiency the selection of antiscalants should consider its bacterial growth potential to minimize associated biofouling to this end we propose an approach for assessing the growth potential of antiscalants in natural seawater and using autochthonous bacterial communities the growth potential of other chemicals e g acids used in the water industry as well as the growth potential of antiscalants as a function of storage conditions e g temperature light exposure storage time in the plants should be also investigated for example storage favoring photodegradation of phosphonate based antiscalants would likely increase their biofouling potential here the growth potential was assessed during eight days of incubation with a plateau on days 4 to 8 however investigating antiscalants short term effects fig s10 is relevant considering shorter hydraulic retention times along the water line in desalination plants seasonally related seawater chemistry would certainly influence the biological response of antiscalants under phosphorus limiting conditions phosphonate based antiscalants containing orthophosphates as contaminants can promote biofouling we need to beware of the seasonal dynamics of seawater properties thus antiscalant s biological response may vary accordingly whether other key elements drive such response needs further investigation for example considering that some antiscalants are metal chelators investigating whether antiscalants chelating iron would delay or inhibit bacterial growth potential would be relevant since the antiscalants bacterial growth potential is related to their chemical signature predictive tools can be developed in the future for instance having a richer dataset of antiscalant bacterial growth potential and their associated nmr spectra the growth potential of a new unknown commercial antiscalant might be predicted by obtaining its nmr spectra and cluster analysis 5 conclusions we investigated the bacterial growth potential of eight different antiscalants in natural seawater and an autochthonous bacterial population as inoculum the main conclusions of this study are as follows a rational selection of antiscalants is possible based on assessing both their bacterial growth potential and chemical structure antiscalants differed strongly in bacterial growth potential in natural seawater demonstrating that some antiscalants can contribute to biofilm formation in membrane systems antiscalants nmr signals allow grouping antiscalants regardless of knowing their chemical structure moreover based on cluster analysis phosphonates within the same cluster exhibited comparable bacterial growth potential phosphonate based antiscalants which contained phosphorus in addition to that of the nominal compound significantly promote bacterial growth under phosphorus limiting conditions a biopolymeric or synthetic polymer antiscalants promoted minor or no significant bacterial growth respectively the bacterial communities that develop in the presence of antiscalants serving as a phosphorus source did not significantly differ from those in the absence of antiscalants synopsis we present an innovative approach to test the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants in natural seawater which combined with their nmr chemical

15013,20 years since the first report on the biofouling potential of chemicals used for scale control still antiscalants with high bacterial growth potential are used in practice evaluating the bacterial growth potential of commercially available antiscalants is therefore essential for a rational selection of these chemicals previous antiscalant growth potential tests were conducted in drinking water or seawater inoculated with model bacterial species which do not represent natural bacterial communities to reflect better on the conditions of desalination systems we investigated the bacterial growth potential of eight different antiscalants in natural seawater and an autochthonous bacterial population as inoculum the antiscalants differed strongly in their bacterial growth potential varying from 1 to 6 μg easily biodegradable c equivalents mg antiscalant the six phosphonate based antiscalants investigated showed a broad range of growth potential which depended on their chemical composition whilst the biopolymer and the synthetic carboxylated polymers based antiscalants showed limited or no significant bacterial growth moreover nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scans enabled antiscalant fingerprinting identifying components and contaminants providing a rapid and sensitive characterization and opening opportunities for rational selection of antiscalants for biofouling control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphonates flow cytometry green antiscalant biofilm growth potential nmr chemical fingerprint seawater reverse osmosis swro membrane module data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the most economic viable option to obtain fresh water in arid or water stress regions is to desalinate seawater seawater desalination by reverse osmosis ro provides freshwater at a current rate of 65 5 million m3 day which accounts for 69 of the volume of desalinated water produced worldwide jones et al 2019 the fact that seawater is vast can give a false notion that obtaining freshwater from desalination is a straightforward solution to our ever increasing water scarcity problem however seawater desalination uses large amounts of energy and chemicals and generates wastes in the form of brine and about 14 000 tons of membrane module waste that is globally landfilled yearly senán salinas et al 2019 therefore every effort to reduce the environmental and economic impacts of seawater desalination is of relevance in the ro process high hydrostatic pressure is applied about 55 to 70 bar to force water passage through a semi permeable membrane the water recovery of a seawater ro installation is about 35 to 45 miyakawa et al 2021 and up to 50 schunke et al 2020 nevertheless ro is currently the most reliable and cost effective seawater desalination method qasim et al 2019 although the technology is well established experts recognize that innovations in membrane technology operation and management are critical to improving the sustainability of delivering freshwater qasim et al 2019 the accumulation of unwanted material on the membrane surface collectively called fouling is recognized as one top difficulties to improve ro desalination for future sustainable water supplies matin et al 2021 fouling includes deposition of inorganic minerals accumulation of particulate matter and biofouling which refers to biofilm formation resulting from deposition of organic matter and microbial deposition and growth flemming 2020 goh et al 2018 nagaraj et al 2018 layers of fouling and biofouling of a few micrometers thick are enough to induce increased energy for water production decrease membrane efficiency and ultimately early membrane failure gonzalez gil et al 2021 the deposition of inorganic minerals or scaling occurs when the concentration of rejected salts along the ro membrane exceeds their solubility limit common mineral scaling includes gypsum caso4 2h2o calcium carbonate caco3 barite baso4 and silica sio2 tong et al 2019 to mitigate scaling problems various methods including feed water pretreatment the optimization of operational processes the development of new membrane materials and the addition of antiscalants have been developed matin et al 2019 yu et al 2020 thus far the addition of antiscalants during pretreatment of the feed water is the most cost effective and convenient method for membrane scaling control at high water recoveries antiscalants are chemicals that inhibit the formation of minerals through chelation dispersion and or by blocking crystal growth sites yu et al 2020 current commercial antiscalants are mainly based on phosphonates or synthetic organic polymers or co polymers hasson et al 2011 phosphonates are characterized by phosphonic groups attached to a carbon atom c po3h2 which give them high stability under wide ph range and high temperatures polymeric antiscalants are constituted by polycarboxylic acids cooh on an aliphatic chain due to concerns that phosphonates can promote eutrophication when discharged and that polymeric antiscalants may remain in the environment for several years matin et al 2019 green or environmental friendly antiscalants were developed these are based on succinic or aspartic acid polymers rabizadeh et al 2019 or the carboxymethylation of inulin a polysaccharide extracted from the chicory plant roots boels and witkamp 2011 although antiscalants mitigate inorganic fouling they can increase the potential of biofouling which is regarded as the most difficult fouling problem to deal with flemming 2020 depending on their chemical components antiscalants can function as phosphorus and or carbon sources for microbial growth antiscalants and acids added to freshwater enhanced bacterial growth causing a significant blockage in a laboratory ro membrane fouling simulator vrouwenvelder et al 2000 and a pilot scale ro van der hoek et al 2000 similarly an unknown phosphonate and a polyacrylate based antiscalant added to seawater or brackish water increased the biofilm formation rate on the surface of ro membranes sweity et al 2013 2015 consequently evaluating the bacterial growth potential of commercially available antiscalants is essential for a rational selection of these chemicals previous evaluations on the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants substantially helped realize that the prevention of a scale problem could translate into a ro feed spacer and membrane biofouling problem araújo et al 2012 vrouwenvelder et al 2009 however those evaluations suffer from several limitations among others previous antiscalant growth potential studies were conducted using drinking water inoculated with two single bacterial species isolated from freshwater vrouwenvelder et al 2000 or seawater inoculated with a model bacterial species sweity et al 2015 these conditions however are in stark contrast to those in natural seawater with diverse bacterial populations furthermore previous studies provide no or limited information regarding the chemical composition of the tested antiscalants which is relevant to understanding why and to what extent chemically different antiscalants may promote bacterial growth moreover the number of commercially available antiscalants for ro systems is large new antiscalants are constantly introduced in the market and providers do not disclose the antiscalants chemical composition testing all available antiscalants for their growth potential is not practical therefore there is a need to determine the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants under relevant seawater conditions and ideally for predictive purposes relate the antiscalants biological response to their chemical composition here we used a high throughput single bacterial cell detection method flow cytometry fcm to assess the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants using natural seawater and an autochthonous bacterial population from the same seawater sample as inoculum moreover nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scans allowed the classifying of all tested commercial antiscalants even if their chemical identity was undisclosed helping to understand their biological response the bacterial growth potential and the nmr scans enabled sensitive antiscalants fingerprinting which allows an informed selection of antiscalants achievable and contributes to biofouling control in seawater desalination 2 materials and methods 2 1 antiscalants we obtained eight technical antiscalants commonly used in seawater treatment applications from four commercial suppliers four antiscalants had no chemical information three antiscalants were labeled as atmp amino trimethylene phosphonic acid and one was labeled as based on polyacrylate acrylic acid copolymer table 1 2 2 chemical characterization of antiscalants since most suppliers did not provide the antiscalants chemical composition we determined their elemental composition i e c p and their chemical structure by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy 2 2 1 total organic carbon toc and total phosphorus the toc concentration of antiscalants was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu kyoto japan and quantification was based upon calibration by a series of external standards 0 to 10 mg toc l 1 prepared using a certified toc solution 20 ppm c ricca chemical co to measure the phosphorus concentration we used stock solutions of antiscalants 3 g l 1 and diluted them with 1 v v hno3 then the phosphorus content was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 5110 quantification with the phosphorus line p 177 434 nm was based upon calibration by a series of external standards prepared with 1 v v hno3 using a certified inorganic phosphorus solution msp 100ppm inorganic ventures the detection limit of the method is about 20 μg p l 1 2 2 2 nmr about 5 to 10 mg of lyophilized antiscalant sample were transferred to a 3 ml glass bottle and dissolved in 600 μl of d2o 99 9 then 550 μl of solution were transferred to a 5 mm nmr tube a bruker 600 avanac iii spectrometer equipped with bbof bruker probe brukerbiospin rheinstetten germany was used to record all nmr spectra the 1h nmr spectra were recorded as described before abdul jameel et al 2016 the 31p nmr are collected according to published parameters tomah al masri et al 2012 the 13c nmr spectra were recorded using 30 flip angle pulse sequence by collecting 2048 scans with 5 s recycle delay abdul jameel et al 2018 bruker topspin 3 5pl7 software was used for both data collection and analyses to classify the antiscalants based on their nmr chemical fingerprints we concatenated their 1h 13c and 31p nmr spectra and performed a hierarchical cluster analysis hca using the chemospec package in r core team 2017 the hca was derived from euclidian distances on zero to one normalized spectra using the complete linkage method mestrenova v 14 1 0 24037 was used to predict the 1h 13c and 31p nmr spectra of various defined chemicals widely used as antiscalants the results of predicted nmr spectra were compared to the measured nmr spectra of the studied antiscalants to elucidate their chemical structure 2 3 determining the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants eight commercial antiscalants were tested for their microbial growth potential in other words we measured the growth of bacterial and archaeal cells in the seawater when exposed to antiscalants since our previous study showed that bacteria largely dominate over archaea phylotypes in the seawater elcik et al 2022 for simplicity we will refer to the microbial growth potential as bacterial growth potential tests of the different antiscalants were run simultaneously to eliminate any impact of seasonal changes in seawater composition on the results seawater from the red sea was collected in assimilable organic carbon free aoc borosilicate glass bottles in july 2021 from the intake of the seawater desalination pilot plant in kaust saudi arabia the collected seawater had an initial measured bacterial cell concentration of 200 000 cells ml 1 therefore seawater was filtered to remove microbial cells and to set a desired low initial cell concentration for the growth potential assay within approximately 10 000 to 20 000 bacterial cells ml 1 one liter of seawater was serially filtered through pre cleaned 0 45 μm pore size and 0 2 μm pore size polyethersulfone filters satorius stedium minisart the filters were replaced every 100 ml filtration allowed removing protozoa to avoid bacterial grazing kuuppo leinikki 1990 which could result in a large underestimation of a sample s bacterial growth potential then 30 ml of the resulting filtered seawater with a bacterial cell concentration of 21 000 1200 cells ml 1 was added to aoc free 40 ml borosilicate glass vials with screw caps containing ptfe lined silicone septa antiscalants were added from stock solutions 3 g l 1 to the vials at a final concentration of 50 mg l 1 vials with no antiscalant addition were included as a control the vials were then incubated at 30 c in the dark and bacterial growth was determined by measuring cell concentrations over time using flow cytometry each growth potential test was conducted in three independent biological replicates here we chose to test antiscalants at 50 mg of provided antiscalant l 1 since in practice i their dosing range varies widely 1 50 mg l 1 ii this value is in the upper dosing range and iii the concentration of added antiscalants will increase along the ro membrane modeules arranged in series in the pressure vessel as a result of solute retention leading to a higher concentration on the membrane surface than in the bulk liquid i e concentration polarization flow cytometry fcm was used to measure the bacterial cell concentration in the vials every 24 h to this end 5 μl sybr green i invitrogen 100 diluted in 10 mm tris buffer ph 8 1 were added to a final 0 5 ml vial samples in amber microfuge tubes followed by mixing and incubation for 10 min in the dark at 35 c stained cells were measured with a bd accuri c6 instrument in fixed 50 μl volume mode with a sample flow rate of 35 μl min 1 the blue 488 nm laser 50 mw was used to collect the green fluorescence at fl1 533 30 nm the red fluorescence fl3 670 nm as well as intrinsic cell parameters given by the side scattered ssh and forward scattered fsh light signals electronic gating was used to separate positive microbial stained signals from instrument and water background noise as described by prest et al 2013 filtered sterilized 0 1 μm ultrapure water as well as unstained samples were used as controls in all runs the instrument performance was verified using spherotech 8 peak validation beads to evaluate whether bacterial growth on antiscalants was greater than the control the bacterial growth curves were compared using a one tailed paired wilcoxon signed rank test at a significance level α 0 05 2 4 flow cytometry based bacterial community analysis the bacterial communities in the growth potential tests were characterized through flow cytometric fingerprinting following the procedure of props et al 2016 using the phenoflow and flowcore packages in r core team 2017 briefly the fluorescence and scatter parameters in signal to height format i e fl1 h fl2 h ssc h and fsc h from the raw fcs files were extracted and rescaled using the arcsine hyperbolic option then a fixed gate was placed on the fluorescence signals to separate bacteria from noise and other background sources and two further gates were applied to determine the proportion of cells with high and low nucleic acid contents i e hna and lna as defined by prest et al 2013 the distribution of normalized nucleic acid i e fl1 h fl2 h and morphology signals i e ssc h fsc h were used to calculate the phenotypic alpha diversity expressed as hill numbers from which d2 corresponds to the inverse simpson index props et al 2018 to this end the diversity rf function was used with default parameters except that the grid resolution was increased to 256 the beta diversity was determined by principal coordinates analysis pcoa of the phenotypic fingerprints using the bray curtis dissimilarity the group differences in beta diversity were assessed by analysis of similarity anosim using the vegan package in r 3 results 3 1 chemical characterization of antiscalants chemical suppliers do not disclose the specific chemical formulation of antiscalants which is relevant to understanding their growth potential therefore we investigated their chemical composition and structure the eight antiscalants investigated had different commercial names and were from four different manufacturers each manufacturer provided two products recommended as antiscalants these are globally used in practice in desalination plants for commercial reasons we coded the antiscalants as as 1 to as 8 table 1 3 1 1 carbon and phosphorus content in antiscalants considering that a biodegradable antiscalant would provide carbon for bacterial growth we measured the toc in the antiscalants fig 1 a most antiscalants had low carbon contents at levels 40 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 among them as 3 had the lowest carbon content 2 6 0 7 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 in contrast the toc in antiscalants as 6 115 23 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 and as 8 110 2 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that in the other six antiscalants fig 1a besides carbon the phosphorous in antiscalants may promote microbial growth except for as 6 all antiscalants contained phosphorus fig 1b four antiscalants had contents of 60 to 100 μg p mg antiscalant 1 as 8 had the lowest measured p content at 0 2 μg p mg antiscalant 1 the two antiscalants with the highest carbon content had phosphorus below detection limit or the lowest phosphorus content fig 1a and b 3 1 2 antiscalants nmr spectra and structure since the chemical composition of antiscalants can determine their growth potential we analyzed their nmr based chemical fingerprint fig 1c the 1h 13c and 31p nmr spectra show that the antiscalants as 3 as 4 and as 5 were chemically highly similar fig 1c antiscalants as 6 and as 8 were chemically the most complex presenting a multitude of peaks in their 1h and 13c spectra except for as 6 all antiscalants produced 31p nmr signals fig 1c hierarchical cluster analysis allowed the grouping of the antiscalants based on their chemical nmr fingerprint the resulting dendrogram showed that as 4 and as 5 are the most similar and together with as 3 they form a cluster and closer to this cluster is as 2 in contrast as 6 and as 8 have a distinct chemical structure that separates them from the rest of the antiscalants fig 1d moreover the chemical structure of the antiscalants was identified or approximated by comparing their nmr spectra to predicted spectra of common antiscalants see figs s1 to s7 in the supplemental material for details the antiscalants as 3 as 4 as 5 and as 1 were identified as phosphonate based table 1 the 1h peak at 3 3 3 7 ppm corresponds to h in the methylene group ch2 the 13c peak at 72 57 ppm corresponds to the c in the n c p bond and the 31p peak at 7 8 ppm is the c p signal fig 1c collectively these chemical shifts correspond to amino trimethylene phosphonic acid atmp an antiscalant with three phosphonic acid groups fig s1 as 2 is also a phosphonate but with four phosphonic acid groups and was identified as hexamethylenediamine tetra methylenephosphonic acid hdtmp fig s2 the 31p nmr spectra showed that all atmp as 3 as 4 as 5 and as 1 and the hdtmp as 2 phosphonates based antiscalants tested contained contaminants i e peaks besides the nominal phosphonate peak particularly orthophosphates and phosphate esters yield nmr peaks below 5 ppm fig 1c as 7 is also a phosphonate but chemically different from the other phosphonate based antiscalants we identified as 7 as 1 hydroxyethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp the 1h peak at 1 4 1 5 ppm ch3 the 13c peaks at 19 ppm ch3 and 70 ppm p c p and the 31p peak at 19 ppm p c p are characteristic of the antiscalant hedp fig s3 in contrast as 6 and as 8 are polymers as 6 had 1h shifts at 3 5 and 4 5 ppm which can be assigned to methine groups ch in hexose and pentoses respectively the 13c shifts at ca 60 70 and 75 80 ppm were assigned to ch2 and ch respectively furthermore as 6 had a typical carboxylic cooh shift at 178 ppm fig 1c no 31p signal was detected for as 6 thus this was the only phosphorus free antiscalant fig 1c the nmr spectra of as 6 resemble those of inulin a carboxy polyfructose figs s4 and s5 on the other hand as 8 spectra resemble those of the copolymer of maleic and acrylic acid ma aa figs s6 and s7 which is a common antiscalant as 8 contains other components besides ma aa for example 31p shifts at 2 and 4 5 ppm may indicate the presence of phosphate esters at trace amounts considering the low phosphorus contents 0 2 μg p mg antiscalant 1 of as 8 overall the antiscalants studied could be grouped into phosphonates and bio and synthetic polymers having determined the antiscalants chemical fingerprints the next step was to determine their bacterial growth potential 3 2 the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants in seawater with an autochthonous bacterial population to determine whether antiscalants would promote seawater bacterial growth seawater with an initial bacterial cell concentration of 20 000 cells ml 1 was incubated in the absence reference control and in the presence of 50 mg l 1 of eight chemically diverse antiscalants the bacterial growth of antiscalants was compared to that of the reference seawater microorganisms respond to the presence of antiscalants the phosphonate based antiscalants as 1 and as 2 resulted in the highest bacterial growth the reference bacterial growth in the seawater without added antiscalant reached about 1 5 106 cells ml 1 after 8 days of incubation in contrast when phosphonate based atmp as 1 as 3 as 4 as 5 and hdtmp as 2 antiscalants were added the bacterial growth curves significantly differed from that of the reference p 0 05 one tail wilcoxon signed rank test with cell numbers reaching about 2 106 to 3 106 cells ml 1 fig 2 a the biopolymeric antiscalant as 6 slightly promoted microbial growth distinctively the antiscalants similar to the phosphonate hedp as 7 and the synthetic polymer aa ma as 8 did not promote growth p 0 05 and their resulting bacterial growth resembled that of the reference fig 2a the amount of bacteria that grew in the presence of antiscalant in excess to that of the control without antiscalant can be expressed in terms of carbon utilized from antiscalant to produce such number of bacteria comparing those values with the measured toc in antiscalants may inform on the antiscalants biodegradability to this end we considered the net number of cells produced after 8 days of incubation fig 2a and a yield for seawater bacteria of 4 6 106 cells μg c 1 reported by dhakal et al 2021 the results were expressed in terms of assimilable organic carbon from the antiscalant μg aoc mg antiscalant 1 fig 2b the polymeric antiscalants as 6 and as 8 and the hedp like phosphonate as 7 were hardly biodegradable for example the estimated aoc from as 8 under the tested conditions was about 1 μg aoc mg antiscalant 1 which represents a biodegradability of 1 for this antiscalant fig 2b in contrast the aoc derived from the growth potential on all phosphonates atmp like antiscalants ranged from 3 to 6 μg aoc mg antiscalant 1 in particular the biodegradability of as 3 derived from its growth potential was above by about 40 the measured toc content for this antiscalant fig 2b thus indicating that phosphorus in the antiscalant promoted bacterial growth and that the growth of microorganisms in the seawater during the growth potential test was phosphorus limited 3 3 bacterial community dynamics during growth potential of antiscalants to explore whether bacterial growth in the presence of the antiscalants would result in differing bacterial communities we used a flow cytometric fingerprint approach which consists in analyzing and tagging bacterial phenotypes based on their optical characteristics i e cells fluorescence and morphology based on their fluorescence intensities bacteria were grouped into high nucleic acid hna or low nucleic acid lna content bacteria hammes and egli 2010 these may represent different bacterial communities or different metabolic status of the same microbial community at the start of the growth potential tests only 30 of the cells were hna independent of the presence of antiscalants the population of hna cells readily increased to about 90 after 1 2 days of incubation thereafter their proportion decreased fig 3 the bacterial diversity derived from the flow cytometric fluorescence and morphology signals i e phenotypic alpha diversity decreased during the microbial growth potential fig 4 a the decrease was independent of the addition and type of antiscalants suggesting a preferential growth of certain microbial types moreover the bacterial communities that developed in the control without antiscalants were not considerably different from those in the presence of antiscalants the bacterial communities in all samples however differed significantly p 0 05 over the incubation time the phenotypic beta diversity expressed as the bray curtis dissimilarities between samples and analyzed by principal coordinates pcoa shows how the communities shifted as a function of the incubation time fig 4b the largest changes in the bacterial communities occurred at day 2 and at day 4 8 fig s8 4 discussion desalination plants use antiscalants to prevent scale formation on the ro membranes in practice the selection of an antiscalant mainly focuses on the type of scales it avoids and does not consider its bacterial growth potential bacterial growth at the point of antiscalant dosage or later on in the ro membrane is detrimental to membrane performance due to membrane and spacer biofouling thus a rational selection of antiscalants should include information regarding their bacterial growth potential to enable biofilm control 4 1 not all phosphorus based antiscalants promote bacterial growth even at phosphorus limiting conditions based on their chemical structure antiscalants are broadly classified as phosphorus and non phosphorus based systems containing organic carbon and none or insufficient bioavailable phosphorus for bacterial growth are regarded as phosphorus limiting duhamel et al 2021 lehtola et al 2002 previous research showed that phosphonate based antiscalants promote biofilm growth of freshwater bacteria vrouwenvelder et al 2010 vibrio fischeri sweity et al 2013 or pseudomonas fluorescence sweity et al 2015 on ro membranes under phosphorus limiting conditions here we infer that the bacteria in the seawater at the time of the growth potential were phosphorus limited this is because as 3 with a phosphorus content of 4 7 0 2 μg p mg antiscalant 1 and with the lowest carbon content among all antiscalants 2 6 0 7 μg toc mg antiscalant 1 fig 1a and b had a bacterial growth potential that exceeded by 40 its carbon content fig 2a and b six of the different antiscalants investigated had a phosphorus content ranging from 4 7 to 100 μg p mg antiscalant 1 however not all promoted bacterial growth distinctively as 7 did not promote growth despite having three times more phosphorus than as 3 which promoted substantial growth thus understanding why the phosphorus based as 7 did not promote growth calls for details on the chemical structure of the tested antiscalants 4 2 advantages of grouping antiscalants through their nmr fingerprints there is a large number of antiscalants in the market and for the majority their chemical composition is undisclosed this represents a limitation towards a rational selection for their application in ro systems since the chemical structure of antiscalants inherently determines their potential to promote or not bacterial growth of course besides their effectiveness as antiscalant with the help of an nmr fingerprint approach it is possible to group antiscalants by their chemical signatures even if the identity of the antiscalant is unknown nmr analysis yields unique spectral fingerprints for different molecules and functional groups we did not know the main component of most of the antiscalants studied for example the chemical structure of the main component in as 3 as 5 as 6 as 7 and as 8 was unknown a hierarchical analysis of antiscalants nmr spectra can reveal clusters allowing for approximating the chemical structure of their main components the nmr spectra of as 3 as 4 and as 5 were highly similar fig 1c and hence made a cluster distance of about 10 in fig 1d technical data were only available for as 4 referred to it as atmp which is a phosphonate antiscalant hence from their clustering we infer that as 5 and as 3 which were from other different manufacturers were also atmp antiscalants as 2 as 1 and as 7 were closer to the atmp closer than as 6 and as 8 suggesting that as 7 was also a phosphonate antiscalant indeed 31p nmr spectra from all those antiscalants show phosphate peaks from 7 to 20 ppm fig 1c which are characteristic of phosphonates sannigrahi and ingall 2005 however in contrast to the other phosphonates as 7 phosphonate peak was distinctively at 20 ppm thus given a set of nmr spectra of chemically defined antiscalants and their clustering it would be possible to classify commercial antiscalants for which no chemical information is provided 4 3 the majority of antiscalants are phosphonate based identifying the main component of antiscalants is paramount to understanding their bacterial growth potential we identified or approximate the main component of antiscalants for which no technical information was provided by comparing their measured nmr spectra with the predicted spectra of commonly used antiscalants see details in si six out of the eight antiscalants tested were phosphonates suggesting a large representation of these chemicals in the market despite their potential environmental burden among the phosphonates as 7 was identified as hedp and as 2 was identified as hdtmp half of the commercial antiscalants tested were the same phosphonate namely atmp as 1 as 3 as 4 and as 5 thus the majority of the antiscalants were the same phosphonate meaning that various manufacturers supply the same atmp antiscalant just with some variations only two of the eight antiscalants studied were polymers as 8 was a maleic acid acrylic acid copolymer mixed with trace contents of phosphate esters as 6 was a biopolymer namely carboxylated inulin 4 4 the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants is related to their chemical fingerprint the bacterial growth potential of eight antiscalants was measured in natural seawater and with a seawater autochthonous bacterial community the antiscalants bacterial growth potential reflected their chemical nmr fingerprint previous studies on antiscalants growth potential used pure bacterial cultures mainly freshwater isolates which are not representative of marine bacterial communities 4 4 1 the phosphonate based antiscalants made of atmp and hdtmp promoted bacterial growth all phosphonate antiscalants made of atmp and hdtmp promoted bacterial growth under the conditions tested we found that at the time of the tests phosphorus was limiting in the seawater hence the marine bacteria readily utilized the phosphorus in the antiscalant global surveys show that the ocean surface is phosphorus depleted with varying concentrations from ca 0 3 to 1 μg l 1 duhamel et al 2021 microorganisms have flexible phosphorus demands to cope with such low and varying phosphorus availability for example the molar c p ratio of marine bacterioplankton can range from 35 to 178 vrede et al 2002 considering a c p mid value of 100 and the measured aoc of atmp and hdtmp antiscalants of 3 to 6 μg c mg antiscalant 1 fig 2b the corresponding bacterial phosphorus uptake would be 0 09 to 0 16 μg p mg antiscalant 1 this uptake translates to 0 1 to 0 25 of the phosphorus content measured in the antiscalants as 5 as 4 as 2 and as 1 and 2 of that in as 3 would atmp antiscalants promote microbial growth at lower dosages the growth potential tests were done with 50 mg l 1 the dosage of antiscalants varies and though this value is in the upper range yu et al 2020 we expect that antiscalants concentrations will increase inside ro modules due to concentration polarization based on our results we can extrapolate that even at dosages of 5 mg l 1 the phosphorus contribution by as 3 the atmp based antiscalant with the lowest content of the nominal compound lowest c and p content fig 1a and b would be 0 47 μg p mg antiscalant 1 this means that 5 mg l 1 of as 8 contains 0 47 μg p mg antiscalant 1 which is still five times higher than the estimated phosphorus uptake 0 09 μg p mg antiscalant 1 for the measured microbial growth potential at 50 mg l 1 of as 3 hence atmp and hdtmp antiscalants need careful decisions for usage to what extent the phosphorus supplied by atmp and hdtmp antiscalants was due to the degradation of the phosphonate or by phosphorus in antiscalants as contaminants from the 31p nmr spectra of these phosphonate antiscalants we infer that other phosphorus components besides the phosphonate are present specifically the measured 31p chemical shifts below 5 ppm are in the range of orthophosphate and phosphate esters sannigrahi and ingall 2005 this supports recent findings that atmp antiscalants contain other phosphorus compounds besides the nominal product using anion exchange chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry armbruster et al found that the contribution of inorganic phosphorus in atmp products is 5 10 armbruster et al 2019 which is a considerable value since we found that only 0 1 to 0 25 from the phosphorus in atmp can significantly promote microbial growth this means that even if the phosphorus in the phosphonate is not utilized inorganic phosphorus contaminants can be utilized diverse environmental parameters are important when assessing the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants for example in previous studies as 5 atmp based did not promote extensive bacterial growth and only minor biomass accumulation occurred in membrane fouling simulators operated with groundwater duiven et al 2010 given that as 1 to as 5 can provide phosphorus for bacterial growth we expect that the bacterial growth potential of these phosphonate based antiscalants would be low in waters with low carbon contents moreover considering that phosphonate antiscalants strongly chelate the microbially essential metal iron deluchat et al 1997 we could expect low effects under iron limiting conditions since seawater chemical and microbial composition are dynamic al otaibi et al 2020 fuhrman et al 2015 it would be relevant to assess the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants over various seasons 4 4 2 antiscalant hedp is a phosphonate that did not promote bacterial growth although as 7 is a phosphonate the bacterial growth potential of this antiscalant was not significantly different from that of the control without an antiscalant we identified as 7 as hedp similar to our results steber and wierich 1986 found no indication of aerobic or anaerobic biodegradability of hedp in stark contrast to atmp and hdtmp antiscalants the 31p nmr spectra of as 7 did not show contaminant phosphorus peaks the only phosphorus peak detected was assigned to the phosphonate hedp fig 1c thus this antiscalant did not contribute to easily available phosphorus to the bacteria this highlights the importance of the chemical fingerprints to scan for antiscalants suitability and suggests that phosphorus contaminants e g orthophosphate as in the case of atmp and hdtmp can readily promote unwanted bacterial growth under phosphorus limiting conditions regarding the persistence of phosphonates in the environment we know that the c p bond of phosphonates is chemically stable however some bacteria can hydrolyze this bond agarwal et al 2011 specifically pseudomonas fluorescence a bacterium used in previous growth potential tests on antiscalants can hydrolyze various phosphonates zboińska et al 1992 another study showed that arthrobacter sp and bacterial enrichments from compost and activated sludge could break hedp schowanek and verstraete 1990 however genes for phosphonate catabolism by c p lyase are not widespread in marine microbial communities lockwood et al 2022 specifically based on a global ocean survey it was found that the presence of bacterial genes encoding the breakage of c p bonds in seawater was limited to only 30 of the sites sampled and in only 2 to 5 of the sampled genomes villarreal chiu et al 2012 thus the relevance to conducting bacterial growth potential of antiscalants for ro purposes under seawater conditions and with autochthonous microbial communities in summary the hedp antiscalant as 7 did not promote bacterial growth this antiscalant did not contain detectable levels of contaminant bioavailable phosphorus 4 4 3 phosphorus free antiscalants a bio and a synthetic polymer are less susceptible to promoting bacterial growth with the drive to protect the environment phosphorus free antiscalants have been developed one example is carboxymethyl inulin a biopolymer produced from the carboxylation of a polysaccharide of fructose extracted from chicory plant roots due to its biological origin carboxymethyl inulin is tagged as a biodegradable green antiscalant with a capacity to inhibit caco3 precipitation comparable to phosphonates boels and witkamp 2011 we identified as 6 as carboxymethyl inulin despite being tagged as biodegradable limited information is available regarding the biodegradability of this antiscalant in membrane fouling simulators fed with groundwater treated with as 6 moderate biomass accumulation occurred duiven et al 2010 in our study we found that under the conditions tested the biodegradability of as 6 was only 1 after eight days of incubation with red sea bacterial communities this suggests that this antiscalant is either hardly degradable i e recalcitrant or that it may degrade after longer times further experiments that run for a longer incubation time are essential to determine the degradability of the inulin antiscalant however in practice this antiscalant having low short term biodegradability seems a reasonable option as caco3 precipitation inhibitor another type of phosphorus free antiscalants is synthetic polymers these antiscalants are rich in carboxylic groups and show a good scale inhibition yu et al 2020 as 8 is a synthetic polymer its main component is similar to the copolymer acrylic maleic acid ma aa a polycarboxylate antiscalant during the 8 days of bacterial growth potential only about 1 of as 8 was biodegraded fig 2b hence this antiscalant is difficult to degrade and some bacteria in the seawater degrade it only to a minor degree longer incubation times under e g non p n fe limiting conditions would be needed to determine the extent of the antiscalant degradation since some polymeric antiscalants are made of organic acids they are regarded as biodegradable however little information is available regarding their microbial growth potential sweity et al found that a polyacrylate antiscalant did not promote the growth of the bacteria pseudomonas fluorescens f113 when cultured in a flask containing brackish water sweity et al 2015 results of biodegradation test using 14c labeled ma aa in river water and sediment showed that this copolymer was not readily biodegradable in those tests only after long incubation times 100 days about 10 to 30 of the compound was transformed to 14co2 which indicates partial degradation of the copolymer hera 2010 thus our results are in line with previous findings since as 8 did not significantly promote bacterial growth taken together polymer based antiscalants are hardly biodegradable and in our study the antiscalant based on the copolymer ma aa did not significantly increase bacterial growth if compared with the reference seawater without antiscalant previous research showed that polyacrylate leads to biofouling by promoting initial bacterial attachment instead of bacterial growth sweity et al 2015 hence further studies with ro membranes are recommended to explore the additional effects of the ma aa copolymer further studies are needed on antiscalants biomass interactions organic molecules may act as chelators and or may hinder nucleation and crystal growth van driessche et al 2019 and some bacteria may promote scale formation ashfaq et al 2020 van driessche et al 2019 4 5 the bacterial communities changed as a function of time but not as a function of antiscalant type we tested whether the antiscalants would drive distinctive changes in the bacterial community during the growth potential tests this information is relevant since different bacterial taxa have different metabolic traits and capacities to form biofilms guillonneau et al 2018 for example gamma proteobacteria accounted for 30 of the biofilm community on a desalination plant ro membrane zhang et al 2011 flow cytometry allows for studying dynamic changes in bacterial community structures koch et al 2014 rubbens and props 2021 differences in nucleic acid content and cell morphology in bacterial communities are associated with differing taxa rubbens et al 2019 or with cells having higher metabolic rates bowman et al 2017 servais et al 2003 during the bacterial growth potential the population of cells operationally defined as having high nucleic acid hna content readily increased from 30 to 90 within one day of incubation this trend was independent of the presence of antiscalants fig 3 moreover the number of hna cells positively correlated with the number of growing cells fig s9 which reflects the high metabolic activity of hna bacteria in line with our results bowman et al 2017 found a positive correlation between the fraction of hna and bacterial productivity in a large dataset comprising freshwater and marine samples other studies also found that hna cells were metabolically more active than lna cells from marine brackish and freshwater ecosystems and that these subpopulations were composed of the same dominant bacterial species servais et al 2003 considering that previous studies showed correlations between flow cytometry based phenotypic diversity and taxonomic diversity rubbens et al 2019 and references therein we used the phenotypic diversity index as a proxy to gain insights on shifts in the bacterial communities of the growth potential on antiscalants we found that in all tests the phenotypic diversity alpha diversity rapidly declined suggesting the enrichment i e preferential growth of certain taxa the enriched bacterial communities with or without antiscalant did not differ substantially under the conditions tested i e they had similar pcoa coordinates fig 4b however the bacterial communities differ significantly as a function of time anosim p 0 0001 r 0 69 specifically from day 0 during maximum growth day 2 3 and when the maximum cell numbers were reached day 4 to 8 since time and not antiscalants structured the bacterial communities it is possible that antiscalants did not significantly provide a distinct carbon under the conditions and period tested this finding may support the notion that during relatively short times the greatest danger of antiscalants particularly atmp is their growth potential by providing a phosphorus source under phosphorus limiting conditions although there can be links between taxonomy and the structure of the flow cytometry data as found in cooling water systems props et al 2016 and natural lake bacterioplankton props et al 2018 we should beware that the resolution of flow cytometric fingerprinting is lower compared to genetic fingerprinting for example different taxa can be grouped within the same cytometric category and the same taxa may be represented by different cytometric categories if its size changes over growth cycles therefore genomic sequencing approaches should be included in future studies for increased resolution when comparing the bacterial communities of the growth potential on antiscalants 4 6 practical implications and research needs in addition to its anti scaling efficiency the selection of antiscalants should consider its bacterial growth potential to minimize associated biofouling to this end we propose an approach for assessing the growth potential of antiscalants in natural seawater and using autochthonous bacterial communities the growth potential of other chemicals e g acids used in the water industry as well as the growth potential of antiscalants as a function of storage conditions e g temperature light exposure storage time in the plants should be also investigated for example storage favoring photodegradation of phosphonate based antiscalants would likely increase their biofouling potential here the growth potential was assessed during eight days of incubation with a plateau on days 4 to 8 however investigating antiscalants short term effects fig s10 is relevant considering shorter hydraulic retention times along the water line in desalination plants seasonally related seawater chemistry would certainly influence the biological response of antiscalants under phosphorus limiting conditions phosphonate based antiscalants containing orthophosphates as contaminants can promote biofouling we need to beware of the seasonal dynamics of seawater properties thus antiscalant s biological response may vary accordingly whether other key elements drive such response needs further investigation for example considering that some antiscalants are metal chelators investigating whether antiscalants chelating iron would delay or inhibit bacterial growth potential would be relevant since the antiscalants bacterial growth potential is related to their chemical signature predictive tools can be developed in the future for instance having a richer dataset of antiscalant bacterial growth potential and their associated nmr spectra the growth potential of a new unknown commercial antiscalant might be predicted by obtaining its nmr spectra and cluster analysis 5 conclusions we investigated the bacterial growth potential of eight different antiscalants in natural seawater and an autochthonous bacterial population as inoculum the main conclusions of this study are as follows a rational selection of antiscalants is possible based on assessing both their bacterial growth potential and chemical structure antiscalants differed strongly in bacterial growth potential in natural seawater demonstrating that some antiscalants can contribute to biofilm formation in membrane systems antiscalants nmr signals allow grouping antiscalants regardless of knowing their chemical structure moreover based on cluster analysis phosphonates within the same cluster exhibited comparable bacterial growth potential phosphonate based antiscalants which contained phosphorus in addition to that of the nominal compound significantly promote bacterial growth under phosphorus limiting conditions a biopolymeric or synthetic polymer antiscalants promoted minor or no significant bacterial growth respectively the bacterial communities that develop in the presence of antiscalants serving as a phosphorus source did not significantly differ from those in the absence of antiscalants synopsis we present an innovative approach to test the bacterial growth potential of antiscalants in natural seawater which combined with their nmr chemical fingerprints provides opportunities for rational selection of antiscalants to avoid their induced biofouling in desalination membrane systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

steadily achieved in the 160 d continuous flow biological column the maximum removal efficiency and capacity of u vi were 100 and 46 4 0 52 g m3 d respectively and the longevity of fe 0 increased by 3 09 times u vi was reduced to solid uo2 while fe 0 was finally oxidized to fe iii autotrophic thiobacillus achieved u vi reduction coupled to fe 0 oxidation verified by pure culture h2 produced from fe

zerovalent iron microbial reduction metagenomic analysis bioremediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction uranium is the important fuel used by nuclear powerplant for nuclear fission which is widely found in soil and groundwater chardi et al 2022 a large amount of uranium containing slag and wastewater discharged during the mining smelting and operation of uranium processing are the main causes of environmental uranium pollution and its toxicity poses a hazard to human and ecosystem health gonzalez estrella et al 2020 at the oak ridge integrated field research challenge ifrc site tennessee usa mining and processing of uranium for nuclear weapons and energy have been conducted for years the aquifer is heavy contaminated by leaks from the former disposal ponds resulting in the uranium concentration of groundwater reaching 14 8 mg l revil et al 2013 as high as 60 36 mg l for uranium concentration is also found in the water samples collected from specific wells cho et al 2012 in order to reduce the risk of exposure to humans the us environmental protection agency us epa designated the maximum contamination level of radionuclides in drinking water as 30 μg l lopez et al 2021 uranium may cause damage to the development of nerves kidneys liver and embryos and increase the incidence rate of cancer and leukemia haakonde et al 2020 uranium mainly exists in the environment in the form of hexavalent uranyl uo2 2 chen et al 2021 which is water soluble highly toxic and mobile and can easily migrate with groundwater however the solubility and mobility of tetravalent uranium u iv are relatively low therefore the reduction of hexavalent uranium u vi into u iv is a promising strategy to stabilize and even remove u vi from groundwater heavy metals including u vi can be removed by methods of ion exchange chemical precipitation and adsorption xie et al 2019 akash et al 2022a in addition phytoremediation and nano composite technology are also gradually applied for heavy metal remediation akash et al 2022b sunny et al 2022 sarojini et al 2023 however conventional physical and chemical methods are costly for full scale implementation microbial methods have become an economical and effective approach for uranium pollution treatment due to their versatile use in various environmental conditions as well as strong reproduction and regeneration ability wang et al 2019 under anaerobic conditions the use of microorganisms to realize the conversion from u vi to u iv is an effective way to remediate u vi contaminated groundwater yabusaki et al 2007 soluble organics acetic acid ethanol emulsified vegetable oil gaseous hydrogen and methane can be used as electron donors to reduce u vi in bioreduction processes dargent et al 2015 deng et al 2016 however the utilization of organic matter in groundwater is relatively insufficient and excessive addition of organic matter may cause problems such as blockage of aquifers connectivity xu et al 2016 moreover the addition of gaseous electron donors may bear safety issues which will increase the operating costs as a widely used material zerovalent iron fe 0 holds great promise for the remediation of groundwater contaminated by organics e g trichloroethene and heavy metals e g u vi because of its low price environmental friendliness and strong reducibility zhao et al 2016 2022 wu et al 2023 fe 0 can react with h2o to release h2 under anaerobic conditions which also acts as electron donor taking part in heavy metal reduction series of high valence heavy metals can be abiotically removed by fe 0 including u vi wang and salvage 2005 however passivation may occur quickly due to the formation of iron oxides covering the fe 0 reaction sites with microorganisms participation the pollutant removal efficacy by fe 0 can be significantly improved with prolonged lifespan of fe 0 for example 98 1 of cr vi with the initial concentration of 50 mg l was biotically removed by fe 0 within 120 h while the cr vi removal efficiency under the same condition without microbes was only 14 8 shi et al 2019 nonetheless biologically reductive detoxification of u vi by fe 0 and the involved microbial mechanisms remain largely unknown in this study the performance and process of u vi removal with fe 0 as the sole electron donor under varied hydrochemical and hydrodynamic conditions in continuous flow biological column were evaluated the products of the reaction were identified along with examining the microbial community dynamics potential functional species involved in u vi reduction and fe 0 oxidation were further confirmed by pure cultures functional genes electron transfer compounds and related metabolites were also examined this is among the first to comprehensively investigate fe 0 driven microbial u vi reduction process which will provide more promising alternative to the remediation of u vi contaminated groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 column experiment design a sealed cylindrical plexiglass column with height of 25 cm and diameter of 5 cm covered by aluminum foil to prevent light exposure was built to imitate aquifer the column contained 50 ml of in situ aquifer sediment obtained from a tailing reservoir site in panzhihua china and 200 g of fe 0 0 8 4 0 mm the left space was filled with quartz sand 1 0 2 0 mm and all materials were evenly distributed in the whole column after being fully mixed gravel was added at the inlet and outlet to prevent blocking at the bottom and material loss in the column u vi was added to previously reported synthetic groundwater in the form of uo2 2 by dissolving uo3 in hydrochloric acid zhou et al 2014 sodium bicarbonate 0 8082 g l was added as the sole inorganic carbon source through the peristaltic pump bt100 1 l longer uk the synthetic groundwater was supplied to the column in upflow mode the operation of the constructed biological column lasted 160 d and was divided into 4 stages based on the hydrochemistry and hydrodynamics shown in table 1 after the concentration of effluent u vi was stable it would turn to the next stage effluent samples were collected regularly throughout the experiment for chemical analysis biomass samples were collected in each stage for microbial community examination at the end of the column operation the reaction products functional genes electron transfer compounds and related metabolites were analyzed at the same time only quartz sand and fe 0 were filled in the identical plexiglass column which worked as abiotic control and also comparatively operated for the first two stages in table 1 another two columns with the same specifications and components as the ones mentioned above and four equally distributed sampling ports at height were used for breakthrough study the initial u vi concentration in the influent was 10 mg l the time required for 1 pore volume pv was 2 h the u vi

2022 the cultivated t denitrificans strain and 5 g fe 0 were inoculated into 250 ml serum bottles with an initial u vi concentration of 50 mg l and sodium bicarbonate 0 8082 g l was added the serum bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and covered with aluminum foil to simulate groundwater environment p stutzeri was inoculated into three groups of 250 ml serum bottles using different volatile fatty acids vfas components acetate isobutyrate and valerate as the carbon source respectively the initial total organic carbon toc concentration was adjusted to 300 mg l control experiments with sterilized biomass sole microbe and sole fe 0 were also performed synthetic groundwater with an initial u vi concentration of 50 mg l was added for all batch experiments the initial od600 for all biotic treatments was 1 0 the u vi concentration was monitored periodically with 6 d as one cycle to evaluate the reducing ability of u vi by these pure strains under different experimental conditions all batch experiments were conducted in triplicate and average values with standard deviations were reported 2 3 chemical analysis all liquid samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before chemical analysis we used a spectrophotometer uv2300 shanghai china to measure the concentration of u vi no3 n no2 n and nh4 n by spectrophotometry mtimunye and chirwa 2019 he et al 2023 the

showed the u vi removal efficiency and capacity during the 160 d operation of the column experiment in stage 1 day 0 40 u vi with an influent concentration of 10 mg l was completely removed under the hydraulic residence time hrt of 24 h the removal capacity was as high as 10 g m3 d after u vi concentration in the influent increased to 50 mg l in stage 2 day 41 70 the removal efficiency of u vi decreased to 92 9 0 71 corresponding to the removal capacity of 46 4 0 52 g m3 d initial u vi concentration also affect the u vi removal efficiency in abiotic u vi reduction processes driven by fe 0 li et al 2013 in stage 3 day 71 107 the concentration of u vi was adjusted back to 10 mg l and the hrt was shortened to 12 h the concentration of u vi in the effluent gradually increased resulting in declined removal efficiency which stabilized at 72 6 1 01 with 14 5 0 17 g m3 d hrt reflected the flow rate which is a key parameter in column studies malik et al 2018 the influence of flow rate on lead removal in a resin column was also revealed rajamohan et al 2018 in stage 4 day 108 160 10 mg l of no3 n was added to the influent on the basis of operating condition of stage 1 the removal efficiency of no3 n was 100 with almost complete removal 98 4 0 9 of u vi with the concentration of no3 n continued to increase to 30 mg l the removal efficiency slightly decreased to 94 6 0 5 while no obvious change occurred in u vi removal efficiency a slight increase of effluent no3 n concentration was attained after increasing the no3 n to 50 mg l at which removal efficiency was stabilized at 94 1 0 9 with removal capacity at 47 1 0 5 g m3 d however the removal efficiency and capacity of u vi decreased significantly to 60 0 0 7 and 6 1 0 1 g m3 d respectively with the increase in no3 n concentration a small amount of no2 n and nh4 n were also detected in the effluent fig s1 si the results indicated the inhibitory effects of electron competitions between no3 n and u vi nitrate was preferentially metabolized by denitrifying bacteria edwards et al 2007 the high no3 n concentration also led to incomplete treatment of nitrate leaving intermediate products of the denitrification process such as nitrite in the solution which might re oxidize the precipitated u iv to dissolved u vi causing the rebounding of u vi concentration in the effluent wilkins et al 2007 the results suggested that u vi could be effectively removed with fe 0 as electron donor in microbial system both hydrochemistry e g u vi concentration co existing nitrate and hydrodynamics e g hrt affected the removal process of u vi in such system the reduction of u vi was also detected in the abiotic column which could be attributed to the high reducibility of fe 0 zhang et al 2018 however the effluent concentration of u vi was much higher than that in biological column and displayed a gradually increasing trend in stage 2 the effluent concentration of u vi increased continuously and the invalidation of fe 0 took place rapidly the precipitation of u iv and fe iii from fe 0 oxidation gradually formed a passivation layer on the surface of fe 0 fig s2a si inhibiting the transfer of electrons and restraining the chemical reaction shi et al 2019 the reaction sites in the biotic column would be regenerated due to microbial activity fig s2b si indicating the advantages of microbial involvement in the process of u vi reduction by fe 0 complete u vi breakthrough occurred at 66 pv in abiotic column fig 2 a due to the gradual passivation of fe 0 during the operation however in the biotic column the complete penetration of u vi occurred at 204 pv which was due to the activities of microorganisms compared with abiotic column the life span of biotic column increased by 3 09 times the calculated contributions of biotic and abiotic to u vi removal in biotic column were 70 81 0 52 and 29 19 0 47 respectively the migration patterns of u vi at different heights displayed similar trends both in biotic and abiotic columns fig 2a fig s3 si by calculating through the regression equation the migration rate of the u vi front in the biotic column was obtained 0 23 0 06 cm pv which was much lower than that in abiotic column 0 66 0 09 cm pv 3 2 characterization of reaction products the concentration of total uranium in the effluent was slightly higher than that of u vi fig s4 si indicating the precipitation of products from u vi reduction junier et al 2011 sem image showed that precipitates were found among the microbes fig 3a the eds pattern proved the presence of u in the precipitate with corresponding peaks fig s2b si the fe peak was contributed by fe 0 oxidation the xps spectrum analysis of u 4f region showed that peaks of u 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 were at 382 0 ev and 392 9 ev respectively fig 3b with the interval between these two bands of approximately 10 9 ev the spectrum indicated that u vi and u iv exist simultaneously for u 4f7 2 the peak locations were coincided with previously reported binding energy ranges for u vi 381 1 382 6 ev and u iv 380 2 380 7 ev respectively schindler et al 2009 for u 4f5 2 the binding energies of u vi and u iv were 392 7 ev and 391 6 ev respectively these results proved that u vi was reduced to insoluble u iv in this study the xrd analysis of the precipitate showed a reflection peak of uo2 fig 3c indicating that the reduced u iv existed in the form of uo2 a new crystalline phase of autunite ca uo2 2 po4 2 2h2o had also been discovered which might come from the co precipitation of ca2 ions and po4 3 in water corresponding to u vi in the solid phase vijay et al 2020 soluble fe species was not detected in the effluent from each stage of the column experiment but the eds spectrum showed that there was a large amount of fe in the precipitate the peak values of fe 2p at fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 were 711 2 ev and 725 1 ev respectively fig 3d matching with the binding energies for fe ii the peaks at 712 5 ev and 726 2 ev and the satellite peak at 718 8 ev corresponded to fe iii yu et al 2019 adsorbed and organic fe ii and fe iii were also found in the precipitates fig s5 si according to xrd analysis the characteristic peaks of active minerals including magnetite and feo oh appeared fig 3c which could be ascribed to the corrosion and oxidation of fe 0 zhong et al 2017 during the whole experiment it was observed that the ph of the effluent increased gradually fig s6 si which might be related to the oh generated by the oxidation process of fe 0 based on the identified products fe 0 driven u vi bio reduction can be described by eq 1 moreover fe 0 corrosion resulted in the production of fe ii and hydrogen via eq 2 hua et al 2021 which were further utilized for u vi bio reduction through eq 3 and 4 li et al 2018 assuming all the removed u vi was reduced to u iv 3 81 0 05 mmol of electrons was required in stage 1 3 according to the quantified fe iii 4 81 0 11 mmol of electron was released higher than that required for u vi reduction more electrons might be consumed for biomass synthesis and microbial proliferation 1 3 u o 2 2 2 f e 0 3 u o 2 2 f e 3 2 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 h 2 2 o h 3 u o 2 2 2 f e 2 u o

microbial communities in stage 1 3 were aggregated indicating that the altered u vi concentration and hrt had little impact on the microbial communities the microbial community of stage 4 distinguished from the inoculum and stages 1 3 which further proved that nitrate changed the community structure venn diagram showed that the microbial samples in the four stages contain 646 398 735 and 217 independent otus respectively fig s7b si the 1679 shared otus meant that there were a large number of otus with u vi reduction and fe 0 oxidation in the column the microbial community taxa at the class level had changed during the operation of the column fig s7c si gammaproteobacteria and clostridia predominated in all stages according to reports gammaproteobacteria was widely enriched in underground uranium mines tunnels and uranium mill tailings islam and sar 2011 in stage 4 methanobacteria 12 9 and bacterodia 5 2 were enriched while the relative abundance of bacilli 0 3 and actinobacteria 2 6 decreased which might be related to denitrification with nitrate supplement furthermore deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria and clostridia were also relatively abundant at all stages functional genera varied over the four stages fig 4 a desulfomicrobium 0 4 2 5 and desulfotomaculum 0 6 1 8 are two sulfate reducing bacteria srb with high abundances in the four stages they could reduce u vi through enzymatic reaction with organic carbon sources playing important roles in bioremediation of uranium polluted environment junier et al 2010 converse et al 2013 the relative abundances of clostridium mainly including strictly anaerobic clostridium sensu stricto 1 and clostridium sensu stricto 8 in the first three stages were relatively higher 1 8 3 5 it could reduce u vi by using h2 as an electron donor dalla vecchia et al 2010 the relative abundance of bacillus reached 1 8 in stage 3 bacillus could reduce u vi heterotrophically and biomineralize uranium by inducing carbonate precipitation li et al 2017a wufuer et al 2017 a large number of denitrifying bacteria were enriched in stage 4 such as simplicispira delftia acinetobacter and pseudomonas the rapid reduction of nitrate by these genera would effectively alleviate its inhibitory effect on uranium removal besides reducing nitrate it had been reported that pseudomonas could reduce u vi under anaerobic conditions and also remove u vi by biosorption and biomineralization yu et al 2022 in another aspect thiobacillus was enriched in stage 3 with relative abundance of 2 9 as a fe oxidizing bacterium thiobacillus had the ability of performing fe ii driven autotrophic denitrification kiskira et al 2017 it might also be able to reduce u vi as they are both high valance pollutants methanobacterium a kind of methanobacteria that could produce ch4 was enriched in stage 2 4 acetoanaerobium an anaerobic bacterium had highest relative abundance 1 6 in stage 1 methanobacterium and acetoanaerobium were capable of ch4 and h2 oxidation to synthesize organic acids li et al 2017b he et al 2020 hu et al 2022 which could support the heterotrophic reduction of u vi in the column the co occurrence network of microbial community displayed distinct modules fig 4b responsible for diverse metabolic processes including u vi reduction fe 0 oxidation and denitrification with respective functional genera in each module most microbes interacted positively indicating their cooperative partnerships negative relationships also arose for instance desulfomicrobium and bacillus methanobacterium and acetoanaerobium probably due to the substrate competition zhang et al 2019 rda result showed that desulfomicrobium was significantly positively correlated with urc further demonstrating its the u vi reduction contribution of desulfomicrobium fig 4c this genus was also affected by hrt the microbial community in stage 2 was positively related to urc no3 n removal capacity nrc was the main factor influencing microbial community in stage 4 and it was positively correlated with denitrifying bacteria such as delftia acinetobacter and pseudomonas structural equation model analysis showed that hrt had directly positive influence on microbial richness p 0 001 while microbial richness further directly affected urc fig 4d u vi and no3 n concentrations had directly negative correlations with microbial diversity microbial diversity and richness further had direct affections on urc 3 4 performance of u vi removal by pure strains due to the enrichment of thiobacillus and pseudomonas in the column experiment we further investigated the u vi reduction abilities of autotrophic t denitrificans and heterotrophic p stutzeri for t denitrificans inoculated biosystem it was observed that the concentration of u vi gradually decreased with time fig 5 a the u vi removal efficiency was 92 6 1 12 within 6 d operation the u vi removal performance remained stable during the 9 cycles insoluble u iv precipitates were also detected fig s8 si vfas were gradually accumulated during the autotrophic metabolisms of t denitrificans fig s9 si which might be synthesized through assimilation with bicarbonate as inorganic carbon source liu et al 2020 these results proved the ability of t denitrificans for u vi reduction coupled to fe 0 oxidation the decrease in u vi concentration was observed in the biological system of p stutzeri fig 5b the removal efficiencies of u vi in a 6 d cycle by p stutzeri with acetate isobutyrate and valerate as organic carbon sources were 100 0 85 2 1 11 and 92 9 1 02 respectively among which acetate had the best performance in the process of u vi reduction xps analysis detected insoluble u iv in the produced precipitates fig s8 si these results demonstrated that p stutzeri could utilize vfas generated during autotrophic metabolism with energy from fe 0 oxidation as organic carbon sources to support u vi reduction u vi components were also detected in the precipitates due to the formation of complexes of phosphate groups yu et al 2022 when nitrate was supplementarily added u vi removal could also occur despite of obvious decrease in u vi removal efficiency because of electron competition no3 n was preferentially reduced as pseudomonas could implement denitrification rediers et al 2009 with appearance of no2 n and nh4 n fig s10 si these phenomena proved that p stutzeri had the ability of reducing u vi with co existing electron acceptors the adsorption of u vi by sterilized biomass of the two strains could not sustainably remove u vi sole strain could only remove a small amount of u vi through endogenous metabolism zhang et al 2021 u vi removal by sole fe 0 occurred slightly due to quick passivation of fe 0 these results collectively proved that functional bacteria enriched in the column experiment could achieve autotrophic and heterotrophic reduction of u vi with diverse electron donors which explored new microbial resources for u vi bioremediation 3 5 functional genes and metabolic pathways metagenomic sequencing annotation revealed the changes of gene abundances in the biological column compared to the inoculum fig 6 a details for functional genes were listed in table s3 si the relative abundances of genes categorized in uranium iron sulfur carbon and nitrogen metabolisms electron transfer and metal transport increased significantly collectively responsible for the u vi reduction coupled to fe 0 oxidation dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene dsra was upregulated dramatically this gene was associated with the activity of srb which had the ability to enzymatically reduce u vi and utilize u vi as an electron acceptor at the end of energy metabolism ontiveros valencia et al 2017 li et al 2022 high transcription level of dsra gene was also observed in all stages through rt qpcr fig 6b the drsb as another dissimilatory sulfite reduction gene was also significantly enriched in the column experiment which might also be related to the reduction of u vi compared with the inoculum phon appeared abundantly in the column experiment after prolonged uranium stress phon acted as a nonspecific acid phosphatase gene that released inorganic phosphates to precipitate metals appukuttan et al 2011 the recombinant escherichia coli carrying the phon gene had been used to successfully and efficiently precipitate u vi into uranyl phosphate precipitates basnakova et al 1998 newsome et al 2014 the appeared czca and czcd genes belonged to the families of metal transporters which could transport metal ions out of the cytoplasm leedjärv et al 2008 in particular czcd had good tolerance to uranium nongkhlaw and joshi 2019 the unregulated genes encoding abc transporters could also enhance the microbial resistance to metal including uranium cason et al 2012 electron transfer played important roles in u vi reduction through multiple pathways newsome et al 2014 as the main component of terminal reductase periplasmic and outer membrane cytochrome c had been proved to be involved in the reduction of u vi yun et al 2016 the mechanism was the electron transfer respiration of cytochrome c which transferred electrons to u vi shelobolina et al 2007 the downregulation of the cytochrome c cyc gene may be the result of cytochrome c oxidase the content of cytochrome c displayed a gradually increasing trend during the operation of the column fig 6b in another aspect metagenomic annotation results indicated that complete gsh synthesis genes were generally enriched gsh also appeared abundantly during operation fig 6b uo2 2 also formed a complex with the carboxyl functional group of gsh to reduce the toxicity of u vi kretzschmar et al 2018 gsh was involved in the oxidative defense mechanism of cells and played an important role in the detoxification mechanism of heavy metals and radical oxygen species kretzschmar et al 2020 genes for iron metabolism were abundantly accumulated in the column cyc1 enriched in column experiments encoded a common enzyme in fe ii oxidation and was an indispensable gene in chemoautotrophic metabolism gupta et al 2021 as a gene encoding outer membrane transmembrane protein mtra played an important role of bidirectional electron transfer between fe ii oxidation and fe iii reduction shi et al 2012 the mtra gene was also transcriptionally expressed fig 6b another important terminal reductase mtrc could also take part in directly electron transfer reactions edwards et al 2020 enrichments of genes encoding intermediate synthesis and utilization were also detected the relative abundances of most genes involved in ch4 metabolism such as the key methyl com reductase subunit a mcra increased significantly ye et al 2022 methane producing methanosarcina possessing this gene could effectively remediate uranium producing aquifers holmes et al 2018 hydrogenase used h2 as an electron donor to reduce u vi and the produced h2 could also be used to synthesize ch4 under anaerobic conditions he et al 2020 as organic intermediates produced in the metabolic process vfas could not only act as electron donors but also provide energy for heterotrophic cells to reduce u vi ch4 h2 and vfas were also directly detected in the column fig 6c further illuminating their roles in fe 0 dependent u vi bio reduction 3 6 potential mechanisms and implications based on the geochemical process examination microbial community analysis pure culture verification and metabolic exploration mechanisms of fe 0 dependent u vi microbial reduction were clarified with independent and synergistic pathways under the activity of the autotrophic thiobacillus fe 0 is finally oxidized to fe iii via fe ii the released electrons simultaneously reduce u vi to insoluble u iv on the other hand energy released from fe 0 oxidation was utilized to convert h2 and hco3 into intermediate metabolites including ch4 and vfas e g acetate isobutyrate valerate liu et al 2020 which were consumed by heterotrophic u vi reducers such as desulfomicrobium bacillus and pseudomonas for the reduction of u vi wufuer et al 2017 h2 produced from fe 0 corrosion was also directly employed by autotrophic clostridium for u vi reduction dalla vecchia et al 2010 the upregulated genes for u vi reduction e g dsra and dsrb and fe ii oxidation e g cyc1 and mtra contributed to the related enzymatic reactions cytochrome c and gsh were also involved in u vi reduction through electron transfer shelobolina et al 2007 kretzschmar et al 2018 genes including czcd as well as abc transporters were responsible for the heavy metal efflux cason et al 2012 these achievements enhance the comprehensive understanding of the role fe 0 in u vi decontamination efficient u vi bio reduction by microbial consortia in aquifer with fe 0 as the sole electron donor and inorganic bicarbonate as carbon source provides a new perspective for the uranium contamination remediation this bioremediation strategy not only effectively reduces the secondary pollution caused by excess organic matter but also improves the efficacy of environmentally friendly fe 0 sulfidation can enhance the reactivity and selectivity of fe 0 and accelerate electron transfer wu et al 2023 which can be considered during application the products from u vi reduction should be timely cleaned up to prevent their re oxidization at the same time the components of natural aquifer environment are relatively complex apart from nitrate there are other refractory organics and heavy metal pollutants e g chromium pentachlorophenol shi et al 2022 which requires equally consideration 4 conclusions in this study the performance and possible mechanisms for microbial u vi removal with fe 0 as the sole electron donor were investigated the major conclusions were u vi could be removed efficiently under different hydrochemical and hydrodynamic conditions in continuous column experiment the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes to u vi removal were 70 81 0 52 and 29 19 0 47 respectively u vi was bio reduced to insoluble u iv while fe 0 was also eventually oxidized to fe iii genera such as thiobacillus pseudomonas and desulfomicrobium played an important role in the microbial removal of u vi and the oxidation of fe 0 which were also verified by pure culture functional genes for u vi reduction e g dsra and dsrb and fe ii oxidation e g cyc1 and mtra were identified metagenomic and rt qpcr analyses together with electron transfer compounds and metabolites quantification independent

15014,zerovalent iron fe 0 can donate electron for bioprocess but microbial uranium vi u vi reduction driven by fe 0 is still poorly understood in this study fe 0 supported u vi bio reduction was steadily achieved in the 160 d continuous flow biological column the maximum removal efficiency and capacity of u vi were 100 and 46 4 0 52 g m3 d respectively and the longevity of fe 0 increased by 3 09 times u vi was reduced to solid uo2 while fe 0 was finally oxidized to fe iii autotrophic thiobacillus achieved u vi reduction coupled to fe 0 oxidation verified by pure culture h2 produced from fe

heterotrophic desulfomicrobium bacillus and pseudomonas to reduce u vi metagenomic analysis found the upregulated genes for u vi reduction e g dsra and dsrb and fe ii oxidation e g cyc1 and mtra these functional genes were also transcriptionally expressed cytochrome c and glutathione responsible for electron transfer also contributed to u vi reduction this study reveals the independent and synergistic pathways for fe 0 dependent u vi bio reduction providing promising remediation strategy for u vi polluted aquifers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uranium vi zerovalent iron microbial reduction metagenomic analysis bioremediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction uranium is the important fuel used by nuclear powerplant for nuclear fission which is widely found in soil and groundwater chardi et al 2022 a large amount of uranium containing slag and wastewater discharged during the mining smelting and operation of uranium processing are the main causes of environmental uranium pollution and its toxicity poses a hazard to human and ecosystem health gonzalez estrella et al 2020 at the oak ridge integrated field research challenge ifrc site tennessee usa mining and processing of uranium for nuclear weapons and energy have been conducted for years the aquifer is heavy contaminated by leaks from the former disposal ponds resulting in the uranium concentration of groundwater reaching 14 8 mg l revil et al 2013 as high as 60 36 mg l for uranium concentration is also found in the water samples collected from specific wells cho et al 2012 in order to reduce the risk of exposure to humans the us environmental protection agency us epa designated the maximum contamination level of radionuclides in drinking water as 30 μg l lopez et al 2021 uranium may cause damage to the development of nerves kidneys liver and embryos and increase the incidence rate of cancer and leukemia haakonde et al 2020 uranium mainly exists in the environment in the form of hexavalent uranyl uo2 2 chen et al 2021 which is water soluble highly toxic and mobile and can easily migrate with groundwater however the solubility and mobility of tetravalent uranium u iv are relatively low therefore the reduction of hexavalent uranium u vi into u iv is a promising strategy to stabilize and even remove u vi from groundwater heavy metals including u vi can be removed by methods of ion exchange chemical precipitation and adsorption xie et al 2019 akash et al 2022a in addition phytoremediation and nano composite technology are also gradually applied for heavy metal remediation akash et al 2022b sunny et al 2022 sarojini et al 2023 however conventional physical and chemical methods are costly for full scale implementation microbial methods have become an economical and effective approach for uranium pollution treatment due to their versatile use in various environmental conditions as well as strong reproduction and regeneration ability wang et al 2019 under anaerobic conditions the use of microorganisms to realize the conversion from u vi to u iv is an effective way to remediate u vi contaminated groundwater yabusaki et al 2007 soluble organics acetic acid ethanol emulsified vegetable oil gaseous hydrogen and methane can be used as electron donors to reduce u vi in bioreduction processes dargent et al 2015 deng et al 2016 however the utilization of organic matter in groundwater is relatively insufficient and excessive addition of organic matter may cause problems such as blockage of aquifers connectivity xu et al 2016 moreover the addition of gaseous electron donors may bear safety issues which will increase the operating costs as a widely used material zerovalent iron fe 0 holds great promise for the remediation of groundwater contaminated by organics e g trichloroethene and heavy metals e g u vi because of its low price environmental friendliness and strong reducibility zhao et al 2016 2022 wu et al 2023 fe 0 can react with h2o to release h2 under anaerobic conditions which also acts as electron donor taking part in heavy metal reduction series of high valence heavy metals can be abiotically removed by fe 0 including u vi wang and salvage 2005 however passivation may occur quickly due to the formation of iron oxides covering the fe 0 reaction sites with microorganisms participation the pollutant removal efficacy by fe 0 can be significantly improved with prolonged lifespan of fe 0 for example 98 1 of cr vi with the initial concentration of 50 mg l was biotically removed by fe 0 within 120 h while the cr vi removal efficiency under the same condition without microbes was only 14 8 shi et al 2019 nonetheless biologically reductive detoxification of u vi by fe 0 and the involved microbial mechanisms remain largely unknown in this study the performance and process of u vi removal with fe 0 as the sole electron donor under varied hydrochemical and hydrodynamic conditions in continuous flow biological column were evaluated the products of the reaction were identified along with examining the microbial community dynamics potential functional species involved in u vi reduction and fe 0 oxidation were further confirmed by pure cultures functional genes electron transfer compounds and related metabolites were also examined this is among the first to comprehensively investigate fe 0 driven microbial u vi reduction process which will provide more promising alternative to the remediation of u vi contaminated groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 column experiment design a sealed cylindrical plexiglass column with height of 25 cm and diameter of 5 cm covered by aluminum foil to prevent light exposure was built to imitate aquifer the column contained 50 ml of in situ aquifer sediment obtained from a tailing reservoir site in panzhihua china and 200 g of fe 0 0 8 4 0 mm the left space was filled with quartz sand 1 0 2 0 mm and all materials were evenly distributed in the whole column after being fully mixed gravel was added at the inlet and outlet to prevent blocking at the bottom and material loss in the column u vi was added to previously reported synthetic groundwater in the form of uo2 2 by dissolving uo3 in hydrochloric acid zhou et al 2014 sodium bicarbonate 0 8082 g l was added as the sole inorganic carbon source through the peristaltic pump bt100 1 l longer uk the synthetic groundwater was supplied to the column in upflow mode the operation of the constructed biological column lasted 160 d and was divided into 4 stages based on the hydrochemistry and hydrodynamics shown in table 1 after the concentration of effluent u vi was stable it would turn to the next stage effluent samples were collected regularly throughout the experiment for chemical analysis biomass samples were collected in each stage for microbial community examination at the end of the column operation the reaction products functional genes electron transfer compounds and related metabolites were analyzed at the same time only quartz sand and fe 0 were filled in the identical plexiglass column which worked as abiotic control and also comparatively operated for the first two stages in table 1 another two columns with the same specifications and components as the ones mentioned above and four equally distributed sampling ports at height were used for breakthrough study the initial u vi concentration in the influent was 10 mg l the time required for 1 pore volume pv was 2 h the u vi

bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and covered with aluminum foil to simulate groundwater environment p stutzeri was inoculated into three groups of 250 ml serum bottles using different volatile fatty acids vfas components acetate isobutyrate and valerate as the carbon source respectively the initial total organic carbon toc concentration was adjusted to 300 mg l control experiments with sterilized biomass sole microbe and sole fe 0 were also performed synthetic groundwater with an initial u vi concentration of 50 mg l was added for all batch experiments the initial od600 for all biotic treatments was 1 0 the u vi concentration was monitored periodically with 6 d as one cycle to evaluate the reducing ability of u vi by these pure strains under different experimental conditions all batch experiments were conducted in triplicate and average values with standard deviations were reported 2 3 chemical analysis all liquid samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before chemical analysis we used a spectrophotometer uv2300 shanghai china to measure the concentration of u vi no3 n no2 n and nh4 n by spectrophotometry mtimunye and chirwa 2019 he et al 2023 the

showed the u vi removal efficiency and capacity during the 160 d operation of the column experiment in stage 1 day 0 40 u vi with an influent concentration of 10 mg l was completely removed under the hydraulic residence time hrt of 24 h the removal capacity was as high as 10 g m3 d after u vi concentration in the influent increased to 50 mg l in stage 2 day 41 70 the removal efficiency of u vi decreased to 92 9 0 71 corresponding to the removal capacity of 46 4 0 52 g m3 d initial u vi concentration also affect the u vi removal efficiency in abiotic u vi reduction processes driven by fe 0 li et al 2013 in stage 3 day 71 107 the concentration of u vi was adjusted back to 10 mg l and the hrt was shortened to 12 h the concentration of u vi in the effluent gradually increased resulting in declined removal efficiency which stabilized at 72 6 1 01 with 14 5 0 17 g m3 d hrt reflected the flow rate which is a key parameter in column studies malik et al 2018 the influence of flow rate on lead removal in a resin column was also revealed rajamohan et al 2018 in stage 4 day 108 160 10 mg l of no3 n was added to the influent on the basis of operating condition of stage 1 the removal efficiency of no3 n was 100 with almost complete removal 98 4 0 9 of u vi with the concentration of no3 n continued to increase to 30 mg l the removal efficiency slightly decreased to 94 6 0 5 while no obvious change occurred in u vi removal efficiency a slight increase of effluent no3 n concentration was attained after increasing the no3 n to 50 mg l at which removal efficiency was stabilized at 94 1 0 9 with removal capacity at 47 1 0 5 g m3 d however the removal efficiency and capacity of u vi decreased significantly to 60 0 0 7 and 6 1 0 1 g m3 d respectively with the increase in no3 n concentration a small amount of no2 n and nh4 n were also detected in the effluent fig s1 si the results indicated the inhibitory effects of electron competitions between no3 n and u vi nitrate was preferentially metabolized by denitrifying bacteria edwards et al 2007 the high no3 n concentration also led to incomplete treatment of nitrate leaving intermediate products of the denitrification process such as nitrite in the solution which might re oxidize the precipitated u iv to dissolved u vi causing the rebounding of u vi concentration in the effluent wilkins et al 2007 the results suggested that u vi could be effectively removed with fe 0 as electron donor in microbial system both hydrochemistry e g u vi concentration co existing nitrate and hydrodynamics e g hrt affected the removal process of u vi in such system the reduction of u vi was also detected in the abiotic column which could be attributed to the high reducibility of fe 0 zhang et al 2018 however the effluent concentration of u vi was much higher than that in biological column and displayed a gradually increasing trend in stage 2 the effluent concentration of u vi increased continuously and the invalidation of fe 0 took place rapidly the precipitation of u iv and fe iii from fe 0 oxidation gradually formed a passivation layer on the surface of fe 0 fig s2a si inhibiting the transfer of electrons and restraining the chemical reaction shi et al 2019 the reaction sites in the biotic column would be regenerated due to microbial activity fig s2b si indicating the advantages of microbial involvement in the process of u vi reduction by fe 0 complete u vi breakthrough occurred at 66 pv in abiotic column fig 2 a due to the gradual passivation of fe 0 during the operation however in the biotic column the complete penetration of u vi occurred at 204 pv which was due to the activities of microorganisms compared with abiotic column the life span of biotic column increased by 3 09 times the calculated contributions of biotic and abiotic to u vi removal in biotic column were 70 81 0 52 and 29 19 0 47 respectively the migration patterns of u vi at different heights displayed similar trends both in biotic and abiotic columns fig 2a fig s3 si by calculating through the regression equation the migration rate of the u vi front in the biotic column was obtained 0 23 0 06 cm pv which was much lower than that in abiotic column 0 66 0 09 cm pv 3 2 characterization of reaction products the concentration of total uranium in the effluent was slightly higher than that of u vi fig s4 si indicating the precipitation of products from u vi reduction junier et al 2011 sem image showed that precipitates were found among the microbes fig 3a the eds pattern proved the presence of u in the precipitate with corresponding peaks fig s2b si the fe peak was contributed by fe 0 oxidation the xps spectrum analysis of u 4f region showed that peaks of u 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 were at 382 0 ev and 392 9 ev respectively fig 3b with the interval between these two bands of approximately 10 9 ev the spectrum indicated that u vi and u iv exist simultaneously for u 4f7 2 the peak locations were coincided with previously reported binding energy ranges for u vi 381 1 382 6 ev and u iv 380 2 380 7 ev respectively schindler et al 2009 for u 4f5 2 the binding energies of u vi and u iv were 392 7 ev and 391 6 ev respectively these results proved that u vi was reduced to insoluble u iv in this study the xrd analysis of the precipitate showed a reflection peak of uo2 fig 3c indicating that the reduced u iv existed in the form of uo2 a new crystalline phase of autunite ca uo2 2 po4 2 2h2o had also been discovered which might come from the co precipitation of ca2 ions and po4 3 in water corresponding to u vi in the solid phase vijay et al 2020 soluble fe species was not detected in the effluent from each stage of the column experiment but the eds spectrum showed that there was a large amount of fe in the precipitate the peak values of fe 2p at fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 were 711 2 ev and 725 1 ev respectively fig 3d matching with the binding energies for fe ii the peaks at 712 5 ev and 726 2 ev and the satellite peak at 718 8 ev corresponded to fe iii yu et al 2019 adsorbed and organic fe ii and fe iii were also found in the precipitates fig s5 si according to xrd analysis the characteristic peaks of active minerals including magnetite and feo oh appeared fig 3c which could be ascribed to the corrosion and oxidation of fe 0 zhong et al 2017 during the whole experiment it was observed that the ph of the effluent increased gradually fig s6 si which might be related to the oh generated by the oxidation process of fe 0 based on the identified products fe 0 driven u vi bio reduction can be described by eq 1 moreover fe 0 corrosion resulted in the production of fe ii and hydrogen via eq 2 hua et al 2021 which were further utilized for u vi bio reduction through eq 3 and 4 li et al 2018 assuming all the removed u vi was reduced to u iv 3 81 0 05 mmol of electrons was required in stage 1 3 according to the quantified fe iii 4 81 0 11 mmol of electron was released higher than that required for u vi reduction more electrons might be consumed for biomass synthesis and microbial proliferation 1 3 u o 2 2 2 f e 0 3 u o 2 2 f e 3 2 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 h 2 2 o h 3 u o 2 2 2 f e 2 u o

indicating that microorganisms adapted to the environment and began to enrich after domestication table s2 si shannon and simpson index showed that the microbial diversity varied the presence of nitrate in stage 4 significantly reduced the microbial community the results of pcoa showed that the microbial community changed greatly compared with the inoculum after the reaction fig s7a si the microbial communities in stage 1 3 were aggregated indicating that the altered u vi concentration and hrt had little impact on the microbial communities the microbial community of stage 4 distinguished from the inoculum and stages 1 3 which further proved that nitrate changed the community structure venn diagram showed that the microbial samples in the four stages contain 646 398 735 and 217 independent otus respectively fig s7b si the 1679 shared otus meant that there were a large number of otus with u vi reduction and fe 0 oxidation in the column the microbial community taxa at the class level had changed during the operation of the column fig s7c si gammaproteobacteria and clostridia predominated in all stages according to reports gammaproteobacteria was widely enriched in underground uranium mines tunnels and uranium mill tailings islam and sar 2011 in stage 4 methanobacteria 12 9 and bacterodia 5 2 were enriched while the relative abundance of bacilli 0 3 and actinobacteria 2 6 decreased which might be related to denitrification with nitrate supplement furthermore deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria and clostridia were also relatively abundant at all stages functional genera varied over the four stages fig 4 a desulfomicrobium 0 4 2 5 and desulfotomaculum 0 6 1 8 are two sulfate reducing bacteria srb with high abundances in the four stages they could reduce u vi through enzymatic reaction with organic carbon sources playing important roles in bioremediation of uranium polluted environment junier et al 2010 converse et al 2013 the relative abundances of clostridium mainly including strictly anaerobic clostridium sensu stricto 1 and clostridium sensu stricto 8 in the first three stages were relatively higher 1 8 3 5 it could reduce u vi by using h2 as an electron donor dalla vecchia et al 2010 the relative abundance of bacillus reached 1 8 in stage 3 bacillus could reduce u vi heterotrophically and biomineralize uranium by inducing carbonate precipitation li et al 2017a wufuer et al 2017 a large number of denitrifying bacteria were enriched in stage 4 such as simplicispira delftia acinetobacter and pseudomonas the rapid reduction of nitrate by these genera would effectively alleviate its inhibitory effect on uranium removal besides reducing nitrate it had been reported that pseudomonas could reduce u vi under anaerobic conditions and also remove u vi by biosorption and biomineralization yu et al 2022 in another aspect thiobacillus was enriched in stage 3 with relative abundance of 2 9 as a fe oxidizing bacterium thiobacillus had the ability of performing fe ii driven autotrophic denitrification kiskira et al 2017 it might also be able to reduce u vi as they are both high valance pollutants methanobacterium a kind of methanobacteria that could produce ch4 was enriched in stage 2 4 acetoanaerobium an anaerobic bacterium had highest relative abundance 1 6 in stage 1 methanobacterium and acetoanaerobium were capable of ch4 and h2 oxidation to synthesize organic acids li et al 2017b he et al 2020 hu et al 2022 which could support the heterotrophic reduction of u vi in the column the co occurrence network of microbial community displayed distinct modules fig 4b responsible for diverse metabolic processes including u vi reduction fe 0 oxidation and denitrification with respective functional genera in each module most microbes interacted positively indicating their cooperative partnerships negative relationships also arose for instance desulfomicrobium and bacillus methanobacterium and acetoanaerobium probably due to the substrate competition zhang et al 2019 rda result showed that desulfomicrobium was significantly positively correlated with urc further demonstrating its the u vi reduction contribution of desulfomicrobium fig 4c this genus was also affected by hrt the microbial community in stage 2 was positively related to urc no3 n removal capacity nrc was the main factor influencing microbial community in stage 4 and it was positively correlated with denitrifying bacteria such as delftia acinetobacter and pseudomonas structural equation model analysis showed that hrt had directly positive influence on microbial richness p 0 001 while microbial richness further directly affected urc fig 4d u vi and no3 n concentrations had directly negative correlations with microbial diversity microbial diversity and richness further had direct affections on urc 3 4 performance of u vi removal by pure strains due to the enrichment of thiobacillus and pseudomonas in the column experiment we further investigated the u vi reduction abilities of autotrophic t denitrificans and heterotrophic p stutzeri for t denitrificans inoculated biosystem it was observed that the concentration of u vi gradually decreased with time fig 5 a the u vi removal efficiency was 92 6 1 12 within 6 d operation the u vi removal performance remained stable during the 9 cycles insoluble u iv precipitates were also detected fig s8 si vfas were gradually accumulated during the autotrophic metabolisms of t denitrificans fig s9 si which might be synthesized through assimilation with bicarbonate as inorganic carbon source liu et al 2020 these results proved the ability of t denitrificans for u vi reduction coupled to fe 0 oxidation the decrease in u vi concentration was observed in the biological system of p stutzeri fig 5b the removal efficiencies of u vi in a 6 d cycle by p stutzeri with acetate isobutyrate and valerate as organic carbon sources were 100 0 85 2 1 11 and 92 9 1 02 respectively among which acetate had the best performance in the process of u vi reduction xps analysis detected insoluble u iv in the produced precipitates fig s8 si these results demonstrated that p stutzeri could utilize vfas generated during autotrophic metabolism with energy from fe 0 oxidation as organic carbon sources to support u vi reduction u vi components were also detected in the precipitates due to the formation of complexes of phosphate groups yu et al 2022 when nitrate was supplementarily added u vi removal could also occur despite of obvious decrease in u vi removal efficiency because of electron competition no3 n was preferentially reduced as pseudomonas could implement denitrification rediers et al 2009 with appearance of no2 n and nh4 n fig s10 si these phenomena proved that p stutzeri had the ability of reducing u vi with co existing electron acceptors the adsorption of u vi by sterilized biomass of the two strains could not sustainably remove u vi sole strain could only remove a small amount of u vi through endogenous metabolism zhang et al 2021 u vi removal by sole fe 0 occurred slightly due to quick passivation of fe 0 these results collectively proved that functional bacteria enriched in the column experiment could achieve autotrophic and heterotrophic reduction of u vi with diverse electron donors which explored new microbial resources for u vi bioremediation 3 5 functional genes and metabolic pathways metagenomic sequencing annotation revealed the changes of gene abundances in the biological column compared to the inoculum fig 6 a details for functional genes were listed in table s3 si the relative abundances of genes categorized in uranium iron sulfur carbon and nitrogen metabolisms electron transfer and metal transport increased significantly collectively responsible for the u vi reduction coupled to fe 0 oxidation dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene dsra was upregulated dramatically this gene was associated with the activity of srb which had the ability to enzymatically reduce u vi and utilize u vi as an electron acceptor at the end of energy metabolism ontiveros valencia et al 2017 li et al 2022 high transcription level of dsra gene was also observed in all stages through rt qpcr fig 6b the drsb as another dissimilatory sulfite reduction gene was also significantly enriched in the column experiment which might also be related to the reduction of u vi compared with the inoculum phon appeared abundantly in the column experiment after prolonged uranium stress phon acted as a nonspecific acid phosphatase gene that released inorganic phosphates to precipitate metals appukuttan et al 2011 the recombinant escherichia coli carrying the phon gene had been used to successfully and efficiently precipitate u vi into uranyl phosphate precipitates basnakova et al 1998 newsome et al 2014 the appeared czca and czcd genes belonged to the families of metal transporters which could transport metal ions out of the cytoplasm leedjärv et al 2008 in particular czcd had good tolerance to uranium nongkhlaw and joshi 2019 the unregulated genes encoding abc transporters could also enhance the microbial resistance to metal including uranium cason et al 2012 electron transfer played important roles in u vi reduction through multiple pathways newsome et al 2014 as the main component of terminal reductase periplasmic and outer membrane cytochrome c had been proved to be involved in the reduction of u vi yun et al 2016 the mechanism was the electron transfer respiration of cytochrome c which transferred electrons to u vi shelobolina et al 2007 the downregulation of the cytochrome c cyc gene may be the result of cytochrome c oxidase the content of cytochrome c displayed a gradually increasing trend during the operation of the column fig 6b in another aspect metagenomic annotation results indicated that complete gsh synthesis genes were generally enriched gsh also appeared abundantly during operation fig 6b uo2 2 also formed a complex with the carboxyl functional group of gsh to reduce the toxicity of u vi kretzschmar et al 2018 gsh was involved in the oxidative defense mechanism of cells and played an important role in the detoxification mechanism of heavy metals and radical oxygen species kretzschmar et al 2020 genes for iron metabolism were abundantly accumulated in the column cyc1 enriched in column experiments encoded a common enzyme in fe ii oxidation and was an indispensable gene in chemoautotrophic metabolism gupta et al 2021 as a gene encoding outer membrane transmembrane protein mtra played an important role of bidirectional electron transfer between fe ii oxidation and fe iii reduction shi et al 2012 the mtra gene was also transcriptionally expressed fig 6b another important terminal reductase mtrc could also take part in directly electron transfer reactions edwards et al 2020 enrichments of genes encoding intermediate synthesis and utilization were also detected the relative abundances of most genes involved in ch4 metabolism such as the key methyl com reductase subunit a mcra increased significantly ye et al 2022 methane producing methanosarcina possessing this gene could effectively remediate uranium producing aquifers holmes et al 2018 hydrogenase used h2 as an electron donor to reduce u vi and the produced h2 could also be used to synthesize ch4 under anaerobic conditions he et al 2020 as organic intermediates produced in the metabolic process vfas could not only act as electron donors but also provide energy for heterotrophic cells to reduce u vi ch4 h2 and vfas were also directly detected in the column fig 6c further illuminating their roles in fe 0 dependent u vi bio reduction 3 6 potential mechanisms and implications based on the geochemical process examination microbial community analysis pure culture verification and metabolic exploration mechanisms of fe 0 dependent u vi microbial reduction were clarified with independent and synergistic pathways under the activity of the autotrophic thiobacillus fe 0 is finally oxidized to fe iii via fe ii the released electrons simultaneously reduce u vi to insoluble u iv on the other hand energy released from fe 0 oxidation was utilized to convert h2 and hco3 into intermediate metabolites including ch4 and vfas e g acetate isobutyrate valerate liu et al 2020 which were consumed by heterotrophic u vi reducers such as desulfomicrobium bacillus and pseudomonas for the reduction of u vi wufuer et al 2017 h2 produced from fe 0 corrosion was also directly employed by autotrophic clostridium for u vi reduction dalla vecchia et al 2010 the upregulated genes for u vi reduction e g dsra and dsrb and fe ii oxidation e g cyc1 and mtra contributed to the related enzymatic reactions cytochrome c and gsh were also involved in u vi reduction through electron transfer shelobolina et al 2007 kretzschmar et al 2018 genes including czcd as well as abc transporters were responsible for the heavy metal efflux cason et al 2012 these achievements enhance the comprehensive understanding of the role fe 0 in u vi decontamination efficient u vi bio reduction by microbial consortia in aquifer with fe 0 as the sole electron donor and inorganic bicarbonate as carbon source provides a new perspective for the uranium contamination remediation this bioremediation strategy not only effectively reduces the secondary pollution caused by excess organic matter but also improves the efficacy of environmentally friendly fe 0 sulfidation can enhance the reactivity and selectivity of fe 0 and accelerate electron transfer wu et al 2023 which can be considered during application the products from u vi reduction should be timely cleaned up to prevent their re oxidization at the same time the components of natural aquifer environment are relatively complex apart from nitrate there are other refractory organics and heavy metal pollutants e g chromium pentachlorophenol shi et al 2022 which requires equally consideration 4 conclusions in this study the performance and possible mechanisms for microbial u vi removal with fe 0 as the sole electron donor were investigated the major conclusions were u vi could be removed efficiently under different hydrochemical and hydrodynamic conditions in continuous column experiment the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes to u vi removal were 70 81 0 52 and 29 19 0 47 respectively u vi was bio reduced to insoluble u iv while fe 0 was also eventually oxidized to fe iii genera such as thiobacillus pseudomonas and desulfomicrobium played an important role in the microbial removal of u vi and the oxidation of fe 0 which were also verified by pure culture functional genes for u vi reduction e g dsra and dsrb and fe ii oxidation e g cyc1 and mtra were identified metagenomic and rt qpcr analyses together with electron transfer compounds and metabolites quantification independent
