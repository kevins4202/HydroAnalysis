12925,mswi leachate contain high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n the conventional submerged air diffusing csa system are the dominant oxygen supply in the aerobic process for nh4 n removal from leachate however it carries high energy consumption in this study pure oxygen po which is more environmentally friendly was used as an alternative to air for solving this problem for comprehensive analysis the effects of po supersede air on nitrogen removals and microbial diversities in the aerobic process during treatment of mswi leachate two parallel full scale anoxic oxic systems were set with the floating praxair s in situ oxygenation i so system and the csa system respectively compared to the cas system the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn increased by 9 79 with the i so system but cod and nh4 n removals reduced by 6 83 and 1 19 respectively metagenomic studies revealed that the bacterial richness diversity and evenness decreased with po aeration while the abundances of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and denitrifying bacteria dnb increased as well as the aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob ratios in addition the nitrite denitrification functional genes nirk and nirs deposited from autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria were more predominant and accounted for the higher efficiency of tn removal in the po aeration treatment while complete nitrification and nitrate denitrification were dominant in the air aeration anoxic oxic system therefore nitrogen removal from mswi leachate by using po aeration provided theoretical perspective for engineering applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mswi leachate anoxic oxic systems pure oxygen aeration metagenomic nitrite denitrification 1 introduction prior to the onsite incineration of municipal solid waste msw it is usually settled in the waste bunker for 2 7 days to further reduce water content during the process a large amount of fresh leachate mswi leachate is generated which contains high contents of cod 20000 75 000 mg l nh4 n 1000 3000 mg l and suspended solids ss 1000 5000 mg l as well as the refractory organic matters e g fulvic and humic like substances 1 3 this leachate poses a threat to the environments and needs to be safely treated before water reclaiming or directly discharging into sewage system in a typical mswi leachate the ratio of biological oxygen demand bod5 to cod varies between 0 5 and 0 8 4 which is suitable for and quite effective with the treatment of biological systems such as anaerobic aerobic coagulation process 5 anaerobic baffled reactor abr aerobic process 6 and uasb modified bardenpho process 4 in the biological treatment aerobic process is the key step for completely degradation of pollutants in which sufficient oxygen is supplied for boosting the proliferation of aerobic microorganisms and secretions of enzymes that engaged in degrading cod and converting ammonia to nitrate since oxygen only account for 21 in the air large volume of air should be used for the treatment of high strength leachate with the conventional air diffusing aeration system the excessive air aeration would cost a great deal of energy furthermore severely undesired foams volatile organic chemicals vocs and other malodorous gases would derive from the high intensity air aeration 7 as the po partial pressure is 4 7 times higher than that of air it can improve the oxygen transfer rate otr and maintain high do level with a lower flowrate during treatment of high concentration wastewater 8 previous studies reported that removal efficiencies of cod 9 total organic carbon toc 10 and nh4 n 11 were enhanced by using po aeration in the aerobic process to date po aeration has been applied for treatment of different wastewater with high strength including landfill leachate 12 13 pulp and paper wastewater 14 and coal gasification wastewater 9 zhuang et al reported that under the po aeration some species of microorganisms involved in nitrification and denitrification were enriched which included thauera comamonas nitrosomonas and nitrospira 9 however few investigations was carried out on po aeration for treatment of mswi leachate and its effects on removals and metabolism pathways of nitrogen were not fully illustrated to elucidate the potential effects of po supersede air on nitrogen removals and microbial diversities air and po aeration were respectively applied in the aerobic processes of two full scale anoxic oxic systems operated in parallel for treatment of mswi leachate in this study the performances of nitrogen removals were investigated and the nitrogen metabolism mechanisms were comprehensively elucidated by metagenomics the main objectives of this study were to 1 compare nitrogen removals with air and po aeration 2 identify the structures of microbial communities and their functions in nitrogen metabolism in the two systems 3 recover the genomes of poorly characterized microbial species and identify their roles in nitrification and denitrification and 4 illustrate the pathways for nitrogen removal under the air and po aeration to our knowledge this work was the first time to use the metagenomic sequencing approach to compare the microbial communities and their metabolic functions in nitrogen removal under the air and po aeration in full scale biological treatment systems these results would elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen removal in treatment of high strength organic and ammonia wastewater streams from the perspective of metagenomes 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale anoxic oxic systems operated in parallel the raw mswi leachate was collected from an msw incineration plant located in changzhou ca 31 72 n 120 05 e china the original mswi leachate treatment system was operated with a designed capacity of 400 m3 d as illustrated in fig s 1 which contained an equalization tank anaerobic digestion towers the same sized two anoxic oxic biological treatment systems operated in parallel anoxic tank 375 m3 the first oxic tanks 877 m3 the second oxic tanks 364 m3 and ultra nano and reverse osmosis filtration systems to compare and evaluate nitrogen removals with the po and air aeration in treatment of mswi leachate the po aeration train named as poat of anoxic oxic systems was modified by replacing the submerged air diffusers with two floating praxair s in situ oxygenation i so systems in the first oxic tank named as po tank oxygen was supplied to the i so system using liquid oxygen 99 5 o2 supplied by praxair china the air aeration train named as aat still used the original air diffusers in the first oxic tank named as aa tank which was performed as the control the same original air diffusers were used in the second oxic tanks following po and aa tanks respectively in the two systems fig s 1 the flow rates of air and pure oxygen were 1000 nm3 h and 160 nm3 h for the aa and po tanks respectively and then the same air aeration rate of 300 nm3 h was used for the second oxic tanks dissolved oxygen do was averaged 2 4 mg l and 2 6 mg l near the outlet of the aa and po tanks respectively the hydraulic loading rate of the digested leachate from the anaerobic digestion towers was 200 360 m3 d which was relatively evenly distributed to the two downstream anoxic oxic systems maximal loading capacity of 200 m3 d for each system 70 m3 h of return activated sludge ras was pumped back to the anoxic tanks from the second oxic tanks individually in the two systems mlss in both anoxic oxic systems were maintained at 12 g l 13 g l the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss mlss ratio was between 0 75 and 0 85 and the sludge retention time srt was between 20 and 25 days the hydraulic retention time hrt of mswi leachate in the anoxic oxic systems was 9 16 days the two anoxic oxic systems were operated for over one month under the above operating conditions 2 2 chemical analysis the influent and effluent of the two anoxic oxic systems were collected every day for 14 days in examination of cod nh4 n tn nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n the sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter before the examination which followed the procedures of water and wastewater monitoring methods 15 2 3 dna extraction and shotgun sequencing four suspended sludge samples were collected for dna extraction on the 11th day of total 14 days of running experiment from the preset sampling pipes in po and aa tanks respectively before collecting the samples the pipe was opened for 5 min to discharge the deposited old sludge two 200 ml of the sludge sample were collected from each sampling point and 2 ml of the homogenized sludge was used to extract total dna using the tianamp soil dna kit tiangen biotech beijing china according to the manufacturer s protocols the quality of dna was tested on 1 agarose gels by forming a single band and its concentration was determined by using a qubit 2 0 flurometer life technologies usa 1 μg of high quality dna from each sample was used to construct the sequencing libraries using nebnext ultra dna library prep kit from illumina neb usa following manufacturer s protocols the libraries were sequenced at the novogene beijing china with the illumina hiseq 2500 platform by applying the pe 250 manufacturer s standard protocol 2 4 metagenomic analysis 2 4 1 metagenomic sequencing data quality control the raw sequencing reads were checked for their quality by fastqc v0 11 7 and the clean reads were obtained by filtering through

genes database genus prokaryotes family eukaryotes 28 to distinguish the affiliated microbial taxa of each gene the taxonomic classification of all protein sequences was performed using kaiju v1 7 2 by compared to ncbi blast nr ncbi non redundant protein sequences database 29 2 4 4 metagenomic binning in terms of metagenomic binning the previous metagenomic assembly file was used to reconstruct mags using the metawrap pipeline v1 2 30 briefly the initial binning process was conducted with three binning software including metabat2 concoct and maxbin2 to recover the raw mags 31 33 these mags were then consolidated by the bin refinement module the reassemble bins module was applied to further improve the quality of mags the abundances expressed as genome copies per million reads of mags

results and discussion 3 1 performance of two full scale anoxic oxic systems the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tn and the changes of no2 n and no3 n in the two systems with either air or po aeration were demonstrated in fig 1a d as shown in fig 1a the influent cod was ranged from 3508 mg l to 6163 mg l after treatment with the anoxic oxic systems cods in the effluent of aat and poat were steadily around 993 mg l and 1231 mg l respectively which corresponded to 78 and 73 of the average cod removal efficiencies in leachate in addition to the biodegradable organic matter a large amount of refractory organic substances were presented which were difficult to be degraded by the conventional biological technologies and remain in effluent 3 the average concentrations of tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the influent were 2008 03 mg l 1966 21 mg l 0 64 mg l and 4 39 mg l respectively indicating the majority of nitrogen in anaerobically digested leachate was nh4 n fig 1b d after treatment with the anoxic oxic systems nh4 n was significantly reduced from 1966 21 mg l to 44 67 mg l and 22 31 mg l in poat and aat which were 97 70 and 98 85 removal efficiencies for the two systems respectively fig 1b tn declined from 2008 03 mg l to 732 71 mg l and 846 50 mg l in poat and aat with removal efficiencies of 63 47 and 57 81 respectively at the same time 596 92 mg l and 739 79 mg l of no3 n and 13 75 mg l and 6 59 mg l of no2 n were observed in poat and aat respectively indicating denitrification was not effective for both systems probably because the carbon source was mostly locked in the refractory organic compounds unavailable for denitrifying microorganisms this result followed the report from lei et al 2019 which demonstrated that about 13 of cod carbon in mswi leachate was presented in form of humic like substances 40 according to fig s 2 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n cod and tn were significantly different p 0 05 between poat and aat indicating tn removal was enhanced but nh4 n and cod removals were weakened with po aeration in general tn is removed by denitrification under anoxic condition the improvement on tn removal in poat might be due to enhancement of denitrification by generation of the oxygen deficient zones in po tank with uneven distribution of oxygen by the i so propellers previous study reported that oxygen bubbles were unevenly distributed by the i so propellers which created an oxygen rich zone near the exit of the down draft tube and under the hood zone and oxygen deficient zones in other parts of the reactor 41 due to the same reason cod nh4 n and no2 n were less oxidized in po tank which resulted in higher concentrations of these compounds in the effluence of poat than those in aat fig 1a c and d in contrast in the aa tank the submerged air diffusing system had a higher air flow rate 1000 nm3 h which enabled air to be dispersed and agitated better with wastewater creating less oxygen deficient zones as a result better cod nh4 n and no2 n removals were observed with aat fig 1a c and d 3 2 structure and diversity of microbial communities to compare the structure and diversity of microbial communities in poat and aat four representative suspended sludge samples were investigated with shotgun metagenomic sequencing total 45 phyla were identified in the four samples and the most abundant 9 phyla were listed in fig 2a among them bacteroidetes 40 29 42 76 proteobacteria 21 12 29 50 chloroflexi 6 97 11 84 and actinobacteria 4 26 5 73 were the dominant phyla in both systems which were also the dominant phyla in anoxic oxic systems for wastewater treatments in other studies 42 45 the abundances of these phyla were correlated with their functions of removals of organic compounds and nitrogen thereinto bacteroidetes was reported to degrade high molecular carbohydrates and aromatic organic compounds for nitrate reduction during anaerobic denitrification 4 46 members of proteobacteria had capabilities of organic matter degradation and nitrogen metabolism and some members in this phylum were autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 47 48 members of actinobacteria and chloroflexi were assigned to tn removal owing to denitrification in the anoxic oxic process 43 nevertheless the dominant phyla were different between poat and aat the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 29 29 in poat which increased by 35 40 compared to 21 63 in aat the relative abundance of chloroflexi in poat was 7 23 which was 57 7 lower than that of 11 40 in aat the abundances of planctomycetes firmicutes and acidobacteria were similar in the two systems which were identified to participate nitrogen metabolism in different anoxic oxic processes 43 49 at the genus level total 909 genera were identified in the four samples and the most abundant 20 genera were used to determine composition of the bacterial communities in poat and aat by hierarchical cluster analysis fig 2b among these 20 genera g f ns9 marine group genus from ns9 marine group family thauera limnobacter and olb8 were presented with relative abundances of 5 or higher the abundance of g f ns9 marine group was 19 62 20 00 and 24 44 25 08 in aat and poat respectively the highest among the identified genera it was an unclassified bacterium affiliated to bacteroidetes and often presented in the biological nitrogen removal facilities 50 51 in the hierarchical cluster analysis the top 20 genera were obviously divided into two clusters suggesting the structure of microbial communities was greatly affected by the ways of different aeration cluster i contained 10 genera that were more abundant in aat which included olb8 truepera phaeodactylibacter and other 7 unclassified genera the genus olb8 belonging to bacteroidetes was 180 times higher in aat than in poat and identified to degrade proteins and polysaccharides 52 truepera and phaeodactylibacter were also reported to degrade organic matters 53 54 cluster ii comprised of 10 genera including limnobacter thauera azoarcus and 7 other unclassified genera which were more abundant in poat than aat thauera azoarcus and limnobacter were identified as denitrifying bacteria 55 56 zhuang et al 2016 found that thauera was higher in the o2 mbr pure oxygen fine bubbles on membrane bioreactor than that in the cmbr conventional mbr using aeration source of air when treating the coal gasification wastewater 9 furthermore fourteen of the top 20 genera in all four sludge samples were unidentified which accounted for 39 24 45 50 of the total reads hence the detail functions of these unidentified environmental microbes in nitrogen metabolism was unclear and need further to be investigated to evaluate the similarity of the microbial communities between poat and aat venn alpha and beta diversity analyses were conducted on the normalized otus data sets principal coordinates analysis pcoa showed that variability factor of pco1 was 93 94 fig s 3 indicating the microbial communities in poat was significantly different from those in aat the two pcoa sets of poat along the pco2 axis were more convergent than those of aat suggesting that the poat microbial communities were more homogenous as shown in fig s 4 859 otus were shared by aat and poat but 1332 and 1132 otus were exclusively owned by aat and poat respectively in addition alpha diversity analysis revealed that chao shannon and heip indexes of poat were lower than those of aat table s 3 indicating that richness diversity and evenness of the microbial community decreased and some species of microbes were enriched with po aeration these results were in accordance with the increased abundances of thauera limnobacter and g f ns9 marine group in poat fig 2b the results were also consistent with the report of zhuang et al 2016 in which the most dominant genera were further enriched by po fine bubbling in treatment of coal gasification wastewater 9 3 3 functional metagenomic analysis of nitrogen metabolism to understand the better removal efficiency of tn in poat the functional genes in nitrogen metabolism were identified and categorized by using kegg enzyme and kegg pathway thirteen groups of kegg enzymes involved in five kegg pathways related to core nitrogen metabolism were annotated including nitrification denitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation fig 3a results of kegg pathways analysis showed that average number of functional genes involved in pathways of nitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction and dissimilatory nitrate reduction showed no significant difference δ the mean difference of abundance 10 between two systems fig 3b however genes involved in the denitrification pathway was more abundant δ 10 in poat than in aat indicating poat had stronger denitrification capacity which was consistent with the better removal of nitrogen in poat fig 1c the abundance of genes associated with nitrogen fixation was extremely low in both systems averaging 4 47 tpm which might be attributed to the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of ammonia presented in the systems 57 meanwhile more genes for nitrogen fixation were observed in aat fig 3b the predicted enzymes from genes in nitrogen metabolic pathways were quantified and presented in fig 3c for nitrification ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 existed at an extremely low abundance averaging 2 29 tpm compared to other functional enzymes and exhibited no difference in poat and aat fig 4c which probably because of the homology genes of methane monooxygenase from methane oxidizing bacteria 58 according to fig 4 the genus nitrosomonas was the common contributor to pmo amo cab genes encoding methane ammonia monooxygenase which was frequently presented in activated sludge and considered to be the major aob 59 some pmo amocab and hao genes were affiliated to methane oxidizing bacteria which were not expressed in nitrification process of sewage 60 these results suggested nitrosomonas was the only contributor of the amocab genes in aob the abundance of genes encoding for ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 affiliated to nitrosomonas was in accordance with the taxa abundance fig 5 which was higher in poat than that in aat fig 3c indicating higher ammonia removal capability in poat yu and zhang 2012 found that abundances of nitrification related genes extracted from metagenomes of activated sludge were low but the expressions of these genes were high which performed efficiently in nitrification resulting in high efficiency of ammonia removal 60 for assimilation nitrate reduction pathway no significant difference was observed in abundance of nitrate reductases ec 1 7 7 2 and ec 1 7 99 and nitrite reductase ec 1 7 7 1 in poat and aat fig 3c probably because nitrogen assimilation was not affected by the high concentration of ammonia in the two systems in dissimilation nitrate reduction pathway the abundance of nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 were higher in poat indicating the capability of dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite was enhanced in poat the abundance of nitrite reductases ec 1 7 1 15 and ec 1 7 2 2 were lower in poat than in aat suggesting the capability of nitrite reduction to ammonium was reduced which might lead to accumulation of nitrite in poat fig 1d in denitrification pathway the abundance of nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 was demonstrated higher in poat than that in aat indicating the capabilities of nitrite reduction in poat in the denitrification pathway was enhanced which was probably due to the more suitable anoxic environment created by the uneven distribution of oxygen by po aeration the abundance of nitrogenase ec 1 18 6 1 involved in nitrogen fixation was observed higher in aat than in poat fig 4c previous study found that enzymes coding genes related to nitrification and denitrification were highly expressed in the oxic and anoxic zone respectively for treating high ammonia wastewater 61 3 4 taxonomic and functional analysis of mags to further identify the unclassified microbial species and their functional genes involved in nitrification and denitrification pathways mags were reconstructed from the high quality clean reads by using metagenomic binning tools twenty seven high quality mags were obtained with more than 90 completeness and less than 5 contamination the genomic features and taxonomic characterization of these mags were listed in table s 4 according to fig 6 12 of the 27 reconstructed mags were assigned to unclassified bacteria among them mag 6 affiliated to g f ns9 marine group was also the dominant mag in both poat and aat but with higher abundance in poat which were consistent with the analysis of microbial communities at the genus level fig 2b the mag 23 and mag 24 were affiliated to nitrosomonas in aob group and catalyzed the reaction of ammonia to nitrite while the abundance of mag 23 was 29 times higher in poat than in aat the mag 24 was slightly higher in aat the mag 22 affiliated to nitrococcus was included in nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 62 and catalyzed the reaction of nitrite to nitrate which was 20 times higher in aat than that in poat to further identify the unclassified microbial species and their functional genes involved in nitrification and denitrification pathways mags were reconstructed from the high quality clean reads by using metagenomic binning tools twenty seven high quality mags were obtained with more than 90 completeness and less than 5 contamination the genomic features and taxonomic characterization of these mags were listed in table s 4 according to fig 6 12 of the 27 reconstructed mags were assigned to unclassified bacteria among them mag 6 affiliated to g f ns9 marine group was also the dominant mag in both poat and aat but with higher abundance in poat which were consistent with the analysis of microbial communities at the genus level fig 2b the mag 23 and mag 24 were affiliated to nitrosomonas in aob group and catalyzed the reaction of ammonia to nitrite while the abundance of mag 23 was 29 times higher in poat than in aat the mag 24 was slightly higher in aat the mag 22 affiliated to nitrococcus was included in nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 62 and catalyzed the reaction of nitrite to nitrate which was 20 times higher in aat than that in poat genes associated with nitrification and denitrification on these mags were identified and quantified which was presented in fig 6 genes in these mags were highly involved in denitrification process narghi napab nirk nirs norbc and nosz narghi or napab encoding for nitrate reductase were identified in 10 of the mags and nirk or nirs for nitrite reductase norbc for nitric oxide reductase and nosz for nitrous oxide reductase were identified in 12 9 and 13 of the mags respectively the napab nirs norbc and nosz genes identified in mag 26 which were affiliated to thiogranum encoded for key enzymes in nitrate denitrification pathway the narghi napab and nirk nirs genes were both identified in 5 mags indicating nitrate denitrification was performed by species deduced from these mags the mag 6 was affiliated to g f ns9 marine group the most abundant genus in metagenomic sequencing analysis contained genes for nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases suggesting it could perform nitrate denitrification in nitrogen removal the narghi and nirk genes were deduced from mag 22 which was affiliated to nitrococcus indicating it could perform nitrite to nitrate oxidization and nitrate to nitric oxide reduction under the oxic and anoxic different environments respectively 63 the nirk or nirs genes were deduced from 7 of the 27 mags but no gene for nitrate reductase was identified suggesting nitrite denitrification was performed with species deduced from these mags among them mag 3 affiliated to g f chitinophagaceae contained genes encoding for nitrite nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductases but no nitrate reductase suggesting mag 3 was a typical nitrite denitrifier only norbc or nosz genes were identified in 8 of these mags suggesting these 8 mags might get involved in denitrification process and complete the denitrification process of other bacteria the mag 23 affiliated to nitrosomonas communis table s 4 contained all genes amocab and hao in nitrification and norbc genes for denitrification indicating this species was involved in autotrophic nitrification and denitrification different from mag 23 mag 24 affiliated to nitrosomonas nitrosa contained the hao gene encoding for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in nitrification and nirk gene for nitrite reductase in denitrification but had no amocab genes which might due to the deficiency of its genomic reads the results indicated that mag 24 could carry out autotrophic nitrite denitrification it was confirmed that nirk in nitrosomonas was expressed under the anoxic condition 61 64 these results suggested that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd was conducted by nitrosomonas mag 23 and mag 24 under low oxygen concentration conditions 65 66 the mag 23 affiliated to nitrosomonas communis table s 4 contained all genes amocab and hao in nitrification and norbc genes for denitrification indicating this species was involved in autotrophic nitrification and denitrification different from mag 23 mag 24 affiliated to nitrosomonas nitrosa contained the hao gene encoding for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in nitrification and nirk gene for nitrite reductase in denitrification but had no amocab genes which might due to the deficiency of its genomic reads the results indicated that mag 24 could carry out autotrophic nitrite denitrification it was confirmed that nirk in nitrosomonas was expressed under the anoxic condition 61 64 these results suggested that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd was conducted by nitrosomonas mag 23 and mag 24 under low oxygen concentration conditions 65 66 3 5 mechanism analysis of tn removal in two anoxic oxic systems in this study to investigate the effects of po supersede air on the treatment of mswi anaerobically digested leachate the csa system was converted to the i so system in one of the anoxic oxic systems operated in parallel in aa tank air was distributed more evenly with the submerged diffusion of higher flowrate air in contrast oxygen distributed by i so system was uneven creating more oxygen deficient zones because the flowrate of po was low consequently different aeration methods created special ecological niches which stimulated different species of microbes to growth in po tank the higher do concentration zones near the i so propellers were created which favored the growths of aob nitrosomonas nob nitrospira and denitrifying bacteria such as g f ns9 marine group g f chitinophagaceae thauera and limnobacter generally do was a key factor that affecting the metabolism of the nitrifying bacteria in nitrification process 67 previous study reported that the growth of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were enhanced by po aeration 9 in poat the abundance of nitrosomonas was 0 38 increased by 2 53 times from 0 15 of aat fig 5 the abundance of nob nitrospira nitrococcus nitrolancea and nitrospina in aat was 0 42 which was 1 68 times higher than that 0 25 in poat fig 5 indicating it was more favorable for ammonium to be oxidized completely to the endproduct of nitrate which was consistent with the less concentration of nitrite in aat fig 1d it was reported that the nob was more sensitive to the low do concentration of which 1 4 g o2 m3 the saturation coefficients by oxygen is significantly higher than that of aob 0 99 g o2 m3 68 we speculated that the zones of po tank away from the i so propellers existed oxygen deficient conditions which resulted in the abundance of nob declined but nitrospira was found to have a higher oxygen affinity and its abundance was increased under long term low do condition 0 37 mg l in additional the composition and dominant species of the nob community have been shifted in order to adapt the low do environment 69 hence the aob nob ratio of poat was 1 56 which was 4 11 times higher than 0 38 of aat resulting in the accumulation of no2 n fig 1d 70 nitrite accumulation stimulated nitrite denitrification in the anoxic environments of poat which was consistent with the higher abundance of nitrite reductases associated with denitrification in poat fig 3c the lower aob nob ratio in aat indicated that nob was robust with more complete aeration and agitation which led to more complete oxidation of no2 n and accumulation of no3 n compared to nitrate denitrification only 60 70 carbon source was consumed by nitrite denitrification 12 hence carbon was significantly saved with nitrite denitrification in addition with po aeration the abundance of nitrosomonas was higher which removed nitrogen through autotrophic denitrification without consumption of carbon source as the c n ratio was only 2 18 and the biodegradable carbon source was limited in anaerobically digested leachate po aeration created a more suitable environment for both autotrophic denitrification and nitrite denitrification which was a better option for tn removal in contrast the complete nitrification and denitrification pathway which were dominated in aat led to poor nitrogen removal 3 6 the recommend for the application of po aeration for a full scale demonstration based on the results of our pilot study and other previous studies 9 71 it is known that po instead air can significantly improve the abundance of functional bacteria and enhance the removals of nitrogen and organic material however the disadvantage of po aeration is also inevitable such as higher equipment investment and higher difficulty in controlling the do distribution which seriously limits the application of it in the full scale demonstration in general the do distribution was greatly affected by the aeration methods in this pilot study the i so system was used which can significantly improve the utilization efficiency of oxygen but it maybe led to oxygen deficient zones in this large aerobic tank it is recommended that the hybrid aeration system mixed aeration of air and pure oxygen should be used in large aerobic tanks which not only can maintain appropriate do concentration to remove oxygen deficient zones but also improve the mass exchange between zones the appropriate concentration of do is conducive to the efficient removal of nh4 n and cod furthermore the removal of total nitrogen can be promoted by supplying additional carbon source such as raw leachate and improving the snd proportions in the poat system other study confirmed that increasing the concentration of bioavailable carbon source can significantly improve the denitrification performance 4 the hybrid aeration system should be used in large aerobic tanks for controlling the appropriately low do concentration condition which might be conducive to the realization of snd generally the professional equipment is needed for improving the distribution of pure oxygen which usually have high price and account for most of capital investment and consumed energy for the capital investment of two full scale anox oxic systems the i so systems costed 800 000 cny 400 000 cny 2 while the air aeration system costed 696 000 cny for purchasing pumps and others equipment and needed additional place for setting pumps meanwhile the annual average operation cost of po aeration was 12 10 cny m3 while that of air aeration was 12 75 cny m3 the operation cost of po aeration was significantly impacted by the influent quantity of leachate obviously the capital investment and operation cost of po aeration need to be further reduced before the large scale adoption hence the hybrid aeration system used in large aerobic tanks should be studied for reducing the capital investment and operation cost furthermore as the higher oxygen transmission efficiency of pure oxygen a more accurate do sensor should be applied for efficiently controlling the do concentration in practice 4 conclusions in this study a full scale experimental investigation of the effects of po supersedes air on nitrogen removal and microbial communities for mswi leachate treatment during the experimental period better tn removal and better cod and nh4 n removal were obtained in poat and aat respectively compared to air aeration the special distribution of oxygen created by po aeration had a remarkable influence on microbial community structures and functions which enhanced autotrophic denitrification and nitrite denitrification resulting in better tn removal in poat with limited carbon source this study provides a significant

12925,mswi leachate contain high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n the conventional submerged air diffusing csa system are the dominant oxygen supply in the aerobic process for nh4 n removal from leachate however it carries high energy consumption in this study pure oxygen po which is more environmentally friendly was used as an alternative to air for solving this problem for comprehensive analysis the effects of po supersede air on nitrogen removals and microbial diversities in the aerobic process during treatment of mswi leachate two parallel full scale anoxic oxic systems were set with the floating praxair s in situ oxygenation i so system and the csa system respectively compared to the cas system the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn increased by 9 79 with the i so system but cod and nh4 n removals reduced by 6 83 and 1 19 respectively metagenomic studies revealed that the bacterial richness diversity and evenness decreased with po aeration while the abundances of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and denitrifying bacteria dnb increased as well as the aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob ratios in addition the nitrite denitrification functional genes nirk and nirs deposited from autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria were more predominant and accounted for the higher efficiency of tn removal in the po aeration treatment while complete nitrification and nitrate denitrification were dominant in the air aeration anoxic oxic system therefore nitrogen removal from mswi leachate by using po aeration provided theoretical perspective for engineering applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mswi leachate anoxic oxic systems pure oxygen aeration metagenomic nitrite denitrification 1 introduction prior to the onsite incineration of municipal solid waste msw it is usually settled in the waste bunker for 2 7 days to further reduce water content during the process a large amount of fresh leachate mswi leachate is generated which contains high contents of cod 20000 75 000 mg l nh4 n 1000 3000 mg l and suspended solids ss 1000 5000 mg l as well as the refractory organic matters e g fulvic and humic like substances 1 3 this leachate poses a threat to the environments and needs to be safely treated before water reclaiming or directly discharging into sewage system in a typical mswi leachate the ratio of biological oxygen demand bod5 to cod varies between 0 5 and 0 8 4 which is suitable for and quite effective with the treatment of biological systems such as anaerobic aerobic coagulation process 5 anaerobic baffled reactor abr aerobic process 6 and uasb modified bardenpho process 4 in the biological treatment aerobic process is the key step for completely degradation of pollutants in which sufficient oxygen is supplied for boosting the proliferation of aerobic microorganisms and secretions of enzymes that engaged in degrading cod and converting ammonia to nitrate since oxygen only account for 21 in the air large volume of air should be used for the treatment of high strength leachate with the conventional air diffusing aeration system the excessive air aeration would cost a great deal of energy furthermore severely undesired foams volatile organic chemicals vocs and other malodorous gases would derive from the high intensity air aeration 7 as the po partial pressure is 4 7 times higher than that of air it can improve the oxygen transfer rate otr and maintain high do level with a lower flowrate during treatment of high concentration wastewater 8 previous studies reported that removal efficiencies of cod 9 total organic carbon toc 10 and nh4 n 11 were enhanced by using po aeration in the aerobic process to date po aeration has been applied for treatment of different wastewater with high strength including landfill leachate 12 13 pulp and paper wastewater 14 and coal gasification wastewater 9 zhuang et al reported that under the po aeration some species of microorganisms involved in nitrification and denitrification were enriched which included thauera comamonas nitrosomonas and nitrospira 9 however few investigations was carried out on po aeration for treatment of mswi leachate and its effects on removals and metabolism pathways of nitrogen were not fully illustrated to elucidate the potential effects of po supersede air on nitrogen removals and microbial diversities air and po aeration were respectively applied in the aerobic processes of two full scale anoxic oxic systems operated in parallel for treatment of mswi leachate in this study the performances of nitrogen removals were investigated and the nitrogen metabolism mechanisms were comprehensively elucidated by metagenomics the main objectives of this study were to 1 compare nitrogen removals with air and po aeration 2 identify the structures of microbial communities and their functions in nitrogen metabolism in the two systems 3 recover the genomes of poorly characterized microbial species and identify their roles in nitrification and denitrification and 4 illustrate the pathways for nitrogen removal under the air and po aeration to our knowledge this work was the first time to use the metagenomic sequencing approach to compare the microbial communities and their metabolic functions in nitrogen removal under the air and po aeration in full scale biological treatment systems these results would elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen removal in treatment of high strength organic and ammonia wastewater streams from the perspective of metagenomes 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale anoxic oxic systems operated in parallel the raw mswi leachate was collected from an msw incineration plant located in changzhou ca 31 72 n 120 05 e china the original mswi leachate treatment system was operated with a designed capacity of 400 m3 d as illustrated in fig s 1 which contained an equalization tank anaerobic digestion towers the same sized two anoxic oxic biological treatment systems operated in parallel anoxic tank 375 m3 the first oxic tanks 877 m3 the second oxic tanks 364 m3 and ultra nano and reverse osmosis filtration systems to compare and evaluate nitrogen removals with the po and air aeration in treatment of mswi leachate the po aeration train named as poat of anoxic oxic systems was modified by replacing the submerged air diffusers with two floating praxair s in situ oxygenation i so systems in the first oxic tank named as po tank oxygen was supplied to the i so system using liquid oxygen 99 5 o2 supplied by praxair china the air aeration train named as aat still used the original air diffusers in the first oxic tank named as aa tank which was performed as the control the same original air diffusers were used in the second oxic tanks following po and aa tanks respectively in the two systems fig s 1 the flow rates of air and pure oxygen were 1000 nm3 h and 160 nm3 h for the aa and po tanks respectively and then the same air aeration rate of 300 nm3 h was used for the second oxic tanks dissolved oxygen do was averaged 2 4 mg l and 2 6 mg l near the outlet of the aa and po tanks respectively the hydraulic loading rate of the digested leachate from the anaerobic digestion towers was 200 360 m3 d which was relatively evenly distributed to the two downstream anoxic oxic systems maximal loading capacity of 200 m3 d for each system 70 m3 h of return activated sludge ras was pumped back to the anoxic tanks from the second oxic tanks individually in the two systems mlss in both anoxic oxic systems were maintained at 12 g l 13 g l the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss mlss ratio was between 0 75 and 0 85 and the sludge retention time srt was between 20 and 25 days the hydraulic retention time hrt of mswi leachate in the anoxic oxic systems was 9 16 days the two anoxic oxic systems were operated for over one month under the above operating conditions 2 2 chemical analysis the influent and effluent of the two anoxic oxic systems were collected every day for 14 days in examination of cod nh4 n tn nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n the sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter before the examination which followed the procedures of water and wastewater monitoring methods 15 2 3 dna extraction and shotgun sequencing four suspended sludge samples were collected for dna extraction on the 11th day of total 14 days of running experiment from the preset sampling pipes in po and aa tanks respectively before collecting the samples the pipe was opened for 5 min to discharge the deposited old sludge two 200 ml of the sludge sample were collected from each sampling point and 2 ml of the homogenized sludge was used to extract total dna using the tianamp soil dna kit tiangen biotech beijing china according to the manufacturer s protocols the quality of dna was tested on 1 agarose gels by forming a single band and its concentration was determined by using a qubit 2 0 flurometer life technologies usa 1 μg of high quality dna from each sample was used to construct the sequencing libraries using nebnext ultra dna library prep kit from illumina neb usa following manufacturer s protocols the libraries were sequenced at the novogene beijing china with the illumina hiseq 2500 platform by applying the pe 250 manufacturer s standard protocol 2 4 metagenomic analysis 2 4 1 metagenomic sequencing data quality control the raw sequencing reads were checked for their quality by fastqc v0 11 7 and the clean reads were obtained by filtering through

predicted non redundant protein sequences were submitted to kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ghostkoala https www kegg jp ghostkoala for assigning kegg ortholog numbers ko against a kegg genes database genus prokaryotes family eukaryotes 28 to distinguish the affiliated microbial taxa of each gene the taxonomic classification of all protein sequences was performed using kaiju v1 7 2 by compared to ncbi blast nr ncbi non redundant protein sequences database 29 2 4 4 metagenomic binning in terms of metagenomic binning the previous metagenomic assembly file was used to reconstruct mags using the metawrap pipeline v1 2 30 briefly the initial binning process was conducted with three binning software including metabat2 concoct and maxbin2 to recover the raw mags 31 33 these mags were then consolidated by the bin refinement module the reassemble bins module was applied to further improve the quality of mags the abundances expressed as genome copies per million reads of mags across metagenomes were calculated by using the quant bin module with salmon after above binning processes statistical features including genome completeness contamination genome size and gc content

analysis by using the prism software graphpad san diego ca the histogram and heatmap figures were drawn by using origin 9 5 software originlab corporation northampton ma and tbtools respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of two full scale anoxic oxic systems the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tn and the changes of no2 n and no3 n in the two systems with either air or po aeration were demonstrated in fig 1a d as shown in fig 1a the influent cod was ranged from 3508 mg l to 6163 mg l after treatment with the anoxic oxic systems cods in the effluent of aat and poat were steadily around 993 mg l and 1231 mg l respectively which corresponded to 78 and 73 of the average cod removal efficiencies in leachate in addition to the biodegradable organic matter a large amount of refractory organic substances were presented which were difficult to be degraded by the conventional biological technologies and remain in effluent 3 the average concentrations of tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the influent were 2008 03 mg l 1966 21 mg l 0 64 mg l and 4 39 mg l respectively indicating the majority of nitrogen in anaerobically digested leachate was nh4 n fig 1b d after treatment with the anoxic oxic systems nh4 n was significantly reduced from 1966 21 mg l to 44 67 mg l and 22 31 mg l in poat and aat which were 97 70 and 98 85 removal efficiencies for the two systems respectively fig 1b tn declined from 2008 03 mg l to 732 71 mg l and 846 50 mg l in poat and aat with removal efficiencies of 63 47 and 57 81 respectively at the same time 596 92 mg l and 739 79 mg l of no3 n and 13 75 mg l and 6 59 mg l of no2 n were observed in poat and aat respectively indicating denitrification was not effective for both systems probably because the carbon source was mostly locked in the refractory organic compounds unavailable for denitrifying microorganisms this result followed the report from lei et al 2019 which demonstrated that about 13 of cod carbon in mswi leachate was presented in form of humic like substances 40 according to fig s 2 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n cod and tn were significantly different p 0 05 between poat and aat indicating tn removal was enhanced but nh4 n and cod removals were weakened with po aeration in general tn is removed by denitrification under anoxic condition the improvement on tn removal in poat might be due to enhancement of denitrification by generation of the oxygen deficient zones in po tank with uneven distribution of oxygen by the i so propellers previous study reported that oxygen bubbles were unevenly distributed by the i so propellers which created an oxygen rich zone near the exit of the down draft tube and under the hood zone and oxygen deficient zones in other parts of the reactor 41 due to the same reason cod nh4 n and no2 n were less oxidized in po tank which resulted in higher concentrations of these compounds in the effluence of poat than those in aat fig 1a c and d in contrast in the aa tank the submerged air diffusing system had a higher air flow rate 1000 nm3 h which enabled air to be dispersed and agitated better with wastewater creating less oxygen deficient zones as a result better cod nh4 n and no2 n removals were observed with aat fig 1a c and d 3 2 structure and diversity of microbial communities to compare the structure and diversity of microbial communities in poat and aat four representative suspended sludge samples were investigated with shotgun metagenomic sequencing total 45 phyla were identified in the four samples and the most abundant 9 phyla were listed in fig 2a among them bacteroidetes 40 29 42 76 proteobacteria 21 12 29 50 chloroflexi 6 97 11 84 and actinobacteria 4 26 5 73 were the dominant phyla in both systems which were also the dominant phyla in anoxic oxic systems for wastewater treatments in other studies 42 45 the abundances of these phyla were correlated with their functions of removals of organic compounds and nitrogen thereinto bacteroidetes was reported to degrade high molecular carbohydrates and aromatic organic compounds for nitrate reduction during anaerobic denitrification 4 46 members of proteobacteria had capabilities of organic matter degradation and nitrogen metabolism and some members in this phylum were autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 47 48 members of actinobacteria and chloroflexi were assigned to tn removal owing to denitrification in the anoxic oxic process 43 nevertheless the dominant phyla were different between poat and aat the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 29 29 in poat which increased by 35 40 compared to 21 63 in aat the relative abundance of chloroflexi in poat was 7 23 which was 57 7 lower than that of 11 40 in aat the abundances of planctomycetes firmicutes and acidobacteria were similar in the two systems which were identified to participate nitrogen metabolism in different anoxic oxic processes 43 49 at the genus level total 909 genera were identified in the four samples and the most abundant 20 genera were used to determine composition of the bacterial communities in poat and aat by hierarchical cluster analysis fig 2b among these 20 genera g f ns9 marine group genus from ns9 marine group family thauera limnobacter and olb8 were presented with relative abundances of 5 or higher the abundance of g f ns9 marine group was 19 62 20 00 and 24 44 25 08 in aat and poat respectively the highest among the identified genera it was an unclassified bacterium affiliated to bacteroidetes and often presented in the biological nitrogen removal facilities 50 51 in the hierarchical cluster analysis the top 20 genera were obviously divided into two clusters suggesting the structure of microbial communities was greatly affected by the ways of different aeration cluster i contained 10 genera that were more abundant in aat which included olb8 truepera phaeodactylibacter and other 7 unclassified genera the genus olb8 belonging to bacteroidetes was 180 times higher in aat than in poat and identified to degrade proteins and polysaccharides 52 truepera and phaeodactylibacter were also reported to degrade organic matters 53 54 cluster ii comprised of 10 genera including limnobacter thauera azoarcus and 7 other unclassified genera which were more abundant in poat than aat thauera azoarcus and limnobacter were identified as denitrifying bacteria 55 56 zhuang et al 2016 found that thauera was higher in the o2 mbr pure oxygen fine bubbles on membrane bioreactor than that in the cmbr conventional mbr using aeration source of air when treating the coal gasification wastewater 9 furthermore fourteen of the top 20 genera in all four sludge samples were unidentified which accounted for 39 24 45 50 of the total reads hence the detail functions of these unidentified environmental microbes in nitrogen metabolism was unclear and need further to be investigated to evaluate the similarity of the microbial communities between poat and aat venn alpha and beta diversity analyses were conducted on the normalized otus data sets principal coordinates analysis pcoa showed that variability factor of pco1 was 93 94 fig s 3 indicating the microbial communities in poat was significantly different from those in aat the two pcoa sets of poat along the pco2 axis were more convergent than those of aat suggesting that the poat microbial communities were more homogenous as shown in fig s 4 859 otus were shared by aat and poat but 1332 and 1132 otus were exclusively owned by aat and poat respectively in addition alpha diversity analysis revealed that chao shannon and heip indexes of poat were lower than those of aat table s 3 indicating that richness diversity and evenness of the microbial community decreased and some species of microbes were enriched with po aeration these results were in accordance with the increased abundances of thauera limnobacter and g f ns9 marine group in poat fig 2b the results were also consistent with the report of zhuang et al 2016 in which the most dominant genera were further enriched by po fine bubbling in treatment of coal gasification wastewater 9 3 3 functional metagenomic analysis of nitrogen metabolism to understand the better removal efficiency of tn in poat the functional genes in nitrogen metabolism were identified and categorized by using kegg enzyme and kegg pathway thirteen groups of kegg enzymes involved in five kegg pathways related to core nitrogen metabolism were annotated including nitrification denitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation fig 3a results of kegg pathways analysis showed that average number of functional genes involved in pathways of nitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction and dissimilatory nitrate reduction showed no significant difference δ the mean difference of abundance 10 between two systems fig 3b however genes involved in the denitrification pathway was more abundant δ 10 in poat than in aat indicating poat had stronger denitrification capacity which was consistent with the better removal of nitrogen in poat fig 1c the abundance of genes associated with nitrogen fixation was extremely low in both systems averaging 4 47 tpm which might be attributed to the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of ammonia presented in the systems 57 meanwhile more genes for nitrogen fixation were observed in aat fig 3b the predicted enzymes from genes in nitrogen metabolic pathways were quantified and presented in fig 3c for nitrification ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 existed at an extremely low abundance averaging 2 29 tpm compared to other functional enzymes and exhibited no difference in poat and aat fig 4c which probably because of the homology genes of methane monooxygenase from methane oxidizing bacteria 58 according to fig 4 the genus nitrosomonas was the common contributor to pmo amo cab genes encoding methane ammonia monooxygenase which was frequently presented in activated sludge and considered to be the major aob 59 some pmo amocab and hao genes were affiliated to methane oxidizing bacteria which were not expressed in nitrification process of sewage 60 these results suggested nitrosomonas was the only contributor of the amocab genes in aob the abundance of genes encoding for ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 affiliated to nitrosomonas was in accordance with the taxa abundance fig 5 which was higher in poat than that in aat fig 3c indicating higher ammonia removal capability in poat yu and zhang 2012 found that abundances of nitrification related genes extracted from metagenomes of activated sludge were low but the expressions of these genes were high which performed efficiently in nitrification resulting in high efficiency of ammonia removal 60 for assimilation nitrate reduction pathway no significant difference was observed in abundance of nitrate reductases ec 1 7 7 2 and ec 1 7 99 and nitrite reductase ec 1 7 7 1 in poat and aat fig 3c probably because nitrogen assimilation was not affected by the high concentration of ammonia in the two systems in dissimilation nitrate reduction pathway the abundance of nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 were higher in poat indicating the capability of dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite was enhanced in poat the abundance of nitrite reductases ec 1 7 1 15 and ec 1 7 2 2 were lower in poat than in aat suggesting the capability of nitrite reduction to ammonium was reduced which might lead to accumulation of nitrite in poat fig 1d in denitrification pathway the abundance of nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 was demonstrated higher in poat than that in aat indicating the capabilities of nitrite reduction in poat in the denitrification pathway was enhanced which was probably due to the more suitable anoxic environment created by the uneven distribution of oxygen by po aeration the abundance of nitrogenase ec 1 18 6 1 involved in nitrogen fixation was observed higher in aat than in poat fig 4c previous study found that enzymes coding genes related to nitrification and denitrification were highly expressed in the oxic and anoxic zone respectively for treating high ammonia wastewater 61 3 4 taxonomic and functional analysis of mags to further identify the unclassified microbial species and their functional genes involved in nitrification and denitrification pathways mags were reconstructed from the high quality clean reads by using metagenomic binning tools twenty seven high quality mags were obtained with more than 90 completeness and less than 5 contamination the genomic features and taxonomic characterization of these mags were listed in table s 4 according to fig 6 12 of the 27 reconstructed mags were assigned to unclassified bacteria among them mag 6 affiliated to g f ns9 marine group was also the dominant mag in both poat and aat but with higher abundance in poat which were consistent with the analysis of microbial communities at the genus level fig 2b the mag 23 and mag 24 were affiliated to nitrosomonas in aob group and catalyzed the reaction of ammonia to nitrite while the abundance of mag 23 was 29 times higher in poat than in aat the mag 24 was slightly higher in aat the mag 22 affiliated to nitrococcus was included in nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 62 and catalyzed the reaction of nitrite to nitrate which was 20 times higher in aat than that in poat to further identify the unclassified microbial species and their functional genes involved in nitrification and denitrification pathways mags were reconstructed from the high quality clean reads by using metagenomic binning tools twenty seven high quality mags were obtained with more than 90 completeness and less than 5 contamination the genomic features and taxonomic characterization of these mags were listed in table s 4 according to fig 6 12 of the 27 reconstructed mags were assigned to unclassified bacteria among them mag 6 affiliated to g f ns9 marine group was also the dominant mag in both poat and aat but with higher abundance in poat which were consistent with the analysis of microbial communities at the genus level fig 2b the mag 23 and mag 24 were affiliated to nitrosomonas in aob group and catalyzed the reaction of ammonia to nitrite while the abundance of mag 23 was 29 times higher in poat than in aat the mag 24 was slightly higher in aat the mag 22 affiliated to nitrococcus was included in nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 62 and catalyzed the reaction of nitrite to nitrate which was 20 times higher in aat than that in poat genes associated with nitrification and denitrification on these mags were identified and quantified which was presented in fig 6 genes in these mags were highly involved in denitrification process narghi napab nirk nirs norbc and nosz narghi or napab encoding for nitrate reductase were identified in 10 of the mags and nirk or nirs for nitrite reductase norbc for nitric oxide reductase and nosz for nitrous oxide reductase were identified in 12 9 and 13 of the mags respectively the napab nirs norbc and nosz genes identified in mag 26 which were affiliated to thiogranum encoded for key enzymes in nitrate denitrification pathway the narghi napab and nirk nirs genes were both identified in 5 mags indicating nitrate denitrification was performed by species deduced from these mags the mag 6 was affiliated to g f ns9 marine group the most abundant genus in metagenomic sequencing analysis contained genes for nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases suggesting it could perform nitrate denitrification in nitrogen removal the narghi and nirk genes were deduced from mag 22 which was affiliated to nitrococcus indicating it could perform nitrite to nitrate oxidization and nitrate to nitric oxide reduction under the oxic and anoxic different environments respectively 63 the nirk or nirs genes were deduced from 7 of the 27 mags but no gene for nitrate reductase was identified suggesting nitrite denitrification was performed with species deduced from these mags among them mag 3 affiliated to g f chitinophagaceae contained genes encoding for nitrite nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductases but no nitrate reductase suggesting mag 3 was a typical nitrite denitrifier only norbc or nosz genes were identified in 8 of these mags suggesting these 8 mags might get involved in denitrification process and complete the denitrification process of other bacteria the mag 23 affiliated to nitrosomonas communis table s 4 contained all genes amocab and hao in nitrification and norbc genes for denitrification indicating this species was involved in autotrophic nitrification and denitrification different from mag 23 mag 24 affiliated to nitrosomonas nitrosa contained the hao gene encoding for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in nitrification and nirk gene for nitrite reductase in denitrification but had no amocab genes which might due to the deficiency of its genomic reads the results indicated that mag 24 could carry out autotrophic nitrite denitrification it was confirmed that nirk in nitrosomonas was expressed under the anoxic condition 61 64 these results suggested that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd was conducted by nitrosomonas mag 23 and mag 24 under low oxygen concentration conditions 65 66 the mag 23 affiliated to nitrosomonas communis table s 4 contained all genes amocab and hao in nitrification and norbc genes for denitrification indicating this species was involved in autotrophic nitrification and denitrification different from mag 23 mag 24 affiliated to nitrosomonas nitrosa contained the hao gene encoding for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in nitrification and nirk gene for nitrite reductase in denitrification but had no amocab genes which might due to the deficiency of its genomic reads the results indicated that mag 24 could carry out autotrophic nitrite denitrification it was confirmed that nirk in nitrosomonas was expressed under the anoxic

mechanism analysis of tn removal in two anoxic oxic systems in this study to investigate the effects of po supersede air on the treatment of mswi anaerobically digested leachate the csa system was converted to the i so system in one of the anoxic oxic systems operated in parallel in aa tank air was distributed more evenly with the submerged diffusion of higher flowrate air in contrast oxygen distributed by i so system was uneven creating more oxygen deficient zones because the flowrate of po was low consequently different aeration methods created special ecological niches which stimulated different species of microbes to growth in po tank the higher do concentration zones near the i so propellers were created which favored the growths of aob nitrosomonas nob nitrospira and denitrifying bacteria such as g f ns9 marine group g f chitinophagaceae thauera and limnobacter generally do was a key factor that affecting the metabolism of the nitrifying bacteria in nitrification process 67 previous study reported that the growth of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were enhanced by po aeration 9 in poat the abundance of nitrosomonas was 0 38 increased by 2 53 times from 0 15 of aat fig 5 the abundance of nob nitrospira nitrococcus nitrolancea and nitrospina in aat was 0 42 which was 1 68 times higher than that 0 25 in poat fig 5 indicating it was more favorable for ammonium to be oxidized completely to the endproduct of nitrate which was consistent with the less concentration of nitrite in aat fig 1d it was reported that the nob was more sensitive to the low do concentration of which 1 4 g o2 m3 the saturation coefficients by oxygen is significantly higher than that of aob 0 99 g o2 m3 68 we speculated that the zones of po tank away from the i so propellers existed oxygen deficient conditions which resulted in the abundance of nob declined but nitrospira was found to have a higher oxygen affinity and its abundance was increased under long term low do condition 0 37 mg l in additional the composition and dominant species of the nob community have been shifted in order to adapt the low do environment 69 hence the aob nob ratio of poat was 1 56 which was 4 11 times higher than 0 38 of aat resulting in the accumulation of no2 n fig 1d 70 nitrite accumulation stimulated nitrite denitrification in the anoxic environments of poat which was consistent with the higher abundance of nitrite reductases associated with denitrification in poat fig 3c the lower aob nob ratio in aat indicated that nob was robust with more complete aeration and agitation which led to more complete oxidation of no2 n and accumulation of no3 n compared to nitrate denitrification only 60 70 carbon source was consumed by nitrite denitrification 12 hence carbon was significantly saved with nitrite denitrification in addition with po aeration the abundance of nitrosomonas was higher which removed nitrogen through autotrophic denitrification without consumption of carbon source as the c n ratio was only 2 18 and the biodegradable carbon source was limited in anaerobically digested leachate po aeration created a more suitable environment for both autotrophic denitrification and nitrite denitrification which was a better option for tn removal in contrast the complete nitrification and denitrification pathway which were dominated in aat led to poor nitrogen removal 3 6 the recommend for the application of po aeration for a full scale demonstration based on the results of our pilot study and other previous studies 9 71 it is known that po instead air can significantly improve the abundance of functional bacteria and enhance the removals of nitrogen and organic material however the disadvantage of po aeration is also inevitable such as higher equipment investment and higher difficulty in controlling the do distribution which seriously limits the application of it in the full scale demonstration in general the do distribution was greatly affected by the aeration methods in this pilot study the i so system was used which can significantly improve the utilization efficiency of oxygen but it maybe led to oxygen deficient zones in this large aerobic tank it is recommended that the hybrid aeration system mixed aeration of air and pure oxygen should be used in large aerobic tanks which not only can maintain appropriate do concentration to remove oxygen deficient zones but also improve the mass exchange between zones the appropriate concentration of do is conducive to the efficient removal of nh4 n and cod furthermore the removal of total nitrogen can be promoted by supplying additional carbon source such as raw leachate and improving the snd proportions in the poat system other study confirmed that increasing the concentration of bioavailable carbon source can significantly improve the denitrification performance 4 the hybrid aeration system should be used in large aerobic tanks for controlling the appropriately low do concentration condition which might be conducive to the realization of snd generally the professional equipment is needed for improving the distribution of pure oxygen which usually have high price and account for most of capital investment and consumed energy for the capital investment of two full scale anox oxic systems the i so systems costed 800 000 cny 400 000 cny 2 while the air aeration system costed 696 000 cny for purchasing pumps and others equipment and needed additional place for setting pumps meanwhile the annual average operation cost of po aeration was 12 10 cny m3 while that of air aeration was 12 75 cny m3 the operation cost of po aeration was significantly impacted by the influent quantity of leachate obviously the capital investment and operation cost of po aeration need to be further reduced before the large scale adoption hence the hybrid aeration system used in large aerobic tanks should be studied for reducing the capital investment and operation cost furthermore as the higher oxygen transmission efficiency of pure oxygen a more accurate do sensor should be applied for efficiently controlling the do concentration in practice 4 conclusions in this study a full scale experimental investigation of the effects of po supersedes air on nitrogen removal and microbial communities for mswi leachate treatment during the experimental period better tn removal and better cod and nh4 n removal were obtained in poat and aat respectively compared to air aeration the special distribution of oxygen created by po aeration had a remarkable influence on microbial community structures and functions which enhanced autotrophic denitrification and nitrite denitrification resulting in better tn removal in poat with limited carbon source this study provides a significant

12926,electrocatalytic method is widely used in the treatment of antibiotic wastewater in this study an efficient and stable ruthenium agarose copper foam ru ag cf composite electrode was prepared by making full use of the properties of agarose and ru this electrode not only has a good catalytic effect but also has a high stability the morphology crystal structure and element valence of the composite electrodes were observed and analyzed by sem xrd and xps respectively the electrodes can achieve a degradation efficiency of 79 12 for a 10 mg l solution of doxycycline in 120 min the kinetics of the doxycycline degraded by ru ag cf electrode was found to be pseudo first order kinetics and was fitted to the langmuir hinshelwood model toxicity tests on doxycycline degradation solution using e coli showed that the toxicity of doxycycline degradation solution was basically negligible and had a certain degree of safety the products of doxycycline were analyzed by hydroxyl radical detection experiments using lc ms the degradation pathway of doxycycline was proposed the removal efficiency of doxycycline was basically unchanged after 10 consecutive applications the good degradation efficiency good reusability and good safety showed that the electrode is a promising material for practical applications in water treatment graphical abstract in this paper ru ag cf composite cathodes were prepared for the electrocatalytic degradation of doxycycline oh and h were generated on the electrode surface and a series of oxidation and reduction reactions were carried out on doxycycline and doxycycline underwent ring opening and cleavage reactions which finally decomposed doxycycline into tiny molecules unlabelled image keywords ruthenium agarose copper foam electrocatalysis doxycycline 1 introduction with the development of society and human technology large quantities of antibiotics were put into use especially in the medical agricultural and aquaculture industries at the same time large quantities of antibiotic wastewater were produced and discharged into natural water bodies 1 3 the presence of antibiotics could be detected in many natural water bodies such as surface water groundwater and lakes although the concentration of antibiotics was not very high the water solubility and persistence of antibiotics could lead to genetic mutation of microorganisms in the environment creating antibiotic resistant genes arg and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which became superbugs and were extremely harmful to the water environment 4 6 doxycycline was a typical antibiotic a semi synthetic tetracycline with similar properties to tetracycline used against gram positive gram negative and listeria monocytogenes and was an effective antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections 7 9 discharge of wastewater containing doxycycline into water bodies without proper treatment could affect the ecological balance in water and pose a serious threat to human health 10 at present the treatment of antibiotic wastewater was mainly through biological and physical methods the biological method was relatively mature simple to operate and had low operating costs but the biological treatment took longer to mineralize the antibiotics in the water effectively and covered a larger area with higher construction costs 11 14 the physical method of removing antibiotics from water was more effective but did not fundamentally achieve complete mineralization and degradation of antibiotic residues in water and required other methods to assist in degradation and external conditions had a greater impact on the degradation effect 15 17 research on electro catalytic treatment of wastewater has been ongoing in recent years and precious metals were considered to be the most efficient catalysts due to their low resistance and excellent catalytic activity in acidic media 18 20 the metal ruthenium ru was a catalyst that had recently received a lot of attention being only 4 of the price of platinum possessing a similar hydrogen bond strength to platinum 65 kcal mol 1 and having good corrosion resistance it was also more advantageous for the dissociation of water and the chemisorption of oh 21 23 agarose ag was the uncharged neutral component of agar and had a wide range of applications in areas such as tissue generation drug delivery and electrophoresis ag is a linear polysaccharide derived from marine algae hot solutions of ag form a three dimensional network of hydrogels upon cooling through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions 24 25 before the ag hot solution cools it is highly viscous and easily adheres to other materials after cooling the ag hot solution becomes solid and is very strong stable and electrically conductive making it an ideal adhesive material if used as an intermediate layer in a composite electrode it will help to improve the stability of the electrode however ag has a high temperature melting property which makes the practical application of ag somewhat limited 26 copper foam cf has been extensively investigated as a new type of electrode in this century compared to the corresponding solid metal materials it not only had the conductive properties of copper itself but also a large specific surface area good magnetic permeability low density and low cost in recent years it has been found that copper foam itself had certain electrocatalytic properties 27 28 in this paper the above three materials were combined and prepared into a ru ag cf composite electrode by impregnation and electrodeposition methods among them ag was used as an intermediate carrier for the composite electrode which adheres ru more closely to the electrode surface increasing the attachment sites of ru and improving the recycling rate of the electrode 29 copper foam as a substrate provided a larger specific surface area and could act synergistically with ru due to its inherent catalytic ability enhancing the potential of both materials to be applied independently to enhance the catalytic effect the prepared composite electrode was used for the degradation of doxycycline the whole experimental system was carried out at room temperature of 35 c and low current conditions completely avoiding the problem of hot melting of agarose the experimental scheme had the following characteristics 1 flexible operation with multiple functions such as air flotation flocculation and sterilization it could also be combined with other treatment processes 2 simple operation the electrochemical process could be carried out at room temperature and pressure and the parameters could be adjusted at any time 3 no or little pollution to the environment no need to add other substances reducing secondary pollution and low power consumption 4 good economy low cost of reaction equipment small footprint low construction operation and maintenance costs at present antibiotics are still not maturely applied mainly because of the high cost of electrodes and high disposal costs combining the above characteristics the aim of this study is to prepare an electrode material that is highly efficient highly reusable and capable of safely degrading doxycycline it is hoped that this will provide a new idea for the practical application of electrocatalysis 2 experiments 2 1 reagents and materials sulphuric acid hydrogen peroxide hydrochloric acid agarose sodium chloride ruthenium chloride and anhydrous sodium sulfate were used in pure chemicals of analytical grade ar without further purification all the above materials were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd copper foam 99 9 ppi 130 wuzhou sanhe new material technology co ltd and platinum flakes 99 99 were purchased from shanghai nonferrous metal smelting plant 2 2 preparation of ru ag cf composite electrodes the ag cf support electrode was prepared by impregnation the cf was ultrasonically washed in ultrapure water for 5 min to remove surface oil then the cf substrate was acid washed with dilute sulfuric acid at a concentration of 0 5 for 2 min to remove the surface oxide layer then rinsed with ultrapure water and finally the rinsed copper foam substrate was dried in a drying oven the ag gel was made by adding 1 g ag to 100 ml of ultrapure water and heating at 95 c for 1 h in a water bath the treated cf was cut to a size of 3 cm 1 cm and the cut cf substrate was dipped into ag gel with a concentration of 10 g l for 30 s with an impregnation area of 2 cm2 and then the electrodes were dried naturally loading of ruthenium was accomplished by electrodeposition using an ag cf support electrode as the cathode and a 1 cm2 sheet of platinum as the anode a mixture of 0 5 mol l na2so4 and 0 1 mmol l rucl3 standard solution was used as the electrodeposition solution with a deposition area of 2 cm2 for ag cf and an electrode spacing of 2 cm after electrodeposition at a constant current of 7 ma and 35 c for 10 min the ru ag cf electrode was obtained 2 3 characterization of composite electrodes morphological characterization of cf ag cf supported electrodes and ru ag cf composite electrodes were carried out using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem zeiss sigma hd g e r at magnifications of 1000 and 80 000 the electrodes were analyzed for crystal structure and determination of the physical phase by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance g e r the elemental composition and chemical valence of the electrode surface were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps rf 5301pc jpn the degraded solution was used to culture e coli and the toxicity of the degradation products was examined by the number of colonies in the medium tafel polarisation curves and ac impedance analysis were carried out with an electrochemical workstation parstat 3000a dx using a three electrode system with composite platinum and saturated glycerol electrodes as working counter and reference electrodes respectively 2 4 degradation of doxycycline the prepared ru ag cf composite electrode was connected to the negative terminal of dc power supply as the working electrode and the platinum sheet was connected to the positive terminal of power supply as the counter electrode and the electro catalytic degradation of doxycycline was carried out at 35 c by continuous magnetic stirring the initial concentration of doxycycline solution was 10 mg l and the electrolyte solution was 0 25 mol l nacl solution during this process the programmable dc power supply provided a constant current for the degradation and the heat collecting magnetic stirrer mainly provided a constant temperature and uniform stirring speed to ensure that the whole reaction system was carried out under homogeneous conditions thus the concentration error of the doxycycline solution could be reduced 3 ml of degradation wastewater was taken at 20 min intervals and doxycycline was quantified by uv vis spectrophotometry at 271 nm the degradation efficiency was calculated by the following equation η c 0 c c 0 100 where η is the removal rate of doxycycline c0 is the initial concentration of doxycycline mg l c is the final concentration of doxycycline mg l after screening the optimal experimental conditions by degradation of doxycycline the test was repeated under the optimal conditions hoping to examine the stability of this electrode in practical applications and to test the toxicity of the degradation products to examine the effect of the degradation products on microorganisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem and eds characterization of ru ag cf fig 1a show sem images of cf at 1000 and 80 000 cf was a macroscopic three dimensional structure rich in pores and with a large specific surface area high magnification images of cf showed that its surface was very smooth and flat which facilitates the uniform loading of other substances the sem image of cf ag fig 1b has a dense agarose coating on the surface compared to cf and the surface microstructure was spheres with a particle size of approximately 20 to 50 nm indicating that the agarose has been successfully loaded fig 1c show an sem image of the ru ag cf composite electrode after loading ru the surface of the electrode had many more particles of about 100 nm in size and uniform distribution and the specific surface area of the electrode had increased significantly the above indicates that ru had been successfully loaded onto the electrode surface in order to determine the elemental composition and distribution on the surface of the electrode the electrode was analyzed by sem eds scanning the composition and distribution of all elements in the composite electrode are shown in fig 1d the elemental distribution on the electrode surface was very homogeneous indicating that the catalysts ruthenium and agarose had been uniformly loaded onto the cf due to the low loading of ru the peak of ru in the plot was very low with an atomic percentage of only 0 02 which is in accordance with the actual loading 3 2 xrd analysis of ru ag cf electrodes in fig 2a three characteristic peaks were found at 43 58 50 72 and 74 4 which are characteristic of copper a faint characteristic peak appeared at 36 46 which was characteristic of cuo due to the low ru loading no significant characteristic peaks were found in the graph which was consistent with the results of the eds analysis further analysis will be required in the follow up this was consistent with the results of the eds analysis 3 3 xps analysis of ru ag cf electrodes to gain a more accurate understanding of the elemental valence states on the surface of the ru ag cf composite electrode x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the valence states of the three elements through the binding energy values in the c1s o1s and ru3p regions as shown in fig 2b the three c peaks were separated by xps spectroscopy including cc 284 7 ev coh 286 2 ev and co 288 2 ev 30 31 a narrow scan of c1s showed the largest peak area for the cc bond followed by coh and the smallest for co this also coincided with the content of the three functional groups on the electrode surface which were consistent with the molecular structure of agarose suggesting that the structure of agarose was not altered by loading ru on the ag cf electrode fig 2c showed narrow scan xps spectra of the o1s region containing o2 531 2 ev oc 531 9 ev oc 532 9 ev and the oc peak region being the largest and the oc peak region is relatively small which agreed with the analysis of the c1s region the presence of o2 on the other hand was likely to be due to the oxidation of ru in air to form ruo2 after the electrode had been prepared fig 2d showed a narrow xps scan of the ru3p region and the spectrum separated two peaks for ru0 362 2 ev ru4 464 1 ev 32 33 the large peak area of ru0 and the relatively small peak area of ru4 indicated that the catalyst was mainly present at the surface electrode in the form of ru0 with a small amount present in the form of ruo2 the above results showed that the metal ru had been successfully loaded onto the electrode surface 3 4 electrochemical analysis of ru ag cf electrodes fig 2e showed the nyquist plots for the pure cf electrode the ag cf matrix electrode and the ru ag cf composite electrode in 0 5 m na2so4 with a frequency range of 105 to 10 2 the decreasing radii of the nyquist curves of the three electrodes in fig 2 e in turn could be deduced from the fact that the composite electrode ru ag cf had the lowest surface charge transfer resistance 34 36 indicating that ag ru and cf had a synergistic effect and that the loading of ru and ag was conducive to lowering the cf surface charge transfer resistance in the hydrogen precipitation reaction fig 2f showed the tafel polarisation curves of the three electrodes in 0 5 m na2so4 at a scan rate of 0 167 mv s under the same conditions the more positive the hydrogen precipitation potential of the electrode the higher the hydrogen precipitation activity and the better the electrocatalytic performance 37 when log j was 4 0 ma cm 2 the corresponding spot levels of the three electrodes were 33 3 mv 23 8 mv and 114 7 mv respectively with little difference in the hydrogen precipitation potentials of cf and cf ag and the ru ag cf electrode was the first to shift positively demonstrating the best electrocatalytic performance of the ru ag cf composite electrode modified with ru 3 5 effect of experimental conditions on the performance of ru ag cf electrodes agarose acts as an intermediate layer that helps ru to adhere successfully to cf providing attachment points for ru and improves the cycling performance of the electrode different ag concentrations influence the subsequent ru loading and thus on the electrode performance in this experiment the effect of electrodes prepared from different concentrations of agarose on the degradation efficiency of doxycycline was investigated using a controlled variable approach the conditions determined in the degradation experiments were as follows degradation temperature of 35 c initial concentration of doxycycline of 10 mg l electrolyte of 0 25 mol l sodium chloride solution solution volume of 100 ml and degradation time of 2 h the experimental results are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3a the removal of doxycycline by the composite electrode was 70 45 71 08 72 96 75 39 and 74 78 at ag concentrations of 0 g l 1 g l 5 g l 10 g l and 20 mg l respectively at concentrations below 10 g l the degradation efficiency increased with increasing concentration of ag when the ag concentration was greater than 20 mg l the degradation efficiency decreased slightly instead the concentration of ag directly affects the thickness of ag on the cf surface if the concentration is too low the ag will not cover the cf surface sufficiently and will not provide enough catalytic sites for ru and the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode will be limited thus reducing the electrocatalytic efficiency if the concentration is too high the ag coating will be too thick and the electron transfer efficiency will be reduced which will also affect the electrocatalytic efficiency hence when the ag concentration was 10 g l the composite electrode had the best effect on the removal of doxycycline to highlight the importance of the intermediate layer ag the degradation efficiency of the cf ag cf ru cf ru ag cf electrodes on doxycycline was compared the results are shown in fig s1 by comparing the degradation performance of three electrodes cf ru cf and ru ag cf it was found that the electrocatalytic efficiency of the electrode was significantly reduced after loading ru on the cf surface alone relative to that of the ru ag cf electrode because the surface of cf is too smooth the electrode is subjected to current during the degradation process resulting in a large number of ru particles coming off the electrode surface which affects the degradation of doxycycline by the electrode therefore it is necessary to introduce ag as an intermediate layer according to the inset in fig 3a doxycycline solution degradation followed a pseudo first order kinetic equation and table s1 showed the fitted rate constants k for the degradation of doxycycline by electrodes with different agarose concentrations 38 the optimum agarose loading concentration of 0 10 g l was further determined by comparison loading the right amount of ru can improve the electrocatalytic efficiency of the electrode in this experiment the loading of ru was controlled by varying the concentration of rucl3 solution 0 01 mmol l 0 05 mmol l 0 1 mmol l 0 15 mmol l 0 2 mmol l the prepared ru ag cf electrodes were subjected to degradation experiments under the above conditions as shown in fig 3b the degradation rates of doxycycline by the composite electrodes prepared with different rucl3 concentrations were 75 75 5 78 07 73 7 and 72 6 respectively the degradation efficiency showed an increasing trend at concentrations less than 0 1 mmol l at concentrations greater than 0 1 mmol l the degradation efficiency decreased instead ru as a catalytic layer if the ru deposition concentration is too low it leaves the electrode surface with insufficient catalyst thus reducing the electrocatalytic efficiency if the deposition concentration is too high the catalytic layer is deposited too thickly and may produce severe agglomeration which affects the degradation efficiency therefore the loading amount should not be too high and the optimum concentration of rucl3 solution was 0 1 mmol l according to the inset in fig 3b it was shown that the degradation process follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics at different ru loading concentrations of the composite electrode table s2 showed the fitted rate constants k for the degradation of doxycycline further demonstrating that the optimum loading concentration of ru was 0 10 mmol l larger ru loadings were not better and that concentrations above a certain level inhibit the catalytic reaction in order to investigate the effect of ru deposition time on the electrode performance the electrodeposition time was varied for 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 25 min and 30 min while other experimental conditions remained unchanged the results were shown in fig 3c as could be seen from fig 3c the degradation efficiency of doxycycline was 74 24 78 07 72 99 72 67 72 61 and 72 27 at different deposition time conditions when the deposition time of ru was 5 min the loading of ru was too small and the degradation efficiency of doxycycline was very low the degradation efficiency of doxycycline reached a maximum after the deposition time was increased to 10 min if the deposition time continues to be prolonged it makes the ru loading too thick which affects the electron transfer and leads to a decrease in the degradation rate of doxycycline therefore the optimum deposition time was 10 min in order to investigate the effect of deposition currents with different ru on the performance of the prepared electrodes the current intensities for depositing ru were set to 1 ma 3 ma 5 ma 7 ma and 10 ma respectively while other experimental conditions were kept constant the prepared electrodes were used to degrade the doxycycline solution to examine the change in degradation efficiency as can be seen from fig 3d the degradation of the prepared electrodes to the doxycycline solution was 73 09 74 09 78 07 79 12 and 74 09 when the deposition currents of ru were 1 ma 3 ma 5 ma 7 ma and 10 ma respectively from the variation of the degradation rate it can be found that when the ru deposition current was between 1 ma and 7 ma the degradation efficiency of the prepared electrodes for doxycycline increased significantly while when the deposition current was greater than 7 ma the electron transfer rate was too fast resulting in non uniform ru deposition and the degradation rate decreased instead therefore it could be concluded that a ru deposition current of 7 ma was the optimum condition for the preparation of composite electrodes the current strength during degradation directly determines the degradation efficiency of doxycycline by the composite electrode in this experiment the effect of different degradation currents on the degradation rate of doxycycline was investigated in this experiment the degradation currents were 1 ma 2 ma 3 ma 4 ma 5 ma 7 5 ma and 10 ma under the conditions that other parameters remained unchanged and the results were shown in fig 3e it was clear from fig 3e that the degradation rates of doxycycline for degradation currents from 1 ma to 10 ma were 49 51 55 59 60 14 68 07 79 12 79 30 and 79 69 respectively during the first 60 min of the reaction the degradation rate of doxycycline at the composite electrode increased gradually with increasing current intensity after 60 min of the reaction when the current was less than 5 ma the degradation rate of doxycycline by the composite electrode increased significantly with the increase of current intensity however when the degradation current was higher than 5 ma the increase of degradation efficiency was not obvious with the increase of current indicating that the maximum degradation efficiency had been reached the above results indicate that current is an important factor affecting electrocatalytic efficiency the main reason why the current decreases in the experiment were that if the current is too high it will make the catalyst on the surface of the electrode fall off and when the catalyst falls off to a certain extent the growth of the degradation efficiency will also become slow therefore 5 ma was chosen as the degradation current to achieve the best catalytic efficiency based on the degradation current and the voltage displayed on the potentiostat it can be roughly estimated that the power consumption during the entire degradation process is approximately 2 w in the electrochemical catalysis of doxycycline the initial ph of the reaction solution has an important influence on the electrochemical reaction process especially on the production process of the active substance and therefore ultimately on the degradation efficiency of doxorubicin hydrochloride in order to investigate the variation in the degradation effect of doxycycline hydrochloride at different ph conditions at the composite electrode the ph of the reaction solution was adjusted with sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide the degradation efficiency is shown in fig 3f as can be seen from fig 3f the degradation efficiency gradually increased at ph values of 1 2 and 3 of the solution with degradation efficiencies of 69 62 74 34 and 79 23 respectively when the ph of the solution was 4 5 6 and 7 the degradation efficiency was 78 82 75 98 72 91 and 70 74 respectively and the degradation efficiency decreased with increasing ph it indicates that adding a small amount of acid to the solution helps to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode if the ph is too low it may corrode the electrode and lead to a decrease in catalytic efficiency and if the ph is increased the production of ho will be inhibited therefore the optimum ph of the solution is 3 in electrochemical reactions electrolytes have a conductive effect in the electrocatalytic process the electrolyte directly influences the electron transfer in the whole system which in turn has a direct impact on the generation of free radicals and therefore the concentration of electrolyte directly affects the degradation of doxycycline this paper therefore investigates the effect of electrolyte concentration on the degradation efficiency of the solution during electrocatalytic degradation and optimizes the optimum electrolyte concentration all other conditions being equal the degradation of doxycycline solutions containing different electrolyte concentrations was carried out the results are shown in fig 3g from fig 3g the degradation efficiency was found to be 25 95 37 25 47 01 63 51 79 01 79 12 and 82 43 for electrolyte concentrations of 0 05 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 and 1 00 mol l respectively at electrolyte concentrations less than 0 4 mol l the degradation efficiency increased greatly with increasing electrolyte concentration when the concentration was increased to 0 50 mol l the degradation efficiency only increased by 0 11 when the concentration was increased to 1 00 mol l the degradation efficiency was only increased by 2 42 therefore at concentrations less than 0 4 mol l the increase in electrolyte conductivity increases the solution conductivity and promotes electrocatalytic reactions when the concentration continues to be greater the electrocatalytic efficiency does not increase as the electron transfer efficiency has reached its maximum therefore the optimal concentration of electrolyte for the degradation reaction is 0 4 mol l in order to verify the reusability of the ru ag cf electrode the electrode was subjected to 10 cycles from fig 3h the degradation efficiency of the electrode remained essentially the same after 10 cycles and the ru ag cf electrode did not shed catalyst due to too many cycles this further suggested that agarose as an intermediate layer contributed to the stability of the catalyst loading 3 6 toxicity test fig 4 and table s3 show pictures and inhibition rates of e coli colonies on agar plates incubated with different infusion solutions fig 4a shows the agar plate e coli medium incubated with ultrapure water and fig 4 b c d e f shows the microbial medium incubated with different degradation time periods 0 min 20 min 40 min 60 min 120 min of doxycycline degradation solution respectively as shown in table s3 the inhibition rates of the doxycycline degradation solution against e coli for the five time periods were 100 16 13 4 84 2 42 and 7 26 respectively implying that the toxicity of the doxycycline solution after 120 min of degradation was essentially negligible indicating that the ru ag cf electrode is safe for application in water treatment 3 7 hydroxyl radical tests in order to investigate the reaction mechanism of ru ag cf electrode in the electro catalytic degradation process coumarone was chosen as the hydroxyl radical trapping agent for the fluorescence spectroscopy test as coumarone captures oh to form 7 hydroxycoumarin the fluorescence intensity of 7 hydroxycoumarin was tested to reflect the concentration of oh fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out with a molecular fluorescence photometer on solutions with different electrocatalytic times as shown in fig 5a the longer the electrocatalytic time the stronger the fluorescence intensity indicating that the oh content gradually increased proving that oh was generated during the electrocatalytic process and further speculating that h was generated along with it although the platinum electrode is active and does not participate directly in the generation of oh chemisorbed oh is generated around the platinum electrode 39 as oh and h were less stable they will carry out redox reactions with doxycycline molecules which further demonstrates the degradation mechanism of electrocatalysis by composite electrodes 3 8 lc ms analysis to further investigate the electrocatalytic degradation process lc ms experiments were carried out fig 5b shows the mass spectra of the doxycycline degradation wastewater at different time periods the figure showed that a series of compounds were produced on the way to degradation and the degradation pathway of doxycycline was inferred based on the m z of the compounds and the predicted results were shown in fig 5c it was hypothesized that the electrocatalytic degradation of doxycycline could be divided into 2 pathways ring opening and functional group cleavage reactions both pathways involved the reduction or oxidation of doxycycline by h and oh ions leading to the cleavage of doxycycline 40 41 pathway 1 prioritized the removal of the functional group prior to ring opening cleavage while pathway 2 opened the ring prior to cleavage of the functional group in the diagram doxycycline dc was dehydroxylated and deaminoated by hydroxyl oxidation and de carbonylated by the introduction of h to give dc1 m z 422 42 dc could also be de aminoated and ring opened by h to give dc2 m z 432 dc1 was sequentially de carboxylated by oh and de dimethylated by h to give dc3 m z 378 and dc5 m z 294 dc5 continued with the progressive removal of functional groups by h and oh eventually giving dc11 m z 149 dc2 continued with the ring opening reaction and progressive dedimethylamino deaminoization dehydroxylation and demethylation to give the common product dc11 with pathway 1 d11 continued to cleave to small molecule compounds m z 150 d12 m z 145 dc13 m z 118 dc14 m z 106 which eventually decomposed to h2o and co2 4 conclusion in this paper ru ag cf composite electrodes with high specific surface area low charge transfer resistance excellent electrocatalytic activity and high stability were successfully prepared and applied to the electrocatalytic degradation of doxycycline the electrodes can achieve a degradation efficiency of 79 01 for a 10 mg l solution of doxycycline the ru ag cf composite electrode showed excellent stability and catalytic activity after 10 cycles in the toxicity test the degradation solution of doxycycline inhibited e coli at 7 26 after 2 h of degradation indicating that the composite electrode degraded the doxycycline solution very thoroughly and with high safety in the hydroxyl radical trapping experiments the presence of oh was tested presumably accompanied by the production of h and the degradation mechanism was broadly inferred the structure of the degradation of doxycycline and the degradation pathway of doxycycline were analyzed by lc ms experiments the results showed that doxycycline could be effectively degraded to small molecules m z 150 by the electrocatalytic process of the composite electrode through the above conclusions it is proved that the electrode materials prepared in this study have the characteristics of high catalytic efficiency reusability and safety of degradation products therefore this study can provide some technical references for the application of electrocatalysis

12926,electrocatalytic method is widely used in the treatment of antibiotic wastewater in this study an efficient and stable ruthenium agarose copper foam ru ag cf composite electrode was prepared by making full use of the properties of agarose and ru this electrode not only has a good catalytic effect but also has a high stability the morphology crystal structure and element valence of the composite electrodes were observed and analyzed by sem xrd and xps respectively the electrodes can achieve a degradation efficiency of 79 12 for a 10 mg l solution of doxycycline in 120 min the kinetics of the doxycycline degraded by ru ag cf electrode was found to be pseudo first order kinetics and was fitted to the langmuir hinshelwood model toxicity tests on doxycycline degradation solution using e coli showed that the toxicity of doxycycline degradation solution was basically negligible and had a certain degree of safety the products of doxycycline were analyzed by hydroxyl radical detection experiments using lc ms the degradation pathway of doxycycline was proposed the removal efficiency of doxycycline was basically unchanged after 10 consecutive applications the good degradation efficiency good reusability and good safety showed that the electrode is a promising material for practical applications in water treatment graphical abstract in this paper ru ag cf composite cathodes were prepared for the electrocatalytic degradation of doxycycline oh and h were generated on the electrode surface and a series of oxidation and reduction reactions were carried out on doxycycline and doxycycline underwent ring opening and cleavage reactions which finally decomposed doxycycline into tiny molecules unlabelled image keywords ruthenium agarose copper foam electrocatalysis doxycycline 1 introduction with the development of society and human technology large quantities of antibiotics were put into use especially in the medical agricultural and aquaculture industries at the same time large quantities of antibiotic wastewater were produced and discharged into natural water bodies 1 3 the presence of antibiotics could be detected in many natural water bodies such as surface water groundwater and lakes although the concentration of antibiotics was not very high the water solubility and persistence of antibiotics could lead to genetic mutation of microorganisms in the environment creating antibiotic resistant genes arg and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which became superbugs and were extremely harmful to the water environment 4 6 doxycycline was a typical antibiotic a semi synthetic tetracycline with similar properties to tetracycline used against gram positive gram negative and listeria monocytogenes and was an effective antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections 7 9 discharge of wastewater containing doxycycline into water bodies without proper treatment could affect the ecological balance in water and pose a serious threat to human health 10 at present the treatment of antibiotic wastewater was mainly through biological and physical methods the biological method was relatively mature simple to operate and had low operating costs but the biological treatment took longer to mineralize the antibiotics in the water effectively and covered a larger area with higher construction costs 11 14 the physical method of removing antibiotics from water was more effective but did not fundamentally achieve complete mineralization and degradation of antibiotic residues in water and required other methods to assist in degradation and external conditions had a greater impact on the degradation effect 15 17 research on electro catalytic treatment of wastewater has been ongoing in recent years and precious metals were considered to be the most efficient catalysts due to their low resistance and excellent catalytic activity in acidic media 18 20 the metal ruthenium ru was a catalyst that had recently received a lot of attention being only 4 of the price of platinum possessing a similar hydrogen bond strength to platinum 65 kcal mol 1 and having good corrosion resistance it was also more advantageous for the dissociation of water and the chemisorption of oh 21 23 agarose ag was the uncharged neutral component of agar and had a wide range of applications in areas such as tissue generation drug delivery and electrophoresis ag is a linear polysaccharide derived from marine algae hot solutions of ag form a three dimensional network of hydrogels upon cooling through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions 24 25 before the ag hot solution cools it is highly viscous and easily adheres to other materials after cooling the ag hot solution becomes solid and is very strong stable and electrically conductive making it an ideal adhesive material if used as an intermediate layer in a composite electrode it will help to improve the stability of the electrode however ag has a high temperature melting property which makes the practical application of ag somewhat limited 26 copper foam cf has been extensively investigated as a new type of electrode in this century compared to the corresponding solid metal materials it not only had the conductive properties of copper itself but also a large specific surface area good magnetic permeability low density and low cost in recent years it has been found that copper foam itself had certain electrocatalytic properties 27 28 in this paper the above three materials were combined and prepared into a ru ag cf composite electrode by impregnation and electrodeposition methods among them ag was used as an intermediate carrier for the composite electrode which adheres ru more closely to the electrode surface increasing the attachment sites of ru and improving the recycling rate of the electrode 29 copper foam as a substrate provided a larger specific surface area and could act synergistically with ru due to its inherent catalytic ability enhancing the potential of both materials to be applied independently to enhance the catalytic effect the prepared composite electrode was used for the degradation of doxycycline the whole experimental system was carried out at room temperature of 35 c and low current conditions completely avoiding the problem of hot melting of agarose the experimental scheme had the following characteristics 1 flexible operation with multiple functions such as air flotation flocculation and sterilization it could also be combined with other treatment processes 2 simple operation the electrochemical process could be carried out at room temperature and pressure and the parameters could be adjusted at any time 3 no or little pollution to the environment no need to add other substances reducing secondary pollution and low power consumption 4 good economy low cost of reaction equipment small footprint low construction operation and maintenance costs at present antibiotics are still not maturely applied mainly because of the high cost of electrodes and high disposal costs combining the above characteristics the aim of this study is to prepare an electrode material that is highly efficient highly reusable and capable of safely degrading doxycycline it is hoped that this will provide a new idea for the practical application of electrocatalysis 2 experiments 2 1 reagents and materials sulphuric acid hydrogen peroxide hydrochloric acid agarose sodium chloride ruthenium chloride and anhydrous sodium sulfate were used in pure chemicals of analytical grade ar without further purification all the above materials were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd copper foam 99 9 ppi 130 wuzhou sanhe new material technology co ltd and platinum flakes 99 99 were purchased from shanghai nonferrous metal smelting plant 2 2 preparation of ru ag cf composite electrodes the ag cf support electrode was prepared by impregnation the cf was ultrasonically washed in ultrapure water for 5 min to remove surface oil then the cf substrate was acid washed with dilute sulfuric acid at a concentration of 0 5 for 2 min to remove the surface oxide layer then rinsed with ultrapure water and finally the rinsed copper foam substrate was dried in a drying oven the ag gel was made by adding 1 g ag to 100 ml of ultrapure water and heating at 95 c for 1 h in a water bath the treated cf was cut to a size of 3 cm 1 cm and the cut cf substrate was dipped into ag gel with a concentration of 10 g l for 30 s with an impregnation area of 2 cm2 and then the electrodes were dried naturally loading of ruthenium was accomplished by electrodeposition using an ag cf support electrode as the cathode and a 1 cm2 sheet of platinum as the anode a mixture of 0 5 mol l na2so4 and 0 1 mmol l rucl3 standard solution was used as the electrodeposition solution with a deposition area of 2 cm2 for ag cf and an electrode spacing of 2 cm after electrodeposition at a constant current of 7 ma and 35 c for 10 min the ru ag cf electrode was obtained 2 3 characterization of composite electrodes morphological characterization of cf ag cf supported electrodes and ru ag cf composite electrodes were carried out using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem zeiss sigma hd g e r at magnifications of 1000 and 80 000 the electrodes were analyzed for crystal structure and determination of the physical phase by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance g e r the elemental composition and chemical valence of the electrode surface were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps rf 5301pc jpn the degraded solution was used to culture e coli and the toxicity of the degradation products was examined by the number of colonies in the medium tafel polarisation curves and ac impedance analysis were carried out with an electrochemical workstation parstat 3000a dx using a three electrode system with composite platinum and saturated glycerol electrodes as working counter and reference electrodes respectively 2 4 degradation of doxycycline the prepared ru ag cf composite electrode was connected to the negative terminal of dc power supply as the working electrode and the platinum sheet was connected to the positive terminal of power supply as the counter electrode and the electro catalytic degradation of doxycycline was carried out at 35 c by continuous magnetic stirring the initial concentration of doxycycline solution was 10 mg l and the electrolyte solution was 0 25 mol l nacl solution during this process the programmable dc power supply provided a constant current for the degradation and the heat collecting magnetic stirrer mainly provided a constant temperature and uniform stirring speed to ensure that the whole reaction system was carried out under homogeneous conditions thus the concentration error of the doxycycline solution could be reduced 3 ml of degradation wastewater was taken at 20 min intervals and doxycycline was quantified by uv vis spectrophotometry at 271 nm the degradation efficiency was calculated by the following equation η c 0 c c 0 100 where η is the removal rate of doxycycline c0 is the initial concentration of doxycycline mg l c is the final concentration of doxycycline mg l after screening the optimal experimental conditions by degradation of doxycycline the test was repeated under the optimal conditions hoping to examine the stability of this electrode in practical applications and to test the toxicity of the degradation products to examine the effect of the degradation products on microorganisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem and eds characterization of ru ag cf fig 1a show sem images of cf at 1000 and 80 000 cf was a macroscopic three dimensional structure rich in pores and with a large specific surface area high magnification images of cf showed that its surface was very smooth and flat which facilitates the uniform loading of other substances the sem image of cf ag fig 1b has a dense agarose coating on the surface compared to cf and the surface microstructure was spheres with a particle size of approximately 20 to 50 nm indicating that the agarose has been successfully loaded fig 1c show an sem image of the ru ag cf composite electrode after loading ru the surface of the electrode had many more particles of about 100 nm in size and uniform distribution and the specific surface area of the electrode had increased significantly the above indicates that ru had been successfully loaded onto the electrode surface in order to determine the elemental composition and distribution on the surface of the electrode the electrode was analyzed by sem eds scanning the composition and distribution of all elements in the composite electrode are shown in fig 1d the elemental distribution on the electrode surface was very homogeneous indicating that the catalysts ruthenium and agarose had been uniformly loaded onto the cf due to the low loading of ru the peak of ru in the plot was very low with an atomic percentage of only 0 02 which is in accordance with the actual loading 3 2 xrd analysis of ru ag cf electrodes in fig 2a three characteristic peaks were found at 43 58 50 72 and 74 4 which are characteristic of copper a faint characteristic peak appeared at 36 46 which was characteristic of cuo due to the low ru loading no significant characteristic peaks were found in the graph which was consistent with the results of the eds analysis further analysis will be required in the follow up this was consistent with the results of the eds analysis 3 3 xps analysis of ru ag cf electrodes to gain a more accurate understanding of the elemental valence states on the surface of the ru ag cf composite electrode x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the valence states of the three elements through the binding energy values in the c1s o1s and ru3p regions as shown in fig 2b the three c peaks were separated by xps spectroscopy including cc 284 7 ev coh 286 2 ev and co 288 2 ev 30 31 a narrow scan of c1s showed the largest peak area for the cc bond followed by coh and the smallest for co this also coincided with the content of the three functional groups on the electrode surface which were consistent with the molecular structure of agarose suggesting that the structure of agarose was not altered by loading ru on the ag cf electrode fig 2c showed narrow scan xps spectra of the o1s region containing o2 531 2 ev oc 531 9 ev oc 532 9 ev and the oc peak region being the largest and the oc peak region is relatively small which agreed with the analysis of the c1s region the presence of o2 on the other hand was likely to be due to the oxidation of ru in air to form ruo2 after the electrode had been prepared fig 2d showed a narrow xps scan of the ru3p region and the spectrum separated two peaks for ru0 362 2 ev ru4 464 1 ev 32 33 the large peak area of ru0 and the relatively small peak area of ru4 indicated that the catalyst was mainly present at the surface electrode in the form of ru0 with a small amount present in the form of ruo2 the above results showed that the metal ru had been successfully loaded onto the electrode surface 3 4 electrochemical analysis of ru ag cf electrodes fig 2e showed the nyquist plots for the pure cf electrode the ag cf matrix electrode and the ru ag cf composite electrode in 0 5 m na2so4 with a frequency range of 105 to 10 2 the decreasing radii of the nyquist curves of the three electrodes in fig 2 e in turn could be deduced from the fact that the composite electrode ru ag cf had the lowest surface charge transfer resistance 34 36 indicating that ag ru and cf had a synergistic effect and that the loading of ru and ag was conducive to lowering the cf surface charge transfer resistance in the hydrogen precipitation reaction fig 2f showed the tafel polarisation curves of the three electrodes in 0 5 m na2so4 at a scan rate of 0 167 mv s under the same conditions the more positive the hydrogen precipitation potential of the electrode the higher the hydrogen precipitation activity and the better the electrocatalytic performance 37 when log j was 4 0 ma cm 2 the corresponding spot levels of the three electrodes were 33 3 mv 23 8 mv and 114 7 mv respectively with little difference in the hydrogen precipitation potentials of cf and cf ag and the ru ag cf electrode was the first to shift positively demonstrating the best electrocatalytic performance of the ru ag cf composite electrode modified with ru 3 5 effect of experimental conditions on the performance of ru ag cf electrodes agarose acts as an intermediate layer that helps ru to adhere successfully to cf providing attachment points for ru and improves the cycling performance of the electrode different ag concentrations influence the subsequent ru loading and thus on the electrode performance in this experiment the effect of electrodes prepared from different concentrations of agarose on the degradation efficiency of doxycycline was investigated using a controlled variable approach the conditions determined in the degradation experiments were as follows degradation temperature of 35 c initial concentration of doxycycline of 10 mg l electrolyte of 0 25 mol l sodium chloride solution solution volume of 100 ml and degradation time of 2 h the experimental results are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3a the removal of doxycycline by the composite electrode was 70 45 71 08 72 96 75 39 and 74 78 at ag concentrations of 0 g l 1 g l 5 g l 10 g l and 20 mg l respectively at concentrations below 10 g l the degradation efficiency increased with increasing concentration of ag when the ag concentration was greater than 20 mg l the degradation efficiency decreased slightly instead the concentration of ag directly affects the thickness of ag on the cf surface if the concentration is too low the ag will not cover the cf surface sufficiently and will not provide enough catalytic sites for ru and the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode will be limited thus reducing the electrocatalytic efficiency if the concentration is too high the ag coating will be too thick and the electron transfer efficiency will be reduced which will also affect the electrocatalytic efficiency hence when the ag concentration was 10 g l the composite electrode had the best effect on the removal of doxycycline to highlight the importance of the intermediate layer ag the degradation efficiency of the cf ag cf ru cf ru ag cf electrodes on doxycycline was compared the results are shown in fig s1 by comparing the degradation performance of three electrodes cf ru cf and ru ag cf it was found that the electrocatalytic efficiency of the electrode was significantly reduced after loading ru on the cf surface alone relative to that of the ru ag cf electrode because the surface of cf is too smooth the electrode is subjected to current during the degradation process resulting in a large number of ru particles coming off the electrode surface which affects the degradation of doxycycline by the electrode therefore it is necessary to introduce ag as an intermediate layer according to the inset in fig 3a doxycycline solution degradation followed a pseudo first order kinetic equation and table s1 showed the fitted rate constants k for the degradation of doxycycline by electrodes with different agarose concentrations 38 the optimum agarose loading concentration of 0 10 g l was further determined by comparison loading the right amount of ru can improve the electrocatalytic efficiency of the electrode in this experiment the loading of ru was controlled by varying the concentration of rucl3 solution 0 01 mmol l 0 05 mmol l 0 1 mmol l 0 15 mmol l 0 2 mmol l the prepared ru ag cf electrodes were subjected to degradation experiments under the above conditions as shown in fig 3b the degradation rates of doxycycline by the composite electrodes prepared with different rucl3 concentrations were 75 75 5 78 07 73 7 and 72 6 respectively the degradation efficiency showed an increasing trend at concentrations less than 0 1 mmol l at concentrations greater than 0 1 mmol l the degradation efficiency decreased instead ru as a catalytic layer if the ru deposition concentration is too low it leaves the electrode surface with insufficient catalyst thus reducing the electrocatalytic efficiency if the deposition concentration is too high the catalytic layer is deposited too thickly and may produce severe agglomeration which affects the degradation efficiency therefore the loading amount should not be too high and the optimum concentration of rucl3 solution was 0 1 mmol l according to the inset in fig 3b it was shown that the degradation process follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics at different ru loading concentrations of the composite electrode table s2 showed the fitted rate constants k for the degradation of doxycycline further demonstrating that the optimum loading concentration of ru was 0 10 mmol l larger ru loadings were not better and that concentrations above a certain level inhibit the catalytic reaction in order to investigate the effect of ru deposition time on the electrode performance the electrodeposition time was varied for 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 25 min and 30 min while other experimental conditions remained unchanged the results were shown in fig 3c as could be seen from fig 3c the degradation efficiency of doxycycline was 74 24 78 07 72 99 72 67 72 61 and 72 27 at different deposition time conditions when the deposition time of ru was 5 min the loading of ru was too small and the degradation efficiency of doxycycline was very low the degradation efficiency of doxycycline reached a maximum after the deposition time was increased to 10 min if the deposition time continues to be prolonged it makes the ru loading too thick which affects the electron transfer and leads to a decrease in the degradation rate of doxycycline therefore the optimum deposition time was 10 min in order to investigate the effect of deposition currents with different ru on the performance of the prepared electrodes the current intensities for depositing ru were set to 1 ma 3 ma 5 ma 7 ma and 10 ma respectively while other experimental conditions were kept constant the prepared electrodes were used to degrade the doxycycline solution to examine the change in degradation efficiency as can be seen from fig 3d the degradation of the prepared electrodes to the doxycycline solution was 73 09 74 09 78 07 79 12 and 74 09 when the deposition currents of ru were 1 ma 3 ma 5 ma 7 ma and 10 ma respectively from the variation of the degradation rate it can be found that when the ru deposition current was between 1 ma and 7 ma the degradation efficiency of the prepared electrodes for doxycycline increased significantly while when the deposition current was greater than 7 ma the electron transfer rate was too fast resulting in non uniform ru deposition and the degradation rate decreased instead therefore it could be concluded that a ru deposition current of 7 ma was the optimum condition for the preparation of composite electrodes the current strength during degradation directly determines the degradation efficiency of doxycycline by the composite electrode in this experiment the effect of different degradation currents on the degradation rate of doxycycline was investigated in this experiment the degradation currents were 1 ma 2 ma 3 ma 4 ma 5 ma 7 5 ma and 10 ma under the conditions that other parameters remained unchanged and the results were shown in fig 3e it was clear from fig 3e that the degradation rates of doxycycline for degradation currents from 1 ma to 10 ma were 49 51 55 59 60 14 68 07 79 12 79 30 and 79 69 respectively during the first 60 min of the reaction the degradation rate of doxycycline at the composite electrode increased gradually with increasing current intensity after 60 min of the reaction when the current was less than 5 ma the degradation rate of doxycycline by the composite electrode increased significantly with the increase of current intensity however when the degradation current was higher than 5 ma the increase of degradation efficiency was not obvious with the increase of current indicating that the maximum degradation efficiency had been reached the above results indicate that current is an important factor affecting electrocatalytic efficiency the main reason why the current decreases in the experiment were that if the current is too high it will make the catalyst on the surface of the electrode fall off and when the catalyst falls off to a certain extent the growth of the degradation efficiency will also become slow therefore 5 ma was chosen as the degradation current to achieve the best catalytic efficiency based on the degradation current and the voltage displayed on the potentiostat it can be roughly estimated that the power consumption during the entire degradation process is approximately 2 w in the electrochemical catalysis of doxycycline the initial ph of the reaction solution has an important influence on the electrochemical reaction process especially on the production process of the active substance and therefore ultimately on the degradation efficiency of doxorubicin hydrochloride in order to investigate the variation in the degradation effect of doxycycline hydrochloride at different ph conditions at the composite electrode the ph of the reaction solution was adjusted with sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide the degradation efficiency is shown in fig 3f as can be seen from fig 3f the degradation efficiency gradually increased at ph values of 1 2 and 3 of the solution with degradation efficiencies of 69 62 74 34 and 79 23 respectively when the ph of the solution was 4 5 6 and 7 the degradation efficiency was 78 82 75 98 72 91 and 70 74 respectively and the degradation efficiency decreased with increasing ph it indicates that adding a small amount of acid to the solution helps to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode if the ph is too low it may corrode the electrode and lead to a decrease in catalytic efficiency and if the ph is increased the production of ho will be inhibited therefore the optimum ph of the solution is 3 in electrochemical reactions electrolytes have a conductive effect in the electrocatalytic process the electrolyte directly influences the electron transfer in the whole system which in turn has a direct impact on the generation of free radicals and therefore the concentration of electrolyte directly affects the degradation of doxycycline this paper therefore investigates the effect of electrolyte concentration on the degradation efficiency of the solution during electrocatalytic degradation and optimizes the optimum electrolyte concentration all other conditions being equal the degradation of doxycycline solutions containing different electrolyte concentrations was carried out the results are shown in fig 3g from fig 3g the degradation efficiency was found to be 25 95 37 25 47 01 63 51 79 01 79 12 and 82 43 for electrolyte concentrations of 0 05 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 and 1 00 mol l respectively at electrolyte concentrations less than 0 4 mol l the degradation efficiency increased greatly with increasing electrolyte concentration when the concentration was increased to 0 50 mol l the degradation efficiency only increased by 0 11 when the concentration was increased to 1 00 mol l the degradation efficiency was only increased by 2 42 therefore at concentrations less than 0 4 mol l the increase in electrolyte conductivity increases the solution conductivity and promotes electrocatalytic reactions when the concentration continues to be greater the electrocatalytic efficiency does not increase as the electron transfer efficiency has reached its maximum therefore the optimal concentration of electrolyte for the degradation reaction is 0 4 mol l in order to verify the reusability of the ru ag cf electrode the electrode was subjected to 10 cycles from fig 3h the degradation efficiency of the electrode remained essentially the same after 10 cycles and the ru ag cf electrode did not shed catalyst due to too many cycles this further suggested that agarose as an intermediate layer contributed to the stability of the catalyst loading 3 6 toxicity test fig 4 and table s3 show pictures and inhibition rates of e coli colonies on agar plates incubated with different infusion solutions fig 4a shows the agar plate e coli medium incubated with ultrapure water and fig 4 b c d e f shows the microbial medium incubated with different degradation time periods 0 min 20 min 40 min 60 min 120 min of doxycycline degradation solution respectively as shown in table s3 the inhibition rates of the doxycycline degradation solution against e coli for the five time periods were 100 16 13 4 84 2 42 and 7 26 respectively implying that the toxicity of the doxycycline solution after 120 min of degradation was essentially negligible indicating that the ru ag cf electrode is safe for application in water treatment 3 7 hydroxyl radical tests in order to investigate the reaction mechanism of ru ag cf electrode in the electro catalytic degradation process coumarone was chosen as the hydroxyl radical trapping agent for the fluorescence spectroscopy test as coumarone captures oh to form 7 hydroxycoumarin the fluorescence intensity of 7 hydroxycoumarin was tested to reflect the concentration of oh fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out with a molecular fluorescence photometer on solutions with different electrocatalytic times as shown in fig 5a the longer the electrocatalytic time the stronger the fluorescence intensity indicating that the oh content gradually increased proving that oh was generated during the electrocatalytic process and further speculating that h was generated along with it although the platinum electrode is active and does not participate directly in the generation of oh chemisorbed oh is generated around the platinum electrode 39 as oh and h were less stable they will carry out redox reactions with doxycycline molecules which further demonstrates the degradation mechanism of electrocatalysis by composite electrodes 3 8 lc ms analysis to further investigate the electrocatalytic degradation process lc ms experiments were carried out fig 5b shows the mass spectra of the doxycycline degradation wastewater at different time periods the figure showed that a series of compounds were produced on the way to degradation and the degradation pathway of doxycycline was inferred based on the m z of the compounds and the predicted results were shown in fig 5c it was hypothesized that the electrocatalytic degradation of doxycycline could be divided into 2 pathways ring opening and functional group cleavage reactions both pathways involved the reduction or oxidation of doxycycline by h and oh ions leading to the cleavage of doxycycline 40 41 pathway 1 prioritized the removal of the functional group prior to ring opening cleavage while pathway 2 opened the ring prior to cleavage of the functional group in the diagram doxycycline dc was dehydroxylated and deaminoated by hydroxyl oxidation and de carbonylated by the introduction of h to give dc1 m z 422 42 dc could also be de aminoated and ring opened by h to give dc2 m z 432 dc1 was sequentially de carboxylated by oh and de dimethylated by h to give dc3 m z 378 and dc5 m z 294 dc5 continued with the progressive removal of functional groups by h and oh eventually giving dc11 m z 149 dc2 continued with the ring opening reaction and progressive dedimethylamino deaminoization dehydroxylation and demethylation to give the common product dc11 with pathway 1 d11 continued to cleave to small molecule compounds m z 150 d12 m z 145 dc13 m z 118 dc14 m z 106 which eventually decomposed to h2o and co2 4 conclusion in this paper ru ag cf composite electrodes with high specific surface area low charge transfer resistance excellent electrocatalytic activity and high stability were successfully prepared and applied to the electrocatalytic degradation of doxycycline the electrodes can achieve a degradation efficiency of 79 01 for a 10 mg l solution of doxycycline the ru ag cf composite electrode showed excellent stability and catalytic activity after 10 cycles in the toxicity test the degradation solution of doxycycline inhibited e coli at 7 26 after 2 h of degradation indicating that the composite electrode degraded the doxycycline solution very thoroughly and with high safety in the hydroxyl radical trapping experiments the presence of oh was tested presumably accompanied by the production of h and the degradation mechanism was broadly inferred the structure of the degradation of doxycycline and the degradation pathway of doxycycline were analyzed by lc ms experiments the results showed that doxycycline could be effectively degraded to small molecules m z 150 by the electrocatalytic process of the composite electrode through the above conclusions it is proved that the electrode materials prepared in this study have the characteristics of high catalytic efficiency reusability and safety of degradation products therefore this study can provide some technical references for the application of electrocatalysis

capacity for codcr nh4 n and tn thirdly high throughput 16s rrna sequencing analysis revealed that the microbial community of efbs at different flow velocities varied significantly finally the microbial community of efbs with a flow velocity of 0 91 m d showed the highest richness index diversity index and operational taxonomic unit otu number moreover the abundance of the ecological functions responsible for carbon and nitrogen removal was the highest at a flow velocity of 0 91 m d the statistical analysis corroborated that flow velocity could affect pollutant removal capacity and microbial community of efbs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ecological floating beds flow velocity microbiology ecological function 1 introduction increased nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization have significantly improved china s crop yields however nitrogen and phosphorus flow with agricultural runoff into rivers and lakes causing severe water eutrophication problems 1 2 especially due to the need for agricultural irrigation the construction of dams on the rivers will slow down river flow rate and accelerate nitrogen and phosphorus deposition further aggravating water body eutrophication 3 the toxic and harmful substances produced by eutrophication induced algae outbreak seriously threaten drinking water quality and ecosystem health 4 6 generally pollutants in eutrophic freshwaters are treated using physical chemical and biological methods however physical and chemical methods may cause secondary pollution of freshwaters 7 8 as a bioremediation technology ecological floating beds efbs are widely used for treating eutrophic water bodies because of their low cost convenient maintenance easy management and no land usage 9 10 in addition to pollutants absorption by plants pollutants degradation or assimilation by microorganisms is the main way to purify water on efbs 11 therefore the role of microorganisms in efbs also deserves attention biofilms mainly consist of bacteria and have important implications for the functioning of aquatic environments and the ecosystem services they provide 12 biofilm can be affected by various factors including water flow velocity temperature and pollutant concentration among these factors water flow velocity is a key factor affecting pollutants removal from efbs 13 14 abundant dissolved oxygen do that produced by water flow can increase nitrogen n biodegradation 15 gao et al tested nitrogen removal from efbs at flow velocities of 0 27 m d 0 4 m d 0 8 m d and 1 6 m d respectively and found that flow velocity had a significant impact on no2 n and nh4 n removal 16 shai et al found that hydrodynamic shear stress of water flow at high velocity affects biofilm s structure classification composition and nutrient cycle 17 however efbs are often used in various slow flow environments along streams and rivers off channel dead zones backwater lakes riparian wetlands etc thus it is necessary to explore the response of microbial communities to different slow flow environments and the ecological process of microbial community the study aimed to investigate the effect of water flow on efbs purification capacity and microbial communities specifically we explored i at which flow velocity conditions efbs have the strongest ability to remove pollutants ii how microbial communities respond to the impact of water flow and iii what are the potential effects of changes in microbial communities at different flow velocities on pollutant removal capacity of efbs the results provide information for improving efbs performance in engineering applications 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental device the experimental device was composed of a 120 cm length x120 cm width x120 cm height water inlet tank a water pump to feed the river water into the water inlet tank three 210 cm length x70 cm width x100 cm height reactors and three flowmeters that were connected to the outlets of the water inlet tank and the inlets of the reactors via pipes to control water flow velocity all influents entered the reactors from the bottom to the top with a depth of 65 cm and a volume of 955 5 l the efbs consisted of 12 floating bodies 33 cm 33 cm placed in the reactors each floating body was planted with cyperus alternifolius l and four bunches of fiber fillers with a length of 60 cm and a diameter of 6 cm hung below each floating body 2 2 experiment conditions the experiment was conducted using three different reactors named v1 v3 and v5 at water flow controlled by flowmeters to be 0 11 m3 d 0 41 m3 d and 0 72 m3 d corresponding to flow velocities of 0 25 m d 0 91 m d and 1 57 m d respectively table 1 shows the quality of water entering the three reactors the experimental water was prepared from the river water of urban inland rivers supplemented with glucose c6h12o6 and ammonium chloride nh4cl 2 3 chemical analysis water samples were collected three times from both the inlet and outlet of each reactor and analyzed immediately after collection temperature and dissolved oxygen do were monitored using a portable dissolved oxygen meter model jpbj 608 china ph was tested using a ph meter model phs10 china chemical oxygen demand codcr ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn were measured according to the standard methods and protocols of state environmental protection administration of china sepa 2002 in detail tn was measured using the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion ultraviolet spectrophotometer method codcr was measured using the dichromate titration method and nh4 n was detected using nessler s reagent spectrophotometry respectively 2 4 microbiological analysis six fillers samples were collected from the water inlet and outlet of the reactors v1 v3 v5 and named tj tj1 tj3 and tj5 and tc tc1 tc3 and tc5 meanwhile three plant root samples were collected from the reactors v1 v3 v5 and named g g1 g3 g5 at the end of the experiment the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified by polymerase chain reactions with forward primer 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and reverse primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 18 and sequenced on illumina miseq platform shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd china using standard procedures the optimal sequences were assigned into operational taxonomic units otus using uclust software uclust v1 1 579 with 97 identity as a cutoff and further subjected to taxonomic analysis to be divided into phyla classes families and genera each sample s microbial richness and diversity were compared using the ace chao1 shannon and simpson indexes 19 the putative ecological functions of the prokaryotic otus were assessed using functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax 20 2 5 data analyses the removal efficiency of codcr nh4 n and tn at different flow velocities was analyzed using spss and origin statistical software the optimal operating flow velocity of efbs for water purification was analyzed using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis model to calculate the positive and negative ideal solution distances of all decision options the solutions were submitted to a comprehensive ranking based on the distances between the positive and negative ideal points to obtain a comprehensive evaluation 21 compared with the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehension evaluation method the topsis model has several characteristics firstly topsis has a simple logic structure and reliable operation results secondly topsis could work with different scales and types of information 22 the analysis process of the topsis model is as follows 1 the economic indexes are calculated using the following formula with the larger value being ideal 1 x j x j max x j x j max x j min 2 the cost indexes are calculated using the following formula with the smaller value being ideal 2 x j x j x j min x j max x j min the x j max is the maximum value of the j th index and the x j min is the minimum value of the j th index 3 the processed data are built based on matrix b b ij i j the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution are calculated using the following formulas 3 c j max 1 i n b ij j 1 2 n 4 c j 0 min 1 i n b ij j 1 2 n 4 the distances of each choice to the positive ideal d i value and the negative ideal d i 0 value are calculated using the following formulas 5 d i j 1 n b ij c j 2 i 1 2 n 6 d i 0 j 1 n b ij c j 0 2 i 1 2 n 5 the proximity factor for each alternative to the distance from the positive to the negative ideal solutions is then calculated using the following formula 7 f i d i 0 d i 0 d i i 1 2 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 efbs performance 3 1 1 codcr removal in the efbs system the fillers and plant roots could absorb suspended organic matter and the microorganisms on the fillers and plant roots could consume codcr through aerobic and anaerobic metabolic processes to achieve codcr reduction codcr was reduced from 107 31 122 27 mg l in the influents to 40 8 75 4 mg l in the effluents with an efficiency ranging from 38 25 to 61 94 fig 2 among the three reactors v1 reactor showed the best codcr reduction efficiency of 61 94 indicating that low velocity could enhance the adequate contact time between plant roots and biofilms in addition lots of algae and bacteria in v1 reactor were enriched on the fillers as observed under an optical microscope fig s1 and by high throughput rrna sequencing fig 4 it has been reported that the bacteria in the bacteria algae symbiosis system can degrade organic carbons to inorganic carbons and cod can be removed by algae assimilation to inorganic carbon 23 24 3 1 2 tn and nh4 n removal high nitrogen concentration is the main cause of water eutrophication as it will cause rapid algae growth and harm the water s ecological environment nitrogen is removed primarily by microbial nitrification and denitrification absorption and evaporation by plants adsorption filtering sedimentation by fillers and ammonia volatilization 25 in the three reactors with different flow velocities nh4 n concentration ranged from 2 62 mg l to 2 75 mg l in the influents and from 1 15 mg l to 1 84 mg l in the effluents overall efbs exhibited a good nh4 n removal efficiency with nh4 n removal efficiency increasing from 32 19 in v5 to 54 38 in v1 and 55 99 in v3 fig 3a showing a better nh4 n removal efficiency at low flow velocity the reason is possibly that the autotrophic digestion process requires a longer time at low do concentration a longer hydraulic retention time is beneficial for plants to uptake nh4 n in the water body 16 26 tn concentration ranged from 4 49 mg l to 5 13 mg l in the influents and 2 05 mg l to 3 39 mg l in the effluents with tn removal efficiency increasing from 33 89 in v5 to 50 01 in v1 and 54 26 in v3 fig 3b after the experiment plant tissues were collected for nitrogen analysis the results showed that the nitrogen content in cyperus alternifolius l was not significantly different before and after the experiment however the plants weight height and root length clearly increased table s1 these results showed that cyperus alternifolius l could absorb nitrogen through assimilation moreover the anaerobic anoxic aerobic microdomains formed in the plant roots and biofilms can strengthen the nitrification and denitrification of microorganisms thus improving nitrogen removal efficiency 27 plant uptake and microbial nitrification denitrification are the main nitrogen removal routes in efbs 3 2 topsis evaluation 3 2 1 data collection to further comprehensively clarify that the water purification capacity of efbs under different flow velocities four indicators were selected for evaluation codcr reduction rate tn removal rate nh4 n removal rate and flow table 2 shows the evaluation indexes of efbs at different flow velocities 3 2 2 evaluation results the topsis model was used to analyze the water purification capacity of efbs at three different flow velocities in the model x1 x2 x3 and x4 represent the codcr reduction rate tn removal rate nh4 n removal rate and flow velocity respectively the evaluation objects were v1 v3 and v5 the value of the i th evaluation object for the j th index variable xj was denoted as aij and the corresponding data matrix a aij 3x4 the evaluation steps were as follows 1 the data in table 2 were standardized using formulas 1 and 2 the standardized data matrix was denoted as b bij 3x4 as follows b 3 x 4 1 0 7915 0 9326 0 0 8419 1 1 0 4918 0 0 0 1 2 the positive ideal solution c and the negative ideal solution c0 were calculated using formulas 3 and 4 3 the distance of each evaluation objects from the positive ideal d i value and the negative ideal d i 0 value is calculated using formulas 5 and 6 the proximity of each evaluation scheme to the ideal scheme a was calculated through the formulas 7 the results are shown in table 3 it can be seen from the comprehensive evaluation results shown in table 3 that the water purification capacity of efbs under the three conditions was 0 91 m d in v3 0 25 m d in v1 and 1 57 m d in v5 showing that v3 had the best operating condition for efbs in other words the pollutants removal rate was higher at low flow velocity by contrast since the amount of purified water is proportional to the water flow in the reactor the amount of purified water is high at high flow velocity and low at low flow velocity thus comprehensively efbs under the v3 conditions had a better pollutants removal rate and higher water body purification capacity 3 3 molecular biology analysis 3 3 1 microbial diversity and richness the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing results showed that the nine samples shared 313 core otus the number of otus was 1980 in the tc3 sample greatly higher than that in the tc1 and tc5 samples and was 1731 in the tj3 sample also greater than that in the tj1 and tj5 samples fig 3a in addition the number of otus was much higher in the filler samples tc1 tc3 tc5 tj1 tj3 and tj5 than in the plant root samples g1 g3 and g5 fig 3a moreover the number of otus in reactors with different flow velocities showed a trend of v3 v5 v1 fig 3b hence the change of flow velocity affects the microbial community characteristics of the efbs the research evaluated the alpha diversity of microorganisms in biofilms using four indicators including chao1 ace shannon and simpson indexes table 4 shows the microbial diversity and abundance at different locations of efbs in the three reactors v1 v3 and v5 a higher shannon index indicates a higher diversity while a higher simpson index indicates a lower diversity it was obvious that all filler samples tc1 tc3 tc5 tj1 tj3 and tj5 had a significantly higher microbial diversity than plant root samples g1 g3 and g5 and filler samples tc3 and tj3 from the v3 reactor had a higher diversity index than the filler samples tc1 tj1 tc5 and tj5 from the v1 and v5 reactors in addition higher ace and chao1 indexes indicate higher microbial abundance the results show that microbial abundance was significantly higher in all filler samples tc1 tc3 tc5 tj1 tj3 and tj5 than the plant root samples g1 g3 and g5 the microbial abundance was significantly higher in the filler samples tc3 tj3 tc5 and tj5 from the v3 and v5 reactors than in the filler samples tc1 and tj1 from the v1 reactor moreover the microbial diversity was higher in the filler samples tc3 and tj3 from the v3 reactor than in the filler samples tc1 tj1 tc5 and tj5 from the v3 and v5 reactors these results also showed that fillers could increase the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the efbs consistent with wu et al 28 furthermore changes in flow velocity affected the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the efbs neither the lower nutrient concentration in the reactor at low flow velocity nor the scouring effect of water flow at high flow velocity was conducive to the growth of biofilms hence the higher abundance and diversity in the v3 reactor might be the reason for its most robust comprehensive water purification ability 3 3 2 microbial taxonomy and community fig 5 demonstrates the microbial community composition of the efbs at the phylum and genus classification levels under different conditions at the phylum level fig 5a proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in all samples followed by cyanobacteria actinobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflei firmicutes campllobacterota acidobacteriota verrucomicrobiota and patescibacteria consistent with the findings of song et al 29 the abundance of proleobacteria was 71 77 74 88 on plant roots significantly greater than that of 31 62 49 10 on the fillers according to a report most nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria belong to proteobacteria 30 the abundance of cyanobacteria actinobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflei and firmicutes was higher on the fillers than on the plant roots the abundance of cyanobacteria on the fillers showed a decreasing trend with the flow velocity increasing a previous study has shown that cyanobacteria is a group of microorganisms related to nitrogen fixation in water bodies with severe nitrogen pollution and plays a critical role in nitrogen removal 31 at the genus level fig 5b the top 10 enriched microorganisms were norank f norank o chloroplast planktothrix nivacya 15 paenarthrobacter norank f rhizobiales ncertae sedis hydrogenophaga rhodobacter pseudorhodobacter acidovorax unclassified f enterobacteriaceae and norank f norank o pem15 and norank f norank o chloroplast belonging to cyanobacteria had the highest relative abundance in reactors with different flow velocities the relative abundance of norank f norank o chloroplast decreased with the flow velocity increasing indicating that high flow velocity is not conducive to the adhesion of algae to the surface of the filler and plant roots rhodobacter is widely present in fresh water and can remove sulfide and nitrate nitrogen 32 33 norank f rhizobiales incertae sedis accounts for a relatively high proportion in plant roots and has a good ability to degrade nitrate 34 the relative abundance of norank f rhizobiales incertae sedis in the reactors with different flow velocities showed a decreasing trend with the flow velocity increasing hydrogenophaga and acidovorax belong to proleobacteria and have certain denitrification and phosphorus removal abilities 35 paenarthrobacter can utilize various carbon sources and has a good degradation ability for organic matters 36 the abundance of paenarthrobacter on the plant root system hardly changed with the flow velocity and its abundance on the filler increased with the flow velocity increasing 3 3 3 similarity analysis of the microbial composition cluster analysis revealed two groups at the phylum level group i consisted of samples from the plant roots while group ii consisted of samples from the fillers fig 6a group ii samples were divided into three subgroups v1 v3 and v5 v1 consisted of samples from the reactor with a flow velocity of 0 25 m d v3 consisted of samples from the reactor with a flow velocity of 0 91 m d v5 consisted of samples from the reactor with a flow velocity of 1 57 m d these data showed that the bacterial community in biofilms shifted depending on changes in flow velocity and sample types the plot of non metric multidimensional scaling nmds fig 6b showed that samples from the v3 and v5 reactors were relatively close to each other indicating that they had similar microbial community structures but were far from samples from the v1 reactor suggesting that samples from the v1 reactor and the samples from the v3 and v5 reactors were composed of different microbial communities in summary the samples were more closely related within each group and further apart among groups in v1 v3 and v5 reactors indicating that the microbial community structure in the reactor was affected by the flow velocity it has been reported that under the influence of water flow generate biofilms with inherently complex and varying physical structures that have implications for microbial functioning and ecosystem processes meanwhile hydrodynamic zones can cause changes in environmental factors leading to changes in microbial community which is consistent with the results of this study 14 37 3 3 4 correlations between environmental factors and microbial composition redundancy analysis a kind of constrained ordination was used to analyze the relationships among environmental factors samples and the relative abundance of bacteria the length of the environmental factor arrow represents the influence degree of the environmental factors on the species data among the environmental factors investigated flow velocity seems to be the most important the change of flow velocity will change environmental factors such as do temperature and nutrient concentration it is generally accepted that do ph and other physicochemical factors affect microbial community diversity and structures 38 39 the angle between the arrow and the point shows the correlation among samples bacterial factors and environmental factors fig 7 microorganisms of tj1 g1 and tc1 were mainly negatively correlated with the flow velocity and do while microorganisms of tc3 tj3 g3 tj5 g5 and tc5 were mainly positively correlated with the velocity and do microorganisms of g1 g3 and g5 were mainly positively correlated with nh4 n tn ph and codcr however microorganisms of tj1 tc1 tj3 tc3 tj5 and tc5 were mainly negatively correlated with nh4 n tn ph and codcr norank f norank o chloroplast and norank f rhizobiales incertae sedis were negatively correlated with the flow velocity and planktothrix niva cya 15 paenarthrobacter hydrogenophaga rhodobacter and acidovorax were positively correlated with the flow velocity 3 3 5 faprotax ecological function prediction to further understand the differences in the ecological functions of microorganisms in the efbs under different flow velocities the ecological function of microorganisms in the efbs were predicted using faprotax software among all ecological functions the ecological function related to carbon and nitrogen removal were highly abundant in the three reactors including those related to chemoheterotrophy aerobic chemoheterotrophy nitrate reduction nitrogen respiration nitrate respiration nitrogen fixation and nitrate denitrification fig 8 this result is consistent with codcr reduction and nitrogen removal by efbs ecological functions related to chemoheterotrophy aerobic chemoheterotrophy nitrate reduction nitrogen respiration nitrate respiration nitrogen fixation and nitrate denitrification are most abundant in the v3 reactor this could explain the evaluation results of the topsis model on the comprehensive carbon and nitrogen removal capacity of the efbs under three flow velocities the abundance of ecological function related to chloroplasts decreased in the order of v1 v3 v5 this may be why the abundance of ecological function related to norank f norank o chloroplast was the highest among all samples at the genus level and why its abundance decreased with the flow velocity increasing fig 5b ecological functions related to denitrification were also highly abundant in the efbs faprotax prediction results showed that changing water flow velocity would affect the abundance of ecological functions of microorganisms in efbs thereby affecting the purification effect of efbs on the water body 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of different water flow velocities on the pollutant removal capacity and microbial community of efbs the evaluation results of the topsis model indicated that efbs had the strongest comprehensive removal capacity for codcr nh4 n and tn at a flow velocity of 0 91 m d microbial high throughput sequencing results showed that flow velocity had a significant impact on the microbial community structure of efbs at a flow velocity of 0 91 m d the microbial community shannon index ace index and otus number in the efbs were the highest the change of water flow velocity will affect the abundance of the ecological functions of microorganisms in the efbs and when the flow velocity is 0 91 m d the abundance of ecological functions related to carbon and nitrogen removal is the highest the results of this study could serve as a reference for the application of efbs in water ecological restoration projects and water pollution control projects declaration of competing

and discussion 3 1 efbs performance 3 1 1 codcr removal in the efbs system the fillers and plant roots could absorb suspended organic matter and the microorganisms on the fillers and plant roots could consume codcr through aerobic and anaerobic metabolic processes to achieve codcr reduction codcr was reduced from 107 31 122 27 mg l in the influents to 40 8 75 4 mg l in the effluents with an efficiency ranging from 38 25 to 61 94 fig 2 among the three reactors v1 reactor showed the best codcr reduction efficiency of 61 94 indicating that low velocity could enhance the adequate contact time between plant roots and biofilms in addition lots of algae and bacteria in v1 reactor were enriched on the fillers as observed under an optical microscope fig s1 and by high throughput rrna sequencing fig 4 it has been reported that the bacteria in the bacteria algae symbiosis system can degrade organic carbons to inorganic carbons and cod can be removed by algae assimilation to inorganic carbon 23 24 3 1 2 tn and nh4 n removal high nitrogen concentration is the main cause of water eutrophication as it will cause rapid algae growth and harm the water s ecological environment nitrogen is removed primarily by microbial nitrification and denitrification absorption and evaporation by plants adsorption filtering sedimentation by fillers and ammonia volatilization 25 in the three reactors with different flow velocities nh4 n concentration ranged from 2 62 mg l to 2 75 mg l in the influents and from 1 15 mg l to 1 84 mg l in the effluents overall efbs exhibited a good nh4 n removal efficiency with nh4 n removal efficiency increasing from 32 19 in v5 to 54 38 in v1 and 55 99 in v3 fig 3a showing a better nh4 n removal efficiency at low flow velocity the reason is possibly that the autotrophic digestion process requires a longer time at low do concentration a longer hydraulic retention time is beneficial for plants to uptake nh4 n in the water body 16 26 tn

anaerobic anoxic aerobic microdomains formed in the plant roots and biofilms can strengthen the nitrification and denitrification of microorganisms thus improving nitrogen removal efficiency 27 plant uptake and microbial nitrification denitrification are the main nitrogen removal routes in efbs 3 2 topsis evaluation 3 2 1 data collection to further comprehensively clarify that the water purification capacity of efbs under different flow velocities four indicators were selected for evaluation codcr reduction rate tn removal rate nh4 n removal rate and flow table 2 shows the evaluation indexes of efbs at different flow velocities 3 2 2 evaluation results the topsis model was used to analyze the water purification capacity of efbs at three different flow velocities in the model x1 x2 x3 and x4 represent the codcr reduction rate tn removal rate nh4 n removal rate and flow velocity respectively the evaluation objects were v1 v3 and v5 the value of the i th evaluation object for the j th index variable xj was denoted as aij and the corresponding data matrix a aij 3x4 the evaluation steps were as follows 1 the data in table 2 were standardized using formulas 1 and 2 the standardized data matrix was denoted as b bij 3x4 as follows b 3 x 4 1 0 7915 0 9326 0 0 8419 1 1 0 4918 0 0 0 1 2 the positive ideal solution c and the negative ideal solution c0 were calculated using formulas 3 and 4 3 the distance of each evaluation objects from the positive ideal d i value and the negative ideal d i 0 value is calculated using formulas 5 and 6 the proximity of each evaluation scheme to the ideal scheme a was calculated through the formulas 7 the results are shown in table 3 it can be seen from the comprehensive evaluation results shown in table 3 that the water purification capacity of efbs under the three conditions was 0 91 m d in v3 0 25 m d in v1 and 1 57 m d in v5 showing that v3 had the best operating condition for efbs in other words the pollutants removal rate was higher at low flow velocity by contrast since the amount of purified water is proportional to the water flow in the reactor the amount of purified water is high at high flow velocity and low at low flow velocity thus comprehensively efbs under the v3 conditions had a better pollutants removal rate and higher water body purification capacity 3 3 molecular biology analysis 3 3 1 microbial diversity and richness the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing results showed that the nine samples shared 313 core otus the number of otus was 1980 in the tc3 sample greatly higher than that in the tc1 and tc5 samples and was 1731 in the tj3 sample also greater than that in the tj1 and tj5 samples fig 3a in addition the number of otus was much higher in the filler samples tc1 tc3 tc5 tj1 tj3 and tj5 than in the plant root samples g1 g3 and g5 fig 3a moreover the number of otus in reactors with different flow velocities showed a trend of v3 v5 v1 fig 3b hence the change of flow velocity affects the microbial community characteristics of the efbs the research evaluated the alpha diversity of microorganisms in biofilms using four indicators including chao1 ace shannon and simpson indexes table 4 shows the microbial diversity and abundance at different locations of efbs in the three reactors v1 v3 and v5 a higher shannon index indicates a higher diversity while a higher simpson index indicates a lower diversity it was obvious that all filler samples tc1 tc3 tc5 tj1 tj3 and tj5 had a significantly higher microbial diversity than plant root samples g1 g3 and g5 and filler samples tc3 and tj3 from the v3 reactor had a higher diversity index than the filler samples tc1 tj1 tc5 and tj5 from the v1 and v5 reactors in addition higher ace and chao1 indexes indicate higher microbial abundance the results show that microbial abundance was significantly higher in all filler samples tc1 tc3 tc5 tj1 tj3 and tj5 than the plant root samples g1 g3 and g5 the microbial abundance was significantly higher in the filler samples tc3 tj3 tc5 and tj5 from the v3 and v5 reactors than in the filler samples tc1 and tj1 from the v1 reactor moreover the microbial diversity was higher in the filler samples tc3 and tj3 from the v3 reactor than in the filler samples tc1 tj1 tc5 and tj5 from the v3 and v5 reactors these results also showed that fillers could increase the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the efbs consistent with wu et al 28 furthermore changes in flow velocity affected the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the efbs neither the lower nutrient concentration in the reactor at low flow velocity nor the scouring effect of water flow at high flow velocity was conducive to the growth of biofilms hence the higher abundance and diversity in the v3 reactor might be the reason for its most robust comprehensive water purification ability 3 3 2 microbial taxonomy and community fig 5 demonstrates the microbial community composition of the efbs at the phylum and genus classification levels under different conditions at the phylum level fig 5a proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in all samples followed by cyanobacteria actinobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflei firmicutes campllobacterota acidobacteriota verrucomicrobiota and patescibacteria consistent with the findings of song et al 29 the abundance of proleobacteria was 71 77 74 88 on plant roots significantly greater than that of 31 62 49 10 on the fillers according to a report most nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria belong to proteobacteria 30 the abundance of cyanobacteria actinobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflei and firmicutes was higher on the fillers than on the plant roots the abundance of cyanobacteria on the fillers showed a decreasing trend with the flow velocity increasing a previous study has shown that cyanobacteria is a group of microorganisms related to nitrogen fixation in water bodies with severe nitrogen pollution and plays a critical role in nitrogen removal 31 at the genus level fig 5b the top 10 enriched microorganisms were norank f norank o chloroplast planktothrix nivacya 15 paenarthrobacter norank f rhizobiales ncertae sedis hydrogenophaga rhodobacter pseudorhodobacter acidovorax unclassified f enterobacteriaceae and norank f norank o pem15 and norank f norank o chloroplast belonging to cyanobacteria had the highest relative abundance in reactors with different flow velocities the relative abundance of norank f norank o chloroplast decreased with the flow velocity increasing indicating that high flow velocity is not conducive to the adhesion of algae to the surface of the filler and plant roots rhodobacter is widely present in fresh water and can remove sulfide and nitrate nitrogen 32 33 norank f rhizobiales incertae sedis accounts for a relatively high proportion in plant roots and has a good ability to degrade nitrate 34 the relative abundance of norank f rhizobiales incertae sedis in the reactors with different flow velocities showed a decreasing trend with the flow velocity increasing hydrogenophaga and acidovorax belong to proleobacteria and have certain denitrification and phosphorus removal abilities 35 paenarthrobacter can utilize various carbon sources and has a good degradation ability for organic matters 36 the abundance of paenarthrobacter on the plant root system hardly changed with the flow velocity and its abundance on the filler increased with the flow velocity increasing 3 3 3 similarity analysis of the microbial composition cluster analysis revealed two groups at the phylum level group i consisted of samples from the plant roots while group ii consisted of samples from the fillers fig 6a group ii samples were divided into three subgroups v1 v3 and v5 v1 consisted of samples from the reactor with a flow velocity of 0 25 m d v3 consisted of samples from the reactor with a flow velocity of 0 91 m d v5 consisted of samples from the reactor with a flow velocity of 1 57 m d these data showed that the bacterial community in biofilms shifted depending on changes in flow velocity and sample types the plot of non metric multidimensional scaling nmds fig 6b showed that samples from the v3 and v5 reactors were relatively close to each other indicating that they had similar microbial community structures but were far from samples from the v1 reactor suggesting that samples from the v1 reactor and the samples from the v3 and v5 reactors were composed of different microbial communities in summary the samples were more closely related within each group and further apart among groups in v1 v3 and v5 reactors indicating that the microbial community structure in the reactor was affected by the flow velocity it has been reported that under the influence of water flow generate biofilms with inherently complex and varying physical structures that have implications for microbial functioning and ecosystem processes meanwhile hydrodynamic zones can cause changes in environmental factors leading to changes in microbial community which is consistent with the results of this study 14 37 3 3 4 correlations between environmental factors and microbial composition redundancy analysis a kind of constrained ordination was used to analyze the relationships among environmental factors samples and the relative abundance of bacteria the length of the environmental factor arrow represents the influence degree of the environmental factors on the species data among the environmental factors investigated flow velocity seems to be the most important the change of flow velocity will change environmental factors such as do temperature and nutrient concentration it is generally accepted that do ph and other physicochemical factors affect microbial community diversity and structures 38 39 the angle between the arrow and the point shows the correlation among samples bacterial factors and environmental factors fig 7 microorganisms of tj1 g1 and tc1 were mainly negatively correlated with the flow velocity and do while microorganisms of tc3 tj3 g3 tj5 g5 and tc5 were mainly positively correlated with the velocity and do microorganisms of g1 g3 and g5 were mainly positively correlated with nh4 n tn ph and codcr however microorganisms of tj1 tc1 tj3 tc3 tj5 and tc5 were mainly negatively correlated with nh4 n tn ph and codcr norank f norank o chloroplast and norank f rhizobiales incertae sedis were negatively correlated with the flow velocity and planktothrix niva cya 15 paenarthrobacter hydrogenophaga rhodobacter and acidovorax were positively correlated with the flow velocity 3 3 5 faprotax ecological function prediction to further understand the differences in the ecological functions of microorganisms in the efbs under different flow velocities the ecological function of microorganisms in the efbs were predicted using faprotax software among all ecological functions the ecological function related to carbon and nitrogen removal were highly abundant in the three reactors including those related to chemoheterotrophy aerobic chemoheterotrophy nitrate reduction nitrogen respiration nitrate respiration nitrogen fixation and nitrate denitrification fig 8 this result is consistent with codcr reduction and nitrogen removal by efbs ecological functions related to chemoheterotrophy aerobic chemoheterotrophy nitrate reduction nitrogen respiration nitrate respiration nitrogen fixation and nitrate denitrification are most abundant in the v3 reactor this could explain the evaluation results of the topsis model on the comprehensive carbon and nitrogen removal capacity of the efbs under three flow velocities the abundance of ecological function related to chloroplasts decreased in the order of v1 v3 v5 this may be why the abundance of ecological function related to norank f norank o chloroplast was the highest among all samples at the genus level and why its abundance decreased with the flow velocity increasing fig 5b ecological functions related to denitrification were also highly abundant in the efbs faprotax prediction results showed that changing water flow velocity would affect the abundance of ecological functions of microorganisms in efbs thereby affecting the purification effect of efbs on the water body 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of different water flow velocities on the pollutant removal capacity and microbial community of efbs the evaluation results of the topsis model indicated that efbs had the strongest comprehensive removal capacity for codcr nh4 n and tn at a flow velocity of 0 91 m d microbial high throughput sequencing results showed that flow velocity had a significant impact on the microbial community structure of efbs at a flow velocity of 0 91 m d the microbial community shannon index ace index and otus number in the efbs were the highest the change of water flow velocity will affect the abundance of the ecological functions of microorganisms in the efbs and when the flow velocity is 0 91 m d the abundance of ecological functions related to carbon and nitrogen removal is the highest the results of this study could serve as a reference for the application of efbs in water ecological restoration projects and water pollution control projects declaration of competing

12928,the expected growth of membrane technology in protein recovery from wastewater is largely impeded by operational non idealities like concentration polarization and membrane fouling two independent concepts namely the dynamic shear enhanced dse filtration and turbulence promoters were introduced decades earlier to remediate the problems however no systematic effort was undertaken to explore the synergy of the two process intensification schemes in this study we have investigated the effects of simple wire type turbulence promoter on a specific class of dse membrane modules the spinning basket filtration units the maximum flux improvement with synthetic wastewater i e bovine serum albumin bsa water solution was 445 whereas for the real dairy effluent the respective enhancement levelled off at 204 the lower level of flux enhancement for real wastewater may be attributed to the severe fouling caused by the casein micelle the increase of power consumption in all promoter fitted configurations was limited to 9 only thus turbulence promoter integrated spinning basket group of membrane modules are confirmed to be much superior relative to other devices in protein recovery from wastewater our results are also supported by corroborating computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations of elevated shear and high turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates for all promoter fitted configurations the present outcomes clearly recommend the application of turbulence promoters in dse modules to maximally increase the protein recovery from wastewater even at concentrations where the standard cross flow systems are apprehended to be non functional graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords spinning basket membrane turbulence promoter permeate flux dairy effluent energy budget cfd 1 introduction nutrient recovery from industrial wastewater is a fundamental step towards sustainable development 1 several industries generate copious volumes of protein laden wastewater for example 145 million tonnes of whey a by product of cheese and casein manufacture is produced per year worldwide 2 effluent concentration of whey proteins i e α lactalbumin β lactoglobulin bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin typically ranges between 6 and 10 g l 1 3 therefore recovery of whey proteins may largely supplement their demand as food additives and therapeutic drug components furthermore protein recovery is also expected to facilitate the wastewater discharge by reducing the biological oxygen demand bod significantly 4 membrane based separation is undoubtedly the most accepted method of protein recovery of which ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf are most commonly employed 5 8 despite the progress uf and mf suffer from the non idealities of concentration polarization cp and subsequent cp led membrane fouling 9 11 treatment of food wastewater is particularly susceptible to these problems for instance polysaccharide molecules in addition to proteins are found to foul the membrane pervasively 12 factors like size of the foulant also play a key role in the extent of permeability loss 13 14 proteins are known to be typically severe foulants protein fouling exhibits a drastic character transformation from reversible to irreversible owing to the conformational changes in the structure which enables it to intrude into membrane pores and clog them 15 several measures to redress protein fouling have been proposed over decades these include boundary layer manipulation by introducing turbulence promotion 16 pre treating the feed with coagulants 17 membrane surface modification by grafting suitable functional groups 18 and using external stimulations like gas sparging backflushing or applying an electric field i e electroultrafiltration 19 21 other techniques like fabrication of functional membrane materials such as the biomimetic dynamic membrane bdm has also been proved effective 22 23 some of these methods are feed specific while others are more versatile of these turbulence promotion is one of the simplest to implement 24 26 increased degree of turbulence disrupts the polarized layer effectively by solute mixing perpendicular to the membrane surface 27 turbulence promotion can be accomplished either by dynamic shear enhancement i e shear enhancement independent of the feed flow rate or by using the static mixers also known as turbulence promoters 28 the dse membrane filtration devices commonly employ a rotating or reciprocating accessory to produce a feed flow independent high shear field in the membrane surface vicinity rotating disk rd multi shaft disk msd and vibratory shear enhanced processing vsep are some standard examples of dse filtration pilots 29 30 in recent times most of the studies on dse filtration devices are focused on the application perspective for instance the rd pilot was successfully applied to separate lipids from microalgae extracts 31 similarly in another study 85 chemical oxygen demand cod reduction of tannery wastewater was achieved with a vsep filtration device 32 the principle of dynamic shear enhancement was also demonstrated to be effective in membrane cleaning 33 reports on dse filtration modeling are relatively infrequent because of the difficulties involved in describing the complex hydrodynamic environment that commonly prevail in any dse pilots very recently rana et al have presented an elegant mathematical model of the spinning basket filtration unit by analytically solving the convection diffusion equation close to the membrane surface 34 the second approach of turbulence promotion is based on static mixers turbulence promoters turbulence promoters are stationary inserts that induce mixing and disrupt the polarized layer through localized flow perturbation 35 in tubular cross flow membranes the use of simple rods twisted tapes helical screws kenics mixers and static blade mixers as turbulence promoters are quite common nowadays 36 recent trend of research on turbulence promoters signify an increasing application of 3d printing in promoter fabrication the 3d printed promoters were noted to largely reduce the pressure drop relative to their metallic versions 37 application of the 3d printed cylindrical pin type promoters in uf of purple araca fruit extract was observed to produce nearly 80 flux enhancement 38 another recent study on cross flow uf of humic acid with 3d printed turbulence promoters has established the kenics mixer to be the most efficient in terms of flux enhancement as well as from the perspective of specific energy demand 39 literature review indicates that the applications of turbulence promoters are majorly restricted to the cross flow modules even so we may recognize an easy scope of performance upgradation upon integrating a compatible turbulence promoter with a dse filtration module furthermore any promoter coupled dse filtration pilot is expected not to significantly increase the energy demand nevertheless the flux is supposed to increase because of the combined effect of dynamic shear enhancement and static turbulence promotion despite this possibility of marked improvement the scope remained nearly unexplored to the best of our knowledge only two relevant studies were reported so far sen et al were the first to use a rectangular vane type turbulence promoter to upgrade the performance of a rd module in uf of bsa and glucose 40 the other report describes the effect of promoter attachment on oscillatory membrane in mf of baker s yeast suspension 41 nearly ten fold flux enhancement was achieved relative to the no oscillation baseline i e equivalent to a dead end unit both of the studies haven t performed any energy budget analysis thus we have a nearly unexplored paradigm of membrane technology research lying at the intersection of two standard turbulence promotion approaches i e by dynamic shear enhancement and static turbulence promotion which needs long term systematic investigation to identify the best possible promoter module combination previously we had introduced a new class of dse modules with unique flux regeneration facility by intermediate hydrodynamic cleaning without using any external utility e g cleaning chemicals waster jet commonly needed in backflushing and backwashing external fields ultrasound and electric field and similar others the baseline version was named as spinning basket membrane sbm filtration device 42 44 which was followed by an upgraded intermeshed spinning basket membrane isbm pilot design with superior performance characteristics relative to its touchstone sbm system 45 in this article we have demonstrated the role of turbulence promoters in performance enhancement of the spinning basket group of membrane pilots i e sbm and isbm in protein recovery from synthetic as well as real wastewater simple wire mesh promoters with square and rotated square pitch wire layouts were used performances of both modules with and without the promoters were studied under varied parametric conditions i e the transmembrane pressure tmp the rotational velocity of the basket ω and the feed concentration c0 for synthetic wastewater whereas it is limited to tmp and ω only for real wastewater the transient process characterization study was majorly focused on the flux profiles and observed rejection over the first three sequential filtration cleaning cycles a preliminary cfd analysis was also carried out to compare the performances of two different promoters in turbulence generation the profiles of turbulent kinetic energy k and the rate of energy dissipation ε were investigated under varying parametric conditions further we have also investigated the power budgets to justify the use of such turbulence promoters in the spinning basket group of dse membrane pilots 2 experimental 2 1 materials and analytical techniques 99 pure bsa average molecular weight 66 kda was purchased from srl india the synthetic feed solution was prepared by mixing bsa powder with tris buffer in a stirred tank the buffer contains 0 151 g of tris base per liter of deionized water 46 the ph of this synthetic wastewater was adjusted to 7 2 0 1 the solution was prepared in four different concentrations ranging between 1 4 w sodium azide 0 012 w was added to arrest all probable bacterial growth on the other hand the real wastewater was collected in batches from the inlet to the effluent treatment tank of a local dairy mother dairy haringhata india and refrigerated to preserve over the course of experiment the properties of synthetic wastewater at a concentration of 1 w were chosen for comparing with the real dairy effluent properties this is represented in table 1 the cod was measured using a standard cod analyzer model 9585 rhosonis netherlands the electrical conductivity was estimated by a digital conductivity meter model 304 systronics india and ph was measured by a ph meter alpha 01 electronics india india the dry mass was measured upon drying the sample at 105 c for 5 h in an oven the protein concentration of the synthetic wastewater was measured by a hitachi dual beam uv vis spectrophotometer model u 2800 at 280 nm following the standard protocols of bradford assay 47 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes membrane type hfmtm 100 asymmetric molecular weight cut off mwco 50 kda were procured from koch membrane system usa the membranes were supplied in the form of rectangular flat sheet 1 0 1 0 m2 the corresponding operating pressure and temperature ranges were 210 830 kpa and 5 54 c respectively to investigate the micro morphological changes of the membrane field emission sem model jsm 6700f jeol japan analysis was carried out before and after the synthetic experiments 2 2 sbm and isbm pilots the central element of both the sbm and isbm pilots is the spinning basket the spinning baskets are the unions of four flat rectangular and hollow radial arms flat sheet membranes with an effective area of 0 05 0 10 m2 were fitted on the alternate sides of those radial arms the basket was mounted on a hollow shaft therefore the permeate stream after passing though the membranes drained out through the shaft itself during the filtration run the basket was rotated in a direction such that the membranes were on the leading faces of rotation conversely during the cleaning operations the direction of rotation is reversed with the membranes on the trailing faces of the basket the idea of reverse rotation based cleaning was conceived from the phenomenon of non uniform pressure distribution between the frontal and rear halves of an object moving past a fluid 48 accordingly during the cleaning run a local vacuum is expected to set in over the membrane surface i e trailing face of rotation which will dislodge the accumulated solutes both the pilots operated in continuous filtration cleaning cycles perpetual flux regeneration after every cleaning run is a unique characteristic of the spinning basket group of filtration modules other dse modules reported so far are devoid of such flux regeneration facility the bench scale sbm pilot consisted of a single spinning basket fig 1 a the basket shaft assembly was placed within a cylindrical housing with a narrow clearance 6 mm between the arm tip and the inner wall of the casing the isbm module was an upgraded version of the baseline sbm pilot it comprised two such spinning baskets which were intermeshed by means of two spur gears with involute teeth the gears were placed outside the housing and were integrally mounted on the parallel shafts of the two baskets by key joints fig 1 b naturally the baskets were subjected to rotate in opposite directions with equal speed the phase difference between the two baskets was fixed at 450 the whole system with proper sealing arrangement was placed inside ss housing the inner surface of the housing was machined to keep equal clearance at all points with respect to the basket arm tips power required for rotation was supplied by a three phase 3 hp induction motor for both the pilots the induction motor was fitted with a variable speed drive abb ip20 ul open type which can also revert the direction of rotation power transmission was facilitated by a belt pulley drive for isbm pilot the pulley was mounted on one of the shafts i e the driver shaft and power transmission to the other shaft i e the driven shaft was accomplished by the gear drive placing of the membranes on the alternate sides of the basket mounted on the driven shaft was just the opposite to that of the basket on the driver shaft to have all the eight membranes on the leading face of rotation during the filtration runs fig 1 b the filtration bench common to both the modules is shown in fig 1 c the feed solution was delivered by a triplex piston pump the bypass and the retentate lines were fitted with two needle valves those valves were simultaneously operated to control the tmp and the flow rate the flow rate was obtained from the rotameter fitted in the retentate line 2 3 turbulence promoters simple ss wire type turbulence promoters with square and rotated square pitch arrangements were chosen for the present investigation fig 2 the wire diameter was fixed at 1 mm the size was so chosen to prevent any alteration in the accessible membrane area relative to that without promoters however the wire diameter was not reduced further to avoid any flow induced mechanical damage both the wire layouts were welded to 8 mm thick rectangular ss frames the frames were further bolted on the rectangular flanges used to attach the membranes on the spinning baskets of both the pilots the promoters were fabricated in the departmental workshop of chemical engineering university of calcutta similar type of wire mesh promoters were used by rai et al in cross flow uf of depectinized mosambi juice 49 however the promoter consisted of laterally positioned wires which were arranged parallelly along the width of the channel 2 4 design of experiments performances of both sbm and isbm modules were characterized with and without the two types of promoters upon systematically varying the process parameters the parametric states for all experiments with synthetic wastewater are described in table 2 corresponding parametric ranges were tmp kpa 101 3 405 3 c0 w of bsa 1 4 and ω rad sec 1 10 47 41 9 for real wastewater the same ranges of tmp and ω were used our previous studies indicate the performances of both the pilots were independent of the feed flow rate 42 45 therefore the flow rate was held constant 1 0 10 4 m3 s 1 for all the experimental runs the modules were operated in a cyclic fashion with every filtration run followed by a counter rotation based cleaning operation each filtration run was continued until the respective quasi steady state was reached on the other hand every cleaning run was conducted for 300 s the cleaning time was kept unchanged as used in our previous studies 42 45 however the rotational speed for all cleaning runs was arbitrarily fixed at the highest parametric value of the filtration experiments 41 9 rad s 1 though in the opposite direction the whole process was continued for three successive runs intervened by two cleaning operations in between the same procedure was repeated for each experiment with a fixed set of parametric conditions we have also conducted a new set of experiments to investigate the long term performance characteristics of baseline and promoter fitted configurations at different tmp each experiment consists of ten consecutive filtration cleaning runs and the total duration was 20 h 50 min 2 5 experimental procedure flat sheet virgin membranes total area 0 06 0 11 m2 were initially fixed by rectangular flanges over the rectangular arms of the basket the promoters were fixed on the rectangular flanges by stud joint this was followed by membrane compaction with deionized water at 608 kpa the compaction pressure was kept higher than the highest operating tmp used in the characterization experiments 405 3 kpa compaction was continued till the three successive water fluxes were nearly identical next the module was switched to filtration mode the needle valves in bypass and retentate lines were kept completely open in the beginning of filtration both the valves were adjusted to fix the tmp and the flow rate once the feed solution started flowing steadily through the module 10 cm3 of permeate sample was periodically collected to measure the flux and the permeate concentration both the retentate and permeate was recirculated back to the feed tank after necessary measurements the ph of the feed solution was also measured intermittently and adjusted at its set point i e ph 7 2 0 1 once the three successive flux readings were nearly identical which signified the respective quasi steady state the module was switched to cleaning mode no permeate was generated during cleaning as the tmp was completely released i e tmp 0 kpa the total energy budgets of membrane pilots were estimated by summing up the individual requirements of the motor that drives the spinning basket a standard single phase wattmeter 225 caps electa model no ce 0102eml was used to measure power usage of feed pump whereas a three phase bench top power meter hioki model no pw3337 03 was employed to estimate the power consumption of 3 phase 3 hp induction motor 2 6 cfd simulation in the previous studies we have simulated the hydrodynamic profiles of the sbm and isbm modules 42 45 for both the cases steady and incompressible flow of newtonian fluid in turbulent regime was considered pressure inlet condition was used along with the assumption of no slip at all the solid boundaries the simulations were performed according to the realizable k ε model because of its better acceptance in flows that involve rotation boundary layer separation vortexing and recirculation 50 reported simulations were completely grid independent presently we have extended the baseline simulations without promoter to the promoter fitted configurations we have specifically focused on the profiles of shear stress turbulence kinetic energy i e k 1 2 i u i 2 and kinetic energy dissipation rate i e ε 2 ν i j e ij e ij where e ij 1 2 u i x j u j x i on both membrane and promoter surfaces the primary underlying motive was to compare the efficacies of the two promoters in shear production and turbulence generation adding up to an eventual correlation between the outcomes and respective flux profiles similar to the previous studies we have used the adaptive grid generation scheme accordingly finer grids were used close to the solid surfaces and the cells were progressively enlarged away with an expansion factor varying between 0 7 and 1 3 51 the entire simulation was performed in the coupled solver of gambit version 2 3 and fluent version 6 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 cfd simulation the basic objective of the hydrodynamic simulation was to understand how the two different promoters augment the turbulence production in the spinning basket group of membrane modules in all dse modules turbulence promotion is generally estimated by the shear stress as high shear generation in the vicinity of the membrane is regarded as a signature of this specific class of membrane pilots 29 additionally the kinetic energy dissipation contour over the membrane surface is also used as a standard measure of turbulence production 52 nevertheless before focusing on the membrane surface the overall hydrodynamic profile must be analyzed especially in terms of the velocity field prevailing in the default interior of the modules the velocity field simulation is considered as a common entry point in understanding the gross hydrodynamic picture of any process device 45 the simulated velocity fields v x in the default interiors of the sbm and isbm modules fig 3 were independent of tmp c0 and the types of currently used turbulence promoters however v x strongly depends on ω for all parametric conditions v x exhibited large spatial variations high velocity regions were mostly localized over the feed inlet retentate outlet arm tips and intermeshed region only in case of isbm the distributions represent high rates of kinetic energy transport from inlet to outlet because of the basket rotation the high kinetic energy of the feed jet was rapidly swept by the basket arms to facilitate its mixing with the primary flow the primary flow was principally generated by the high speed basket rotation only essentially the respective flow may be simulated in batch mode without any inlet or outlet streams as discussed in previous reports 42 45 the mixing of the feed jet with such primary flow leads to the generation of asymmetric secondary flows consisting of vortices wakes and complex reversed flow the asymmetry was further intensified in case of isbm especially because of its intermeshed region the narrow gap between the arm tips of the two baskets fig 3 b naturally promotes a lubrication flow through the corresponding v shaped channel thus interaction of the lubrication flow i e contraction and expansion with the surrounding vortices and circulating streamlines is supposed to largely intensify the turbulence production in the bulk regions furthermore the average velocity magnitude in isbm was more than two folds higher than that in sbm higher velocity magnitude actually resulted because of the counter rotation of the intermeshed baskets the liquid is swept by both the baskets collectively which intensifies the corresponding rate of displacement and therefore increases the velocity magnitude the average velocity magnitude was also noted to be nearly doubled for an increase of the rotational speed from 10 47 rad s 1 to 41 9 rad s 1 for both sbm and isbm though the directional profiles of velocity mostly remained unaltered overall our findings suggest gross velocity field intensification in isbm relative to the baseline sbm module under identical parametric conditions necessarily higher velocity magnitude indicates a state of elevated shear considering the no slip boundary condition yet the apprehended high shear production has to be validated from the shear profile only which is subsequently elaborated the velocity field of both modules could be effectively controlled upon changing the rotational speed of the baskets the contours of shear stress on the membrane surface unambiguously point out the efficacies of both promoters fig 4 the shear profiles on the promoters are also included in the same figure the rotated square pitch promoters were found to generate maximum shear stress for both modules and similar to the velocity field isbm pilot was able to produce approximately 130 higher average shear stress than the single basket sbm unit in any turbulent flow the observed shear stress is contributed by diffusive and eddy transport of momentum i e τ ij obs 2 μ e ij ρ 0 u i u j where e ij 1 2 u i x j u j x i close to the solid boundary the effect of reynolds stress components ρ 0 u i u j is practically insignificant however in the current design the wire type promoters were fixed close to the membrane surface 5 mm therefore the combined effect of boundary layer separation from the wire surface and the reflected flow from the basket wall is expected to produce high reynolds stress even close to the membranes the rotated square pitch arrangement must have favoured such type of flow separation induced production of eddies relative to the ordinary square pitch design which led to a higher shear production similar profiles were obtained atω 41 9 rad s 1 nevertheless the mean shear stress for all cases was found to be 1 7 2 4 times higher than the same at 10 47 rad s 1 the profiles of turbulence generation of the two promoters in the spinning basket modules were further compared in terms of the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate ε the kinetic energy cascade down from the larger to the smaller eddies following an inviscid pathway 53 at the characteristic kolmogorov microscale η the cascaded kinetic energy finally dissipates into heat 54 the rate of such dissipation is frequently chosen as a measure of turbulence production therefore the contours of ε and the respective mean values for the two promoters in sbm and isbm modules were considered for a comparative analysis fig 5 the results show a sharp increase of average dissipation rate ε with the attachment of promoters especially in case of the sbm pilot moreover ε on the membrane surface was also noted to increase by 18 for rotated square pitch promoter relative to the normal square pitch on the other hand for isbm the relative increase was limited to 3 5 only the low relative increase of ε may be attributed to the high baseline value of mean dissipation rate in isbm without promoters fig 5 b the profiles on the promoter surfaces are pretty consistent with the profiles on the membranes overall the outcomes of the cfd simulation signify a superior performance of the rotated square pitch promoter in both sbm and isbm modules relative to the normal square pitch design the profiles of the shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate indicate a state of high turbulence production with the rotated square pitch promoter nevertheless the efficacies are to be finally confirmed in terms of the corresponding flux profile with the synthetic and real wastewater feed which are presented in the next section 3 2 studies with synthetic wastewater 3 2 1 flux profiles a declining transient flux profile was observed for the baseline sbm and isbm modules in all filtration runs conducted under different parametric conditions tmp ω and c0 the trend perfectly corroborates with the previous reports 42 45 the flux stabilized to a quasi steady state after 120 min for every cycle demarcating the end of the filtration run and the need to switch to the cleaning mode both the quasi steady as well as the regenerated flux was higher for the baseline isbm than sbm due to the enhanced membrane shear generated by intermeshing of spinning baskets to further intensify the shear field turbulence promoters were integrated with both filtration pilots the immediate outcome is observed as a superior performance in terms of solvent flux the quasi steady stabilization occurred at much higher flux values and the flux regenerations after cleaning were also found to be higher apprehensively the promoters contribute to enhance the membrane shear further and hence the respective back transport was higher enabling better solute dislodging this perceived effect can be evidently correlated to the increased shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates predicted in the preceding section fig 6 shows the variation of the permeate flux for three consecutive filtration runs each of 120 min duration with two intermediate cleaning runs of nearly 5 min each for sbm fig 6 a i to a iii and isbm fig 6 b i to b iii pilots at four different tmps ω 20 95 rad s 1 and c0 2 w the three sets of profiles i e i ii and iii distinguish the observations for baseline square pitch and rotated square pitch promoter attached configurations increasing the tmp is always associated with flux enhancement in any pressure driven membrane separation processes 8 and such is the overall trend observed here as well for example the quasi steady flux j t 120 min at the end of first filtration run was observed to increase by 45 67 for a change of tmp from 101 3 kpa to 405 3 kpa in case of baseline sbm pilot however a comparative performance analysis between the three different configurations in two modules is of greater consequence for the sbm module j t 120 min was found to increase from 2 16 10 5m3m 2s 1in baseline to 3 7 10 5m3m 2s 1with square pitch and 4 53 10 5m3m 2s 1with rotated square pitch promoters at tmp 101 3 kpa a similar trend was followed for other values of tmp imperatively the performance based on j t 120 min in case of isbm pilot was mostly akin sbm except for the overall higher flux due to enhanced shear generation an increase from 5 67 10 5m3m 2s 1 to 9 53 10 5m3m 2s 1 and finally 12 89 10 5m3m 2s 1 was observed at tmp 101 3 kpa for the baseline square pitch and rotated square pitch promoter fitted configurations we have also evaluated the corresponding fouling resistance according to the well known resistance in series model j tmp μ r m r f where μ is the viscosity rm is the hydraulic resistance of the virgin membrane and rf is the fouling resistance 45 rm was evaluated from pure water run with a virgin membrane at different tmp and we found rm 1 68 1012 m 1 fig 7 depicts the transient profiles of rf for the baseline and rotated square pitch promoter fitted configurations only all rf profiles were observed to grow with time before levelling off to the respective quasi steady value at t 120 min the profiles are perfectly consistent with those of flux as shown in fig 6 the quasi steady rf values of the baseline sbm at different tmp were found to be lowest because of its low shear production rate relative to other configurations fig 4 on the other hand the rf profiles of rotated square pitch promoter integrated sbm pilot fig 7 a ii were pretty similar to those of the baseline isbm module fig 7 b i which once again justifies the promoter based process intensification scheme of dse filtration pilots the rotated square pitch promoter fitted isbm unit apprehended to be the best configuration of the present lot in terms of all quality functions e g flux and shear generation was able to restrict rf t 120 min within 2 5 1012 m 1 even at tmp 405 5 kpa the profiles of j t 120 min with respect to the tmp for all configurations are shown in fig 8 a the plot is specifically useful in comparing the efficacies of shear generation and turbulence production between the two competing strategies basket intermeshing and turbulence promoter integration the promoter is not expected to increase the power consumption significantly on the other hand the process intensification from sbm to isbm unit i e by basket intermeshing is energy intensive the detailed power budget has been discussed later therefore the performance upgradation of sbm by promoter attachment is the preferred cost effective pathway provided the flux produced is close to that of the baseline isbm module the profiles of j t 120 min clearly revealed that the sbm module with rotated square pitch promoter is closely equivalent to the isbm unit without promoter over 101 3 405 1 kpa j t 120 min of the rotated square pitch promoter fitted sbm unit was 82 87 of the j t 120 min produced by the isbm module similar trend was followed at other parametric conditions as well thus flux enhancement of sbm by promoter attachment is economically advantageous over additional basket intermeshing strategy i e sbm to isbm unit the j t 120 min versus tmp profiles exhibited piece wise linear growth with decreasing growth rate with tmp the trend clearly indicates the approach towards the so called limiting flux 55 the quasi steady flux enhancements for sbm pilot were 40 355 and 64 445 for square and rotated square pitch promoters respectively over the entire parametric space in case of the isbm unit the corresponding ranges were 68 192 and 112 335 as mentioned earlier the flux enhancement reported by sen et al in uf of bsa glucose using a rd membrane pilot fitted with vane type turbulence promoters was limited to 50 only another study reported cross flow filtration units fitted with the turbulence promoters to exhibit a flux enhancement up to 700 in uf of skimmed milk 37 nevertheless the respective feed to retentate pressure drop was also increased by 300 resulting in a proportionate increase of the pumping cost however for spinning basket group the overall power consumption maximally increased by 9 only as elaborated later moreover the baseline flux in any dse module is at least ten fold higher than an equivalent cross flow unit 29 an alternative representation style namely the phase plane plot i e j t versus dj dt plot was also included in fig 8 to realize the dynamic effects of promoter attachment in general the phase plane formalism finds common use in non linear analysis 56 presently we have used it to capture a holistic picture of the non linear transience over the first three filtration cycles for all cases under study the phase plane plots assumed an open rectangular shape with a gradual shift towards the lower side values of flux the horizontal arm at the bottom represents the extent of flux decline in a filtration run whereas the top horizontal arm depicts the flux regeneration on cleaning the connecting vertical arms indicate the switch from the filtration to the cleaning mode and vice versa we have included the phase plane plots of three configurations in both modules for a specific parametric condition tmp 304 0 kpa c0 2 w and ω 20 95 rad s 1 only the trend of mean flux over the three filtration cycles j was similar to the quasi steady flux at t 120 min for example j of the sbm module was recorded to increase by 76 and 116 for the square pitch and rotated square pitch promoters respectively which are well within the corresponding ranges of quasi steady flux enhancement additionally the plots also indicate the proximity of the flux profiles obtained from rotated square pitch integrated sbm module and the isbm pilot without promoters this observation evidently points out the advantages of energy inexpensive process intensification of sbm by promoter attachment over the power and capital cost intensive basket intermeshing the variation of the flux profiles with ω for three different configurations in both modules were also investigated the flux was noted to significantly increase with ω in all six cases for example in the baseline designs j t 120 min increased by 113 and 116 in sbm and isbm pilots respectively for a change of ω from 10 49 rad s 1 to 41 9 rad s 1 the corresponding enhancements with the square pitch promoters were 125 and 129 whereas for the rotated square pitch the quasi steady flux exhibited a maximum two and half fold growth in isbm module high rotational speed is apprehended to increase the shear induced back transport flux and thus restricts the growth of the rejected solute layer the transient flux profiles with changing ω for all configurations are elaborately discussed in the supplementary section s 1 in general increasing c0 results in an increase in the membrane rejection perceived through a greater solute accumulation on the membrane surface this is associated with a decreasing permeate flux an overall transition of the blocking filtration regime from the initial complete blocking to the cake filtration close to the so called quasi steady state has been confirmed for the baseline isbm in uf of bsa 45 the trend implies that the effect of increasing c0 becomes most conspicuous at the quasi steady state with maximum loss of flux thus the favorable role of the turbulence promoters is expected to be better understood at the quasi steady state fig 9 depicts the quasi steady flux profiles with respect to c0 over the entire range of tmp the j t 120 min exhibited a universal declining profile with c0 nevertheless the promoters were able to significantly damp the decreasing trend the isbm pilot operating at 202 7 kpa exhibited 43 decline of jt 120 min for a change of c0 from 1 w to 4 w at ω 20 95 rad s 1 whereas the same module integrated with rotated square pitch promoter was able to limit the decline within 5 only similar trend was exhibited by the isbm module as well fig 9 b i to b iii the sbm pilot on promoter attachment was observed to exhibit maximum enhancement of j t 120 min relative to the isbm unit additionally the flux obtained from the sbm unit with the rotated square pitch promoter under certain parametric conditions was found to be overlapping and even slightly higher than the isbm pilot which simply reiterates the advantages of promoter attachment strategy over basket intermeshing 3 2 2 modes of fouling the flux profiles under different parametric conditions were further expected to identify the dominant fouling mechanism fouling models constitute one of the fundamental approaches of membrane modeling the primary objective was to identify the membrane solute interaction pattern classically four different regimes of filtration were postulated by hermia and breedee in explaining the flux profiles obtained from an elementary dead end module 57 an informative review about the origin applicability and limitations of these models were presented by iritani 58 the models are very briefly described in table 3 the blocking models have been successfully applied to cross flow systems after necessary modifications 58 zhang and ding first applied blocking filtration models to characterize the performance of a rd module 59 high r2 0 98 of the respective linear regression clearly indicates the relevance of the classical blocking models in describing the governing fouling mechanism of a dse filtration system accordingly we have also chosen four classical blocking models to investigate their applicability in all present configurations the linear fits of the transformed datasets e g ln j versus t in case of complete blocking were tested in terms of r2 the dataset consists of the flux versus time profiles for the first filtration run only obtained from ten different filtration cleaning experiments described in table 1 the datasets and the linear fits for the baseline sbm and its two promoter fitted configurations are shown in fig 10 similar plots for all configurations associated to isbm are presented in supplementary section s 2 all r2 data table s1 unambiguously justify the complete blocking model to best describe the state of fouling in every configurations r2 0 88 the second highest r2 0 74 was identified for the cake filtration model the result implies a physical picture of complete blocking for most of the membrane surface only over some selected regions we may apprehend cake build up closer investigation revealed enhanced applicability of the cake filtration model in baseline modules which simply reflects a state of relatively low shear production compared to promoter integrated configurations 3 2 3 membrane morphology fesem images of the membrane surface after the first filtration run implies relatively intense fouling in the baseline pilots fig 11 b i and c i compared to the promoter fitted configurations fig 11 b ii and c ii photomicrograph of the virgin membrane is also included in the same figure fig 11 a morphologically minimum fouling was observed for the promoter integrated isbm module because of its high shear production overall the findings are pretty consistent with the outcomes of the blocking mode analysis localized grey patches in the fesem images possibly indicate mono layered complete blocking regions superimposed with partial multi layered cake build up the physical picture has been schematized in fig 11 d 3 2 4 long term performance characterization the spinning basket group of membrane pilots were claimed to perpetually regenerate the solvent flux by their in built hydrodynamic cleaning facility however all flux profiles reported so far only includes the first three filtration cleaning cycles the total span was 370 min which includes three filtration runs each of 120 min duration and two intermediate cleaning runs of total 10 min duration thus it is impossible to predict the so called long term performance characteristics from the three consecutive filtration cleaning cycles only blanpain avet et al have recommended that a long term study must consist of at least ten filtration cleaning cycles 60 standard chemical cleaning method with sodium hydroxide and nitric acid solutions was used to clean a mf membrane fouled by whey protein concentrate 3 5 w the flux recovery was observed to vary within 72 94 of the corresponding initial flux recorded at the beginning of the first filtration run j0 each filtration run was continued for 90 min whereas the cleaning run duration was varied within 5 20 min in any dairy industry the time span of membrane cleaning generally depends on the feed quality and the size of the plant the duration usually varies between 5 and 20 min 61 thus the time spans of individual filtration and cleaning runs as used in the present study are seemingly consistent with other reports following the criterion of long term performance characterization we have also conducted a set of new experiments consisting of ten consecutive filtration cleaning cycles under different tmp the total run time for each experiment was nearly 21 h the profiles of the initial and the regenerated i e after every cleaning run flux values for all configurations are depicted in fig 12 in all cases the regenerated flux after 21 h was found to vary within 74 88 of j0 the two baseline modules exhibited relatively lower flux regenerations i e 0 74j0 0 82j0 which imply the promoters to be instrumental even during the cleaning runs promoter induced local turbulence must have amplified the solute dislodging capacity of the pressure draft generated because of the reverse spinning of the baskets in all cleaning runs high flux regeneration characteristics even after 20 h filtration and 50 min cleaning in treatment of fouling prone food wastewater clearly signifies the novelty of promoter based process intensification of spinning basket membrane pilots the result implies that the promoter fitted sbm and isbm modules are to be specifically suitable in real life treatment of concentrated and heavy fouling feeds including protein solutions phytochemicals food wastewater oil water emulsions black liquors and many others 3 2 5 observed rejection the effects of promoter attachment to the spinning basket membrane pilots was further investigated by measuring the observed rejection r 0 1 c p c 0 where c p is the solute concentration in the permeate at the end of first filtration run we have specifically explored the role of promoters at different tmp and ω the 3d mesh plots fig 13 of r0 t 120 min with respect to tmp and ω portray an almost linear trend r2 0 92 evidently the rejection was observed to increase with tmp and decrease with ω in all configurations for both modules any increase in the tmp is expected to result in higher solute rejection the rejected solute accumulates on the membrane surface primarily according to the complete blocking picture which may lead to cake layer built ups over some regions fig 11 d the solute layer naturally gives rise to an additional mass transfer resistance in series with the membrane fig 7 the enhanced resistance is responsible for the increase in observed rejection upon reducing the concentration of solute in the permeate stream on the contrary filtration with increased ω intensifies the solute back transport and hinders the growth of the same layer resulting in a low quasi steady r0 promoters are apprehended to perturb the quasi steady r0 of the baseline modules by further augmenting the solute scoop up the increased rate of solute back transport reduces the deposited layer thickness δ and subsequently the mass transfer resistance δ d where d is the diffusivity in the deposited layer thus the solute transport through the combined mass transfer resistances in series consisting of the deposited solute layer and the membrane increased with promoter attachment which consequently reduced r0 for example in the sbm module r0 t 120 min decreased from 98 5 in the baseline version to 91 in the rotated square pitch fitted configuration at ω 10 49 rad s 1 and tmp 405 3 kpa similar trends were followed by other configurations as well nevertheless a damping effect on the role of promoters on quasi steady r0 was noted at high ω which indicates a high shear generation and shear induced protein transport from the membrane surface to the bulk irrespective of chosen promoter geometry the promoters simply amplify the rate of shear generation to an extent that finally causes further reduction of the r0 t 120 min overall the study with synthetic wastewater unambiguously justifies the process intensification of the spinning basket group of membrane pilots by turbulence promoters a maximum of five and a half fold flux enhancement was obtained with the rotated square pitch configuration however the beneficial role of the promoters was investigated further with the real dairy effluent to fully understand the scope of the current process upgradation the outcomes of this characterization study i e sbm and isbm pilots with two different wire type promoters are discussed in the next section 3 3 studies with real wastewater the experiments with the real wastewater i e the dairy effluent before treatment were conducted at two extreme process conditions of tmp and ω for the first set of experiments tmp and ω were maintained at 101 3 kpa and 10 47 rad s 1 respectively in the second set experiments were carried out at the highest possible parametric values i e tmp 405 3 kpa and ω 41 9 rad s 1 moreover we have only focused on the quasi steady state values of flux and permeate cod for the three different configurations of both modules the j t 120 min profiles fig 14 a i and a ii almost replicate the trend for synthetic wastewater from baseline to the rotated square pitch promoter integrated configuration the increase of j t 120 minwas recorded to vary between 90 and 204 for sbm and 82 123 for isbm pilots furthermore the absolute flux values with real wastewater were also observed to follow the same order of magnitude as that of the synthetic feed notwithstanding the much lower protein concentration in real samples in this context it is imperative to note that the cod of 1 w synthetic wastewater is eighty three folds higher than the real effluent s cod table 1 the order of magnitude similarity between synthetic and real wastewater fluxes can be understood from their respective fouling mechanisms the dairy wastewater contains much less organic matter and inorganic salt compounds compared to the bsa water synthetic feed solution additionally the real dairy effluent is quite heterogeneous in composition consisting of lactose salts proteins and lipids 62 the protein constituents can be majorly classified into casein and whey proteins α lactalbumin α la β lactoglobulin β lg bsa and immunoglobulin ig casein contributes to 80 of the total protein content in milk and hence forms the major protein fraction of the dairy effluent as well the ph of the effluent is alkaline 9 2 caused by the use of alkaline solutions as cleaning agents 63 considering the reported constituents of the dairy effluent a paradigm shift from the case of synthetic wastewater may be expected in the respective fouling process in synthetic wastewater filtration fouling was triggered by accumulation and subsequent adsorption of bsa on the membrane surface the fouling regime investigation of isbm unit already revealed a transition from the mono layered complete blocking to the multi layered cake filtration regime towards the quasi steady state 45 in spite of partial alleviation of the cake layer resistance in promoter fitted configurations the cake filtration regime may still be apprehended to prevail at the quasi steady state on the other hand in case of real wastewater lactose α la and β lg will pass through the membrane owing to their smaller molecular size compared to the pore size thus membrane fouling must be caused majorly by casein and the larger sized whey proteins i e bsa and ig casein in aqueous medium embedded with calcium phosphate exists in the form of large colloidal particles commonly referred to as casein micelles 64 electron microscopic investigations revealed the size of the casein micelles to fall in the range of 50 500 nm 65 however despite extensive research the exact structure of a casein micelle is still under debate according to the most accepted model proposed by horne the casein micelle consists of a gel like internal core made of α casein and microgranular calcium phosphate 66 the external shell of the micelle is composed of a proteinaceous hairy layer of κ casein therefore we may expect two types of fouling phenomena mediated by casein whey protein and casein membrane interactions in the first type the micelle s κ casein bush layer is apprehended to bridge with the tails and loops of the adsorbed whey proteins whereas in the second case the external κ casein may anchor directly on the membrane itself fig 15 the strong protein bridging interactions among the casein micelle the adsorbed whey protein and the membrane is expected to trigger a multi layered cake filtration type fouling regime at the quasi steady state which finally results in the low permeate throughput moreover the polarized casein layer is thicker in case of real wastewater as the diffusion coefficient of casein micelle is approximately twenty fold lower than the whey proteins 63 thus the overall effect of fouling in real wastewater becomes equivalent to the high concentration synthetic feed solution which explains the similar flux magnitudes in two cases the detailed mechanism of fouling is discussed in the supplementary section s 3 the quasi steady cod profiles of the permeate stream are also included in the same figure fig 14 b the permeate cod was noted to vary within 243 312 mg o2 l 1 and 262 335 mg o2 l 1 for sbm and isbm respectively the high cod of permeate stream was majorly due to the unhindered percolation of smaller sized proteins i e α la and β lg the cod exhibited an increasing trend in promoter attached configurations which is quite similar to the increase of observed rejection in synthetic wastewater experiments promoter induced local turbulence seems to be effective in dislodging the accumulated casein and high molecular weight whey proteins consequently the mass transfer resistances of the polarized and the fouling layer have decreased which allows the higher throughput of low molecular weight proteins through the membrane leading to an increase of the corresponding cod values the promoter based upgradation of both sbm and isbm was confirmed to be highly effective in treatment of real dairy effluent even under the limited set of parametric conditions the quasi steady flux enhancements for both modules were pretty high nevertheless to fully establish the efficacy of promoter based process intensification energy budget analysis is indispensable we have restricted the said analysis to synthetic wastewater only as the gross outcomes were comparable to the real wastewater experiments the trends of the energy usage are elaborated in the next section 3 4 energy budget our previous analysis clearly revealed that the major part of the energy is consumed by the driver motor connected to the spinning basket the residual amount is used by the feed pump closer inspection indicates that 80 86 of energy is consumed by the motor moreover a large fraction of the energy supplied to the motor is used to overcome the mechanical friction specifically localized over the shaft staffing box contact region therefore even in a dry run nearly 66 74 of the energy was reported to be consumed by the motor 43 45 the feed pump consumes 14 20 of the total energy budget to deliver the feed against the high pressure tmp regarding the parametric dependence it was reported that the overall consumption pattern was strongly influenced by tmp and ω while the role of feed concentration was nearly insignificant in the current study we have extended the power usage analysis to understand the role of promoters in altering the energy budget of the baseline pilots in all promoter fitted configurations the increase of energy uptake with respect to the baseline designs was limited to 9 only the increase may be attributed to the increased drag offered by the promoters the promoter wires are supposed to trigger localized wake formation because of the boundary layer separations in the space between the promoter and the membrane the boundary layer separation essentially augments the retarding drag as the basket is rotated at high speed the enhanced drag subsequently increases the retarding torque t and eventually the power consumed by the motor as e motor tω however a low percentage increase of e motor in promoter fitted configurations essentially signifies insignificant upscaling of the retarding drag thus we may apprehend the drag to be majorly contributed by the boundary layer separation at the edges of the spinning basket which is partially reflected in the velocity vector profiles fig 3 considering the similar trends of energy usage between the baseline and the promoter fitted configurations we have planned to represent the profiles in terms of the specific energy budget i e the energy consumed per unit volume of the permeate at the quasi steady state in whl 1 the variations of the specific energy budget with tmp and ω for all configurations are depicted in fig 16 a and b for sbm and isbm respectively both spinning basket modules exhibited a drastic reduction of the specific energy budget upon promoter attachment for instance in the configuration with rotated square pitch the specific energy consumption in sbm was 56 61 lower relative to the baseline module similarly for isbm pilot the corresponding reduction was estimated to vary within 64 70 furthermore the specific energy usage showed a decreasing trend with ω and increased with tmp nevertheless the rate of change with tmp and ω largely damped down in promoter fitted configurations this approximate invariance of the specific energy usage is definitely advantageous from the economic perspective as it expands the feasible parametric space and improves the flexibility of operation 4 conclusion the study demonstrates the applications of simple wire type turbulence promoters in the spinning basket group of dynamic shear enhanced membrane pilots and a detailed account of enhanced fouling mitigation was presented in protein recovery from wastewater by ultrafiltration the cfd simulation of all promoter fitted configurations showed significant increase of shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate at the membrane surface relative to the baseline designs this was followed by varied sets of experiments with synthetic and real dairy effluents which includes standard parametric investigations analysis of fouling regime membrane morphology power budget and the long term 21 h performance characterization in the first case rotated square pitch promoter integrated modules exhibited the best performance in terms of flux enhancement a nominal increase of 9 in the power budget signifies that the energy economy remained unaffected the promising results yielded by combining two parallel pathways to shear enhancement i e static turbulence promoter and dynamic shear enhancement marks the integrated approach as a new research niche of its own prospects of future research include the use of more complex promoter configurations like twisted tape cylindrical rods with other existing dse modules and

12928,the expected growth of membrane technology in protein recovery from wastewater is largely impeded by operational non idealities like concentration polarization and membrane fouling two independent concepts namely the dynamic shear enhanced dse filtration and turbulence promoters were introduced decades earlier to remediate the problems however no systematic effort was undertaken to explore the synergy of the two process intensification schemes in this study we have investigated the effects of simple wire type turbulence promoter on a specific class of dse membrane modules the spinning basket filtration units the maximum flux improvement with synthetic wastewater i e bovine serum albumin bsa water solution was 445 whereas for the real dairy effluent the respective enhancement levelled off at 204 the lower level of flux enhancement for real wastewater may be attributed to the severe fouling caused by the casein micelle the increase of power consumption in all promoter fitted configurations was limited to 9 only thus turbulence promoter integrated spinning basket group of membrane modules are confirmed to be much superior relative to other devices in protein recovery from wastewater our results are also supported by corroborating computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations of elevated shear and high turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates for all promoter fitted configurations the present outcomes clearly recommend the application of turbulence promoters in dse modules to maximally increase the protein recovery from wastewater even at concentrations where the standard cross flow systems are apprehended to be non functional graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords spinning basket membrane turbulence promoter permeate flux dairy effluent energy budget cfd 1 introduction nutrient recovery from industrial wastewater is a fundamental step towards sustainable development 1 several industries generate copious volumes of protein laden wastewater for example 145 million tonnes of whey a by product of cheese and casein manufacture is produced per year worldwide 2 effluent concentration of whey proteins i e α lactalbumin β lactoglobulin bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin typically ranges between 6 and 10 g l 1 3 therefore recovery of whey proteins may largely supplement their demand as food additives and therapeutic drug components furthermore protein recovery is also expected to facilitate the wastewater discharge by reducing the biological oxygen demand bod significantly 4 membrane based separation is undoubtedly the most accepted method of protein recovery of which ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf are most commonly employed 5 8 despite the progress uf and mf suffer from the non idealities of concentration polarization cp and subsequent cp led membrane fouling 9 11 treatment of food wastewater is particularly susceptible to these problems for instance polysaccharide molecules in addition to proteins are found to foul the membrane pervasively 12 factors like size of the foulant also play a key role in the extent of permeability loss 13 14 proteins are known to be typically severe foulants protein fouling exhibits a drastic character transformation from reversible to irreversible owing to the conformational changes in the structure which enables it to intrude into membrane pores and clog them 15 several measures to redress protein fouling have been proposed over decades these include boundary layer manipulation by introducing turbulence promotion 16 pre treating the feed with coagulants 17 membrane surface modification by grafting suitable functional groups 18 and using external stimulations like gas sparging backflushing or applying an electric field i e electroultrafiltration 19 21 other techniques like fabrication of functional membrane materials such as the biomimetic dynamic membrane bdm has also been proved effective 22 23 some of these methods are feed specific while others are more versatile of these turbulence promotion is one of the simplest to implement 24 26 increased degree of turbulence disrupts the polarized layer effectively by solute mixing perpendicular to the membrane surface 27 turbulence promotion can be accomplished either by dynamic shear enhancement i e shear enhancement independent of the feed flow rate or by using the static mixers also known as turbulence promoters 28 the dse membrane filtration devices commonly employ a rotating or reciprocating accessory to produce a feed flow independent high shear field in the membrane surface vicinity rotating disk rd multi shaft disk msd and vibratory shear enhanced processing vsep are some standard examples of dse filtration pilots 29 30 in recent times most of the studies on dse filtration devices are focused on the application perspective for instance the rd pilot was successfully applied to separate lipids from microalgae extracts 31 similarly in another study 85 chemical oxygen demand cod reduction of tannery wastewater was achieved with a vsep filtration device 32 the principle of dynamic shear enhancement was also demonstrated to be effective in membrane cleaning 33 reports on dse filtration modeling are relatively infrequent because of the difficulties involved in describing the complex hydrodynamic environment that commonly prevail in any dse pilots very recently rana et al have presented an elegant mathematical model of the spinning basket filtration unit by analytically solving the convection diffusion equation close to the membrane surface 34 the second approach of turbulence promotion is based on static mixers turbulence promoters turbulence promoters are stationary inserts that induce mixing and disrupt the polarized layer through localized flow perturbation 35 in tubular cross flow membranes the use of simple rods twisted tapes helical screws kenics mixers and static blade mixers as turbulence promoters are quite common nowadays 36 recent trend of research on turbulence promoters signify an increasing application of 3d printing in promoter fabrication the 3d printed promoters were noted to largely reduce the pressure drop relative to their metallic versions 37 application of the 3d printed cylindrical pin type promoters in uf of purple araca fruit extract was observed to produce nearly 80 flux enhancement 38 another recent study on cross flow uf of humic acid with 3d printed turbulence promoters has established the kenics mixer to be the most efficient in terms of flux enhancement as well as from the perspective of specific energy demand 39 literature review indicates that the applications of turbulence promoters are majorly restricted to the cross flow modules even so we may recognize an easy scope of performance upgradation upon integrating a compatible turbulence promoter with a dse filtration module furthermore any promoter coupled dse filtration pilot is expected not to significantly increase the energy demand nevertheless the flux is supposed to increase because of the combined effect of dynamic shear enhancement and static turbulence promotion despite this possibility of marked improvement the scope remained nearly unexplored to the best of our knowledge only two relevant studies were reported so far sen et al were the first to use a rectangular vane type turbulence promoter to upgrade the performance of a rd module in uf of bsa and glucose 40 the other report describes the effect of promoter attachment on oscillatory membrane in mf of baker s yeast suspension 41 nearly ten fold flux enhancement was achieved relative to the no oscillation baseline i e equivalent to a dead end unit both of the studies haven t performed any energy budget analysis thus we have a nearly unexplored paradigm of membrane technology research lying at the intersection of two standard turbulence promotion approaches i e by dynamic shear enhancement and static turbulence promotion which needs long term systematic investigation to identify the best possible promoter module combination previously we had introduced a new class of dse modules with unique flux regeneration facility by intermediate hydrodynamic cleaning without using any external utility e g cleaning chemicals waster jet commonly needed in backflushing and backwashing external fields ultrasound and electric field and similar others the baseline version was named as spinning basket membrane sbm filtration device 42 44 which was followed by an upgraded intermeshed spinning basket membrane isbm pilot design with superior performance characteristics relative to its touchstone sbm system 45 in this article we have demonstrated the role of turbulence promoters in performance enhancement of the spinning basket group of membrane pilots i e sbm and isbm in protein recovery from synthetic as well as real wastewater simple wire mesh promoters with square and rotated square pitch wire layouts were used performances of both modules with and without the promoters were studied under varied parametric conditions i e the transmembrane pressure tmp the rotational velocity of the basket ω and the feed concentration c0 for synthetic wastewater whereas it is limited to tmp and ω only for real wastewater the transient process characterization study was majorly focused on the flux profiles and observed rejection over the first three sequential filtration cleaning cycles a preliminary cfd analysis was also carried out to compare the performances of two different promoters in turbulence generation the profiles of turbulent kinetic energy k and the rate of energy dissipation ε were investigated under varying parametric conditions further we have also investigated the power budgets to justify the use of such turbulence promoters in the spinning basket group of dse membrane pilots 2 experimental 2 1 materials and analytical techniques 99 pure bsa average molecular weight 66 kda was purchased from srl india the synthetic feed solution was prepared by mixing bsa powder with tris buffer in a stirred tank the buffer contains 0 151 g of tris base per liter of deionized water 46 the ph of this synthetic wastewater was adjusted to 7 2 0 1 the solution was prepared in four different concentrations ranging between 1 4 w sodium azide 0 012 w was added to arrest all probable bacterial growth on the other hand the real wastewater was collected in batches from the inlet to the effluent treatment tank of a local dairy mother dairy haringhata india and refrigerated to preserve over the course of experiment the properties of synthetic wastewater at a concentration of 1 w were chosen for comparing with the real dairy effluent properties this is represented in table 1 the cod was measured using a standard cod analyzer model 9585 rhosonis netherlands the electrical conductivity was estimated by a digital conductivity meter model 304 systronics india and ph was measured by a ph meter alpha 01 electronics india india the dry mass was measured upon drying the sample at 105 c for 5 h in an oven the protein concentration of the synthetic wastewater was measured by a hitachi dual beam uv vis spectrophotometer model u 2800 at 280 nm following the standard protocols of bradford assay 47 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes membrane type hfmtm 100 asymmetric molecular weight cut off mwco 50 kda were procured from koch membrane system usa the membranes were supplied in the form of rectangular flat sheet 1 0 1 0 m2 the corresponding operating pressure and temperature ranges were 210 830 kpa and 5 54 c respectively to investigate the micro morphological changes of the membrane field emission sem model jsm 6700f jeol japan analysis was carried out before and after the synthetic experiments 2 2 sbm and isbm pilots the central element of both the sbm and isbm pilots is the spinning basket the spinning baskets are the unions of four flat rectangular and hollow radial arms flat sheet membranes with an effective area of 0 05 0 10 m2 were fitted on the alternate sides of those radial arms the basket was mounted on a hollow shaft therefore the permeate stream after passing though the membranes drained out through the shaft itself during the filtration run the basket was rotated in a direction such that the membranes were on the leading faces of rotation conversely during the cleaning operations the direction of rotation is reversed with the membranes on the trailing faces of the basket the idea of reverse rotation based cleaning was conceived from the phenomenon of non uniform pressure distribution between the frontal and rear halves of an object moving past a fluid 48 accordingly during the cleaning run a local vacuum is expected to set in over the membrane surface i e trailing face of rotation which will dislodge the accumulated solutes both the pilots operated in continuous filtration cleaning cycles perpetual flux regeneration after every cleaning run is a unique characteristic of the spinning basket group of filtration modules other dse modules reported so far are devoid of such flux regeneration facility the bench scale sbm pilot consisted of a single spinning basket fig 1 a the basket shaft assembly was placed within a cylindrical housing with a narrow clearance 6 mm between the arm tip and the inner wall of the casing the isbm module was an upgraded version of the baseline sbm pilot it comprised two such spinning baskets which were intermeshed by means of two spur gears with involute teeth the gears were placed outside the housing and were integrally mounted on the parallel shafts of the two baskets by key joints fig 1 b naturally the baskets were subjected to rotate in opposite directions with equal speed the phase difference between the two baskets was fixed at 450 the whole system with proper sealing arrangement was placed inside ss housing the inner surface of the housing was machined to keep equal clearance at all points with respect to the basket arm tips power required for rotation was supplied by a three phase 3 hp induction motor for both the pilots the induction motor was fitted with a variable speed drive abb ip20 ul open type which can also revert the direction of rotation power transmission was facilitated by a belt pulley drive for isbm pilot the pulley was mounted on one of the shafts i e the driver shaft and power transmission to the other shaft i e the driven shaft was accomplished by the gear drive placing of the membranes on the alternate sides of the basket mounted on the driven shaft was just the opposite to that of the basket on the driver shaft to have all the eight membranes on the leading face of rotation during the filtration runs fig 1 b the filtration bench common to both the modules is shown in fig 1 c the feed solution was delivered by a triplex piston pump the bypass and the retentate lines were fitted with two needle valves those valves were simultaneously operated to control the tmp and the flow rate the flow rate was obtained from the rotameter fitted in the retentate line 2 3 turbulence promoters simple ss wire type turbulence promoters with square and rotated square pitch arrangements were chosen for the present investigation fig 2 the wire diameter was fixed at 1 mm the size was so chosen to prevent any alteration in the accessible membrane area relative to that without promoters however the wire diameter was not reduced further to avoid any flow induced mechanical damage both the wire layouts were welded to 8 mm thick rectangular ss frames the frames were further bolted on the rectangular flanges used to attach the membranes on the spinning baskets of both the pilots the promoters were fabricated in the departmental workshop of chemical engineering university of calcutta similar type of wire mesh promoters were used by rai et al in cross flow uf of depectinized mosambi juice 49 however the promoter consisted of laterally positioned wires which were arranged parallelly along the width of the channel 2 4 design of experiments performances of both sbm and isbm modules were characterized with and without the two types of promoters upon systematically varying the process parameters the parametric states for all experiments with synthetic wastewater are described in table 2 corresponding parametric ranges were tmp kpa 101 3 405 3 c0 w of bsa 1 4 and ω rad sec 1 10 47 41 9 for real wastewater the same ranges of tmp and ω were used our previous studies indicate the performances of both the pilots were independent of the feed flow rate 42 45 therefore the flow rate was held constant 1 0 10 4 m3 s 1 for all the experimental runs the modules were operated in a cyclic fashion with every filtration run followed by a counter rotation based cleaning operation each filtration run was continued until the respective quasi steady state was reached on the other hand every cleaning run was conducted for 300 s the cleaning time was kept unchanged as used in our previous studies 42 45 however the rotational speed for all cleaning runs was arbitrarily fixed at the highest parametric value of the filtration experiments 41 9 rad s 1 though in the opposite direction the whole process was continued for three successive runs intervened by two cleaning operations in between the same procedure was repeated for each experiment with a fixed set of parametric conditions we have also conducted a new set of experiments to investigate the long term performance characteristics of baseline and promoter fitted configurations at different tmp each experiment consists of ten consecutive filtration cleaning runs and the total duration was 20 h 50 min 2 5 experimental procedure flat sheet virgin membranes total area 0 06 0 11 m2 were initially fixed by rectangular flanges over the rectangular arms of the basket the promoters were fixed on the rectangular flanges by stud joint this was followed by membrane compaction with deionized water at 608 kpa the compaction pressure was kept higher than the highest operating tmp used in the characterization experiments 405 3 kpa compaction was continued till the three successive water fluxes were nearly identical next the module was switched to filtration mode the needle valves in bypass and retentate lines were kept completely open in the beginning of filtration both the valves were adjusted to fix the tmp and the flow rate once the feed solution started flowing steadily through the module 10 cm3 of permeate sample was periodically collected to measure the flux and the permeate concentration both the retentate and permeate was recirculated back to the feed tank after necessary measurements the ph of the feed solution was also measured intermittently and adjusted at its set point i e ph 7 2 0 1 once the three successive flux readings were nearly identical which signified the respective quasi steady state the module was switched to cleaning mode no permeate was generated during cleaning as the tmp was completely released i e tmp 0 kpa the total energy budgets of membrane pilots were estimated by summing up the individual requirements of the motor that drives the spinning basket a standard single phase wattmeter 225 caps electa model no ce 0102eml was used to measure power usage of feed pump whereas a three phase bench top power meter hioki model no pw3337 03 was employed to estimate the power consumption of 3 phase 3 hp induction motor 2 6 cfd simulation in the previous studies we have simulated the hydrodynamic profiles of the sbm and isbm modules 42 45 for both the cases steady and incompressible flow of newtonian fluid in turbulent regime was considered pressure inlet condition was used along with the assumption of no slip at all the solid boundaries the simulations were performed according to the realizable k ε model because of its better acceptance in flows that involve rotation boundary layer separation vortexing and recirculation 50 reported simulations were completely grid independent presently we have extended the baseline simulations without promoter to the promoter fitted configurations we have specifically focused on the profiles of shear stress turbulence kinetic energy i e k 1 2 i u i 2 and kinetic energy dissipation rate i e ε 2 ν i j e ij e ij where e ij 1 2 u i x j u j x i on both membrane and promoter surfaces the primary underlying motive was to compare the efficacies of the two promoters in shear production and turbulence generation adding up to an eventual correlation between the outcomes and respective flux profiles similar to the previous studies we have used the adaptive grid generation scheme accordingly finer grids were used close to the solid surfaces and the cells were progressively enlarged away with an expansion factor varying between 0 7 and 1 3 51 the entire simulation was performed in the coupled solver of gambit version 2 3 and fluent version 6 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 cfd simulation the basic objective of the hydrodynamic simulation was to understand how the two different promoters augment the turbulence production in the spinning basket group of membrane modules in all dse modules turbulence promotion is generally estimated by the shear stress as high shear generation in the vicinity of the membrane is regarded as a signature of this specific class of membrane pilots 29 additionally the kinetic energy dissipation contour over the membrane surface is also used as a standard measure of turbulence production 52 nevertheless before focusing on the membrane surface the overall hydrodynamic profile must be analyzed especially in terms of the velocity field prevailing in the default interior of the modules the velocity field simulation is considered as a common entry point in understanding the gross hydrodynamic picture of any process device 45 the simulated velocity fields v x in the default interiors of the sbm and isbm modules fig 3 were independent of tmp c0 and the types of currently used turbulence promoters however v x strongly depends on ω for all parametric conditions v x exhibited large spatial variations high velocity regions were mostly localized over the feed inlet retentate outlet arm tips and intermeshed region only in case of isbm the distributions represent high rates of kinetic energy transport from inlet to outlet because of the basket rotation the high kinetic energy of the feed jet was rapidly swept by the basket arms to facilitate its mixing with the primary flow the primary flow was principally generated by the high speed basket rotation only essentially the respective flow may be simulated in batch mode without any inlet or outlet streams as discussed in previous reports 42 45 the mixing of the feed jet with such primary flow leads to the generation of asymmetric secondary flows consisting of vortices wakes and complex reversed flow the asymmetry was further intensified in case of isbm especially because of its intermeshed region the narrow gap between the arm tips of the two baskets fig 3 b naturally promotes a lubrication flow through the corresponding v shaped channel thus interaction of the lubrication flow i e contraction and expansion with the surrounding vortices and circulating streamlines is supposed to largely intensify the turbulence production in the bulk regions furthermore the average velocity magnitude in isbm was more than two folds higher than that in sbm higher velocity magnitude actually resulted because of the counter rotation of the intermeshed baskets the liquid is swept by both the baskets collectively which intensifies the corresponding rate of displacement and therefore increases the velocity magnitude the average velocity magnitude was also noted to be nearly doubled for an increase of the rotational speed from 10 47 rad s 1 to 41 9 rad s 1 for both sbm and isbm though the directional profiles of velocity mostly remained unaltered overall our findings suggest gross velocity field intensification in isbm relative to the baseline sbm module under identical parametric conditions necessarily higher velocity magnitude indicates a state of elevated shear considering the no slip boundary condition yet the apprehended high shear production has to be validated from the shear profile only which is subsequently elaborated the velocity field of both modules could be effectively controlled upon changing the rotational speed of the baskets the contours of shear stress on the membrane surface unambiguously point out the efficacies of both promoters fig 4 the shear profiles on the promoters are also included in the same figure the rotated square pitch promoters were found to generate maximum shear stress for both modules and similar to the velocity field isbm pilot was able to produce approximately 130 higher average shear stress than the single basket sbm unit in any turbulent flow the observed shear stress is contributed by diffusive and eddy transport of momentum i e τ ij obs 2 μ e ij ρ 0 u i u j where e ij 1 2 u i x j u j x i close to the solid boundary the effect of reynolds stress components ρ 0 u i u j is practically insignificant however in the current design the wire type promoters were fixed close to the membrane surface 5 mm therefore the combined effect of boundary layer separation from the wire surface and the reflected flow from the basket wall is expected to produce high reynolds stress even close to the membranes the rotated square pitch arrangement must have favoured such type of flow separation induced production of eddies relative to the ordinary square pitch design which led to a higher shear production similar profiles were obtained atω 41 9 rad s 1 nevertheless the mean shear stress for all cases was found to be 1 7 2 4 times higher than the same at 10 47 rad s 1 the profiles of turbulence generation of the two promoters in the spinning basket modules were further compared in terms of the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate ε the kinetic energy cascade down from the larger to the smaller eddies following an inviscid pathway 53 at the characteristic kolmogorov microscale η the cascaded kinetic energy finally dissipates into heat 54 the rate of such dissipation is frequently chosen as a measure of turbulence production therefore the contours of ε and the respective mean values for the two promoters in sbm and isbm modules were considered for a comparative analysis fig 5 the results show a sharp increase of average dissipation rate ε with the attachment of promoters especially in case of the sbm pilot moreover ε on the membrane surface was also noted to increase by 18 for rotated square pitch promoter relative to the normal square pitch on the other hand for isbm the relative increase was limited to 3 5 only the low relative increase of ε may be attributed to the high baseline value of mean dissipation rate in isbm without promoters fig 5 b the profiles on the promoter surfaces are pretty consistent with the profiles on the membranes overall the outcomes of the cfd simulation signify a superior performance of the rotated square pitch promoter in both sbm and isbm modules relative to the normal square pitch design the profiles of the shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate indicate a state of high turbulence production with the rotated square pitch promoter nevertheless the efficacies are to be finally confirmed in terms of the corresponding flux profile with the synthetic and real wastewater feed which are presented in the next section 3 2 studies with synthetic wastewater 3 2 1 flux profiles a declining transient flux profile was observed for the baseline sbm and isbm modules in all filtration runs conducted under different parametric conditions tmp ω and c0 the trend perfectly corroborates with the previous reports 42 45 the flux stabilized to a quasi steady state after 120 min for every cycle demarcating the end of the filtration run and the need to switch to the cleaning mode both the quasi steady as well as the regenerated flux was higher for the baseline isbm than sbm due to the enhanced membrane shear generated by intermeshing of spinning baskets to further intensify the shear field turbulence promoters were integrated with both filtration pilots the immediate outcome is observed as a superior performance in terms of solvent flux the quasi steady stabilization occurred at much higher flux values and the flux regenerations after cleaning were also found to be higher apprehensively the promoters contribute to enhance the membrane shear further and hence the respective back transport was higher enabling better solute dislodging this perceived effect can be evidently correlated to the increased shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates predicted in the preceding section fig 6 shows the variation of the permeate flux for three consecutive filtration runs each of 120 min duration with two intermediate cleaning runs of nearly 5 min each for sbm fig 6 a i to a iii and isbm fig 6 b i to b iii pilots at four different tmps ω 20 95 rad s 1 and c0 2 w the three sets of profiles i e i ii and iii distinguish the observations for baseline square pitch and rotated square pitch promoter attached configurations increasing the tmp is always associated with flux enhancement in any pressure driven membrane separation processes 8 and such is the overall trend observed here as well for example the quasi steady flux j t 120 min at the end of first filtration run was observed to increase by 45 67 for a change of tmp from 101 3 kpa to 405 3 kpa in case of baseline sbm pilot however a comparative performance analysis between the three different configurations in two modules is of greater consequence for the sbm module j t 120 min was found to increase from 2 16 10 5m3m 2s 1in baseline to 3 7 10 5m3m 2s 1with square pitch and 4 53 10 5m3m 2s 1with rotated square pitch promoters at tmp 101 3 kpa a similar trend was followed for other values of tmp imperatively the performance based on j t 120 min in case of isbm pilot was mostly akin sbm except for the overall higher flux due to enhanced shear generation an increase from 5 67 10 5m3m 2s 1 to 9 53 10 5m3m 2s 1 and finally 12 89 10 5m3m 2s 1 was observed at tmp 101 3 kpa for the baseline square pitch and rotated square pitch promoter fitted configurations we have also evaluated the corresponding fouling resistance according to the well known resistance in series model j tmp μ r m r f where μ is the viscosity rm is the hydraulic resistance of the virgin membrane and rf is the fouling resistance 45 rm was evaluated from pure water run with a virgin membrane at different tmp and we found rm 1 68 1012 m 1 fig 7 depicts the transient profiles of rf for the baseline and rotated square pitch promoter fitted configurations only all rf profiles were observed to grow with time before levelling off to the respective quasi steady value at t 120 min the profiles are perfectly consistent with those of flux as shown in fig 6 the quasi steady rf values of the baseline sbm at different tmp were found to be lowest because of its low shear production rate relative to other configurations fig 4 on the other hand the rf profiles of rotated square pitch promoter integrated sbm pilot fig 7 a ii were pretty similar to those of the baseline isbm module fig 7 b i which once again justifies the promoter based process intensification scheme of dse filtration pilots the rotated square pitch promoter fitted isbm unit apprehended to be the best configuration of the present lot in terms of all quality functions e g flux and shear generation was able to restrict rf t 120 min within 2 5 1012 m 1 even at tmp 405 5 kpa the profiles of j t 120 min with respect to the tmp for all configurations are shown in fig 8 a the plot is specifically useful in comparing the efficacies of shear generation and turbulence production between the two competing strategies basket intermeshing and turbulence promoter integration the promoter is not expected to increase the power consumption significantly on the other hand the process intensification from sbm to isbm unit i e by basket intermeshing is energy intensive the detailed power budget has been discussed later therefore the performance upgradation of sbm by promoter attachment is the preferred cost effective pathway provided the flux produced is close to that of the baseline isbm module the profiles of j t 120 min clearly revealed that the sbm module with rotated square pitch promoter is closely equivalent to the isbm unit without promoter over 101 3 405 1 kpa j t 120 min of the rotated square pitch promoter fitted sbm unit was 82 87 of the j t 120 min produced by the isbm module similar trend was followed at other parametric conditions as well thus flux enhancement of sbm by promoter attachment is economically advantageous over additional basket intermeshing strategy i e sbm to isbm unit the j t 120 min versus tmp profiles exhibited piece wise linear growth with decreasing growth rate with tmp the trend clearly indicates the approach towards the so called limiting flux 55 the quasi steady flux enhancements for sbm pilot were 40 355 and 64 445 for square and rotated square pitch promoters respectively over the entire parametric space in case of the isbm unit the corresponding ranges were 68 192 and 112 335 as mentioned earlier the flux enhancement reported by sen et al in uf of bsa glucose using a rd membrane pilot fitted with vane type turbulence promoters was limited to 50 only another study reported cross flow filtration units fitted with the turbulence promoters to exhibit a flux enhancement up to 700 in uf of skimmed milk 37 nevertheless the respective feed to retentate pressure drop was also increased by 300 resulting in a proportionate increase of the pumping cost however for spinning basket group the overall power consumption maximally increased by 9 only as elaborated later moreover the baseline flux in any dse module is at least ten fold higher than an equivalent cross flow unit 29 an alternative representation style namely the phase plane plot i e j t versus dj dt plot was also included in fig 8 to realize the dynamic effects of promoter attachment in general the phase plane formalism finds common use in non linear analysis 56 presently we have used it to capture a holistic picture of the non linear transience over the first three filtration cycles for all cases under study the phase plane plots assumed an open rectangular shape with a gradual shift towards the lower side values of flux the horizontal arm at the bottom represents the extent of flux decline in a filtration run whereas the top horizontal arm depicts the flux regeneration on cleaning the connecting vertical arms indicate the switch from the filtration to the cleaning mode and vice versa we have included the phase plane plots of three configurations in both modules for a specific parametric condition tmp 304 0 kpa c0 2 w and ω 20 95 rad s 1 only the trend of mean flux over the three filtration cycles j was similar to the quasi steady flux at t 120 min for example j of the sbm module was recorded to increase by 76 and 116 for the square pitch and rotated square pitch promoters respectively which are well within the corresponding ranges of quasi steady flux enhancement additionally the plots also indicate the proximity of the flux profiles obtained from rotated square pitch integrated sbm module and the isbm pilot without promoters this observation evidently points out the advantages of energy inexpensive process intensification of sbm by promoter attachment over the power and capital cost intensive basket intermeshing the variation of the flux profiles with ω for three different configurations in both modules were also investigated the flux was noted to significantly increase with ω in all six cases for example in the baseline designs j t 120 min increased by 113 and 116 in sbm and isbm pilots respectively for a change of ω from 10 49 rad s 1 to 41 9 rad s 1 the corresponding enhancements with the square pitch promoters were 125 and 129 whereas for the rotated square pitch the quasi steady flux exhibited a maximum two and half fold growth in isbm module high rotational speed is apprehended to increase the shear induced back transport flux and thus restricts the growth of the rejected solute layer the transient flux profiles with changing ω for all configurations are elaborately discussed in the supplementary section s 1 in general increasing c0 results in an increase in the membrane rejection perceived through a greater solute accumulation on the membrane surface this is associated with a decreasing permeate flux an overall transition of the blocking filtration regime from the initial complete blocking to the cake filtration close to the so called quasi steady state has been confirmed for the baseline isbm in uf of bsa 45 the trend implies that the effect of increasing c0 becomes most conspicuous at the quasi steady state with maximum loss of flux thus the favorable role of the turbulence promoters is expected to be better understood at the quasi steady state fig 9 depicts the quasi steady flux profiles with respect to c0 over the entire range of tmp the j t 120 min exhibited a universal declining profile with c0 nevertheless the promoters were able to significantly damp the decreasing trend the isbm pilot operating at 202 7 kpa exhibited 43 decline of jt 120 min for a change of c0 from 1 w to 4 w at ω 20 95 rad s 1 whereas the same module integrated with rotated square pitch promoter was able to limit the decline within 5 only similar trend was exhibited by the isbm module as well fig 9 b i to b iii the sbm pilot on promoter attachment was observed to exhibit maximum enhancement of j t 120 min relative to the isbm unit additionally the flux obtained from the sbm unit with the rotated square pitch promoter under certain parametric conditions was found to be overlapping and even slightly higher than the isbm pilot which simply reiterates the advantages of promoter attachment strategy over basket intermeshing 3 2 2 modes of fouling the flux profiles under different parametric conditions were further expected to identify the dominant fouling mechanism fouling models constitute one of the fundamental approaches of membrane modeling the primary objective was to identify the membrane solute interaction pattern classically four different regimes of filtration were postulated by hermia and breedee in explaining the flux profiles obtained from an elementary dead end module 57 an informative review about the origin applicability and limitations of these models were presented by iritani 58 the models are very briefly described in table 3 the blocking models have been successfully applied to cross flow systems after necessary modifications 58 zhang and ding first applied blocking filtration models to characterize the performance of a rd module 59 high r2 0 98 of the respective linear regression clearly indicates the relevance of the classical blocking models in describing the governing fouling mechanism of a dse filtration system accordingly we have also chosen four classical blocking models to investigate their applicability in all present configurations the linear fits of the transformed datasets e g ln j versus t in case of complete blocking were tested in terms of r2 the dataset consists of the flux versus time profiles for the first filtration run only obtained from ten different filtration cleaning experiments described in table 1 the datasets and the linear fits for the baseline sbm and its two promoter fitted configurations are shown in fig 10 similar plots for all configurations associated to isbm are presented in supplementary section s 2 all r2 data table s1 unambiguously justify the complete blocking model to best describe the state of fouling in every configurations r2 0 88 the second highest r2 0 74 was identified for the cake filtration model the result implies a physical picture of complete blocking for most of the membrane surface only over some selected regions we may apprehend cake build up closer investigation revealed enhanced applicability of the cake filtration model in baseline modules which simply reflects a state of relatively low shear production compared to promoter integrated configurations 3 2 3 membrane morphology fesem images of the membrane surface after the first filtration run implies relatively intense fouling in the baseline pilots fig 11 b i and c i compared to the promoter fitted configurations fig 11 b ii and c ii photomicrograph of the virgin membrane is also included in the same figure fig 11 a morphologically minimum fouling was observed for the promoter integrated isbm module because of its high shear production overall the findings are pretty consistent with the outcomes of the blocking mode analysis localized grey patches in the fesem images possibly indicate mono layered complete blocking regions superimposed with partial multi layered cake build up the physical picture has been schematized in fig 11 d 3 2 4 long term performance characterization the spinning basket group of membrane pilots were claimed to perpetually regenerate the solvent flux by their in built hydrodynamic cleaning facility however all flux profiles reported so far only includes the first three filtration cleaning cycles the total span was 370 min which includes three filtration runs each of 120 min duration and two intermediate cleaning runs of total 10 min duration thus it is impossible to predict the so called long term performance characteristics from the three consecutive filtration cleaning cycles only blanpain avet et al have recommended that a long term study must consist of at least ten filtration cleaning cycles 60 standard chemical cleaning method with sodium hydroxide and nitric acid solutions was used to clean a mf membrane fouled by whey protein concentrate 3 5 w the flux recovery was observed to vary within 72 94 of the corresponding initial flux recorded at the beginning of the first filtration run j0 each filtration run was continued for 90 min whereas the cleaning run duration was varied within 5 20 min in any dairy industry the time span of membrane cleaning generally depends on the feed quality and the size of the plant the duration usually varies between 5 and 20 min 61 thus the time spans of individual filtration and cleaning runs as used in the present study are seemingly consistent with other reports following the criterion of long term performance characterization we have also conducted a set of new experiments consisting of ten consecutive filtration cleaning cycles under different tmp the total run time for each experiment was nearly 21 h the profiles of the initial and the regenerated i e after every cleaning run flux values for all configurations are depicted in fig 12 in all cases the regenerated flux after 21 h was found to vary within 74 88 of j0 the two baseline modules exhibited relatively lower flux regenerations i e 0 74j0 0 82j0 which imply the promoters to be instrumental even during the cleaning runs promoter induced local turbulence must have amplified the solute dislodging capacity of the pressure draft generated because of the reverse spinning of the baskets in all cleaning runs high flux regeneration characteristics even after 20 h filtration and 50 min cleaning in treatment of fouling prone food wastewater clearly signifies the novelty of promoter based process intensification of spinning basket membrane pilots the result implies that the promoter fitted sbm and isbm modules are to be specifically suitable in real life treatment of concentrated and heavy fouling feeds including protein solutions phytochemicals food wastewater oil water emulsions black liquors and many others 3 2 5 observed rejection the effects of promoter attachment to the spinning basket membrane pilots was further investigated by measuring the observed rejection r 0 1 c p c 0 where c p is the solute concentration in the permeate at the end of first filtration run we have specifically explored the role of promoters at different tmp and ω the 3d mesh plots fig 13 of r0 t 120 min with respect to tmp and ω portray an almost linear trend r2 0 92 evidently the rejection was observed to increase with tmp and decrease with ω in all configurations for both modules any increase in the tmp is expected to result in higher solute rejection the rejected solute accumulates on the membrane surface primarily according to the complete blocking picture which may lead to cake layer built ups over some regions fig 11 d the solute layer naturally gives rise to an additional mass transfer resistance in series with the membrane fig 7 the enhanced resistance is responsible for the increase in observed rejection upon reducing the concentration of solute in the permeate stream on the contrary filtration with increased ω intensifies the solute back transport and hinders the growth of the same layer resulting in a low quasi steady r0 promoters are apprehended to perturb the quasi steady r0 of the baseline modules by further augmenting the solute scoop up the increased rate of solute back transport reduces the deposited layer thickness δ and subsequently the mass transfer resistance δ d where d is the diffusivity in the deposited layer thus the solute transport through the combined mass transfer resistances in series consisting of the deposited solute layer and the membrane increased with promoter attachment which consequently reduced r0 for example in the sbm module r0 t 120 min decreased from 98 5 in the baseline version to 91 in the rotated square pitch fitted configuration at ω 10 49 rad s 1 and tmp 405 3 kpa similar trends were followed by other configurations as well nevertheless a damping effect on the role of promoters on quasi steady r0 was noted at high ω which indicates a high shear generation and shear induced protein transport from the membrane surface to the bulk irrespective of chosen promoter geometry the promoters simply amplify the rate of shear generation to an extent that finally causes further reduction of the r0 t 120 min overall the study with synthetic wastewater unambiguously justifies the process intensification of the spinning basket group of membrane pilots by turbulence promoters a maximum of five and a half fold flux enhancement was obtained with the rotated square pitch configuration however the beneficial role of the promoters was investigated further with the real dairy effluent to fully understand the scope of the current process upgradation the outcomes of this characterization study i e sbm and isbm pilots with two different wire type promoters are discussed in the next section 3 3 studies with real wastewater the experiments with the real wastewater i e the dairy effluent before treatment were conducted at two extreme process conditions of tmp and ω for the first set of experiments tmp and ω were maintained at 101 3 kpa and 10 47 rad s 1 respectively in the second set experiments were carried out at the highest possible parametric values i e tmp 405 3 kpa and ω 41 9 rad s 1 moreover we have only focused on the quasi steady state values of flux and permeate cod for the three different configurations of both modules the j t 120 min profiles fig 14 a i and a ii almost replicate the trend for synthetic wastewater from baseline to the rotated square pitch promoter integrated configuration the increase of j t 120 minwas recorded to vary between 90 and 204 for sbm and 82 123 for isbm pilots furthermore the absolute flux values with real wastewater were also observed to follow the same order of magnitude as that of the synthetic feed notwithstanding the much lower protein concentration in real samples in this context it is imperative to note that the cod of 1 w synthetic wastewater is eighty three folds higher than the real effluent s cod table 1 the order of magnitude similarity between synthetic and real wastewater fluxes can be understood from their respective fouling mechanisms the dairy wastewater contains much less organic matter and inorganic salt compounds compared to the bsa water synthetic feed solution additionally the real dairy effluent is quite heterogeneous in composition consisting of lactose salts proteins and lipids 62 the protein constituents can be majorly classified into casein and whey proteins α lactalbumin α la β lactoglobulin β lg bsa and immunoglobulin ig casein contributes to 80 of the total protein content in milk and hence forms the major protein fraction of the dairy effluent as well the ph of the effluent is alkaline 9 2 caused by the use of alkaline solutions as cleaning agents 63 considering the reported constituents of the dairy effluent a paradigm shift from the case of synthetic wastewater may be expected in the respective fouling process in synthetic wastewater filtration fouling was triggered by accumulation and subsequent adsorption of bsa on the membrane surface the fouling regime investigation of isbm unit already revealed a transition from the mono layered complete blocking to the multi layered cake filtration regime towards the quasi steady state 45 in spite of partial alleviation of the cake layer resistance in promoter fitted configurations the cake filtration regime may still be apprehended to prevail at the quasi steady state on the other hand in case of real wastewater lactose α la and β lg will pass through the membrane owing to their smaller molecular size compared to the pore size thus membrane fouling must be caused majorly by casein and the larger sized whey proteins i e bsa and ig casein in aqueous medium embedded with calcium phosphate exists in the form of large colloidal particles commonly referred to as casein micelles 64 electron microscopic investigations revealed the size of the casein micelles to fall in the range of 50 500 nm 65 however despite extensive research the exact structure of a casein micelle is still under debate according to the most accepted model proposed by horne the casein micelle consists of a gel like internal core made of α casein and microgranular calcium phosphate 66 the external shell of the micelle is composed of a proteinaceous hairy layer of κ casein therefore we may expect two types of fouling phenomena mediated by casein whey protein and casein membrane interactions in the first type the micelle s κ casein bush layer is apprehended to bridge with the tails and loops of the adsorbed whey proteins whereas in the second case the external κ casein may anchor directly on the membrane itself fig 15 the strong protein bridging interactions among the casein micelle the adsorbed whey protein and the membrane is expected to trigger a multi layered cake filtration type fouling regime at the quasi steady state which finally results in the low permeate throughput moreover the polarized casein layer is thicker in case of real wastewater as the diffusion coefficient of casein micelle is approximately twenty fold lower than the whey proteins 63 thus the overall effect of fouling in real wastewater becomes equivalent to the high concentration synthetic feed solution which explains the similar flux magnitudes in two cases the detailed mechanism of fouling is discussed in the supplementary section s 3 the quasi steady cod profiles of the permeate stream are also included in the same figure fig 14 b the permeate cod was noted to vary within 243 312 mg o2 l 1 and 262 335 mg o2 l 1 for sbm and isbm respectively the high cod of permeate stream was majorly due to the unhindered percolation of smaller sized proteins i e α la and β lg the cod exhibited an increasing trend in promoter attached configurations which is quite similar to the increase of observed rejection in synthetic wastewater experiments promoter induced local turbulence seems to be effective in dislodging the accumulated casein and high molecular weight whey proteins consequently the mass transfer resistances of the polarized and the fouling layer have decreased which allows the higher throughput of low molecular weight proteins through the membrane leading to an increase of the corresponding cod values the promoter based upgradation of both sbm and isbm was confirmed to be highly effective in treatment of real dairy effluent even under the limited set of parametric conditions the quasi steady flux enhancements for both modules were pretty high nevertheless to fully establish the efficacy of promoter based process intensification energy budget analysis is indispensable we have restricted the said analysis to synthetic wastewater only as the gross outcomes were comparable to the real wastewater experiments the trends of the energy usage are elaborated in the next section 3 4 energy budget our previous analysis clearly revealed that the major part of the energy is consumed by the driver motor connected to the spinning basket the residual amount is used by the feed pump closer inspection indicates that 80 86 of energy is consumed by the motor moreover a large fraction of the energy supplied to the motor is used to overcome the mechanical friction specifically localized over the shaft staffing box contact region therefore even in a dry run nearly 66 74 of the energy was reported to be consumed by the motor 43 45 the feed pump consumes 14 20 of the total energy budget to deliver the feed against the high pressure tmp regarding the parametric dependence it was reported that the overall consumption pattern was strongly influenced by tmp and ω while the role of feed concentration was nearly insignificant in the current study we have extended the power usage analysis to understand the role of promoters in altering the energy budget of the baseline pilots in all promoter fitted configurations the increase of energy uptake with respect to the baseline designs was limited to 9 only the increase may be attributed to the increased drag offered by the promoters the promoter wires are supposed to trigger localized wake formation because of the boundary layer separations in the space between the promoter and the membrane the boundary layer separation essentially augments the retarding drag as the basket is rotated at high speed the enhanced drag subsequently increases the retarding torque t and eventually the power consumed by the motor as e motor tω however a low percentage increase of e motor in promoter fitted configurations essentially signifies insignificant upscaling of the retarding drag thus we may apprehend the drag to be majorly contributed by the boundary layer separation at the edges of the spinning basket which is partially reflected in the velocity vector profiles fig 3 considering the similar trends of energy usage between the baseline and the promoter fitted configurations we have planned to represent the profiles in terms of the specific energy budget i e the energy consumed per unit volume of the permeate at the quasi steady state in whl 1 the variations of the specific energy budget with tmp and ω for all configurations are depicted in fig 16 a and b for sbm and isbm respectively both spinning basket modules exhibited a drastic reduction of the specific energy budget upon promoter attachment for instance in the configuration with rotated square pitch the specific energy consumption in sbm was 56 61 lower relative to the baseline module similarly for isbm pilot the corresponding reduction was estimated to vary within 64 70 furthermore the specific energy usage showed a decreasing trend with ω and increased with tmp nevertheless the rate of change with tmp and ω largely damped down in promoter fitted configurations this approximate invariance of the specific energy usage is definitely advantageous from the economic perspective as it expands the feasible parametric space and improves the flexibility of operation 4 conclusion the study demonstrates the applications of simple wire type turbulence promoters in the spinning basket group of dynamic shear enhanced membrane pilots and a detailed account of enhanced fouling mitigation was presented in protein recovery from wastewater by ultrafiltration the cfd simulation of all promoter fitted configurations showed significant increase of shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate at the membrane surface relative to the baseline designs this was followed by varied sets of experiments with synthetic and real dairy effluents which includes standard parametric investigations analysis of fouling regime membrane morphology power budget and the long term 21 h performance characterization in the first case rotated square pitch promoter integrated modules exhibited the best performance in terms of flux enhancement a nominal increase of 9 in the power budget signifies that the energy economy remained unaffected the promising results yielded by combining two parallel pathways to shear enhancement i e static turbulence promoter and dynamic shear enhancement marks the integrated approach as a new research niche of its own prospects of future research include the use of more complex promoter configurations like twisted tape cylindrical rods with other existing dse modules and

the china surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 which shows the effectiveness of the water quality improvement method using this method to rebuild the water ecosystem improves the water quality local urban image environmental quality and living environment the combined technology can serve as reference for urban river water quality improvement graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bypass system combined technology water quality improve artificial wetlands aquatic plants 1 introduction owing to the rapid increase in the world population and the increasing global demand for water resources water scarcity has become one of the most significant challenges currently 1 whereas industrialisation and urbanisation processes have worsened the issue of water scarcity 2 water scarcity has become a critical problem in many countries whereas water quality deterioration has become a global problem 3 in recent years china has progressed significantly in terms of economic development and urbanisation nevertheless this is accompanied by various environmental problems where various pollutants are discharged into the surface of water bodies thereby resulting in increasing levels of pollution in urban rivers and lakes 4 as well as blackened and putrid water bodies and fish deaths the management of polluted water environments alleviation of water shortage and assurance of a good living environment to humans are important issues to be solved 5 an artificial wetland is an ecological engineering technology comprising aquatic plants substrates and microorganisms 6 and has been widely used in recent decades 7 it exhibits the characteristics of simple structure continuity and easy maintenance 8 in addition it affords a low operating cost as well as good removal and landscape effects 9 because of its combined physical chemical and biological processes it can effectively remove pollutants 10 from water and is thus widely used to treat industrial wastewater agricultural wastewater and stormwater runoffs 11 in artificial wetlands the substrate exerts filtering retention and adsorption effects on pollutants thereby enabling pollutant removal and providing space for plants and microorganisms to grow 12 these wetlands are composed of primarily soil sand and gravel aquatic plants are an important component of wetlands 13 and are typically used wetland plants such as typha orientalis presl phragmites australis cav trin ex steud hydrilla verticillata linn f royle and myriophyllum elatinoides gaudich the roots of aquatic plants can directly remove pollutants from wastewater via absorption and adsorption as well as secrete oxygen such that the wetland produces different areas with different oxygen levels allowing different microorganisms to survive in the wetland 14 the main microorganisms in artificial wetlands are bacteria protozoa fungi and algae which degrade pollutants into insoluble or harmless substances 15 artificial wetlands can effectively remove organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and other substances from the feed water through physical chemical and biological processes such as substrate adsorption plant uptake and microbial activity 16 as well as effectively remove suspended substances and microalgae from the water 17 however water quality improvement is extremely complicated and artificial wetlands exhibit low efficiency in terms of nitrogen removal owing to their limited dissolved oxygen concentration 18 therefore using only a single treatment technology renders it difficult to achieve the treatment goal in the actual water quality enhancement project various processes must be combined to enhance water quality such as combining artificial aeration and artificial wetlands in addition to the actual requirement to add an ecological substrate purifier an ecological isolation layer and other auxiliary measures in this study a typical river requiring water quality enhancement in wuhan was investigated the water quality condition of the river and the surrounding topographic conditions were first examined subsequently experience in water quality enhancement at both domestic and international level was exploited and the environmental benefits and technical stability of the project were fully considered a bypass artificial wetland system combining technologies such as surface flow artificial wetlands ecological gravel beds ecological wetland multi pond systems and underwater forest ecosystems was adopted to improve the river water quality artificial wetlands offer significant environmental benefits to urban ecosystems 19 in addition to improving water quality they offer other functions such as biodiversity and biological habitats 20 in addition artificial wetlands have been adopted in the in situ treatments of rivers via the planting of aquatic plants installation of ecological floating islands and use of ecological substrate purifiers bypass and in situ treatments were adopted which resulted in further improvements in river water quality the overall goals of this project is to achieve do 5 mg l nh3 n 1 0 mg l tp 0 2 mg l cod 20 mg l and transparency exceeding 60 cm as well as improve the image of the city increase biodiversity enhance environmental quality and improve the living environment in this study the ponds around baozi river are utilized and transformed into a bypass combination artificial wetland system based on the actual topography the construction of the bypass combination artificial wetland system is rationalised and the construction of each process in the bypass combination artificial wetland system is investigated subsequently the feasibility of using the ecological isolation layer to transform the pond into an artificial wetland is verified additionally a bypass combined artificial wetland system is constructed to improve the water quality of baozi river and improve the ecosystem of the baozi river watershed this may serve as reference for similar projects finally in situ and bypass treatment system processes are compared to verify the feasibility of the bypass combination artificial wetland system in actual water quality enhancement projects 2 materials and research methods 2 1 overview of study area the project is located in the northern foot section of the longquan mountain near baozi river in jiangxia district in wuhan city which is located in the transition zone between the jianghan plain and the hills in the south of china and the climate therein is subtropical monsoon the plain geomorphological features are clear and the overall terrain is high in the north and low in the south the average annual precipitation is 1150 1190 mm with the highest amount of rainfall from april to august the spring and summer seasons are typically rainy whereas the autumn and winter seasons are less rainy and the amount of rain is distributed unevenly the river channel comprises a flat terrain on both sides where fish ponds are located primarily on the west side and wasteland on the east side the river is approximately 0 9 km long 15 30 m wide and 1 5 m deep at the beginning of the study the river water was turbid and of low transparency the pollution sources were primarily the initial rainwater discharged directly from the rainwater pipe network of the surrounding towns and the agricultural sewage discharged directly from the surrounding farmlands to solve the pollution problem of baozi river the pond on the west side of the river was transformed into a bypass artificial wetland system and the river water was transferred to this system for treatment the design volume of the bypass artificial wetland system was 15 000 m3 d with a hydraulic retention time of approximately 25 d and an area of approximately 254 260 m2 the specific location of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 water quality characteristics prior to the commencement of the project the river water quality was monitored for 4 weeks once daily the average value was recorded and the results show that the river water quality monitoring indexes belonged to class v water of the china surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 those indexes did not satisfy the class iii water specifications required for the project the raw water quality characteristics are shown in table 1 2 3 sample acquisition three sampling sections were defined in the river for the demonstration project and the water quality indexes were used as their average values those sections are at the upstream of the river treatment process outlet downstream of the river expressed as the influent monitoring point 1 monitoring point 2 respectively the locations of the specific sampling points are shown in fig 1 the sampling points are acquired once every 10 d for 4 months the water samples are sampled using a water sampler subsequently the water samples are cryogenically preserved and returned to the laboratory to test for their cod tp nh3 n and other water quality indicators in the field to measure transparency dissolved oxygen and other water quality indicators 2 4 measurement methods the water quality measuring methods and measuring instruments are shown in table 2 2 5 waterquality enhancement technology 2 5 1 technology routes this current project is based on the overall principles of rational utilization environmental beauty and ecological return where the water quality enhancement and ecological construction are achieved by considering the situation and the local conditions the bypass treatment system used in this project combines the current water system and integrates the existing fish ponds to create purification function wetlands and natural landscape wetlands the existing field paths are used as the boundary and for functional zoning and they are allocated into units for the pre treatment system the aeration ponds the first level surface flow wetlands the ecological gravel beds the second level surface flow wetlands the ecological wetland multi pond systems and the underwater forest systems to provide a substrate environment conducive to ecological recovery and achieve continuous improvement in the water environment among them the pre treatment system occupies an area of 308 m2 and the design flow rate is 15 000 m3 d in addition aquatic plants are planted ecological floating islands are installed and ecological shore protection is implemented in the river for in situ treatment the specific process route is shown in fig 2 2 5 2 ecological water recharge and ecological aeration to maintain a healthy water ecosystem the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water body must be increased to ensure that the water body possesses sufficient oxidation capacity this is primary achieved via ecological water replenishment and artificial aeration in this project ecological water replenishment and ecological aeration are performed to increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water body to not only solve the problem of insufficient oxygen and black odour in the water body but also to improve the aerobic environment for the subsequent microbial degradation of pollutants low mobility of water bodies can trigger problems such as weak self purification ability of water bodies and accumulation of pollutants which would result in algal blooms significant changes in the biological communities of water bodies and loss of balance in water ecosystems therefore ecological replenishment is performed in this study to increase the mobility of the water body and restore the self purification ability of the water body ecological recharge artificially changes the original water body enables the water circulation mechanism improves the hydraulic conditions 21 effectively improves the water flow status and enhances the water body reoxygenation capacity and self purification capacity 22 in this project ecological water replenishment is performed daily and calculated based on evaporation and rainfall data 30 000 m3 of water is transferred from baoxie lake to the upstream of baozi river of which 15 000 m3 of the water undergoes wetlands treatment and another 15 000 m3 of water flows along baozi river from north to south with an average water exchange cycle of 22 d the designed zoning and ecological water replenishment scheme is shown in fig 3 artificial aeration technology depends on various artificially enhanced aeration methods to introduce air or oxygen into water to enhance the turbulent flow of river water and accelerate the reoxygenation of the water body 23 artificial aeration can not only oxidise blackened and putrid pollutants in the water body but can also accelerate the metabolism of animals plants and microorganisms in the water body and improve the purification capacity of the water body 24 the water body contains the appropriate amount of dissolved oxygen which is beneficial to the nitrification of microorganisms and the combined process can be operated efficiently via artificial aeration technology in this project an aeration equipment is installed at the front end of the bypass system and a layer of brown hair mat with a mass of 1200 g m3 per unit volume is installed at the bottom of the eco aeration pond as an ecological isolation layer which is fixed to each other using u shaped nails to prevent the substrate from being disrupted during aeration in addition within the ecological aeration pond filler type ecological floating islands are installed to not only provide microbial hanging film spots but also to facilitate landscaping four submersible push flow aerators with a power of 1 5 kw a voltage of 220 v a service area of 800 1200 m2 and an oxygenation capacity of approximately 5 4 kg o2 h are installed on the ecological isolation layer of the eco aeration pond aeration is conducted via intermittent aeration for 10 h d which not only improves nitrification but also increases the total nitrogen removal rate 25 the ecological aeration pond occupies an area of 3233 m2 the designed water depth is 1 5 m the hydraulic retention time is 3 h and the set flow rate is 15 000 m3 d 2 5 3 surface flow artificial wetlands and ecological gravel beds the treated water body in this project contains a significant amount of agricultural wastewater and surrounding initial rainwater which comprises a considerable amount of nitrogen and phosphorus excess nitrogen and phosphorus in the water body would result in eutrophication which would adversely affect the water ecosystem meanwhile the surface flow artificial wetlands are considered an environmentally friendly and low cost solution for agricultural wastewater treatment 26 in this project a superficial flow artificial wetlands with two levels are used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater via the synergistic effect of substrate microbial plant in the superficial flow artificial wetlands between the two levels of the surface flow wetlands ecological gravel beds were installed the ecological gravel beds offers both physical and chemical purification and biochemical purification effects meanwhile gravel of different particle sizes can filter the suspended substances the bottom of the gravel provides an anoxic environment where anaerobic microorganisms feed on nutrients e g the denitrification activities of microorganisms the surface layer provides an aerobic environment where aerobic microorganisms promote the decomposition of organic matter in the ecological gravel beds gravels of different particle sizes are set as fillers microorganisms are attached to the surface of the fillers and nutrients in the water body are decomposed when the water body passes through the attached biofilm the combination of surface flow artificial wetlands and ecological gravel beds promotes the synergistic effect of substrate microorganism plants as well as allow the nutrients in the water body to be removed more efficiently in this project the existing fish ponds are transformed into the surface flow wetlands soil river sand and gravel are typically used as substrates in artificial wetlands however the use of a single substrate results in saturation easily due to adsorption and is associated with low nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency 27 the substrate serves as a platform for plant growth and biofilm suspension as well as a reaction site for pollutant immobilisation 28 therefore the substrate setting is particularly important the substrate of the wetlands in this project is configured as follows 1 the bottom of the pond is compacted with plain soil a 100 mm fine sand protective layer is set on the upper layer of the plain soil layer and a layer of geotechnical protective film is set on the upper layer of the protective layer 2 a layer of filler is set on the upper layer of the geotechnical protective film and ceramic granules and large size pebbles are selected as fillers 3 a 30 mm thick brown mat is installed in the surface flow artificial wetlands based on the water depth a 10 cm layer of planting soil is placed on the brown mat and planting is performed on it in addition water sustaining plants such as canna and iris pseudacorus l are planted within 5 m along the wetlands whereas submerged plants such as vallisneria natans lour hara and hydrilla verticillata linn f royle are planted in the middle of the wetlands the area of the first level surface flow artificial wetlands is 26 497 m2 design flow rate is 15 000 m3 d design water depth is 1 5 m hydraulic retention time is 2 65 d and hydraulic load is 0 566 m3 m2 d the second level surface flow artificial wetlands occupy an area of 49 128 m2 with a design flow of 15 000 m3 d design water depth of 1 5 m hydraulic retention time of 4 91 d and hydraulic load of 0 305 m3 m2 d the structure of the surface flow artificial wetland is shown in fig 4 the ecological gravel beds comprise three levels of gravel bed as follows the first level is composed of 64 to 128 mm pebbles the second level 32 to 64 mm pebbles the third level 6 to 32 mm pebbles microorganisms can be attached to the filler to suspend the film such that water quality can be further improved the gravel beds are designed with water intake at the bottom and water plunging at different levels with two levels of plunging and vertical reciprocating water flows in the multi level composite ecological gravel bed side shore canna thalia dealbata fraser and other plants are planted within 5 m to not only enhance the landscape effect but also to purify the water the ecological gravel beds occupy an area of 14 026 m2 with a design flow of 15 000 m3 d hydraulic retention time of 0 7 d and hydraulic load of 1 07 m3 m2 d the structure of the ecological gravel bed is shown in fig 5 in this project first level surface flow wetlands ecological gravel beds and second level surface flow wetlands are installed at the front end of the bypass restoration system the two level surface flow wetlands are installed such that pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus are fully removed by plants microorganisms and the wetlands substrate the ecological gravel beds provide sufficient microbial hanging points thus allowing the organic pollutants to be decomposed while being in full contact with microorganisms the use of this combination technology not only affords better water quality improvement but also a better landscape effect 2 5 4 ecological wetland multi pond systems the ecological wetland multi pond systems are the ecological restoration technology with characteristics of low investment easy management and high removal performance it offers better treatment results in treating non point source pollution 29 features a larger water depth and uses a larger space to extend the retention time of sewage as compared with other systems 30 thereby allowing pollutants to be removed more efficiently from sewage to further improve water quality the ecological wetland multi pond systems are installed after the second level surface flow wetlands in this project the ecological wetland multi pond systems are combined with the surrounding topography of the fish pond or lotus pond dredging transformation to provide a suitable growth environment for aquatic plants furthermore this combines allows aquatic microorganisms to remove pollutants in the water body efficiently and harmlessly the installation of artificial islands increases the intersection between water and land as well as the contact area between soil and water meanwhile the changing water depth increases the habitation area of different organisms thereby increasing biodiversity the ecological wetland multi pond systems occupy an area of 103 490 m2 with a design flow of 15 000 m3 d design water depth of 1 5 m hydraulic retention time of 10 d and hydraulic load of 0 15 m3 m2 d the structure of the ecological wetland multi pond system is shown in fig 6 to manage surface pollution more effectively multi stage stabilisation ponds are to be installed based on the actual topography of the project site as well as the different water depths this allows anaerobic aerobic and ecological ponds to be constructed to create an anaerobic anoxic aerobic environment which allows pollutants in the water body to be further removed in addition aquatic plants can be planted fish and shrimp can be stocked and biological fillers can be added in the multi pond systems after river water flows into the multi pond systems the pollutants will be absorbed and purified by the microorganisms and plants in the multi stage stabilisation ponds subsequently the pollutants will enter the lower treatment facilities via the connecting pipeline in this project a multi pond connection pipeline with a diameter of 400 to 600 which is based on the size of the site pond is installed to prevent water flow out of the pond the pond should be installed based on the direction of water flow in the pond water blocking cloth furthermore waterproof fabric should be used as the water blocking cloth such that the water body is fully purified and output uniformly aquatic plant partitions are set up in the multi ponds based on a reasonable configuration to overcome the shortcomings of ordinary artificial wetlands those partitions encompass a large area and can filter pollutants they effectively remove pollutants in the water body and minimise the transformation cost while being easily manageable 2 5 5 underwater forest ecosystems the underwater forest ecosystems improve the water environment enhance the ability of the water body to absorb pollution and produce clear water and offers a certain landscape value it features a structure comprising primarily submerged plants and aquatic plants as a supplement the submerged plants are key to water quality improvement in underwater forest which is achieved primarily through plant growth absorption and improvements in the water body environment to purify the water body 31 submerged plants are not only the main producers of aquatic ecosystems but also the basis for the structural complexity spatial diversity and functional stability of aquatic ecosystems furthermore they can effectively maintain the stability of water quality 32 this project is performed based on the underwater forest ecosystems at the end of the bypass system the water body enters the underwater forest ecosystems after the previous process treatment to ensure the required water quality standard it is partitioned into three zones i e a pre treatment area an ecological connotation area and a clear water flow area as shown in fig 7 the underwater forest ecosystems occupy an area of 61 124 m2 meanwhile the design flow is 15 000 m3 d design water depth is 1 5 m hydraulic retention time is 5 81 d and hydraulic load is 0 26 m3 m2 d the pre treatment ecological and clear water flow areas encompass 14 863 36 075 and 10 186 m2 respectively the pre treatment zone is used to promote the sedimentation of suspended matter in the upstream water and reduce the amounts of organic matter and nitrogen nutrients in the water body in the pre treatment area artificial water grass and aquatic plants are placed separately the artificial water plants are used to increase the contact time between water flow and microbial carriers via the purification principle of biofilms as well as physical rectification and interception such that the pollutants in the water can be in complete contact with the biofilm and the water quality can be improved in addition the artificial water plants can intercept and accumulate the suspended matters in the water and the water transparency can be improved which promotes the growth of submerged plants and results in an improved food chain and ecosystem the submerged plants planted in the pre treatment area are primarily vallisneria natans lour hara hydrilla verticillata linn f royle and other plants measuring 40 60 cm v natans lour hara with a planting density of 40 60 plants m2 and h verticillata linn f royle with a planting density of 9 12 bushes m2 in an area 5 m away from the shore aquatic plants such as thalia dealbata fraser and canna indica l measuring 120 180 cm are planted at a planting density of 1 plant m2 the ecological cultured area is intended to reduce the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients and organic matter in the water body in the ecological cultured area the food chain of the ecological cultured area is improved by placing algae control zooplankton and aquatic animals as well as by constructing an aquatic plant system additionally the appropriate placement of the algae control zooplankton can not only improve the transparency of the water body but also promote the growth of aquatic plants algae control zooplankton are associated with comprehensive ecological restoration treatment no secondary pollution no ecological safety hazards stable effect low cost and applicability under the hydrological water quality conditions of most urban landscape water bodies or natural eutrophic water bodies the aquatic animals used are primarily lateolabrax japonicus macrobrachium nipponense and sinotaia quadrata the size of l japonicus is 350 400 g tail the length of m nipponense is 2 3 cm and the diameter of sinotaia quadrata is 1 2 cm the submerged and aquatic plants planted in the ecological cultured area are the same as those in the pre treatment area in terms of type size and density the clean water flow area is intended to purify the large water depth and guarantee the water quality the planting of the plants and the placement of the aquatic animals in the clear water flow area are the same as those in the ecological connotation area the underwater forest ecosystems not only effectively improve the water quality and increases the diversity of regional species but also exhibit a certain landscape structure the structure of the underwater forest ecosystem is shown in fig 8 2 5 6 ecological substrate remediation agent owing to the discharge of wastewater from fish and root ponds into rivers for many years significant amounts of oxygen consuming organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus are continuously precipitated and accumulated in the ponds which form sediments meanwhile external disturbances and changes in the redox state of the water column result in the release of pollutants into the overlying water column via sediment suspension or concentration gradient diffusion thereby causing a secondary pollution of the water column 33 therefore bottom sediment management is essential substrate dredging involves significant amounts of labour and financial resources as well as easily causes the destruction of underwater ecosystems sediment resuspension and secondary pollution during sediment transportation and disposal 34 to mitigate this issue ecological substrate remediation agents are used this technology can effectively reduce the enrichment of nh3 n nitrites organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus in the overlying water body inhibit the outbreak of anaerobic pathogenic bacteria and afford better treatment on heavy metals in the substrate thereby significantly reducing toxicity and inhibiting of heavy metals in the substrate to plants hence an in situ remediation of the substrate can be achieved to treat the substrate a high pressure water gun is used to suspend the substrate and 500 1000 g m2 of the ecological substrate restorer is used for 20 d subsequently some sections of the river are added based on the condition of the river the best construction conditions are 15 c 35 c and a water depth 0 5 3 m the ecological substrate restorer is placed in the entire river section whose length and area are approximately 900 m and 154 177 m2 respectively 2 5 7 ecological isolation layer when pond renovation was performed in this study a 30 mm thick palm mat was installed based on the design water depth and fixed using u nails additionally a 10 cm layer of planting soil was laid on top of the palm mat the ecological isolation layer can solve the problems of excessive water depth and planting difficulty in certain sections of the surface flow wetlands and ecological wetland multi pond systems the ecological isolation layer which can not only improve the plant survival rate and allow the plant roots to be in complete contact with the water body integrates the characteristics of ecological floating islands and submerged plants hence it solves the problem of non controllable ecological floating islands during stormy seasons furthermore it provides microorganisms with more suspension points and prevents the sediments in the water column from clogging the substrate of the bypass combination artificial wetland system the ecological isolation layer is shown in fig 9 2 5 8 river reconstruction the river transformation performed in this study is based on river bank transformation substrate restoration and greening transformation the river bank transformation is intended primarily for the transformation of natural river banks in the natural river bank transformation vegetation compound bank protection is used the river bank is fixed with net mats and various plants are planted on the river bank a significant amount of sediment exists at the bottom of the river which would release pollutants and cause a secondary pollution if not treated timely in the river sediment transformation performed in this study an ecological sediment purifier is added to prevent the release of pollutants in the river sediment such that water purification can be achieved river greening transformation is intended primarily for general plant planting fountain aeration planting canna indica l thalia dealbata fraser and other aquatic plants on the edge of the river bank planting vallisneria natans lour hara hydrilla verticillata linn f royle and other submerged plants at a greater water depth arranging ecological floating islands in the centre of the river and planting myriophyllum elatinoides gaudich and other plants in ecological floating islands while greening the area around the river which comprises trees and shrubs in the centre of the river a fountain aerator is installed every 50 m to not only increase the amount of do but also to enhance the landscape the river transformation not only purifies the water enhances the landscape but also provides areas of human living tourism and entertainment 3 results and discussion the project lasted 4 months from system start up to system stabilisation beginning from the start up samples were obtained every 10 d for 12 times from 10 00 to 11 00 a m the measurement indexes included do nh3 n tp cod and transparency among them do and transparency were measured on site and the remaining three indicators were sampled and then used in the laboratory for measurement 3 1 do enhancement effect as shown in fig 10 the result of this project shows good water reoxygenation and the do in the water column increases from 1 40 to approximately 5 10 mg l in the first 20 d of system operation the water column was reoxygenated using aeration ecological substrate remediation agent combination technology in the river and an aerator in the bypass system where the ecological substrate remediation agent injected contains calcium peroxide and other oxygenating agents as a slow release oxygenating agent calcium peroxide decomposes gradually in the water column thereby releasing oxygen 35 and maintaining the water column in an aerobic state for a long period after 20 d of system operation the oxygenating agent in the ecological substrate restorer in the river lost its effect and the pollutant degradation required a significant amount of do which caused the rate of water reoxygenation to begin decreasing the main reoxygenation methods of the river in situ treatment system and bypass system at this stage were artificial aeration reoxygenation and aquatic plant reoxygenation the plants planted in the treatment system not only absorbed harmful substances in the wastewater but also provided oxygen to the water environment 36 when a significant amount of oxygen produced via plant photosynthesis was delivered to the root zone the excess amount diffused outward from the root surface after 30 d of system operation the aquatic plants grown to maturity released a significant amount of oxygen thereby increasing the water reoxygenation rate after 80 d of system operation the amount of do in the river water body stabilised at above 5 10 mg l which indicates that the artificial aeration and aquatic plant system in the treatment system can effectively prevent the effect of pollutants and facilitate the enhancement in do in the water body 3 2 transparency enhancement effect as shown in fig 11 the transparency of the water body improves significantly after treatment was implemented in the first 20 d of system operation the transparency improved faster i e from 11 to approximately 34 cm in this stage the transparency improvement in the bypass system is attributed to the pre treatment system ecological substrate purifier and ecological gravel beds in the pre treatment system devices such as grates were installed to retain larger particles in the water column in addition larger particles and pollutants were first removed via the physical filtration and retention of the substrate 12 the transparency enhancement in the in situ river treatment system is attributed to the ecological substrate purifier the ecological substrate purifier contained flocculants therefore flocculation with suspended materials was achieved in the water column and the flocculants provided the appropriate surface area to allow smaller particulate matter to accumulate on them and form larger particles 37 which were then settled by gravity after 20 d of system operation although the flocculant in the ecological substrate restorer lost its flocculating effect as the aquatic plants matured the macrophytes reduced the flow velocity of the water column and filtered the suspended solids 38 as well as enhanced water clarity by reducing sediment resuspension nutrient concentrations and the proliferation of phytoplankton 39 additionally aquatic animals removed suspended matter and phytoplankton via the food chain in this stage the system was operated for approximately 80 d and the water transparency fluctuated at approximately 70 cm thus satisfying the requirement of 60 cm in this project 3 3 removal effect of nh3 n as shown in fig 12 the concentration of nh3 n in the water column decreases abruptly in the first 20 d of system operation the concentration of nh3 n decreases gradually from 20 to 80 d of system operation and the concentration of nh3 n stabilises at approximately 0 90 mg l after 80 d of system operation during the first 20 d of system operation the nh3 n concentration in the overlying water column decreases owing to the adsorption of substances such as bentonite in the ecological substrate purifier used in the river after approximately 20 d the adsorption saturated and the nh3 n concentration in the water column began to decrease gradually in addition the pre treatment system in the bypass system and the substrate of each system contributed differently to the process the nh3 n removal rate recovered after 30 d of system operation owing to the synergistic substrate plant microbial action in the treatment system where nh3 n was permanently removed via nitrogen emission ammonia volatilisation and plant harvesting under the actions of microbial activity substrate adsorption and plant uptake in this process nitrification and denitrification in microbial activity were the main denitrification mechanisms 40 and after 30 d of system operation microorganisms successfully suspended a film on the substrate and nh3 n is adsorbed by substrates such as ceramic granules in the wetland subsequently nh3 n was degraded transformed and bio immobilised by microorganisms in the substrate and the substrate removal of nh3 n involved physical precipitation filtration and adsorption 41 in addition the roots of plants such as hydrilla verticillata linn f royle grew to maturity and the roots of aquatic plants were able to accumulate numerous microorganisms which promoted microbial denitrification due to oxygen release from the roots and the formation of an anoxic anaerobic aerobic environment meanwhile nh3 n was converted to no2 or no3 due to nitrification by microorganisms the aquatic plants consumed nitrates or nitrites to directly fulfil their nutrient requirements 42 and finally removed nitrogen from the water column via plant harvesting etc in this study intermittent aeration was adopted which enabled an aerobic anoxic anaerobic environment in the treatment system and was conducive to microbial denitrification 43 meanwhile the nh3 n in the water column was fully removed after 80 d of system operation the nh3 n concentration stabilised below 0 90 mg l and the removal rate was relatively stable indicating the high efficiency of the system in removing nh3 n 3 4 removal effect of tp as shown in fig 13 the amount of tp in the water column decreases significantly in the first 20 d of system operation and decreases gradually thereafter meanwhile the amount of tp in the water column decreases to less than 0 2 mg l after 60 d of system operation in the first 20 d of system operation the ecological substrate purifier used in the river contained modified bentonite which exhibits a high specific surface area with a high adsorption capacity 44 and the ecological substrate purifier absorbed soluble phosphate in the water column when it was sinking which caused the amount of tp in the water column to decrease significantly in this stage the bypass system contributed to the process as well after 20 d of system operation the adsorption of modified bentonite in the bottom sludge purifier saturated and its adsorption effect was lost thereby causing the phosphorus amount in the water column to decrease gradually after 30 d of system operation phosphorus removal depended on the filtration and adsorption of the substrate assimilation by plants and assimilation and accumulation by microorganisms the substrate was the most vital to tp removal followed by the combined action of the aquatic plants and microorganisms 45 the phosphorus removal primarily involved the filtering of larger phosphorus containing particles in the water column and applying their adsorption properties to adsorb smaller phosphorus containing particles during the continuous growth of the aquatic plants in the system phosphorus was absorbed by the aquatic plants and then transformed into substances required for the plants growth resulting in a reduction in the tp amount in the water column furthermore the harvesting of plants at a later stage resulted in the removal of tp from the water column microorganisms absorb excess phosphorus under anaerobic conditions 46 whereas phosphorus can be absorbed by microorganisms and enriched in the body to be removed after the system was operated for 80 d the tp levels in the water column are lower than 0 2 mg l and the tp concentration reduced significantly 3 5 removal effect of cod as shown in fig 14 the amount of cod in the water column decreases significantly during the system operation the main mechanisms of organic matter removal are sedimentation and filtration of suspended solids plant uptake and microbial biodegradation processes under aerobic or anaerobic conditions 47 during the first 20 d of system operation the amount of cod in the water column decreased significantly primarily due to the removal of larger suspended solids via the grids in the bypass system the adsorption and filtration of the ecological gravel beds and substrate installed in the system which removed the particulate matter from the water column as well as the flocculants and adsorbents in the ecological substrate purifier used in the river after 20 d of system operation the cod content in the water body began to decrease gradually primarily because the flocculants and adsorbents in the substrate purifier had lost their effects which then caused the amount of cod in the water body to decrease gradually however in this stage the plants grew and matured gradually and in the plant growth stage they could absorb the nutrients dissolved in the water body furthermore the plants imposed an interception effect on the particulate matter which allowed the number of cod in the water body to be reduced in this stage microorganisms successfully suspended a film in the ecological gravel beds and plant inter roots and microbial degradation was vital to cod removal 48 as it oxidised and decomposed organic matter under the action of aerobic microorganisms thereby reducing the amount of cod in the water body in addition during the gradual recovery of dissolved oxygen in the water body microbial degradation can oxidise substances such as reduced inorganic substances in the water body thereby reducing the amount of cod in the water body after 80 d of system operation the amount of cod in the water body stabilised at lower than 20 mg l the standard of class iii surface water was attained and the cod removal rate exceeded 60 3 6 process comparison the effects of do and transparency improvement as well as the removal of nh3 n tp and cod show that the in situ river treatment is less effective than the bypass system this might be because the in situ river treatment system did not provide sufficient microbial suspension sites and the water ecosystem in the in situ river treatment system was not well constructed in the bypass treatment system the combination of surface flow artificial wetlands ecological gravel beds artificial wetland multi pond systems and underwater forest ecosystems not only provided a sufficient number of microbial suspension sites but also improved the structure of the water body ecosystem which contributed to a better landscape effect furthermore the problems of the in situ treatment system such as storm during certain seasons which causes the planted plants to be washed away were solved in addition during the actual project if the land resources near the river are insufficient and the in situ treatment system must be used then processes such as contact oxidation ponds are to be incorporated to ensure sufficient space for microorganisms to suspend their films as well as to allow the construction of water ecology to be prioritised when selecting the process issues such as engineering cost effectiveness should be considered although the in situ treatment process is constrained by topographic conditions it does not require a significant amount of land resources and can allows the corresponding treatment measures to be implemented on the river which is not cost prohibitive by contrast the bypass treatment system requires a significant amount of land resources and the construction of numerous structures thereby incurring a higher cost specific processes must be selected after a comprehensive consideration of water quality topography and engineering costs 4 conclusion in this project bypass treatment was performed to improve the water quality of baozi river where the surrounding fish and lotus ponds were transformed a wetland ecosystem structure was built and the wetland biodiversity was enriched additionally ecological aeration systems surface flow artificial wetland systems ecological gravel beds ecological wetland multi pond systems and underwater forest systems were established and their processes combined subsequently in situ treatment was conducted in the river using aeration aquatic plants ecological floating islands ecological berms and substrate purifiers after 4 months of performing the combined process the do and transparency in the water body improved significantly and the amount of ammonia nh3 n tp and cod in the water body were reduced significantly in particular the removal rate of nh3 n exceeded 50 the removal rates of tp and cod exceeded 60 and all he waters quality indicators for the water body reached the standard of class iii surface water after the project was conducted the water quality of the river improved the surrounding fish and root ponds were used more reasonably aquatic plants grew better the landscape around the river was more beautiful and a healthy ecology returned which enabled the river to restore its self purification function this project realised the sustainable use of wetland functions wetland water bodies biological landscapes and other resources as well as achieved the dual purpose of water quality improvement and ecological construction with good application value which can serve as reference for

water quality local urban image environmental quality and living environment the combined technology can serve as reference for urban river water quality improvement graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bypass system combined technology water quality improve artificial wetlands aquatic plants 1 introduction owing to the rapid increase in the world population and the increasing global demand for water resources water scarcity has become one of the most significant challenges currently 1 whereas industrialisation and urbanisation processes have worsened the issue of water scarcity 2 water scarcity has become a critical problem in many countries whereas water quality deterioration has become a global problem 3 in recent years china has progressed significantly in terms of economic development and urbanisation nevertheless this is accompanied by various environmental problems where various pollutants are discharged into the surface of water bodies thereby resulting in increasing levels of pollution in urban rivers and lakes 4 as well as blackened and putrid water bodies and fish deaths the management of polluted water environments alleviation of water shortage and assurance of a good living environment to humans are important issues to be solved 5 an artificial wetland is an ecological engineering technology comprising aquatic plants substrates and microorganisms 6 and has been widely used in recent decades 7 it exhibits the characteristics of simple structure continuity and easy maintenance 8 in addition it affords a low operating cost as well as good removal and landscape effects 9 because of its combined physical chemical and biological processes it can effectively remove pollutants 10 from water and is thus widely used to treat industrial wastewater agricultural wastewater and stormwater runoffs 11 in artificial wetlands the substrate exerts filtering retention and adsorption effects on pollutants thereby enabling pollutant removal and providing space for plants and microorganisms to grow 12 these wetlands are composed of primarily soil sand and gravel aquatic plants are an important component of wetlands 13 and are typically used wetland plants such as typha orientalis presl phragmites australis cav trin ex steud hydrilla verticillata linn f royle and myriophyllum elatinoides gaudich the roots of aquatic plants can directly remove pollutants from wastewater via absorption and adsorption as well as secrete oxygen such that the wetland produces different areas with different oxygen levels allowing different microorganisms to survive in the wetland 14 the main microorganisms in artificial wetlands are bacteria protozoa fungi and algae which degrade pollutants into insoluble or harmless substances 15 artificial wetlands can effectively remove organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and other substances from the feed water through physical chemical and biological processes such as substrate adsorption plant uptake and microbial activity 16 as well as effectively remove suspended substances and microalgae from the water 17 however water quality improvement is extremely complicated and artificial wetlands exhibit low efficiency in terms of nitrogen removal owing to their limited dissolved oxygen concentration 18 therefore using only a single treatment technology renders it difficult to achieve the treatment goal in the actual water quality enhancement project various processes must be combined to enhance water quality such as combining artificial aeration and artificial wetlands in addition to the actual requirement to add an ecological substrate purifier an ecological isolation layer and other auxiliary measures in this study a typical river requiring water quality enhancement in wuhan was investigated the water quality condition of the river and the surrounding topographic conditions were first examined subsequently experience in water quality enhancement at both domestic and international level was exploited and the environmental benefits and technical stability of the project were fully considered a bypass artificial wetland system combining technologies such as surface flow artificial wetlands ecological gravel beds ecological wetland multi pond systems and underwater forest ecosystems was adopted to improve the river water quality artificial wetlands offer significant environmental benefits to urban ecosystems 19 in addition to improving water quality they offer other functions such as biodiversity and biological habitats 20 in addition artificial wetlands have been adopted in the in situ treatments of rivers via the planting of aquatic plants installation of ecological floating islands and use of ecological substrate purifiers bypass and in situ treatments were adopted which resulted in further improvements in river water quality the overall goals of this project is to achieve do 5 mg l nh3 n 1 0 mg l tp 0 2 mg l cod 20 mg l and transparency exceeding 60 cm as well as improve the image of the city increase biodiversity enhance environmental quality and improve the living environment in this study the ponds around baozi river are utilized and transformed into a bypass combination artificial wetland system based on the actual topography the construction of the bypass combination artificial wetland system is rationalised and the construction of each process in the bypass combination artificial wetland system is investigated subsequently the feasibility of using the ecological isolation layer to transform the pond into an artificial wetland is verified additionally a bypass combined artificial wetland system is constructed to improve the water quality of baozi river and improve the ecosystem of the baozi river watershed this may serve as reference for similar projects finally in situ and bypass treatment system processes are compared to verify the feasibility of the bypass combination artificial wetland system in actual water quality enhancement projects 2 materials and research methods 2 1 overview of study area the project is located in the northern foot section of the longquan mountain near baozi river in jiangxia district in wuhan city which is located in the transition zone between the jianghan plain and the hills in the south of china and the climate therein is subtropical monsoon the plain geomorphological features are clear and the overall terrain is high in the north and low in the south the average annual precipitation is 1150 1190 mm with the highest amount of rainfall from april to august the spring and summer seasons are typically rainy whereas the autumn and winter seasons are less rainy and the amount of rain is distributed unevenly the river channel comprises a flat terrain on both sides where fish ponds are located primarily on the west side and wasteland on the east side the river is approximately 0 9 km long 15 30 m wide and 1 5 m deep at the beginning of the study the river water was turbid and of low transparency the pollution sources were primarily the initial rainwater discharged directly from the rainwater pipe network of the surrounding towns and the agricultural sewage discharged directly from the surrounding farmlands to solve the pollution problem of baozi river the pond on the west side of the river was transformed into a bypass artificial wetland system and the river water was transferred to this system for treatment the design volume of the bypass artificial wetland system was 15 000 m3 d with a hydraulic retention time of approximately 25 d and an area of approximately 254 260 m2 the specific location of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 water quality characteristics prior to the commencement of the project the river water quality was monitored for 4 weeks once daily the average value was recorded and the results show that the river water quality monitoring indexes belonged to class v water of the china surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 those indexes did not satisfy the class iii water specifications required for the project the raw water quality characteristics are shown in table 1 2 3 sample acquisition three sampling sections were defined in the river for the demonstration project and the water quality indexes were used as their average values those sections are at the upstream of the river treatment process outlet downstream of the river expressed as the influent monitoring point 1 monitoring point 2 respectively the locations of the specific sampling points are shown in fig 1 the sampling points are acquired once every 10 d for 4 months the water samples are sampled using a water sampler subsequently the water samples are cryogenically preserved and returned to the laboratory to test for their cod tp nh3 n and other water quality indicators in the field to measure transparency dissolved oxygen and other water quality indicators 2 4 measurement methods the water quality measuring methods and measuring instruments are shown in table 2 2 5 waterquality enhancement technology 2 5 1 technology routes this current project is based on the overall principles of rational utilization environmental beauty and ecological return where the water quality enhancement and ecological construction are achieved by considering the situation and the local conditions the bypass treatment system used in this project combines the current water system and integrates the existing fish ponds to create purification function wetlands and natural landscape wetlands the existing field paths are used as the boundary and for functional zoning and they are allocated into units for the pre treatment system the aeration ponds the first level surface flow wetlands the ecological gravel beds the second level surface flow wetlands the ecological wetland multi pond systems and the underwater forest systems to provide a substrate environment conducive to ecological recovery and achieve continuous improvement in the water environment among them the pre treatment system occupies an area of 308 m2 and the design flow rate is 15 000 m3 d in addition aquatic plants are planted ecological floating islands are installed and ecological shore protection is implemented in the river for in situ treatment the specific process route is shown in fig 2 2 5 2 ecological water recharge and ecological aeration to maintain a healthy water ecosystem the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water body must be increased to ensure that the water body possesses sufficient oxidation capacity this is primary achieved via ecological water replenishment and artificial aeration in this project ecological water replenishment and ecological aeration are performed to increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water body to not only solve the problem of insufficient oxygen and black odour in the water body but also to improve the aerobic environment for the subsequent microbial degradation of pollutants low mobility of water bodies can trigger problems such as weak self purification ability of water bodies and accumulation of pollutants which would result in algal blooms significant changes in the biological communities of water bodies and loss of balance in water ecosystems therefore ecological replenishment is performed in this study to increase the mobility of the water body and restore the self purification ability of the water body ecological recharge artificially changes the original water body enables the water circulation mechanism improves the hydraulic conditions 21 effectively improves the water flow status and enhances the water body reoxygenation capacity and self purification capacity 22 in this project ecological water replenishment is performed daily and calculated based on evaporation and rainfall data 30 000 m3 of water is transferred from baoxie lake to the upstream of baozi river of which 15 000 m3 of the water undergoes wetlands treatment and another 15 000 m3 of water flows along baozi river from north to south with an average water exchange cycle of 22 d the designed zoning and ecological water replenishment scheme is shown in fig 3 artificial aeration technology depends on various artificially enhanced aeration methods to introduce air or oxygen into water to enhance the turbulent flow of river water and accelerate the reoxygenation of the water body 23 artificial aeration can not only oxidise blackened and putrid pollutants in the water body but can also accelerate the metabolism of animals plants and microorganisms in the water body and improve the purification capacity of the water body 24 the water body contains the appropriate amount of dissolved oxygen which is beneficial to the nitrification of microorganisms and the combined process can be operated efficiently via artificial aeration technology in this project an aeration equipment is installed at the front end of the bypass system and a layer of brown hair mat with a mass of 1200 g m3 per unit volume is installed at the bottom of the eco aeration pond as an ecological isolation layer which is fixed to each other using u shaped nails to prevent the substrate from being disrupted during aeration in addition within the ecological aeration pond filler type ecological floating islands are installed to not only provide microbial hanging film spots but also to facilitate landscaping four submersible push flow aerators with a power of 1 5 kw a voltage of 220 v a service area of 800 1200 m2 and an oxygenation capacity of approximately 5 4 kg o2 h are installed on the ecological isolation layer of the eco aeration pond aeration is conducted via intermittent aeration for 10 h d which not only improves nitrification but also increases the total nitrogen removal rate 25 the ecological aeration pond occupies an area of 3233 m2 the designed water depth is 1 5 m the hydraulic retention time is 3 h and the set flow rate is 15 000 m3 d 2 5 3 surface flow artificial wetlands and ecological gravel beds the treated water body in this project contains a significant amount of agricultural wastewater and surrounding initial rainwater which comprises a considerable amount of nitrogen and phosphorus excess nitrogen and phosphorus in the water body would result in eutrophication which would adversely affect the water ecosystem meanwhile the surface flow artificial wetlands are considered an environmentally friendly and low cost solution for agricultural wastewater treatment 26 in this project a superficial flow artificial wetlands with two levels are used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater via the synergistic effect of substrate microbial plant in the superficial flow artificial wetlands between the two levels of the surface flow wetlands ecological gravel beds were installed the ecological gravel beds offers both physical and chemical purification and biochemical purification effects meanwhile gravel of different particle sizes can filter the suspended substances the bottom of the gravel provides an anoxic environment where anaerobic microorganisms feed on nutrients e g the denitrification activities of microorganisms the surface layer provides an aerobic environment where aerobic microorganisms promote the decomposition of organic matter in the ecological gravel beds gravels of different particle sizes are set as fillers microorganisms are attached to the surface of the fillers and nutrients in the water body are decomposed when the water body passes through the attached biofilm the combination of surface flow artificial wetlands and ecological gravel beds promotes the synergistic effect of substrate microorganism plants as well as allow the nutrients in the water body to be removed more efficiently in this project the existing fish ponds are transformed into the surface flow wetlands soil river sand and gravel are typically used as substrates in artificial wetlands however the use of a single substrate results in saturation easily due to adsorption and is associated with low nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency 27 the substrate serves as a platform for plant growth and biofilm suspension as well as a reaction site for pollutant immobilisation 28 therefore the substrate setting is particularly important the substrate of the wetlands in this project is configured as follows 1 the bottom of the pond is compacted with plain soil a 100 mm fine sand protective layer is set on the upper layer of the plain soil layer and a layer of geotechnical protective film is set on the upper layer of the protective layer 2 a layer of filler is set on the upper layer of the geotechnical protective film and ceramic granules and large size pebbles are selected as fillers 3 a 30 mm thick brown mat is installed in the surface flow artificial wetlands based on the water depth a 10 cm layer of planting soil is placed on the brown mat and planting is performed on it in addition water sustaining plants such as canna and iris pseudacorus l are planted within 5 m along the wetlands whereas submerged plants such as vallisneria natans lour hara and hydrilla verticillata linn f royle are planted in the middle of the wetlands the area of the first level surface flow artificial wetlands is 26 497 m2 design flow rate is 15 000 m3 d design water depth is 1 5 m hydraulic retention time is 2 65 d and hydraulic load is 0 566 m3 m2 d the second level surface flow artificial wetlands occupy an area of 49 128 m2 with a design flow of 15 000 m3 d design water depth of 1 5 m hydraulic retention time of 4 91 d and hydraulic load of 0 305 m3 m2 d the structure of the surface flow artificial wetland is shown in fig 4 the ecological gravel beds comprise three levels of gravel bed as follows the first level is composed of 64 to 128 mm pebbles the second level 32 to 64 mm pebbles the third level 6 to 32 mm pebbles microorganisms can be attached to the filler to suspend the film such that water quality can be further improved the gravel beds are designed with water intake at the bottom and water plunging at different levels with two levels of plunging and vertical reciprocating water flows in the multi level composite ecological gravel bed side shore canna thalia dealbata fraser and other plants are planted within 5 m to not only enhance the landscape effect but also to purify the water the ecological gravel beds occupy an area of 14 026 m2 with a design flow of 15 000 m3 d hydraulic retention time of 0 7 d and hydraulic load of 1 07 m3 m2 d the structure of the ecological gravel bed is shown in fig 5 in this project first level surface flow wetlands ecological gravel beds and second level surface flow wetlands are installed at the front end of the bypass restoration system the two level surface flow wetlands are installed such that pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus are fully removed by plants microorganisms and the wetlands substrate the ecological gravel beds provide sufficient microbial hanging points thus allowing the organic pollutants to be decomposed while being in full contact with microorganisms the use of this combination technology not only affords better water quality improvement but also a better landscape effect 2 5 4 ecological wetland multi pond systems the ecological wetland multi pond systems are the ecological restoration technology with characteristics of low investment easy management and high removal performance it offers better treatment results in treating non point source pollution 29 features a larger water depth and uses a larger space to extend the retention time of sewage as compared with other systems 30 thereby allowing pollutants to be removed more efficiently from sewage to further improve water quality the ecological wetland multi pond systems are installed after the second level surface flow wetlands in this project the ecological wetland multi pond systems are combined with the surrounding topography of the fish pond or lotus pond dredging transformation to provide a suitable growth environment for aquatic plants furthermore this combines allows aquatic microorganisms to remove pollutants in the water body efficiently and harmlessly the installation of artificial islands increases the intersection between water and land as well as the contact area between soil and water meanwhile the changing water depth increases the habitation area of different organisms thereby increasing biodiversity the ecological wetland multi pond systems occupy an area of 103 490 m2 with a design flow of 15 000 m3 d design water depth of 1 5 m hydraulic retention time of 10 d and hydraulic load of 0 15 m3 m2 d the structure of the ecological wetland multi pond system is shown in fig 6 to manage surface pollution more effectively multi stage stabilisation ponds are to be installed based on the actual topography of the project site as well as the different water depths this allows anaerobic aerobic and ecological ponds to be constructed to create an anaerobic anoxic aerobic environment which allows pollutants in the water body to be further removed in addition aquatic plants can be planted fish and shrimp can be stocked and biological fillers can be added in the multi pond systems after river water flows into the multi pond systems the pollutants will be absorbed and purified by the microorganisms and plants in the multi stage stabilisation ponds subsequently the pollutants will enter the lower treatment facilities via the connecting pipeline in this project a multi pond connection pipeline with a diameter of 400 to 600 which is based on the size of the site pond is installed to prevent water flow out of the pond the pond should be installed based on the direction of water flow in the pond water blocking cloth furthermore waterproof fabric should be used as the water blocking cloth such that the water body is fully purified and output uniformly aquatic plant partitions are set up in the multi ponds based on a reasonable configuration to overcome the shortcomings of ordinary artificial wetlands those partitions encompass a large area and can filter pollutants they effectively remove pollutants in the water body and minimise the transformation cost while being easily manageable 2 5 5 underwater forest ecosystems the underwater forest ecosystems improve the water environment enhance the ability of the water body to absorb pollution and produce clear water and offers a certain landscape value it features a structure comprising primarily submerged plants and aquatic plants as a supplement the submerged plants are key to water quality improvement in underwater forest which is achieved primarily through plant growth absorption and improvements in the water body environment to purify the water body 31 submerged plants are not only the main producers of aquatic ecosystems but also the basis for the structural complexity spatial diversity and functional stability of aquatic ecosystems furthermore they can effectively maintain the stability of water quality 32 this project is performed based on the underwater forest ecosystems at the end of the bypass system the water body enters the underwater forest ecosystems after the previous process treatment to ensure the required water quality standard it is partitioned into three zones i e a pre treatment area an ecological connotation area and a clear water flow area as shown in fig 7 the underwater forest ecosystems occupy an area of 61 124 m2 meanwhile the design flow is 15 000 m3 d design water depth is 1 5 m hydraulic retention time is 5 81 d and hydraulic load is 0 26 m3 m2 d the pre treatment ecological and clear water flow areas encompass 14 863 36 075 and 10 186 m2 respectively the pre treatment zone is used to promote the sedimentation of suspended matter in the upstream water and reduce the amounts of organic matter and nitrogen nutrients in the water body in the pre treatment area artificial water grass and aquatic plants are placed separately the artificial water plants are used to increase the contact time between water flow and microbial carriers via the purification principle of biofilms as well as physical rectification and interception such that the pollutants in the water can be in complete contact with the biofilm and the water quality can be improved in addition the artificial water plants can intercept and accumulate the suspended matters in the water and the water transparency can be improved which promotes the growth of submerged plants and results in an improved food chain and ecosystem the submerged plants planted in the pre treatment area are primarily vallisneria natans lour hara hydrilla verticillata linn f royle and other plants measuring 40 60 cm v natans lour hara with a planting density of 40 60 plants m2 and h verticillata linn f royle with a planting density of 9 12 bushes m2 in an area 5 m away from the shore aquatic plants such as thalia dealbata fraser and canna indica l measuring 120 180 cm are planted at a planting density of 1 plant m2 the ecological cultured area is intended to reduce the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients and organic matter in the water body in the ecological cultured area the food chain of the ecological cultured area is improved by placing algae control zooplankton and aquatic animals as well as by constructing an aquatic plant system additionally the appropriate placement of the algae control zooplankton can not only improve the transparency of the water body but also promote the growth of aquatic plants algae control zooplankton are associated with comprehensive ecological restoration treatment no secondary pollution no ecological safety hazards stable effect low cost and applicability under the hydrological water quality conditions of most urban landscape water bodies or natural eutrophic water bodies the aquatic animals used are primarily lateolabrax japonicus macrobrachium nipponense and sinotaia quadrata the size of l japonicus is 350 400 g tail the length of m nipponense is 2 3 cm and the diameter of sinotaia quadrata is 1 2 cm the submerged and aquatic plants planted in the ecological cultured area are the same as those in the pre treatment area in terms of type size and density the clean water flow area is intended to purify the large water depth and guarantee the water quality the planting of the plants and the placement of the aquatic animals in the clear water flow area are the same as those in the ecological connotation area the underwater forest ecosystems not only effectively improve the water quality and increases the diversity of regional species but also exhibit a certain landscape structure the structure of the underwater forest ecosystem is shown in fig 8 2 5 6 ecological substrate remediation agent owing to the discharge of wastewater from fish and root ponds into rivers for many years significant amounts of oxygen consuming organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus are continuously precipitated and accumulated in the ponds which form sediments meanwhile external disturbances and changes in the redox state of the water column result in the release of pollutants into the overlying water column via sediment suspension or concentration gradient diffusion thereby causing a secondary pollution of the water column 33 therefore bottom sediment management is essential substrate dredging involves significant amounts of labour and financial resources as well as easily causes the destruction of underwater ecosystems sediment resuspension and secondary pollution during sediment transportation and disposal 34 to mitigate this issue ecological substrate remediation agents are used this technology can effectively reduce the enrichment of nh3 n nitrites organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus in the overlying water body inhibit the outbreak of anaerobic pathogenic bacteria and afford better treatment on heavy metals in the substrate thereby significantly reducing toxicity and inhibiting of heavy metals in the substrate to plants hence an in situ remediation of the substrate can be achieved to treat the substrate a high pressure water gun is used to suspend the substrate and 500 1000 g m2 of the ecological substrate restorer is used for 20 d subsequently some sections of the river are added based on the condition of the river the best construction conditions are 15 c 35 c and a water depth 0 5 3 m the ecological substrate restorer is placed in the entire river section whose length and area are approximately 900 m and 154 177 m2 respectively 2 5 7 ecological isolation layer when pond renovation was performed in this study a 30 mm thick palm mat was installed based on the design water depth and fixed using u nails additionally a 10 cm layer of planting soil was laid on top of the palm mat the ecological isolation layer can solve the problems of excessive water depth and planting difficulty in certain sections of the surface flow wetlands and ecological wetland multi pond systems the ecological isolation layer which can not only improve the plant survival rate and allow the plant roots to be in complete contact with the water body integrates the characteristics of ecological floating islands and submerged plants hence it solves the problem of non controllable ecological floating islands during stormy seasons furthermore it provides microorganisms with more suspension points and prevents the sediments in the water column from clogging the substrate of the bypass combination artificial wetland system the ecological isolation layer is shown in fig 9 2 5 8 river reconstruction the river transformation performed in this study is based on river bank transformation substrate restoration and greening transformation the river bank transformation is intended primarily for the transformation of natural river banks in the natural river bank transformation vegetation compound bank protection is used the river bank is fixed with net mats and various plants are planted on the river bank a significant amount of sediment exists at the bottom of the river which would release pollutants and cause a secondary pollution if not treated timely in the river sediment transformation performed in this study an ecological sediment purifier is added to prevent the release of pollutants in the river sediment such that water purification can be achieved river greening transformation is intended primarily for general plant planting fountain aeration planting canna indica l thalia dealbata fraser and other aquatic plants on the edge of the river bank planting vallisneria natans lour hara hydrilla verticillata linn f royle and other submerged plants at a greater water depth arranging ecological floating islands in the centre of the river and planting myriophyllum elatinoides gaudich and other plants in ecological floating islands while greening the area around the river which comprises trees and shrubs in the centre of the river a fountain aerator is installed every 50 m to not only increase the amount of do but also to enhance the landscape the river transformation not only purifies the water enhances the landscape but also provides areas of human living tourism and entertainment 3 results and discussion the project lasted 4 months from system start up to system stabilisation beginning from the start up samples were obtained every 10 d for 12 times from 10 00 to 11 00 a m the measurement indexes included do nh3 n tp cod and transparency among them do and transparency were measured on site and the remaining three indicators were sampled and then used in the laboratory for measurement 3 1 do enhancement effect as shown in fig 10 the result of this project shows good water reoxygenation and the do in the water column increases from 1 40 to approximately 5 10 mg l in the first 20 d of system operation the water column was reoxygenated using aeration ecological substrate remediation agent combination technology in the river and an aerator in the bypass system where the ecological substrate remediation agent injected contains calcium peroxide and other oxygenating agents as a slow release oxygenating agent calcium peroxide decomposes gradually in the water column thereby releasing oxygen 35 and maintaining the water column in an aerobic state for a long period after 20 d of system operation the oxygenating agent in the ecological substrate restorer in the river lost its effect and the pollutant degradation required a significant amount of do which caused the rate of water reoxygenation to begin decreasing the main reoxygenation methods of the river in situ treatment system and bypass system at this stage were artificial aeration reoxygenation and aquatic plant reoxygenation the plants planted in the treatment system not only absorbed harmful substances in the wastewater but also provided oxygen to the water environment 36 when a significant amount of oxygen produced via plant photosynthesis was delivered to the root zone the excess amount diffused outward from the root surface after 30 d of system operation the aquatic plants grown to maturity released a significant amount of oxygen thereby increasing the water reoxygenation rate after 80 d of system operation the amount of do in the river water body stabilised at above 5 10 mg l which indicates that the artificial aeration and aquatic plant system in the treatment system can effectively prevent the effect of pollutants and facilitate the enhancement in do in the water body 3 2 transparency enhancement effect as shown in fig 11 the transparency of the water body improves significantly after treatment was implemented in the first 20 d of system operation the transparency improved faster i e from 11 to approximately 34 cm in this stage the transparency improvement in the bypass system is attributed to the pre treatment system ecological substrate purifier and ecological gravel beds in the pre treatment system devices such as grates were installed to retain larger particles in the water column in addition larger particles and pollutants were first removed via the physical filtration and retention of the substrate 12 the transparency enhancement in the in situ river treatment system is attributed to the ecological substrate purifier the ecological substrate purifier contained flocculants therefore flocculation with suspended materials was achieved in the water column and the flocculants provided the appropriate surface area to allow smaller particulate matter to accumulate on them and form larger particles 37 which were then settled by gravity after 20 d of system operation although the flocculant in the ecological substrate restorer lost its flocculating effect as the aquatic plants matured the macrophytes reduced the flow velocity of the water column and filtered the suspended solids 38 as well as enhanced water clarity by reducing sediment resuspension nutrient concentrations and the proliferation of phytoplankton 39 additionally aquatic animals removed suspended matter and phytoplankton via the food chain in this stage the system was operated for approximately 80 d and the water transparency fluctuated at approximately 70 cm thus satisfying the requirement of 60 cm in this project 3 3 removal effect of nh3 n as shown in fig 12 the concentration of nh3 n in the water column decreases abruptly in the first 20 d of system operation the concentration of nh3 n decreases gradually from 20 to 80 d of system operation and the concentration of nh3 n stabilises at approximately 0 90 mg l after 80 d of system operation during the first 20 d of system operation the nh3 n concentration in the overlying water column decreases owing to the adsorption of substances such as bentonite in the ecological substrate purifier used in the river after approximately 20 d the adsorption saturated and the nh3 n concentration in the water column began to decrease gradually in addition the pre treatment system in the bypass system and the substrate of each system contributed differently to the process the nh3 n removal rate recovered after 30 d of system operation owing to the synergistic substrate plant microbial action in the treatment system where nh3 n was permanently removed via nitrogen emission ammonia volatilisation and plant harvesting under the actions of microbial activity substrate adsorption and plant uptake in this process nitrification and denitrification in microbial activity were the main denitrification mechanisms 40 and after 30 d of system operation microorganisms successfully suspended a film on the substrate and nh3 n is adsorbed by substrates such as ceramic granules in the wetland subsequently nh3 n was degraded transformed and bio immobilised by microorganisms in the substrate and the substrate removal of nh3 n involved physical precipitation filtration and adsorption 41 in addition the roots of plants such as hydrilla verticillata linn f royle grew to maturity and the roots of aquatic plants were able to accumulate numerous microorganisms which promoted microbial denitrification due to oxygen release from the roots and the formation of an anoxic anaerobic aerobic environment meanwhile nh3 n was converted to no2 or no3 due to nitrification by microorganisms the aquatic plants consumed nitrates or nitrites to directly fulfil their nutrient requirements 42 and finally removed nitrogen from the water column via plant harvesting etc in this study intermittent aeration was adopted which enabled an aerobic anoxic anaerobic environment in the treatment system and was conducive to microbial denitrification 43 meanwhile the nh3 n in the water column was fully removed after 80 d of system operation the nh3 n concentration stabilised below 0 90 mg l and the removal rate was relatively stable indicating the high efficiency of the system in removing nh3 n 3 4 removal effect of tp as shown in fig 13 the amount of tp in the water column decreases significantly in the first 20 d of system operation and decreases gradually thereafter meanwhile the amount of tp in the water column decreases to less than 0 2 mg l after 60 d of system operation in the first 20 d of system operation the ecological substrate purifier used in the river contained modified bentonite which exhibits a high specific surface area with a high adsorption capacity 44 and the ecological substrate purifier absorbed soluble phosphate in the water column when it was sinking which caused the amount of tp in the water column to decrease significantly in this stage the bypass system contributed to the process as well after 20 d of system operation the adsorption of modified bentonite in the bottom sludge purifier saturated and its adsorption effect was lost thereby causing the phosphorus amount in the water column to decrease gradually after 30 d of system operation phosphorus removal depended on the filtration and adsorption of the substrate assimilation by plants and assimilation and accumulation by microorganisms the substrate was the most vital to tp removal followed by the combined action of the aquatic plants and microorganisms 45 the phosphorus removal primarily involved the filtering of larger phosphorus containing particles in the water column and applying their adsorption properties to adsorb smaller phosphorus containing particles during the continuous growth of the aquatic plants in the system phosphorus was absorbed by the aquatic plants and then transformed into substances required for the plants growth resulting in a reduction in the tp amount in the water column furthermore the harvesting of plants at a later stage resulted in the removal of tp from the water column microorganisms absorb excess phosphorus under anaerobic conditions 46 whereas phosphorus can be absorbed by microorganisms and enriched in the body to be removed after the system was operated for 80 d the tp levels in the water column are lower than 0 2 mg l and the tp concentration reduced significantly 3 5 removal effect of cod as shown in fig 14 the amount of cod in the water column decreases significantly during the system operation the main mechanisms of organic matter removal are sedimentation and filtration of suspended solids plant uptake and microbial biodegradation processes under aerobic or anaerobic conditions 47 during the first 20 d of system operation the amount of cod in the water column decreased significantly primarily due to the removal of larger suspended solids via the grids in the bypass system the adsorption and filtration of the ecological gravel beds and substrate installed in the system which removed the particulate matter from the water column as well as the flocculants and adsorbents in the ecological substrate purifier used in the river after 20 d of system operation the cod content in the water body began to decrease gradually primarily because the flocculants and adsorbents in the substrate purifier had lost their effects which then caused the amount of cod in the water body to decrease gradually however in this stage the plants grew and matured gradually and in the plant growth stage they could absorb the nutrients dissolved in the water body furthermore the plants imposed an interception effect on the particulate matter which allowed the number of cod in the water body to be reduced in this stage microorganisms successfully suspended a film in the ecological gravel beds and plant inter roots and microbial degradation was vital to cod removal 48 as it oxidised and decomposed organic matter under the action of aerobic microorganisms thereby reducing the amount of cod in the water body in addition during the gradual recovery of dissolved oxygen in the water body microbial degradation can oxidise substances such as reduced inorganic substances in the water body thereby reducing the amount of cod in the water body after 80 d of system operation the amount of cod in the water body stabilised at lower than 20 mg l the standard of class iii surface water was attained and the cod removal rate exceeded 60 3 6 process comparison the effects of do and transparency improvement as well as the removal of nh3 n tp and cod show that the in situ river treatment is less effective than the bypass system this might be because the in situ river treatment system did not provide sufficient microbial suspension sites and the water ecosystem in the in situ river treatment system was not well constructed in the bypass treatment system the combination of surface flow artificial wetlands ecological gravel beds artificial wetland multi pond systems and underwater forest ecosystems not only provided a sufficient number of microbial suspension sites but also improved the structure of the water body ecosystem which contributed to a better landscape effect furthermore the problems of the in situ treatment system such as storm during certain seasons which causes the planted plants to be washed away were solved in addition during the actual project if the land resources near the river are insufficient and the in situ treatment system must be used then processes such as contact oxidation ponds are to be incorporated to ensure sufficient space for microorganisms to suspend their films as well as to allow the construction of water ecology to be prioritised when selecting the process issues such as engineering cost effectiveness should be considered although the in situ treatment process is constrained by topographic conditions it does not require a significant amount of land resources and can allows the corresponding treatment measures to be implemented on the river which is not cost prohibitive by contrast the bypass treatment system requires a significant amount of land resources and the construction of numerous structures thereby incurring a higher cost specific processes must be selected after a comprehensive consideration of water quality topography and engineering costs 4 conclusion in this project bypass treatment was performed to improve the water quality of baozi river where the surrounding fish and lotus ponds were transformed a wetland ecosystem structure was built and the wetland biodiversity was enriched additionally ecological aeration systems surface flow artificial wetland systems ecological gravel beds ecological wetland multi pond systems and underwater forest systems were established and their processes combined subsequently in situ treatment was conducted in the river using aeration aquatic plants ecological floating islands ecological berms and substrate purifiers after 4 months of performing the combined process the do and transparency in the water body improved significantly and the amount of ammonia nh3 n tp and cod in the water body were reduced significantly in particular the removal rate of nh3 n exceeded 50 the removal rates of tp and cod exceeded 60 and all he waters quality indicators for the water body reached the standard of class iii surface water after the project was conducted the water quality of the river improved the surrounding fish and root ponds were used more reasonably aquatic plants grew better the landscape around the river was more beautiful and a healthy ecology returned which enabled the river to restore its self purification function this project realised the sustainable use of wetland functions wetland water bodies biological landscapes and other resources as well as achieved the dual purpose of water quality improvement and ecological construction with good application value which can serve as reference for
