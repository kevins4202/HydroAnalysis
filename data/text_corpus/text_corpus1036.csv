risk management behavior fdrmb in downstream of karkheh dam basin iran for this purpose the protection motivation theory pmt was used to measure fdrmb this theory consists of six variables i e perceived vulnerability pv perceived severity ps self efficacy se response cost rc response efficacy rc and intention in this research included a descriptive correlational and causal relationship that was conducted by a survey the study population included farmers who were members in the water user association in downstream of karkheh dam n 3668 out of which 350 users were sampled by krejcie and morgan s table and by the stratified random sampling method respectively in accordance with the pmt for the variables affecting fdrmb a causal framework was designed findings from the path analysis indicated that the six variables in pmt might explain 0 473 of the fdrmb variance besides se had the highest effect in fdrmb Î² 0 503 as a general conclusion policies need to make farmers take their own risk management decisions and have access to a variety of tools and strategies keywords drought risk management behavior protection motivation theory farmers climate change causal analysis 1 introduction many different definitions of drought have been presented naturally drought simply means lack of rainfall mishra and singh 2010 in agriculture specifically it means low moisture at the root of crop products in hydrological terms drought indicates the condition when the level of subsurface waters in streams lakes reservoirs etc drop below moderate levels economically drought is considered to be a water scarcity that affects the sustainable economy however new classifications of drought have been formed emphasizing it as a phenomenon created by human systems and ecosystems and that its long term effects might lead to ecosystem degradation famine severe social conflict and economic damages sayers et al 2016 fang et al 2019 recent droughts in iran have been associated with growing demand for water population growth and agricultural development that all have resulted in further water scarcity yazdanpanah et al 2014 the analysis of the data related to rainfalls water resources and climate changes in iran illustrates that the country is facing a major drought and an environmental crisis that need to be managed properly unless will cause irrecoverable damage to the country safavi and rastghalam 2017 mosavi et al 2020 drought is a recurring phenomenon of any region s climate however drought management has not 1received enough attention in many parts of the world there are two broad approaches for drought management crisis management and risk management drought crisis management involves activities carried out by governments i e identifying crisis areas and providing aid for those areas such measures are often costly and unfortunately are usually taken when it s quite late on the contrary in drought risk management economic and timely management the goal is getting prepared for the drought before it s occurred and spread as a matter of fact drought risk management involves taking the necessary and pre designed measures for adaptation to drought in the future according to the current conditions of the area that is drought risk management is a set of actions that are done in advance to minimize the effects of an unanticipated drought risk itself is a condition of uncertainty that affects the performance of either an individual or an organization in a way that their success and failure would then both be a possibility in this regard drought risk is an essential feature of human and natural systems that reflects interactions among climate hydrological response the vulnerability of individuals ecosystems and economies sayers et al 2016 in iran water related problems have multiple roots yazdanpanah et al 2015 drought is a creeping disaster that cannot be solved without systematic thinking and appropriate management mishra and singh 2010 one of the most important actions in this regard is to modify the behavioral patterns of water stakeholders in different fields many studies have recognized the consumption behaviors of individuals and society members especially the agricultural community as the most important cause for water problems shiri et al 2011 nasrabadi et al 2013 abadi 2017 bijani et al 2017 malekian et al 2017 sabzali parikhani et al 2018 khachatryan et al 2019 ataei et al 2019 sharifzadeh et al 2019 rezaei et al 2020 therefore to prevent environmental problems and degradation of water resources and subsequent food insecurity it would be necessary to focus on the promotion of appropriate drought risk management practices among farmers as the largest water consumer community the first step in this path is to understand the current behaviors of farmers yazdanpanah et al 2014 salehi et al 2017 one of the behaviors requiring to be assessed is the farmers drought risk management behavior fdrmb in the basin of karkheh dam in khuzestan province one of the most important centers of iran s agriculture drought has damaged agricultural products and has led to reduction of performance level of surface streams underground reservoirs and changed aquatic ecosystems like rivers and wetlands assareh and amiri 2015 these effects entail further studies on the management of drought risk behavior in the downstream of the karkheh river thus the goal of this study was the application of protection motivation theory pmt to assess farmers drought risk management behavior in the karkheh dam basin iran consequently reviewing the present literature and documents the authors tried to approach the issue from a new perspective novelty of this study not only was the study area but also it was fdrmb analysis based on protection motivation theory pmt for the first time pmt has been used extensively in health care nevertheless its application in drought has yet remained unstudied besides the causality and its application as a causal model has not been applied in previous studies thus the main focus was on risk management behavior that used the literature of risk management studies and tried to explain how farmers think and behave under risky conditions 2 theoretical background and literature review 2 1 theoretical background researches has shown that theory based interventions might motivate people to change their attitudes and their behaviors in drought conditions aquilina et al 2004 in this study protection motivation theory pmt first proposed by rogers 1975 and 1983 fig 1 was used as a basis for identifying the main factors of farmers behavior pmt compared to other theories encompasses a broad set of predictions and might improve our understanding of the uncertainties governing environmental behavior bockarjova and steg 2014 and it can serve as a consultation and decision making tool and it can help us to identify barriers and facilitators for the acceptation of protective behaviors pmt revolves around the idea that people when faced with a risk adopt coping measures through two cognitive processes threat appraisal ta and coping appraisal ca rogers 1983 ta is the individual s assessment of threat level in terms of perceived vulnerability pv and perceived severity ps pv reflects the individual s sensitivity to the threat scarpa and theiene 2011 in this study the threats are result of social economic and environmental damages caused by droughts thus it can be said that ps is the level of threat that people expect to confront in case of their resilience to that threat dang et al 2012 in this study ps denotes the consequences of drought for the farmers ca is the individual s assessment of his or her ability to respond to a perceived threat here the environmental effects of drought and to avoid a particular risk here the negative consequences of drought ca itself consists of three variables response efficacy re self efficacy se and response costs rc floyd et al 2000 response efficacy is the impact of a reaction to mitigate or avoid an existing risk ibid in this study response efficacy is the impact of environmental activities carried out to manage drought and to reduce its negative effects self efficacy emphasizes one s ability and judgment in dealing with threats or planning protective measures ifinedo 2012 besides se refers to the measures taken to protect human life during drought finally response costs represent all perceived costs associated with the protective measures including financial costs time effort and emotional costs scarpa and theiene 2011 therefore ca can be seen as the perceived ability to prevent or to reduce risks versus the predicted costs of protective measures keshavarz and karami 2016 2 2 literature review the review of the theoretical literature on the subject revealed a wide variety of studies that in their analysis of fdrmb have used pmt table 1 floyd et al 2000 found that the increase of threat intensity threat vulnerability response efficacy and self efficacy facilitate inabilities and adaptable behaviors on the contrary a decrease in adaptive response rewards and adaptive response costs increase adaptive intentions or behaviors van duinen et al 2015 reported that behavioral factors have significant roles in explaining the actual extent of farmers adaptation motivations it was also found that perceived severity perceived cost and se significantly reduce drought behavior chen 2016 studied the empirical results obtained from the developed pmt model this study reported that not only the perceived vulnerability about the threat of food safety scandals and the perceived self efficacy but also the perceived product safety liability of food providers involved in food safety scandals were significant predictors of protection motivation which consequently would affect the behavioral intentions regarding safe food choices according to keshavarz and karami 2016 perceived response efficacy perceived severity response costs perceived vulnerability self efficacy income and social environment significantly affect the environmental behavior of farmers during droughts as it can be seen the effects of both income and social environment along with the effects of pmt components on behavior were considered in this study azadi et al 2017 found that there was a positive and significant correlation between response efficacy self efficacy perceived vulnerability perceived threat severity and response cost on one hand and on the other the adaptive behavior of farmers when they are come up with climate changes that is with the increase of response efficacy self efficacy perceived vulnerability perceived threat severity and response costs farmers adaptation behavior also increases besides the results showed that response self efficacy perceived vulnerability and response costs have a significant and positive effect on farmers adaptation behavior overall these variables managed to predict 34 of the variability of the adaptation behavior of farmers in case of coming up with climate changes self efficacy was the variable most capable in terms of predicting adaptation behavior of farmers who were come up with climate changes because it had a significant direct effect on farmers adaptation behavior delfiyan et al 2018 2020 found that farmers drought adaptation behavior was mainly predicted by intentions perceived severity perceived vulnerability and perceived benefits the findings of this study indicated that the intention had a significant negative relationship with perceived vulnerability and perceived barriers in addition the intention had a significant positive relationship with belief and self efficacy variables results of the correlation test showed that the behavior variable had a significant positive relationship with the following variables perceived vulnerability perceived severity perceived benefits self efficacy and intention the results of the regression analysis also showed that self efficacy and perceived benefits might significantly explain the changes in an individual s intention in terms of adapting to drought in spite of the claims made the variables of perceived vulnerability perceived severity of effects and perceived barriers were not found to be significant it was also reported that the following 4 variables i e intention perceived severity perceived vulnerability and perceived benefits might significantly explain the changes in an individual s drought adaptation behavior formunyuy verkijika 2018 came to the conclusion that the perceived vulnerability and the perceived severity had significant positive effects on regretting and also they had indirect positive effects on intention and behavior the predicted self efficacy and regret were directly correlated with intention and the predicted regret and intention had positive effect on behavior however response cost and response efficacy had no significant relationship with intention menard et al 2018 found that one s personal attitudes toward collectivism would affect psychological ownership and lack of intention for safe behaviors also psychological ownership has a significant effect on the structures of protection motivation as well as intention through studying the effect of collectivism on spiritual ownership and the effect of psychological ownership on protection the findings of this study contribute to the realization of information security the results of this study also showed a significant relationship between response cost and behavioral intention but self efficacy response efficacy and perceived severity had no significant relationship with behavioral intention ghanian et al 2020 found that farmers adaptation intention was affected directly by in adaptation and indirectly by economic disincentives barriers to belief in anthropogenic climate change and broader risk perceptions 3 research methodology 3 1 research design this study was applied in terms of approach purpose quantitative in terms of nature of the problem and non experimental in terms of control over the variables in terms of method the study was descriptive correlational and causal relational and was carried out using the survey technique 3 2 study area the study area is karkheh river basin krb located in khuzestan province southwest iran fig 2 the basin represents semi arid and arid areas of the region and covers 5 08 million ha mha out of which only 1 07 mha are irrigable and 0 9 mha are suitable for rainfed agriculture krb is located in 25 32 to 00 35 northern latitudes and 00 46 to 00 49 eastern longitudes with considering karoun and dez rivers having the major capacity of water karkheh river with less capacity holds the most amount of water in iran the water basin of karkheh river is 42 620 km2 up to the bridge and is about 50 000 km2 up to hourolazim swamp as its final destination haghiabi and mastorakis 2009 this basin southern karkheh covers four cities including hamidieh dasht e azadegan bostan susangerd hoveyzeh and ahwaz 3 3 statistical population and sampling method the statistical population of the study included the farmers n 3668 who were members of water user associations in the downstream of the karkheh dam the reason for choosing these farmers was that they had been already given good and accurate information about drought and they had well comprehension of that based on the questions raised in this study the target audience were those who had the necessary information about the drought and had received the necessary trainings farmers who were members of the water user associations had this feature the sample size was determined using krejcie and morgan 1970 sample size table n 350 and the sample was formed using the proportionate stratified random sampling method table 2 it should be noted that in this sampling the strata were the irrigation networks of karkheh dam basin 3 4 survey instrument questionnaire was used as the data collection instrument the validity of the questionnaire was verified by a panel of professors and experts expertise in agricultural extension and education and water resources management and planning the reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using cronbach s alpha test table 3 the questionnaire consisted of three sections the first section contained title and purpose of the research the second section contained the items used to measure each research variable and the third section was related to the demographic characteristics of the participants the items related to the variables presented in fig 1 based on pmt were measured using a five point likert scale coded 1 5 in this study ps stands as the consequences of drought for farmers which is briefly described as consequences and symbolized as ps also pv is the perceived vulnerability of drought for farmers and se refers to the measures taken to protect human life during drought that are briefly described as perceived vulnerability and self efficacy respectively and abbreviated as pv and se as seen in table 3 according to the protection motivation theory pmt the items of these two variables are the same in which two respondents are asked for response cost rc and response efficacy re the obtained data were analyzed using spss24 pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between the variables and using multiple linear regression the causal relations were determined by path analysis 4 result and discussion 4 1 analysis of individual characteristics of the farmers among the farmers studied 306 individuals were male 87 4 and 44 were female 12 6 the average age of the farmers was 42 31 7 of them were in the range of 30 40 years old and 18 3 of them were less than 30 years old the former group had the highest frequency whereas the later had the least among these farmers 292 83 4 had already experienced drought and 58 16 6 had not experienced it only 181 farmers participated in the drought training classes and 169 individual denied participation 4 2 relationships among variables pearson correlation test was used to determine the relationships between variables table 4 the results showed that excluding rc there was a significant correlation between fdrmb and all other variables the variables in re pv ps and se had the highest correlation with fdrmb in that order there was also a significant positive correlation between in and other variables except rc 4 3 causal analysis of the variables affecting fdrmb according to the theoretical framework of this paper pmt fdrmb might be used to establish causal chain between in pv ps re rc and se numerous studies have established and tested such a causal chain for the purpose of behavioral evaluation bijani et al 2017 2019 ebrahimi sarcheshmeh et al 2018 mohammadi mehr et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2020 shojaei miandoragh et al 2020 valizadeh et al 2018 2019 2020 in this study path analysis was conducted using multiple linear regression method the results of path analysis showed that the causal model of the research might explain a significant share of variance changes in fdrmb and in the r2adj values for each regression were 0 473 for fdrmb and 0 520 for in respectively table 5 and fig 3 the path analysis calculations were performed using enter method in two steps in the first step of causal analysis based on the theoretical framework in fig 1 the direct effects of the variables on fdrmb were assessed the results of this assessment showed that threat appraisal ta pv and ps coping appraisal ca se re and rc and in had a direct effect on fdrmb the results also showed that in had the greatest individual direct effect Î² 0 338 on fdrmb whereas ps had the smallest Î² 0 001 overall these six variables explain 0 473 of the variances in fdrmb in the second step the direct effects of the variables on in were analyzed the results of this analysis showed that the variables ta pv and ps and ca se re and rc had a direct effect on in and thereby indirect effect on fdrmb the results showed that ps had the greatest individual direct effect Î² 0 321 on farmers in in drought risk management and rc had the smallest individual direct effect on in generally these five variables explain 0 520 of variances in in table 6 shows the causal effect sum of direct and indirect effects and the total causal effect calculated for the variables affecting fdrmb the indirect effects of independent variables on the dependent variables according to the theoretical framework were calculated for the following variables pv 0 338 0 307 ps 0 338 0 321 se 0 098 0 338 re rc 0 217 0 338 and rc 0 008 0 338 as shown in table 6 and fig 3 the conducted path analysis determined that all paths except the effects of rc and ps were consistent with the theoretical framework pmt since the correlation of rc with fdrmb was not insignificant table 4 and Î² value calculated for this relation was 0 05 Î² 0 016 this path was not consistent with the theoretical framework mansourfar 2006 moreover since the t value obtained for the two aforementioned variables was not significant these paths were inconsistent with pmt this is also true for the effect of rc on in as shown in table 6 re had the greatest causal effect 0502 on the contrary ps had the greatest non causal effect 0 265 on fdrmb 5 conclusion and policy implications the findings of this study have contributed to conceptualization and comprehension of farmers drought risk management behavior in fdrmb analysis in the study pmt was applied which is replicable and comparable elsewhere the main objective of this paper was to use pmt so as to assess this behavior among farmers living in the basin of karkheh dam in iran thus the relationship between the variables of this theory and fdrmb was studied through a correlation and causal relation analysis indeed there are other variables such as personal professional normative and social features that might affect these relations inasmuch as no study might cover all aspects of a topic this study along with similar studies has focused merely on the pmt variables in fact in the similar studies alternative approaches could be taken from different logical or ethical perspectives and different theories and also other variables that are more suitable for the area under study can be used this study showed that pmt can be useful in explaining fdrmb fig 3 according to this theory fdrmb is determined by pv ps re rc se and in in this study the four variables re in pv and se had the greatest direct role in explaining the dependent variable fdrmb respectively nevertheless other variables rc and ps had no significant direct effect on fdrmb this result is not consistent with the results of keshavarz and karami 2016 azadi et al 2017 menard et al 2018 delfiyan et al 2018 2020 ghanian et al 2020 this could have been caused by the lack of transparency and the fact that the perceived severity of the drought has reached a critical level and yet the perception of drought induced costs that farmers shall pay in different ways cash and non cash is still immature furthermore se was found to be the most important predictor of fdrmb which has consistency with the reports of keshavarz and karami 2016 azadi et al 2017 several studies have recognized se as one of the most important pmt variables for influencing on behavior the results of this study showed a significant positive relationship between pv and fdrmb which is consistent with the results of van duinen et al 2015 chen 2016 delfiyan et al 2018 this could be due to the immense consequences of drought once the farmers understand these consequences they try to plan ahead and improve their flexibility against the expected effects that result in better behavior in other words farmers could reduce the effects of drought and could manage the drought risks by simple planning the results also showed a significant positive relationship between ps and fdrmb accordingly it can be argued that when farmers see the severity of the effects of drought they start conserving water thus showing farmers the real life examples of drought effects is recommended so that their understanding of the severity of the expected effects is increased and then they are stimulated to manage their behavior especially with regard to risk management a significant positive relationship was observed between se and fdrmb which was consistent with the results of floyd et al 2000 van duinen et al 2015 chen 2016 keshavarz and karami 2016 azadi et al 2017 formunyuy verkijika 2018 delfiyan et al 2018 menard et al 2018 accordingly the farmers ability to overcome managerial obstacles should be reinforced this can be done by devising appropriate programs and by involving farmers in the implementation of these programs and also giving them enough confidence regarding the ease of water resources management which would improve their drought risk management behavior the findings of this study showed a significant positive relationship between pv and in of farmers consistent with the studies of chen 2016 formunyuy verkijika 2018 delfiyan et al 2018 in other words the greater the farmers understanding of drought vulnerability is the greater their intention for improving their management behavior would be the farmers knowledge about the consequences of drought might be increased by holding educational classes and raising their awareness through media this approach can be expected to affect attitudes of farmers and to increase their understanding of the effects of drought on their life which in turn increases their in furthermore correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between ps and in that is means the greater the farmers understanding of the severity of the effects of drought is the higher their willingness to improve their drought risk management behavior would be since experience affects people s understanding of drought it can be argued that it increases their willingness to engage in management behaviors farming has for so long been an inherently risky profession so farmers might easily understand the possible severity of water scarcity effects and thus their intentions to manage water resources and their own behaviors might be enhanced the significant relationship observed between se and in consistent with studies of chen 2016 formunyuy verkijika 2018 delfiyan et al 2018 indicates that having a sense of drought risk management farmers might increase their willingness intention to improve their management behaviors therefore development of partnership programs with the purpose of supporting farmers would seem necessary to help them develop their skills and enhance their willingness to engage in management behaviors can be expected to result in the flourishment of farmers self efficacy potentials and improvement of their water resource protection behaviors undoubtedly one of the behaviors that might be improved in this way is the drought risk management behavior in the path analysis all paths except for the effects of rc and ps are consistent with the theoretical framework pmt this could be because of the fact that farmers still do not understand the costs of ignoring drought risk management and need more time to do so moreover the Î² value computed for ps was 0 05 Î² 0 001 despite the significant relationship between ps and fdrmb this path was inconsistent with the theoretical framework the reason was that although farmers had a tangible understanding of drought effects the perceived severity of the effects was yet not tangible enough one of the best strategies to address this issue is to emphasize on the extension training with the objective of strengthening these two parameters in farmers for this purpose the training sessions should focus less on pure awareness improvement and more on cooperation with farmers and then make them more engaged with the issue of drought risk and risk management these findings emerge from all the descriptive correlational and causal analysis and have some policy implications as follows 1 based on the results compared to researchers each farmer has much better information about the nature of his risk environment thus policies need to empower farmers so that they might take their own risk management decisions and have access to a variety of tools and strategies 2 besides the evaluation of response cost must be carried out in line with the assessment of drought risk management in other words weather and drought monitoring networks with sufficient coverage and adequate human capacity are required to analyze and to convert this information into drought risk management and mitigation measures 3 according to the findings policy choice concerning drought risk management is particularly challenging first there is inherent uncertainty and lack of information about risk management decisions in terms of both risk assessment and policy impacts analysis second the precise definition of the policy objective is controversial indeed the mitigation of agricultural risk always does not enhance farmers welfare and farmers understanding of drought vulnerability can vary across different government goals therefore this paper contributes in improving the knowledge of farmers strategic risk management decisions and introducing variables pv ps se rc rc and in that might increase the consideration of potential policy options 4 additionally the findings suggest that public policies should effectively target risk averse farmers in order to establish confident relationships with them which can strengthen their perceptions and adaptive behaviors in relation to drought and climate changes from the perspective of policy coming up with drought the adaptive behavior is relatively more efficient in increasing farmers welfare than the government programs the main reason is that adaptive behaviors have higher efficiency in increasing self efficacy and perceived vulnerability of farmers

significant predictors of protection motivation which consequently would affect the behavioral intentions regarding safe food choices according to keshavarz and karami 2016 perceived response efficacy perceived severity response costs perceived vulnerability self efficacy income and social environment significantly affect the environmental behavior of farmers during droughts as it can be seen the effects of both income and social environment along with the effects of pmt components on behavior were considered in this study azadi et al 2017 found that there was a positive and significant correlation between response efficacy self efficacy perceived vulnerability perceived threat severity and response cost on one hand and on the other the adaptive behavior of farmers when they are come up with climate changes that is with the increase of response efficacy self efficacy perceived vulnerability perceived threat severity and response costs farmers adaptation behavior also increases besides the results showed that response self efficacy perceived vulnerability and response costs have a significant and positive effect on farmers adaptation behavior overall these variables managed to predict 34 of the variability of the adaptation behavior of farmers in case of coming up with climate changes self efficacy was the variable most capable in terms of predicting adaptation behavior of farmers who were come up with climate changes because it had a significant direct effect on farmers adaptation behavior delfiyan et al 2018 2020 found that farmers drought adaptation behavior was mainly predicted by intentions perceived severity perceived vulnerability and perceived benefits the findings of this study indicated that the intention had a significant negative relationship with perceived vulnerability and perceived barriers in addition the intention had a significant positive relationship with belief and self efficacy variables results of the correlation test showed that the behavior variable had a significant positive relationship with the following variables perceived vulnerability perceived severity perceived benefits self efficacy and intention the results of the regression analysis also showed that self efficacy and perceived benefits might significantly explain the changes in an individual s intention in terms of adapting to drought in spite of the claims made the variables of perceived vulnerability perceived severity of effects and perceived barriers were not found to be significant it was also reported that the following 4 variables i e intention perceived severity perceived vulnerability and perceived benefits might significantly explain the changes in an individual s drought adaptation behavior formunyuy verkijika 2018 came to the conclusion that the perceived vulnerability and the perceived severity had significant positive effects on regretting and also they had indirect positive effects on intention and behavior the predicted self efficacy and regret were directly correlated with intention and the predicted regret and intention had positive effect on behavior however response cost and response efficacy had no significant relationship with intention menard et al 2018 found that one s personal attitudes toward collectivism would affect psychological ownership and lack of intention for safe behaviors also psychological ownership has a significant effect on the structures of protection motivation as well as intention through studying the effect of collectivism on spiritual ownership and the effect of psychological ownership on protection the findings of this study contribute to the realization of information security the results of this study also showed a significant relationship between response cost and behavioral intention but self efficacy response efficacy and perceived severity had no significant relationship with behavioral intention ghanian et al 2020 found that farmers adaptation intention was affected directly by in adaptation and indirectly by economic disincentives barriers to belief in anthropogenic climate change and broader risk perceptions 3 research methodology 3 1 research design this study was applied in terms of approach purpose quantitative in terms of nature of the problem and non experimental in terms of control over the variables in terms of method the study was descriptive correlational and causal relational and was carried out using the survey technique 3 2 study area the study area is karkheh river basin krb located in khuzestan province southwest iran fig 2 the basin represents semi arid and arid areas of the region and covers 5 08 million ha mha out of which only 1 07 mha are irrigable and 0 9 mha are suitable for rainfed agriculture krb is located in 25 32 to 00 35 northern latitudes and 00 46 to 00 49 eastern longitudes with considering karoun and dez rivers having the major capacity of water karkheh river with less capacity holds the most amount of water in iran the water basin of karkheh river is 42 620 km2 up to the bridge and is about 50 000 km2 up to hourolazim swamp as its final destination haghiabi and mastorakis 2009 this basin southern karkheh covers four cities including hamidieh dasht e azadegan bostan susangerd hoveyzeh and ahwaz 3 3 statistical population and sampling method the statistical population of the study included the farmers n 3668 who were members of water user associations in the downstream of the karkheh dam the reason for choosing these farmers was that they had been already given good and accurate information about drought and they had well comprehension of that based on the questions raised in this study the target audience were those who had the necessary information about the drought and had received the necessary trainings farmers who were members of the water user associations had this feature the sample size was determined using krejcie and morgan 1970 sample size table n 350 and the sample was formed using the proportionate stratified random sampling method table 2 it should be noted that in this sampling the strata were the irrigation networks of karkheh dam basin 3 4 survey instrument questionnaire was used as the data collection instrument the validity of the questionnaire was verified by a panel of professors and experts expertise in agricultural extension and education and water resources management and planning the reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using cronbach s alpha test table 3 the questionnaire consisted of three sections the first section contained title and purpose of the research the second section contained the items used to measure each research variable and the third section was related to the demographic characteristics of the participants the items related to the variables presented in fig 1 based on pmt were measured using a five point likert scale coded 1 5 in this study ps stands as the consequences of drought for farmers which is briefly described as consequences and symbolized as ps also pv is the perceived vulnerability of drought for farmers and se refers to the measures taken to protect human life during drought that are briefly described as perceived vulnerability and self efficacy respectively and abbreviated as pv and se as seen in table 3 according to the protection motivation theory pmt the items of these two variables are the same in which two respondents are asked for response cost rc and response efficacy re the obtained data were analyzed using spss24 pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between the variables and using multiple linear regression the causal relations were determined by path analysis 4 result and discussion 4 1 analysis of individual characteristics of the farmers among the farmers studied 306 individuals were male 87 4 and 44 were female 12 6 the average age of the farmers was 42 31 7 of them were in the range of 30 40 years old and 18 3 of them were less than 30 years old the former group had the highest frequency whereas the later had the least among these farmers 292 83 4 had already experienced drought and 58 16 6 had not experienced it only 181 farmers participated in the drought training classes and 169 individual denied participation 4 2 relationships among variables pearson correlation test was used to determine the relationships between variables table 4 the results showed that excluding rc there was a significant correlation between fdrmb and all other variables the variables in re pv ps and se had the highest correlation with fdrmb in that order there was also a significant positive correlation between in and other variables except rc 4 3 causal analysis of the variables affecting fdrmb according to the theoretical framework of this paper pmt fdrmb might be used to establish causal chain between in pv ps re rc and se numerous studies have established and tested such a causal chain for the purpose of behavioral evaluation bijani et al 2017 2019 ebrahimi sarcheshmeh et al 2018 mohammadi mehr et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2020 shojaei miandoragh et al 2020 valizadeh et al 2018 2019 2020 in this study path analysis was conducted using multiple linear regression method the results of path analysis showed that the causal model of the research might explain a significant share of variance changes in fdrmb and in the r2adj values for each regression were 0 473 for fdrmb and 0 520 for in respectively table 5 and fig 3 the path analysis calculations were performed using enter method in two steps in the first step of causal analysis based on the theoretical framework in fig 1 the direct effects of the variables on fdrmb were assessed the results of this assessment showed that threat appraisal ta pv and ps coping appraisal ca se re and rc and in had a direct effect on fdrmb the results also showed that in had the greatest individual direct effect Î² 0 338 on fdrmb whereas ps had the smallest Î² 0 001 overall these six variables explain 0 473 of the variances in fdrmb in the second step the direct effects of the variables on in were analyzed the results of this analysis showed that the variables ta pv and ps and ca se re and rc had a direct effect on in and thereby indirect effect on fdrmb the results showed that ps had the greatest individual direct effect Î² 0 321 on farmers in in drought risk management and rc had the smallest individual direct effect on in generally these five variables explain 0 520 of variances in in table 6 shows the causal effect sum of direct and indirect effects and the total causal effect calculated for the variables affecting fdrmb the indirect effects of independent variables on the dependent variables according to the theoretical framework were calculated for the following variables pv 0 338 0 307 ps 0 338 0 321 se 0 098 0 338 re rc 0 217 0 338 and rc 0 008 0 338 as shown in table 6 and fig 3 the conducted path analysis determined that all paths except the effects of rc and ps were consistent with the theoretical framework pmt since the correlation of rc with fdrmb was not insignificant table 4 and Î² value calculated for this relation was 0 05 Î² 0 016 this path was not consistent with the theoretical framework mansourfar 2006 moreover since the t value obtained for the two aforementioned variables was not significant these paths were inconsistent with pmt this is also true for the effect of rc on in as shown in table 6 re had the greatest causal effect 0502 on the contrary ps had the greatest non causal effect 0 265 on fdrmb 5 conclusion and policy implications the findings of this study have contributed to conceptualization and comprehension of farmers drought risk management behavior in fdrmb analysis in the study pmt was applied which is replicable and comparable elsewhere the main objective of this paper was to use pmt so as to assess this behavior among farmers living in the basin of karkheh dam in iran thus the relationship between the variables of this theory and fdrmb was studied through a correlation and causal relation analysis indeed there are other variables such as personal professional normative and social features that might affect these relations inasmuch as no study might cover all aspects of a topic this study along with similar studies has focused merely on the pmt variables in fact in the similar studies alternative approaches could be taken from different logical or ethical perspectives and different theories and also other variables that are more suitable for the area under study can be used this study showed that pmt can be useful in explaining fdrmb fig 3 according to this theory fdrmb is determined by pv ps re rc se and in in this study the four variables re in pv and se had the greatest direct role in explaining the dependent variable fdrmb respectively nevertheless other variables rc and ps had no significant direct effect on fdrmb this result is not consistent with the results of keshavarz and karami 2016 azadi et al 2017 menard et al 2018 delfiyan et al 2018 2020 ghanian et al 2020 this could have been caused by the lack of transparency and the fact that the perceived severity of the drought has reached a critical level and yet the perception of drought induced costs that farmers shall pay in different ways cash and non cash is still immature furthermore se was found to be the most important predictor of fdrmb which has consistency with the reports of keshavarz and karami 2016 azadi et al 2017 several studies have recognized se as one of the most important pmt variables for influencing on behavior the results of this study showed a significant positive relationship between pv and fdrmb which is consistent with the results of van duinen et al 2015 chen 2016 delfiyan et al 2018 this could be due to the immense consequences of drought once the farmers understand these consequences they try to plan ahead and improve their flexibility against the expected effects that result in better behavior in other words farmers could reduce the effects of drought and could manage the drought risks by simple planning the results also showed a significant positive relationship between ps and fdrmb accordingly it can be argued that when farmers see the severity of the effects of drought they start conserving water thus showing farmers the real life examples of drought effects is recommended so that their understanding of the severity of the expected effects is increased and then they are stimulated to manage their behavior especially with regard to risk management a significant positive relationship was observed between se and fdrmb which was consistent with the results of floyd et al 2000 van duinen et al 2015 chen 2016 keshavarz and karami 2016 azadi et al 2017 formunyuy verkijika 2018 delfiyan et al 2018 menard et al 2018 accordingly the farmers ability to overcome managerial obstacles should be reinforced this can be done by devising appropriate programs and by involving farmers in the implementation of these programs and also giving them enough confidence regarding the ease of water resources management which would improve their drought risk management behavior the findings of this study showed a significant positive relationship between pv and in of farmers consistent with the studies of chen 2016 formunyuy verkijika 2018 delfiyan et al 2018 in other words the greater the farmers understanding of drought vulnerability is the greater their intention for improving their management behavior would be the farmers knowledge about the consequences of drought might be increased by holding educational classes and raising their awareness through media this approach can be expected to affect attitudes of farmers and to increase their understanding of the effects of drought on their life which in turn increases their in furthermore correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between ps and in that is means the greater the farmers understanding of the severity of the effects of drought is the higher their willingness to improve their drought risk management behavior would be since experience affects people s understanding of drought it can be argued that it increases their willingness to engage in management behaviors farming has for so long been an inherently risky profession so farmers might easily understand the possible severity of water scarcity effects and thus their intentions to manage water resources and their own behaviors might be enhanced the significant relationship observed between se and in consistent with studies of chen 2016 formunyuy verkijika 2018 delfiyan et al 2018 indicates that having a sense of drought risk management farmers might increase their willingness intention to improve their management behaviors therefore development of partnership programs with the purpose of supporting farmers would seem necessary to help them develop their skills and enhance their willingness to engage in management behaviors can be expected to result in the flourishment of farmers self efficacy potentials and improvement of their water resource protection behaviors undoubtedly one of the behaviors that might be improved in this way is the drought risk management behavior in the path analysis all paths except for the effects of rc and ps are consistent with the theoretical framework pmt this could be because of the fact that farmers still do not understand the costs of ignoring drought risk management and need more time to do so moreover the Î² value computed for ps was 0 05 Î² 0 001 despite the significant relationship between ps and fdrmb this path was inconsistent with the theoretical framework the reason was that although farmers had a tangible understanding of drought effects the perceived severity of the effects was yet not tangible enough one of the best strategies to address this issue is to emphasize on the extension training with the objective of strengthening these two parameters in farmers for this purpose the training sessions should focus less on pure awareness improvement and more on cooperation with farmers and then make them more engaged with the issue of drought risk and risk management these findings emerge from all the descriptive correlational and causal analysis and have some policy implications as follows 1 based on the results compared to researchers each farmer has much better information about the nature of his risk environment thus policies need to empower farmers so that they might take their own risk management decisions and have access to a variety of tools and strategies 2 besides the evaluation of response cost must be carried out in line with the assessment of drought risk management in other words weather and drought monitoring networks with sufficient coverage and adequate human capacity are required to analyze and to convert this information into drought risk management and mitigation measures 3 according to the findings policy choice concerning drought risk management is particularly challenging first there is inherent uncertainty and lack of information about risk management decisions in terms of both risk assessment and policy impacts analysis second the precise definition of the policy objective is controversial indeed the mitigation of agricultural risk always does not enhance farmers welfare and farmers understanding of drought vulnerability can vary across different government goals therefore this paper contributes in improving the knowledge of farmers strategic risk management decisions and introducing variables pv ps se rc rc and in that might increase the consideration of potential policy options 4 additionally the findings suggest that public policies should effectively target risk averse farmers in order to establish confident relationships with them which can strengthen their perceptions and adaptive behaviors in relation to drought and climate changes from the perspective of policy coming up with drought the adaptive behavior is relatively more efficient in increasing farmers welfare than the government programs the main reason is that adaptive behaviors have higher efficiency in increasing self efficacy and perceived vulnerability of farmers

5181,in this study multiphase flood waves caused by failure of silted up dams have been scrutinized experimentally and efficacy of the public domain cfd software openfoam numerical models to represent such phenomenon is evaluated experimental observations are sparse on dam break for reservoirs with high sediment depths called silted up reservoirs sediment layer in this case may behave as a viscous fluid and produce a complex multi layer flow of air and water overtopping a sediment layer massive sediment quantities can have a substantial impact on the wave propagation pattern caused by dam break this study contributes to an experiment based understanding of dam break phenomenon with silted up reservoir and elaborates the propagation of multi layer waves herein different hydraulic conditions were experimentally observed including 8 different upstream sediment depths in the range of 0 0 24 m and 4 downstream initial water levels of 0 0 02 0 04 and 0 05 m which collectively created 32 scenarios the resulted waves were filmed by high speed cameras and data were extracted through image processing an open source cfd software namely openfoam was employed to simulate the experiments using two distinct numerical approaches volume of fluid vof and eulerian results of both numerical approaches were in good agreement with the experimental measurements with mae and rmse error values varying from 0 006 m to 0 031 m and 0 008 m to 0 043 m respectively 2 to 10 and 2 6 to 14 with respect to the reservoir height of 0 3 m the eulerian approach showed marginally superior performance to vof especially in cases with high sediment depths which is likely due to accommodating phase mixing a wide collection of high quality data is made available online in the appendix data and could be utilized in future studies keywords dam break silted up reservoirs multiphase flood wave image processing openfoam 1 introduction reservoir sedimentation can cause challenging problems such as reducing the effective volume and triggering flood overpassing yang 1996 it may also cause failure of coffer dams built to trap sediments upstream of the main dam reservoir vischer and hager 1998 massive amount of sediment stored in dam reservoirs has a substantial impact on the dam break flood propagation pattern and also can bury buildings installations and infrastructures at the downstream of the dam in such phenomenon the sediment layer may behave like a viscous fluid with clear water flowing easily over its top which produces a complex three layer wave formed by air a layer of water overtopping a saturated sediment layer duarte et al 2011 most early studies as well as current work focus on dam break for water filled reservoirs and this problem for silted up reservoir is sparsely addressed in the literature duarte et al 2011 at the first glance many dam break scenarios with mobile bed may seem similar to silted up reservoirs because the parameters such as water level and sediment depth play important roles in both but in fact there is a large difference between the sediment depth in a silted up reservoir and typical sediment level in a river downstream of the dam duarte et al 2011 particularly the authors are not aware of any numerical model verifying the adequacy of the public domain cfd software openfoam on dam break multi layer waves for silted up reservoirs which motivated this work accordingly it is appropriate to investigate the dam break issue with silted up reservoirs and elaborate how multi layer waves propagate therein experimentally and verifying numerically using openfoam cfd software open foam 2015 the oldest experimental works on dam break and associated flood wave dating back to the late 20th century dressler 1954 bell et al 1992 bellos et al 1992 fraccarollo and toro 1995 lauber and hager 1998 the majority of prior experimental researches have evaluated this issue for a fixed channel bed without sediment in which different initial conditions such as dry bed or wet bed downstream have been addressed soares frazÃ£o and zech 2002 bellos 2004 meile et al 2013 wood and wang 2015 xue et al 2011 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 larocque et al 2013 ozmen cagatay et al 2014 recently dam break laboratory studies concerning mobile bed scenarios have gained more attention to assess relevant physical parameters such as flow depth and wave front celerity leal et al 2001 spinewine and zech 2007 cochard and ancey 2008 leal et al 2009 lal and moustafa 2016 to collect the required data in these studies digital image processing has been used leal et al 2001 spinewine and zech 2007 although studies of dam break are well documented to the authors knowledge just one study is available in the literature that experimentally examined dam break with silted up reservoirs duarte et al 2011 in particular that study has considered only dry tail water portion as the downstream condition duarte et al 2011 additionally several experimental works have been conducted in the literature to examine dam break phenomena with various kinds of fluid in their reservoir nsom 2002 ancey et al 2009 minussi and de freitas maciel 2012 some focusing on newtonian fluids with high viscosities and debris flows nsom 2002 ancey et al 2009 others on similar scenarios but for non newtonian fluids minussi and de freitas maciel 2012 in reality the multiphase flood resulted from dam break with silted up reservoir may behave as a non newtonian flow especially at small shear stresses there are different non newtonian models in openfoam in which various solvers such as simplefoam nonnewtonianicofoam and pisofoam are developed to simulate non newtonian fluids open foam 2015 unofficial openfoam 2019 however since in the numerical part of this study sudden dam break was modeled and partial gate opening was not considered the applied models and solvers are not capable of non newtonian simulation hence it is one of the modeling assumptions although imperfect in this study that the multiphase flood wave behaves newtonian a considerable body of literature on dam break phenomena are based on numerical modeling without recourse to the main differences between sudden failure of dams with highly silted up reservoirs and dam break with usual mobile bed condition in the late 20th century there has been numerous studies to investigate 1d and 2d dam break gabutti 1983 beam and warming 1976 chaudhry 2008 fennema and chaudhry 1990 mingham and causon 1998 on the basis of computational fluid dynamics cfds in which specific numerical approaches have been widely used such as finite difference method gabutti 1983 beam and warming 1976 and finite volume method fraccarollo and toro 1995 mingham and causon 1998 usually simple scenarios have been the focus of researches where straight and bending channels soares frazÃ£o and zech 2002 valiani et al 2002 zoppou and roberts 2003 ackerman et al 2008 have been considered for a constant bed later dam break studies have emphasized on more complicated scenarios such as wet bed downstream conditions zoppou and roberts 2003 cao et al 2004 leal et al 2006 wu and wang 2007 crespo et al 2008 zoppou and roberts 2000 aliparast 2009 and the role of sediment transport and vegetation evangelista et al 2013 postacchini et al 2014 he et al 2017 kim and sanders 2016 fu and jin 2016 have also gained more attention recently 3d numerical studies have been conducted to simulate such phenomenon biscarini et al 2010 yang et al 2010 hu et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2015 some focusing on mobile bed condition marsooli and wu 2015 however the efficacy of numerical models to represent the dam break multi layer waves for silted up reservoirs to date has not been directly evaluated the present study is focused on two and three phase flood waves caused by sudden dam break with silted up reservoirs in order to address the literature gaps and shortcomings outlined above the authors have scrutinized this topic experimentally for 32 different cases and modeled them numerically using the openfoam software more specifically different initial hydraulic conditions were considered including eight distinct depths for saturated sediment layer upstream of the dam which occupied 10 80 of the reservoir s initial water depth four downstream boundary conditions were examined zero dry and three different non zero wet initial water depths of 0 02 0 04 and 0 05 m which collectively created 32 scenarios results of this study can enhance the technical understanding of how multi layer waves resulted from dam break phenomena with silted up reservoirs propagate therein and elaborate how the saturated sediment cone begins to move and develops or deforms as time elapses this study also provides a wide collection of high quality laboratory data that can be utilized for validation of other numerical models a free licensed cfd package namely openfoam open foam 2015 was employed to simulate the experiments using two distinct numerical approaches volume of fluid vof and eulerian then the experimental measurements and numerical results are comprehensively compared and their correlation is discussed 2 experimental procedure fig 1 represents flowchart of the methodology utilized in developing experimental study and numerical verification of silted up dam break as reflected in the figure the methodology contains 5 main steps which will be discussed in detail in the rest of the research paper all main experiments were carried out in the hydraulic lab of civil and environmental engineering department at shiraz university shiraz iran using a 6 m long horizontal laboratory flume with prismatic rectangular section 0 3 m wide and 0 32 m high fig 2 the flume consists of a smooth metallic bottom and the walls are made of 9 mm thick glass in order to represent a reservoir a 1 52 m long section of the flume was isolated by a gate dam to split the upstream and downstream regions of the flume while the downstream flume reach was 4 5 m long fig 2 initial experiments were carried out to carefully evaluate hydraulic parameters initial conditions and required facilities then by preparing constructing and installing detailed parts to the flume it was equipped to perform main dam break experiments dam break was physically emulated by rapidly raising the gate downstream of the reservoir we followed the literature guidelines that gate opening time should be shorter than 1 25 h 0 g where h 0 is the initial reservoir water level and g is the gravitational acceleration lauber and hager 1998 noted that in all experiments h 0 0 3 m and hence maximum gate opening time is 0 22 s the gate was removed in a much shorter duration 0 08 0 16 s as documented by high speed imaging and hence this process may be considered as a sudden dam break two and three phase flows of water and saturated sediment layer caused by dam break phenomena were filmed by three professional and high speed digital cameras canon eos 70d cameras were mounted on the right hand side of the flume without any position change in more than 6 months while main experiments were conducted recorded videos were 50 frames per second with 1920 1080 pixels full hd 1080p resolution as shown in fig 2 cameras covered 5 52 m along the flume which consisted of 1 52 m upstream to 4 m downstream of the gate location dam moreover two powerful spotlights were mounted above the flume as light sources at both ends of the flume the opposite lateral wall of the flume was covered with black plastic sheets to conceal installations in the back of the flume lab windows and other uncontrolled light sources were covered using thick black curtains to eliminate light pollution and obtain adequate contrast different hydraulic conditions were examined table 1 including various depths of saturated sediment layer in the reservoir and different downstream initial water levels dry bed or wet bed downstream conditions with different water levels which collectively created 32 dam break scenarios as mentioned earlier the purpose of this study was to scrutinize the multiphase shock waves caused by failure of silted up dams it also addresses the failure of coffer dams secondary dams and gravel or front basins built upstream of a main dam to protect its reservoir sedimentation by trapping sediments vischer and hager 1998 as shown in table 1 a variety of initial upstream sediment depths were considered to cover 10 80 of the reservoir s initial water depth these experimental scenarios were designed to cover different elevation zones of the dam reservoir such as inactive zone dead storage buffer and active zone conservative and flood control zone lamond and boukhtouta 2002 initial downstream water levels of 0 02 0 04 and 0 05 m as well as dry downstream conditions were also considered this setup was specifically designed to approximately acquire logical downstream river level conditions and to evaluate and cover different states as much as possible vischer and hager 1998 lamond and boukhtouta 2002 authors believe these initial conditions are sufficient to mimic practical applications percentage depth of saturated sediment stored in the reservoir was defined in table 1 as s d h 0 s d h 0 100 where s d and h 0 are initial upstream sediment and water levels respectively fig 3 a shows wave propagation images at different times after dam break for the case with 0 075 m depth silted up reservoir and 0 02 m standing water downstream as expected the wave stretches and dampens as it moves downstream it is worth noting that to gain higher quality and accuracy in determining free surface profiles all images have been enhanced in brightness sharpness contrast color and overlap the waves caused by a dam break in silted up reservoirs produce a very complex phenomenon with a three phase behavior as shown in fig 3 b including a layer of water on a saturated sediment layer and the third phase being air additionally once the dam breaks the sediment layer may behave like a viscous fluid with clear water flowing easily on its top to collect the required data several 1 mm resolution point gages in stripe forms have been installed on the flume outside wall these point gages located in overlap sections covered by two closed cameras were used as reference to match the images for the main tests with silted up reservoirs a certain type of sediment was selected as mixtures of quartz sand with a uniform grain size between 0 2 and 0 4 mm the sediment gradation curve is presented in fig s1 in supplementary material in order to ensure uniformity and homogeneity of sedimentation a standard test preparation procedure was followed carefully duarte et al 2011 after washing and drying the sediment it was transferred slowly into the dry flume therefore the smooth and horizontal sediment layer surface was manually created by a putty knife in order to minimize sediment diameter separation water was injected to the flume at a low discharge while slow sediment deposition took place simultaneously 2 1 data collection for each experiment three 40 s video files in mov format were recorded using all cameras while each camera covered about 2 m of the flume length fig 2 relevant parameters of water level and sediment depth were extracted using an automated image processing method main advantage of digital image processing is that this method is non subjective and can yield accurate and high quality results additionally measurement points can be easily replaced in this method and the measurements of water level and sediment depth variations can be estimated at any arbitrary location along the flume for this purpose the spatially surveyed spots including 16 distinct points have considered covering the entire length of the flume fig 4 gaps between the points near the gate location were less than other areas along the flume to ensure enough measurements are performed in this area of high turbulence and rapid depth change the first point was at the beginning of the reservoir upstream of the flume and the distances of 15 other surveyed points were 0 76 1 02 1 27 1 37 1 42 1 47 1 52 1 57 1 67 1 77 1 87 2 52 3 52 4 52 and 5 52 m downstream of the first point respectively these data were extracted by the analysis of the first 300 frames covering 6 s 50 frames per second of each video file using 15 time snaps after the dam breaks intervals between the snaps were shorter immediately after the dam break and increased gradually the snap times were 0 04 0 08 0 12 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 1 5 2 3 4 5 and 6 s after the dam break given 3 cameras for shooting 15 time snaps and 32 different dam break scenarios a total of 1440 photographs extracted which were all examined carefully according to the 16 fixed locations and two parameters these photographs contained 15 360 data 32 scenarios 15 times 16 locations 2 parameters which are all presented in the appendix data to verify the experimental measurements and openfoam results particular physical models with clear water upstream and dry bed or wet bed downstream conditions were designed and modeled both experimentally and numerically then their results were compared with available experimental and numerical studies reported in literature similar results in the larocque et al 2013 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 fig 5 presents a set of image comparisons at different times after dam break to visually compare the results of the present study against other researchers results ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 a good agreement with literature was found in terms of water depths and wave front locations as illustrated in fig 5 and also figs s2 and s3 in supplementary material 3 numerical modeling along with several commercial cfd software such as fluent and flow3d to solve fluid mechanics problems free licensed software also gained popularity in the field one of the most widely used being an open source code software named openfoam open foam 2015 this software allows users to simulate a wide range of physical phenomena such as two phase and multiphase flows open foam 2015 unofficial openfoam 2019 the numerical part of this study is limited to simulation of all experimental data collected from 32 different experiment scenarios using the openfoam software this software is designed for installation on a linux operating system and its programming language is c an object oriented and easily expandable programming language simulations have been performed using both volume of fluid vof and eulerian approaches although these approaches have been used previously to solve clear water dam break problems ozmen cagatay et al 2014 biscarini et al 2010 issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 mokrani and abadie 2016 panicker et al 2015 fondelli et al 2015 ye and zhao 2017 issakhov et al 2018 to the authors knowledge they have never been used in multiphase dam break with silted up reservoirs modeling it should be noted that no reduction or enlargement in width of channel downstream was considered and the longitudinal slope of channel was taken as zero 3 1 vof method the vof method is used to simulate layered flows in which the phases have explicit boundaries clear interfaces such as free surface flows in order to simulate two phase and multiphase dam break waves with openfoam interfoam and multiphaseinterfoam solvers have been used in this approach a set of conservative forms of continuity and momentum equations are simultaneously solved for all available phases computations of the water free surface by vof also involved a cfd package based on the finite volume method fvm continuity and momentum equations for a newtonian incompressible fluid in vof method may be described as eqs 1 and 2 jamshidi et al 2019 kassar et al 2018 barbosa et al 2019 hirt and nichols 1981 rusche 2002 1 u 0 2

multiphase flows while phases may mix together in this method which is also called two fluid method tfm each phase is individually calculated and solved making the computing time longer than vof the most widely used solvers in this method are twophaseeulerfoam and multiphaseeulerfoam with the theoretical details being described in soleimani et al 2015 bhusare et al 2017 lubchenko et al 2018 kia and aminian 2017 panda et al 2017 to verify the openfoam numerical results particular clear water dam break scenarios were modeled physically and numerically under dry bed and wet bed downstream conditions results were compared fig 5 with available laboratory and numerical results in the literature larocque et al 2013 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 and a good agreement with literature was found also as shown in figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary material the numerical results are in good agreement with measured data in the literature 3 3 initial conditions and solution domain owing to the laboratory channel restrictions the solution domain was 6 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 32 m high as the initial condition a volume of 1 52 m in length and 0 3 m in height was considered as the reservoir channel bottom and side walls were made of steel and glass thus assumed smooth as the boundary condition the upstream bottom and side boundaries along the channel were all defined as walls and the downstream boundary at the end of the channel was defined as a pressure outlet the top boundary was defined as a pressure inlet due to atmospheric pressure on the free surface the boundary hydraulic conditions were also independently considered meshed creating different downstream and upstream conditions downstream conditions were completely dry bed or wet bed with different initial water depths and upstream conditions were reservoirs with various saturated sediment layer heights a standard procedure was followed carefully to determine suitable mesh size and time step akbari and barati 2012 barati et al 2012 mesh size analysis was performed using eight different sizes then by compromising the error and runtime a uniform mesh of fixed cubes with dx dy dz 0 005 m was selected in total the three dimensional computational domain contained more than 4 6 million cells time step analysis was performed using four different time steps and considering the error courant number and the runtime a time step of 0 001 s was selected more details of the mesh size and time step analyses are presented in figs s6 s8 in supplementary material 4 results and discussion in this section several graphs and tables are presented and discussed to study the effects of various factors including dry bed or wet bed downstream and different depths of upstream saturated sediment layer on multiphase flood waves caused by the silted up dam break fig 6 shows the comparison between simulation results using vof and eulerian approaches at distinct times of 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 1 s after the dam breaks images are extracted and categorized for an approximately 2 m interval covered from 0 2 m upstream to 1 8 m downstream of the dam as shown the resulted wave moves rapidly downstream about 0 18 m in 0 1 sec after the dam breaks and it reaches 1 5 m downstream of the dam in 1 s 3 m point in the figure once this wave hits the standing downstream water it creates special large bulges in the water level as the time passes after dam break water level at the dam section as well as its upstream decreases quickly results of the two numerical methods are slightly different for example at 0 4 and 1 s the amount of sediment layer propagation in vof method is slightly higher than that in eulerian also the boundary between the phases is sharp and clear in vof results while the interference of phases has occurred at some regions in eulerian 4 1 image comparisons for upstream sediment depths of 0 03 0 15 and 0 22 m several image comparisons are depicted using photographs extracted from the laboratory videos and simulation results of vof and eulerian methods all images are presented on an evaluable basis and a complete comparison is made to better visualize different upstream and downstream hydraulic conditions the photographs associated with camera no 2 mid camera have utilized covering about 2 m of the channel length from upstream to downstream of the dam six snap times of 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 s after dam break were scrutinized in fig 7 water level and sediment depth profiles are shown after the dam breaks the simulation results by vof and eulerian methods are located below experimental images for a span of 1 3 3 1 m from the beginning of the flume from 0 2 m upstream to 1 6 m downstream of the dam this figure is for the case where upstream sediment depth is 0 03 m and dam downstream is wet with 0 04 m of standing water by comparing the experimental and numerical results it is observed that the downstream wave propagations are similar in predicting the wave tip locations hence there is an acceptable concordance in prediction of the wave front celerity at 0 4 s the downstream positive wave causes an increase in downstream water elevation also the progressive wave has a specific profile with two bulges in the body and a front wave in its forehead region the wave tip has reached 2 4 m in downstream and it is well predicted by both numerical methods in terms of size form and location however eulerian results seem to be more accurate in predicting the details at 0 6 s turbulence is increased in the forehead region and the wave tip has reached 2 9 m from the reservoir beginning with two large bulges in its body also at 2 2 m from the reservoir beginning the water level is about 0 13 m which predicted reasonably by both numerical methods at 0 8 s the wave has some bulges in frontal area and at an interval of 2 1 3 m the water level has increased and all of these fluctuations are well predicted by the software investigating later times after dam break indicates that the sediment layer has moved downstream up to 0 08 m without any significant change in its initial form of a relatively sharp step comparisons of water level and sediment depth profiles show that laboratory experiments and results of vof and eulerian methods are in good agreements note that the water level and sediment depth profile images after dam break while upstream sediment depth is 0 15 m and dam downstream is wet with 0 04 m water are depicted and discussed in fig s9 in supplementary material in fig 8 water level and sediment depth profiles are shown while upstream sediment depth is 0 22 m and downstream is wet with 0 05 m of standing water as in previous figure the experimental and both numerical results are in good agreements at 0 4 s the positive wave hits the downstream standing water creating an increase in water elevation and reaches 1 95 m from the reservoir beginning and at 0 6 s the wave tip reaches 2 25 m downstream point at 0 8 and 1 s the wave tip has reached 2 6 m and 2 85 m from the reservoir beginning point respectively while water level upstream is decreasing and rising in the downstream region for instance water level at 0 8 s is about 0 24 m at point 1 4 m and about 0 07 m at point 2 5 m however at 1 s water level at 1 4 m decreases to 0 22 m and rises to a maximum of 0 1 m at point 2 5 m investigating images at later times after dam break indicates the saturated sediment layer upstream has moved downstream up to 0 18 m as previously discussed the sediment depth at the dam location and dam upstream decreased as time passes for instance at 1 s after dam break the sediment depth decreased about 0 08 m at dam location which is well predicted by both numerical methods as the upstream sediment depth increases the movement of saturated sediment layer as well as its depth in the downstream direction increase accordingly on the other hand the downstream initial water presence reduces the advancement of saturated sediment layer reducing the risk of burying structures and equipment under the massive saturated sediment layer however downstream initial water level leads to increase the maximum water level there after dam break and hence increases immersion risk of downstream structures and equipment comparing the predictions of vof and eulerian methods with experimental results it is clear that eulerian especially for wet downstream conditions is more accurate in predicting the details at the wave forehead region also if the upstream sediment depth is more than half of the reservoir s height then eulerian is more accurate and closer to experimental results in both terms of the sediment layer depth and movement in the downstream direction despite advantages such as higher accuracy eulerian has disadvantages 1 longer computational times 2 more complex simulation conditions and 3 requiring professional skills to design and run a multiphase model 4 2 water surface and sediment depth profile fig 9 shows water surface profiles at different times after dam break when the upstream reservoir is filled up by clear water without sediment and the downstream is either dry fig 9 a and b or wet with 0 05 m of sitting water fig 9 c and d figures depict the profiles for early fig 9 a and c and late fig 9 b and d times after dam break all figures show both laboratory measurements points and vof results lines the experimental and vof results are in good agreements and the maximum rmse and mae are 0 012 m and 0 006 m respectively compared to the 0 3 m depth of the reservoir water error indices seem insignificant as the maximum rmse and mae are 4 and 2 of the reservoir water depth respectively however as the downstream condition gets more complicated with higher flow turbulence the statistical error indices increase accordingly fig 9 c and d the experimental results at 0 04 0 08 and 0 2 s early times indicate that the dam break wave propagated up to 0 7 m upstream and 0 7 m downstream however at 0 4 1 2 and 6 s late times the negative wave reached the flume beginning 1 52 m upstream of the dam the water level was affected at the beginning of the reservoir within 0 4 s and decreased to less than 0 04 m at 6 s there the waves shape and propagation pattern differ in dry versus wet downstream conditions in dry downstream condition the wave tip propagates about 0 7 m at early times 0 2 s and progresses smoothly however in wet downstream condition at the same time this wave only propagates up to 0 45 m and has several humps in the late times 0 4 1 2 and 6 s after dam break the effect of downstream conditions on the wave propagation pattern is significant for instance wet downstream in comparison with dry downstream has caused an increase in the water level at the flume beginning point created several humps in the progressive wave and also increased the maximum flood wave s depth fig 10 a d shows water surface profiles after dam break while the upstream sediment depth is 0 03 m and the downstream is dry fig 10 a and c and wet with 0 02 m of sitting water fig 10 b and d all figures depict experimental measurements as well as vof fig 10 a and b and eulerian fig 10 c and d results the measured data and both vof and eulerian results are in good agreement and the maximum rmse and mae values which occurred in the vof method are 0 013 and 0 0098 m respectively these errors are negligible compared to the 0 3 m depth of the reservoir water profile results at 0 4 1 2 and 6 s late times indicate that the negative wave has reached the flume beginning in 0 4 s and the water level has changed there from 0 3 m to around 0 05 m in 6 s although many of the analyses are similar to fig 9 comparisons of water level in fig 10 a d show that eulerian results are more accurate than vof in predicting the measured data rmse and mae values for eulerian are 0 0091 m and 0 0076 m respectively rmse is 3 and mae is 2 53 with respect to the 0 3 m depth of the reservoir water while wet downstream condition has not had much of an effect on the upstream wave pattern it has had a profound effect on the downstream wave pattern and created a bumpy profile fig 10 e h shows sediment depth profiles after dam break while the upstream sediment depth is 0 075 m and the downstream is dry fig 10 a and c or wet with 0 05 m of sitting water fig 10 b and d all figures depict measured data as well as vof fig 10 a and b and eulerian fig 10 c and d results the experimental measurements are in good agreement with vof and eulerian results and the maximum rmse and mae values are 0 0083 m and 0 0047 m respectively that occurred in vof when the downstream was initially wet profile results at 0 4 1 2 and 6 s indicate that the sediment negative wave has advanced back to upstream by 0 15 m in 0 4 s to a maximum of 0 5 m in 6 s and its positive wave has moved up to 0 35 m to the dam downstream also the sediment layer propagation differs in dry versus wet downstream conditions however in dry bed condition the sediment layer tip propagates around 0 35 m to downstream in wet downstream condition it only moves up to 0 25 m there comparisons of sediment depth profiles in fig 10 e h show that eulerian is more accurate than vof in predicting measured data rmse and mae values for the eulerian method are 0 0046 m and 0 0023 m respectively rmse is 6 1 and mae is 3 1 with respect to the 0 075 m depth of the sediment layer deeper investigation indicates in early times after dam break up to 0 2 s the reservoir sediment layer was not influenced by downstream dry bed or wet bed conditions and no significant changes has occurred in the sediment layer initial form of a relatively sharp step in the latter case low sediment depth and turbulence of the wave may prevent significant deformation in sediment layer at early times note that water surface profiles when the upstream sediment depth is 0 15 m with different downstream conditions are shown in fig s10 in supplementary material the sediment depth profiles when the upstream sediment depth is 0 2 m are also depicted and discussed in fig s11 in supplementary material the statistical error values of vof and eulerian in predicting water surface profile at late times 0 4 1 2 and 6 s after dam break are presented in table 2 covering upstream sediment depths of 0 03 0 24 m and dry bed or wet bed downstream initial conditions as reflected in table 2 the experimental measurements are in good agreement with vof and eulerian results and the maximum rmse and mae were 0 043 m and 0 03 m respectively the maximum error values occurred in vof for wet downstream condition with 0 04 and 0 05 m water in these cases the upstream sediment depths were 0 22 m and 0 2 m however according to simulation assumptions such as considering the saturated sediment layer as a viscous fluid the results are satisfactory and the maximum amounts of error seems acceptable as compared to 0 3 m depth of reservoir water as previously mentioned it seems as the downstream condition gets more complicated the error indices increase accordingly it should be noted that the rmse value presented for each dam break scenario in table 2 is an average of the errors calculated in 16 distinct surveyed locations along the channel and also at 4 time snaps 0 4 1 2 and 6 s after the dam break deeper investigation showed that in the lower sediment depth conditions 0 03 m and 0 075 m the ability of numerical models is higher than other cases moreover in dry downstream condition the best fit between experimental and numerical results is achieved by comparing the statistical error indices it is observed that the eulerian had better fit to the measured data than the vof for instance when the upstream sediment depth was 0 2 m and downstream was wet with 0 05 m water the eulerian yielded error indices that are 17 lower than the vof pointing to a superior performance nevertheless the insignificant errors reported from different cases indicate the high ability of openfoam in simulating the multiphase shock waves the statistical error values of vof and eulerian in predicting sediment depth profiles at 0 4 1 2 and 6 s after dam break are presented in table s1 in supplementary material in general the calculated maes vary between 0 006 m and 0 031 m 2 10 with respect to the reservoir height of 0 3 m and the rmses vary between 0 008 m and 0 043 m 2 6 4 with respect to the maximum reservoir height of 0 3 m results of all numerical simulations indicate that especially in some cases with high upstream sediment depths the eulerian method showed slightly superior performances than the vof and the error values in the eulerian were lower than the vof by 5 20 accommodating mixing of the phases in eulerian may have prompted its superior results 4 3 investigation of water level and sediment depth variations over time in this part the results of vof and eulerian methods are compared with experimental measurements in predicting the variation of water level and sediment depth as time elapses the mae and rmse indices are also calculated and presented for all cases to assess the agreement between experimental and numerical results for this purpose 15 time snaps are considered in a wide range of 0 04 6 s after dam break section 2 1 all graphs are presented for three fixed locations and the distances between locations from reservoir beginning are 0 76 m upstream reservoir midpoint 1 52 m dam location and 2 52 m dam downstream the channel side view and three fixed locations are illustrated in fig s12 in supplementary material for data extraction from these locations both first and second camera mid camera are used covering about 3 7 m of the flume length in fig 11 the water level variation as time elapses after dam break at 3 fixed locations are shown here the reservoir is filled up by clear water with different downstream conditions points and lines represent experimental measurements and vof results respectively the experimental and vof results are in good agreement and as the downstream condition gets more complicated the error indices increase accordingly the maximum rmse and mae were 0 0079 m and 0 0057 m respectively 2 6 and 1 9 with respect to the 0 3 m depth of reservoir water respectively as expected after dam break for up to 3 s the upstream water level at 0 76 m decreases rapidly while at the same time the downstream water level 2 52 m rises rapidly and then slowly decreases along the flume once the dam breaks the water depth at dam location 1 52 m sharply reduced and after about 0 5 s it reached less than half of its initial depth and then gradually decreases as reflected in the figure presence of downstream initial water has led to an increase in water level in the dam downstream particularly during late times 4 6 s the effect of downstream conditions on the water level in all three surveyed points upstream dam location and downstream was evident and the water level at all points for wet downstream condition was higher than dry downstream condition in fig 12 both water level and sediment depth variations have been examined for three fixed locations along the flume and results of vof and eulerian numerical methods have been compared with experimental measurements when upstream sediment depth was 0 24 m with different downstream conditions the experimental and both vof and eulerian results are in acceptable agreement with maximum rmse and mae of 0 0365 and 0 0255 m respectively 12 1 and 8 5 of initial reservoir water level 0 3 m based on the simulation assumptions such as considering the saturated sediment layer as a viscous fluid the results are acceptable the water level variation in dam upstream and downstream has behaved in the same manner as previously discussed as expected once the dam breaks the water level at dam location 1 52 m sharply reduced and after 0 5 s reached less than 0 2 m and then gradually decreased experimental results indicate that the sediment depth at the dam upstream 0 76 m and downstream 2 52 m do not change much in the first 2 s after the dam break however in the same time the sediment depth rapidly decreased about 0 1 m at the dam section 1 52 m and then slowly decreased moreover at 2 s after dam break the downstream sediment depth slowly started to increase and reached 0 025 m at 6 s it is also observed in fig 12 that different downstream conditions dry bed or wet bed at early times after dam break up to 0 4 s did not have any effect on water level variation at upstream and dam section 1 52 m however presence of downstream initial water has led to an increase in the water level at dam downstream and the effect of wet downstream condition on the water level at dam section is obvious in late times 6 s in general the experimental measurements are in good agreement with vof and eulerian results also as previously discussed in some cases with high sediment depths upstream the error values in eulerian were lower showing slightly superior performance than the vof noted that in fig s13 in supplementary material the time variation results of vof and eulerian methods have been compared with experimental measurements when upstream sediment depth is 0 03 m with different downstream conditions 4 4 investigation of correlation factor in experimental and numerical results in this section by presenting several graphs for different upstream and downstream conditions and comparing the coefficient of determination r 2 the correlation between experimental results and numerical simulations is evaluated in fig 13 a the correlation between experimental measurements and vof results in determining water level after dam break is shown for different times in this case the reservoir is filled up by clear water and downstream is wet with 0 04 m water as it can be seen the experimental measurements are highly correlated with vof results and the r 2 is 0 989 fig 13 b and c indicates the correlation of laboratory measurements versus vof or eulerian numerical methods in determining water level variation at different times after dam break for the case that the upstream sediment depth is 0 075 m and downstream is wet with 0 05 m water experimental measurements are correlated with both vof and eulerian results with r 2 values of 0 983 and 0 987 respectively which indicates an acceptable accuracy of results however a small difference in the determination coefficients shows the eulerian results have a higher precision as compared to vof results the statistical error value presented in this study for each scenario is an average of the errors calculated for different sections of the flume at various time snaps after the dam break however according to fig 13 in some locations along the flume high error values are observed for example in fig 13 b at 6 s after the dam break the error value has reached 40 50 in some locations along the flume the reason seems to be the difference between threshold shear stress in a fluid with non newtonian behavior reality and the assumption of numerical modeling in this study in which newtonian fluid is assumed this has led to significant differences between observed data and numerical results at some locations at the beginning of the dam reservoir it should be noted that the correlation analysis for the case that the upstream sediment depth is 0 2 m while downstream is dry has been presented in fig s14 in supplementary material 4 5 investigation of wave front celerity the wave front celerity values were rigorously measured by means of extracted images at four 1 m long intervals through dam downstream these four intervals totally cover 4 m length of dam downstream 1 52 m 5 52 m from reservoir beginning the measured wave front celerity values for these intervals are provided in 4 tables due to 4 downstream conditions presented in supplementary material section s11 however the mean measured wave front celerity along dam downstream for all 32 dam break scenarios are classified in table 3 investigating table 3 it is concluded that the upstream sediment depth is an important factor which determine the celerity values the deeper the upstream sediment layer the slower the dam break flood wave propagates it seems that shallower water flow on the top of the sediment layer is one of the reasons resulting in lower wave front celerity values downstream initial standing water also leads to decrease in the flood celerity deeper downstream standing water reduced the wave front celerity further reduced wave velocity due to downstream initial water level is also reported in previous studies leal et al 2006 deng et al 2018 as reflected the mean wave front celerity values along the flume are in a range of 1 08 2 32 m s based on different dam upstream and downstream conditions the variance of each mean celerity value was also calculated and classified in table 3 var line as it can be seen the calculated variance values are insignificant and varied from 0 004 to a maximum of 0 042 m 2 s 2 and the maximum variance values have occurred in the cases with deeper initial upstream sediment 5 summary and conclusion in the present study two and three phase flood waves caused by sudden dam break with silted up reservoirs have been studied both experimentally and numerically different initial conditions including various upstream sediment depths and dry bed or wet bed downstream have been considered which created a total of 32 scenarios multiphase dam break shock waves were filmed by cameras mounted along the flume and image processing method was employed to extract water level and sediment depth data from 16 locations along the flume and 15 snap times after the dam breaks numerical simulations were conducted using openfoam via vof and eulerian numerical approaches authors concluded that upstream sediment depth is an important factor in determining flood wave propagation velocity particularly higher upstream sediment depths and less water depth on it caused a slower flood wave propagation downstream it was postulated that the high sediment viscosity is a factor for the wave front celerity decrease under these conditions on the other hand by increasing upstream sediment depth both length and depth of the saturated sediment propagation to downstream area increase raising the risk of burying downstream facilities the results demonstrate a strong effect of downstream initial water on the flood wave which reduces the advancement of saturated sediment layer leading to a decrease in flood wave velocity the deeper the downstream initial water is the slower the flood wave propagates leal et al 2006 deng et al 2018 nevertheless presence of downstream initial water has led to increase in maximum flood wave height in downstream which could raise the immersion risk of structures and equipment located in prone areas despite limitations such as assuming the upstream saturated sediment layer as a viscous fluid in numerical modeling comparing the numerical results of vof and eulerian approaches with laboratory measurements showed that they are in good agreements the eulerian approach slightly outperformed vof especially in cases with high upstream sediment depths accommodating phase mixing in eulerian method is believed to have caused its superior results further good controls over the conditions in the lab such as no leakage from gate edges short gate opening time 0 08 0 16 s high imaging quality and precise computer processing of the images appeared to be among reasons leading to good matching of experimental and numerical results maximum error values in terms of mean absolute error mae varied from 0 006 m to 0 031 m 2 to 10 with respect to the reservoir height of 0 3 m and in terms of root mean square error rmse varied from 0 008 m to 0 043 m 2 6 to 14 with respect to the maximum reservoir height of 0 3 m although comparing coefficient of determination r 2 showed acceptable correlations between the measured data and the results of vof and eulerian approaches the eulerian method indicated a better correlation with experimental results however required computational time for eulerian approach was far more than that of vof in some cases twice as long it requires more complex simulation conditions especially when utilizing as a multiphase modeling tool future research could examine the potential effects of changing downstream condition along the flume on such a multiphase shock wave propagation simulating the saturated sediment layer as a fluid with non newtonian behavior or as solid particles might prove important too moreover evaluating the application of expert systems particularly artificial neural networks anns on predicting such complex issues may constitute the object of future studies first of all this is desirable to apply artificial intelligence or genetic algorithm models to make an accurate estimation for such multiphase flood waves nikoo et al 2015 2016 since artificial intelligence models may have different accuracies fusion based methods are common approaches could be conducted on the wide database provided in this research alizadeh and nikoo 2018 ghazali et al 2018 taravatrooy et al 2018 in the last this is very much the key component in future attempts to discuss the uncertainties in the peak estimation as well as the hydrograph of dam break flood using interval optimization methods factorial analysis and also the method of conditional value at risk cvar naserizade et al 2018 soltani et al 2016 tavakoli et al 2014 above all this issue would need to be explored further using different types of sediments with various grain sizes and gradations and this is desirable for future work to take into account the consolidation of sediment credit authorship contribution statement foad vosoughi conceptualization

5181,in this study multiphase flood waves caused by failure of silted up dams have been scrutinized experimentally and efficacy of the public domain cfd software openfoam numerical models to represent such phenomenon is evaluated experimental observations are sparse on dam break for reservoirs with high sediment depths called silted up reservoirs sediment layer in this case may behave as a viscous fluid and produce a complex multi layer flow of air and water overtopping a sediment layer massive sediment quantities can have a substantial impact on the wave propagation pattern caused by dam break this study contributes to an experiment based understanding of dam break phenomenon with silted up reservoir and elaborates the propagation of multi layer waves herein different hydraulic conditions were experimentally observed including 8 different upstream sediment depths in the range of 0 0 24 m and 4 downstream initial water levels of 0 0 02 0 04 and 0 05 m which collectively created 32 scenarios the resulted waves were filmed by high speed cameras and data were extracted through image processing an open source cfd software namely openfoam was employed to simulate the experiments using two distinct numerical approaches volume of fluid vof and eulerian results of both numerical approaches were in good agreement with the experimental measurements with mae and rmse error values varying from 0 006 m to 0 031 m and 0 008 m to 0 043 m respectively 2 to 10 and 2 6 to 14 with respect to the reservoir height of 0 3 m the eulerian approach showed marginally superior performance to vof especially in cases with high sediment depths which is likely due to accommodating phase mixing a wide collection of high quality data is made available online in the appendix data and could be utilized in future studies keywords dam break silted up reservoirs multiphase flood wave image processing openfoam 1 introduction reservoir sedimentation can cause challenging problems such as reducing the effective volume and triggering flood overpassing yang 1996 it may also cause failure of coffer dams built to trap sediments upstream of the main dam reservoir vischer and hager 1998 massive amount of sediment stored in dam reservoirs has a substantial impact on the dam break flood propagation pattern and also can bury buildings installations and infrastructures at the downstream of the dam in such phenomenon the sediment layer may behave like a viscous fluid with clear water flowing easily over its top which produces a complex three layer wave formed by air a layer of water overtopping a saturated sediment layer duarte et al 2011 most early studies as well as current work focus on dam break for water filled reservoirs and this problem for silted up reservoir is sparsely addressed in the literature duarte et al 2011 at the first glance many dam break scenarios with mobile bed may seem similar to silted up reservoirs because the parameters such as water level and sediment depth play important roles in both but in fact there is a large difference between the sediment depth in a silted up reservoir and typical sediment level in a river downstream of the dam duarte et al 2011 particularly the authors are not aware of any numerical model verifying the adequacy of the public domain cfd software openfoam on dam break multi layer waves for silted up reservoirs which motivated this work accordingly it is appropriate to investigate the dam break issue with silted up reservoirs and elaborate how multi layer waves propagate therein experimentally and verifying numerically using openfoam cfd software open foam 2015 the oldest experimental works on dam break and associated flood wave dating back to the late 20th century dressler 1954 bell et al 1992 bellos et al 1992 fraccarollo and toro 1995 lauber and hager 1998 the majority of prior experimental researches have evaluated this issue for a fixed channel bed without sediment in which different initial conditions such as dry bed or wet bed downstream have been addressed soares frazÃ£o and zech 2002 bellos 2004 meile et al 2013 wood and wang 2015 xue et al 2011 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 larocque et al 2013 ozmen cagatay et al 2014 recently dam break laboratory studies concerning mobile bed scenarios have gained more attention to assess relevant physical parameters such as flow depth and wave front celerity leal et al 2001 spinewine and zech 2007 cochard and ancey 2008 leal et al 2009 lal and moustafa 2016 to collect the required data in these studies digital image processing has been used leal et al 2001 spinewine and zech 2007 although studies of dam break are well documented to the authors knowledge just one study is available in the literature that experimentally examined dam break with silted up reservoirs duarte et al 2011 in particular that study has considered only dry tail water portion as the downstream condition duarte et al 2011 additionally several experimental works have been conducted in the literature to examine dam break phenomena with various kinds of fluid in their reservoir nsom 2002 ancey et al 2009 minussi and de freitas maciel 2012 some focusing on newtonian fluids with high viscosities and debris flows nsom 2002 ancey et al 2009 others on similar scenarios but for non newtonian fluids minussi and de freitas maciel 2012 in reality the multiphase flood resulted from dam break with silted up reservoir may behave as a non newtonian flow especially at small shear stresses there are different non newtonian models in openfoam in which various solvers such as simplefoam nonnewtonianicofoam and pisofoam are developed to simulate non newtonian fluids open foam 2015 unofficial openfoam 2019 however since in the numerical part of this study sudden dam break was modeled and partial gate opening was not considered the applied models and solvers are not capable of non newtonian simulation hence it is one of the modeling assumptions although imperfect in this study that the multiphase flood wave behaves newtonian a considerable body of literature on dam break phenomena are based on numerical modeling without recourse to the main differences between sudden failure of dams with highly silted up reservoirs and dam break with usual mobile bed condition in the late 20th century there has been numerous studies to investigate 1d and 2d dam break gabutti 1983 beam and warming 1976 chaudhry 2008 fennema and chaudhry 1990 mingham and causon 1998 on the basis of computational fluid dynamics cfds in which specific numerical approaches have been widely used such as finite difference method gabutti 1983 beam and warming 1976 and finite volume method fraccarollo and toro 1995 mingham and causon 1998 usually simple scenarios have been the focus of researches where straight and bending channels soares frazÃ£o and zech 2002 valiani et al 2002 zoppou and roberts 2003 ackerman et al 2008 have been considered for a constant bed later dam break studies have emphasized on more complicated scenarios such as wet bed downstream conditions zoppou and roberts 2003 cao et al 2004 leal et al 2006 wu and wang 2007 crespo et al 2008 zoppou and roberts 2000 aliparast 2009 and the role of sediment transport and vegetation evangelista et al 2013 postacchini et al 2014 he et al 2017 kim and sanders 2016 fu and jin 2016 have also gained more attention recently 3d numerical studies have been conducted to simulate such phenomenon biscarini et al 2010 yang et al 2010 hu et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2015 some focusing on mobile bed condition marsooli and wu 2015 however the efficacy of numerical models to represent the dam break multi layer waves for silted up reservoirs to date has not been directly evaluated the present study is focused on two and three phase flood waves caused by sudden dam break with silted up reservoirs in order to address the literature gaps and shortcomings outlined above the authors have scrutinized this topic experimentally for 32 different cases and modeled them numerically using the openfoam software more specifically different initial hydraulic conditions were considered including eight distinct depths for saturated sediment layer upstream of the dam which occupied 10 80 of the reservoir s initial water depth four downstream boundary conditions were examined zero dry and three different non zero wet initial water depths of 0 02 0 04 and 0 05 m which collectively created 32 scenarios results of this study can enhance the technical understanding of how multi layer waves resulted from dam break phenomena with silted up reservoirs propagate therein and elaborate how the saturated sediment cone begins to move and develops or deforms as time elapses this study also provides a wide collection of high quality laboratory data that can be utilized for validation of other numerical models a free licensed cfd package namely openfoam open foam 2015 was employed to simulate the experiments using two distinct numerical approaches volume of fluid vof and eulerian then the experimental measurements and numerical results are comprehensively compared and their correlation is discussed 2 experimental procedure fig 1 represents flowchart of the methodology utilized in developing experimental study and numerical verification of silted up dam break as reflected in the figure the methodology contains 5 main steps which will be discussed in detail in the rest of the research paper all main experiments were carried out in the hydraulic lab of civil and environmental engineering department at shiraz university shiraz iran using a 6 m long horizontal laboratory flume with prismatic rectangular section 0 3 m wide and 0 32 m high fig 2 the flume consists of a smooth metallic bottom and the walls are made of 9 mm thick glass in order to represent a reservoir a 1 52 m long section of the flume was isolated by a gate dam to split the upstream and downstream regions of the flume while the downstream flume reach was 4 5 m long fig 2 initial experiments were carried out to carefully evaluate hydraulic parameters initial conditions and required facilities then by preparing constructing and installing detailed parts to the flume it was equipped to perform main dam break experiments dam break was physically emulated by rapidly raising the gate downstream of the reservoir we followed the literature guidelines that gate opening time should be shorter than 1 25 h 0 g where h 0 is the initial reservoir water level and g is the gravitational acceleration lauber and hager 1998 noted that in all experiments h 0 0 3 m and hence maximum gate opening time is 0 22 s the gate was removed in a much shorter duration 0 08 0 16 s as documented by high speed imaging and hence this process may be considered as a sudden dam break two and three phase flows of water and saturated sediment layer caused by dam break phenomena were filmed by three professional and high speed digital cameras canon eos 70d cameras were mounted on the right hand side of the flume without any position change in more than 6 months while main experiments were conducted recorded videos were 50 frames per second with 1920 1080 pixels full hd 1080p resolution as shown in fig 2 cameras covered 5 52 m along the flume which consisted of 1 52 m upstream to 4 m downstream of the gate location dam moreover two powerful spotlights were mounted above the flume as light sources at both ends of the flume the opposite lateral wall of the flume was covered with black plastic sheets to conceal installations in the back of the flume lab windows and other uncontrolled light sources were covered using thick black curtains to eliminate light pollution and obtain adequate contrast different hydraulic conditions were examined table 1 including various depths of saturated sediment layer in the reservoir and different downstream initial water levels dry bed or wet bed downstream conditions with different water levels which collectively created 32 dam break scenarios as mentioned earlier the purpose of this study was to scrutinize the multiphase shock waves caused by failure of silted up dams it also addresses the failure of coffer dams secondary dams and gravel or front basins built upstream of a main dam to protect its reservoir sedimentation by trapping sediments vischer and hager 1998 as shown in table 1 a variety of initial upstream sediment depths were considered to cover 10 80 of the reservoir s initial water depth these experimental scenarios were designed to cover different elevation zones of the dam reservoir such as inactive zone dead storage buffer and active zone conservative and flood control zone lamond and boukhtouta 2002 initial downstream water levels of 0 02 0 04 and 0 05 m as well as dry downstream conditions were also considered this setup was specifically designed to approximately acquire logical downstream river level conditions and to evaluate and cover different states as much as possible vischer and hager 1998 lamond and boukhtouta 2002 authors believe these initial conditions are sufficient to mimic practical applications percentage depth of saturated sediment stored in the reservoir was defined in table 1 as s d h 0 s d h 0 100 where s d and h 0 are initial upstream sediment and water levels respectively fig 3 a shows wave propagation images at different times after dam break for the case with 0 075 m depth silted up reservoir and 0 02 m standing water downstream as expected the wave stretches and dampens as it moves downstream it is worth noting that to gain higher quality and accuracy in determining free surface profiles all images have been enhanced in brightness sharpness contrast color and overlap the waves caused by a dam break in silted up reservoirs produce a very complex phenomenon with a three phase behavior as shown in fig 3 b including a layer of water on a saturated sediment layer and the third phase being air additionally once the dam breaks the sediment layer may behave like a viscous fluid with clear water flowing easily on its top to collect the required data several 1 mm resolution point gages in stripe forms have been installed on the flume outside wall these point gages located in overlap sections covered by two closed cameras were used as reference to match the images for the main tests with silted up reservoirs a certain type of sediment was selected as mixtures of quartz sand with a uniform grain size between 0 2 and 0 4 mm the sediment gradation curve is presented in fig s1 in supplementary material in order to ensure uniformity and homogeneity of sedimentation a standard test preparation procedure was followed carefully duarte et al 2011 after washing and drying the sediment it was transferred slowly into the dry flume therefore the smooth and horizontal sediment layer surface was manually created by a putty knife in order to minimize sediment diameter separation water was injected to the flume at a low discharge while slow sediment deposition took place simultaneously 2 1 data collection for each experiment three 40 s video files in mov format were recorded using all cameras while each camera covered about 2 m of the flume length fig 2 relevant parameters of water level and sediment depth were extracted using an automated image processing method main advantage of digital image processing is that this method is non subjective and can yield accurate and high quality results additionally measurement points can be easily replaced in this method and the measurements of water level and sediment depth variations can be estimated at any arbitrary location along the flume for this purpose the spatially surveyed spots including 16 distinct points have considered covering the entire length of the flume fig 4 gaps between the points near the gate location were less than other areas along the flume to ensure enough measurements are performed in this area of high turbulence and rapid depth change the first point was at the beginning of the reservoir upstream of the flume and the distances of 15 other surveyed points were 0 76 1 02 1 27 1 37 1 42 1 47 1 52 1 57 1 67 1 77 1 87 2 52 3 52 4 52 and 5 52 m downstream of the first point respectively these data were extracted by the analysis of the first 300 frames covering 6 s 50 frames per second of each video file using 15 time snaps after the dam breaks intervals between the snaps were shorter immediately after the dam break and increased gradually the snap times were 0 04 0 08 0 12 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 1 5 2 3 4 5 and 6 s after the dam break given 3 cameras for shooting 15 time snaps and 32 different dam break scenarios a total of 1440 photographs extracted which were all examined carefully according to the 16 fixed locations and two parameters these photographs contained 15 360 data 32 scenarios 15 times 16 locations 2 parameters which are all presented in the appendix data to verify the experimental measurements and openfoam results particular physical models with clear water upstream and dry bed or wet bed downstream conditions were designed and modeled both experimentally and numerically then their results were compared with available experimental and numerical studies reported in literature similar results in the larocque et al 2013 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 fig 5 presents a set of image comparisons at different times after dam break to visually compare the results of the present study against other researchers results ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 a good agreement with literature was found in terms of water depths and wave front locations as illustrated in fig 5 and also figs s2 and s3 in supplementary material 3 numerical modeling along with several commercial cfd software such as fluent and flow3d to solve fluid mechanics problems free licensed software also gained popularity in the field one of the most widely used being an open source code software named openfoam open foam 2015 this software allows users to simulate a wide range of physical phenomena such as two phase and multiphase flows open foam 2015 unofficial openfoam 2019 the numerical part of this study is limited to simulation of all experimental data collected from 32 different experiment scenarios using the openfoam software this software is designed for installation on a linux operating system and its programming language is c an object oriented and easily expandable programming language simulations have been performed using both volume of fluid vof and eulerian approaches although these approaches have been used previously to solve clear water dam break problems ozmen cagatay et al 2014 biscarini et al 2010 issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 mokrani and abadie 2016 panicker et al 2015 fondelli et al 2015 ye and zhao 2017 issakhov et al 2018 to the authors knowledge they have never been used in multiphase dam break with silted up reservoirs modeling it should be noted that no reduction or enlargement in width of channel downstream was considered and the longitudinal slope of channel was taken as zero 3 1 vof method the vof method is used to simulate layered flows in which the phases have explicit boundaries clear interfaces such as free surface flows in order to simulate two phase and multiphase dam break waves with openfoam interfoam and multiphaseinterfoam solvers have been used in this approach a set of conservative forms of continuity and momentum equations are simultaneously solved for all available phases computations of the water free surface by vof also involved a cfd package based on the finite volume method fvm continuity and momentum equations for a newtonian incompressible fluid in vof method may be described as eqs 1 and 2 jamshidi et al 2019 kassar et al 2018 barbosa et al 2019 hirt and nichols 1981 rusche 2002 1 u 0 2

multiphase flows while phases may mix together in this method which is also called two fluid method tfm each phase is individually calculated and solved making the computing time longer than vof the most widely used solvers in this method are twophaseeulerfoam and multiphaseeulerfoam with the theoretical details being described in soleimani et al 2015 bhusare et al 2017 lubchenko et al 2018 kia and aminian 2017 panda et al 2017 to verify the openfoam numerical results particular clear water dam break scenarios were modeled physically and numerically under dry bed and wet bed downstream conditions results were compared fig 5 with available laboratory and numerical results in the literature larocque et al 2013 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 and a good agreement with literature was found also as shown in figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary material the numerical results are in good agreement with measured data in the literature 3 3 initial conditions and solution domain owing to the laboratory channel restrictions the solution domain was 6 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 32 m high as the initial condition a volume of 1 52 m in length and 0 3 m in height was considered as the reservoir channel bottom and side walls were made of steel and glass thus assumed smooth as the boundary condition the upstream bottom and side boundaries along the channel were all defined as walls and the downstream boundary at the end of the channel was defined as a pressure outlet the top boundary was defined as a pressure inlet due to atmospheric pressure on the free surface the boundary hydraulic conditions were also independently considered meshed creating different downstream and upstream conditions downstream conditions were completely dry bed or wet bed with different initial water depths and upstream conditions were reservoirs with various saturated sediment layer heights a standard procedure was followed carefully to determine suitable mesh size and time step akbari and barati 2012 barati et al 2012 mesh size analysis was performed using eight different sizes then by compromising the error and runtime a uniform mesh of fixed cubes with dx dy dz 0 005 m was selected in total the three dimensional computational domain contained more than 4 6 million cells time step analysis was performed using four different time steps and considering the error courant number and the runtime a time step of 0 001 s was selected more details of the mesh size and time step analyses are presented in figs s6 s8 in supplementary material 4 results and discussion in this section several graphs and tables are presented and discussed to study the effects of various factors including dry bed or wet bed downstream and different depths of upstream saturated sediment layer on multiphase flood waves caused by the silted up dam break fig 6 shows the comparison between simulation results using vof and eulerian approaches at distinct times of 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 1 s after the dam breaks images are extracted and categorized for an approximately 2 m interval covered from 0 2 m upstream to 1 8 m downstream of the dam as shown the resulted wave moves rapidly downstream about 0 18 m in 0 1 sec after the dam breaks and it reaches 1 5 m downstream of the dam in 1 s 3 m point in the figure once this wave hits the standing downstream water it creates special large bulges in the water level as the time passes after dam break water level at the dam section as well as its upstream decreases quickly results of the two numerical methods are slightly different for example at 0 4 and 1 s the amount of sediment layer propagation in vof method is slightly higher than that in eulerian also the boundary between the phases is sharp and clear in vof results while the interference of phases has occurred at some regions in eulerian 4 1 image comparisons for upstream sediment depths of 0 03 0 15 and 0 22 m several image comparisons are depicted using photographs extracted from the laboratory videos and simulation results of vof and eulerian methods all images are presented on an evaluable basis and a complete comparison is made to better visualize different upstream and downstream hydraulic conditions the photographs associated with camera no 2 mid camera have utilized covering about 2 m of the channel length from upstream to downstream of the dam six snap times of 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 s after dam break were scrutinized in fig 7 water level and sediment depth profiles are shown after the dam breaks the simulation results by vof and eulerian methods are located below experimental images for a span of 1 3 3 1 m from the beginning of the flume from 0 2 m upstream to 1 6 m downstream of the dam this figure is for the case where upstream sediment depth is 0 03 m and dam downstream is wet with 0 04 m of standing water by comparing the experimental and numerical results it is observed that the downstream wave propagations are similar in predicting the wave tip locations hence there is an acceptable concordance in prediction of the wave front celerity at 0 4 s the downstream positive wave causes an increase in downstream water elevation also the progressive wave has a specific profile with two bulges in the body and a front wave in its forehead region the wave tip has reached 2 4 m in downstream and it is well predicted by both numerical methods in terms of size form and location however eulerian results seem to be more accurate in predicting the details at 0 6 s turbulence is increased in the forehead region and the wave tip has reached 2 9 m from the reservoir beginning with two large bulges in its body also at 2 2 m from the reservoir beginning the water level is about 0 13 m which predicted reasonably by both numerical methods at 0 8 s the wave has some bulges in frontal area and at an interval of 2 1 3 m the water level has increased and all of these fluctuations are well predicted by the software investigating later times after dam break indicates that the sediment layer has moved downstream up to 0 08 m without any significant change in its initial form of a relatively sharp step comparisons of water level and sediment depth profiles show that laboratory experiments and results of vof and eulerian methods are in good agreements note that the water level and sediment depth profile images after dam break while upstream sediment depth is 0 15 m and dam downstream is wet with 0 04 m water are depicted and discussed in fig s9 in supplementary material in fig 8 water level and sediment depth profiles are shown while upstream sediment depth is 0 22 m and downstream is wet with 0 05 m of standing water as in previous figure the experimental and both numerical results are in good agreements at 0 4 s the positive wave hits the downstream standing water creating an increase in water elevation and reaches 1 95 m from the reservoir beginning and at 0 6 s the wave tip reaches 2 25 m downstream point at 0 8 and 1 s the wave tip has reached 2 6 m and 2 85 m from the reservoir beginning point respectively while water level upstream is decreasing and rising in the downstream region for instance water level at 0 8 s is about 0 24 m at point 1 4 m and about 0 07 m at point 2 5 m however at 1 s water level at 1 4 m decreases to 0 22 m and rises to a maximum of 0 1 m at point 2 5 m investigating images at later times after dam break indicates the saturated sediment layer upstream has moved downstream up to 0 18 m as previously discussed the sediment depth at the dam location and dam upstream decreased as time passes for instance at 1 s after dam break the sediment depth decreased about 0 08 m at dam location which is well predicted by both numerical methods as the upstream sediment depth increases the movement of saturated sediment layer as well as its depth in the downstream direction increase accordingly on the other hand the downstream initial water presence reduces the advancement of saturated sediment layer reducing the risk of burying structures and equipment under the massive saturated sediment layer however downstream initial water level leads to increase the maximum water level there after dam break and hence increases immersion risk of downstream structures and equipment comparing the predictions of vof and eulerian methods with experimental results it is clear that eulerian especially for wet downstream conditions is more accurate in predicting the details at the wave forehead region also if the upstream sediment depth is more than half of the reservoir s height then eulerian is more accurate and closer to experimental results in both terms of the sediment layer depth and movement in the downstream direction despite advantages such as higher accuracy eulerian has disadvantages 1 longer computational times 2 more complex simulation conditions and 3 requiring professional skills to design and run a multiphase model 4 2 water surface and sediment depth profile fig 9 shows water surface profiles at different times after dam break when the upstream reservoir is filled up by clear water without sediment and the downstream is either dry fig 9 a and b or wet with 0 05 m of sitting water fig 9 c and d figures depict the profiles for early fig 9 a and c and late fig 9 b and d times after dam break all figures show both laboratory measurements points and vof results lines the experimental and vof results are in good agreements and the maximum rmse and mae are 0 012 m and 0 006 m respectively compared to the 0 3 m depth of the reservoir water error indices seem insignificant as the maximum rmse and mae are 4 and 2 of the reservoir water depth respectively however as the downstream condition gets more complicated with higher flow turbulence the statistical error indices increase accordingly fig 9 c and d the experimental results at 0 04 0 08 and 0 2 s early times indicate that the dam break wave propagated up to 0 7 m upstream and 0 7 m downstream however at 0 4 1 2 and 6 s late times the negative wave reached the flume beginning 1 52 m upstream of the dam the water level was affected at the beginning of the reservoir within 0 4 s and decreased to less than 0 04 m at 6 s there the waves shape and propagation pattern differ in dry versus wet downstream conditions in dry downstream condition the wave tip propagates about 0 7 m at early times 0 2 s and progresses smoothly however in wet downstream condition at the same time this wave only propagates up to 0 45 m and has several humps in the late times 0 4 1 2 and 6 s after dam break the effect of downstream conditions on the wave propagation pattern is significant for instance wet downstream in comparison with dry downstream has caused an increase in the water level at the flume beginning point created several humps in the progressive wave and also increased the maximum flood wave s depth fig 10 a d shows water surface profiles after dam break while the upstream sediment depth is 0 03 m and the downstream is dry fig 10 a and c and wet with 0 02 m of sitting water fig 10 b and d all figures depict experimental measurements as well as vof fig 10 a and b and eulerian fig 10 c and d results the measured data and both vof and eulerian results are in good agreement and the maximum rmse and mae values which occurred in the vof method are 0 013 and 0 0098 m respectively these errors are negligible compared to the 0 3 m depth of the reservoir water profile results at 0 4 1 2 and 6 s late times indicate that the negative wave has reached the flume beginning in 0 4 s and the water level has changed there from 0 3 m to around 0 05 m in 6 s although many of the analyses are similar to fig 9 comparisons of water level in fig 10 a d show that eulerian results are more accurate than vof in predicting the measured data rmse and mae values for eulerian are 0 0091 m and 0 0076 m respectively rmse is 3 and mae is 2 53 with respect to the 0 3 m depth of the reservoir water while wet downstream condition has not had much of an effect on the upstream wave pattern it has had a profound effect on the downstream wave pattern and created a bumpy profile fig 10 e h shows sediment depth profiles after dam break while the upstream sediment depth is 0 075 m and the downstream is dry fig 10 a and c or wet with 0 05 m of sitting water fig 10 b and d all figures depict measured data as well as vof fig 10 a and b and eulerian fig 10 c and d results the experimental measurements are in good agreement with vof and eulerian results and the maximum rmse and mae values are 0 0083 m and 0 0047 m respectively that occurred in vof when the downstream was initially wet profile results at 0 4 1 2 and 6 s indicate that the sediment negative wave has advanced back to upstream by 0 15 m in 0 4 s to a maximum of 0 5 m in 6 s and its positive wave has moved up to 0 35 m to the dam downstream also the sediment layer propagation differs in dry versus wet downstream conditions however in dry bed condition the sediment layer tip propagates around 0 35 m to downstream in wet downstream condition it only moves up to 0 25 m there comparisons of sediment depth profiles in fig 10 e h show that eulerian is more accurate than vof in predicting measured data rmse and mae values for the eulerian method are 0 0046 m and 0 0023 m respectively rmse is 6 1 and mae is 3 1 with respect to the 0 075 m depth of the sediment layer deeper investigation indicates in early times after dam break up to 0 2 s the reservoir sediment layer was not influenced by downstream dry bed or wet bed conditions and no significant changes has occurred in the sediment layer initial form of a relatively sharp step in the latter case low sediment depth and turbulence of the wave may prevent significant deformation in sediment layer at early times note that water surface profiles when the upstream sediment depth is 0 15 m with different downstream conditions are shown in fig s10 in supplementary material the sediment depth profiles when the upstream sediment depth is 0 2 m are also depicted and discussed in fig s11 in supplementary material the statistical error values of vof and eulerian in predicting water surface profile at late times 0 4 1 2 and 6 s after dam break are presented in table 2 covering upstream sediment depths of 0 03 0 24 m and dry bed or wet bed downstream initial conditions as reflected in table 2 the experimental measurements are in good agreement with vof and eulerian results and the maximum rmse and mae were 0 043 m and 0 03 m respectively the maximum error values occurred in vof for wet downstream condition with 0 04 and 0 05 m water in these cases the upstream sediment depths were 0 22 m and 0 2 m however according to simulation assumptions such as considering the saturated sediment layer as a viscous fluid the results are satisfactory and the maximum amounts of error seems acceptable as compared to 0 3 m depth of reservoir water as previously mentioned it seems as the downstream condition gets more complicated the error indices increase accordingly it should be noted that the rmse value presented for each dam break scenario in table 2 is an average of the errors calculated in 16 distinct surveyed locations along the channel and also at 4 time snaps 0 4 1 2 and 6 s after the dam break deeper investigation showed that in the lower sediment depth conditions 0 03 m and 0 075 m the ability of numerical models is higher than other cases moreover in dry downstream condition the best fit between experimental and numerical results is achieved by comparing the statistical error indices it is observed that the eulerian had better fit to the measured data than the vof for instance when the upstream sediment depth was 0 2 m and downstream was wet with 0 05 m water the eulerian yielded error indices that are 17 lower than the vof pointing to a superior performance nevertheless the insignificant errors reported from different cases indicate the high ability of openfoam in simulating the multiphase shock waves the statistical error values of vof and eulerian in predicting sediment depth profiles at 0 4 1 2 and 6 s after dam break are presented in table s1 in supplementary material in general the calculated maes vary between 0 006 m and 0 031 m 2 10 with respect to the reservoir height of 0 3 m and the rmses vary between 0 008 m and 0 043 m 2 6 4 with respect to the maximum reservoir height of 0 3 m results of all numerical simulations indicate that especially in some cases with high upstream sediment depths the eulerian method showed slightly superior performances than the vof and the error values in the eulerian were lower than the vof by 5 20 accommodating mixing of the phases in eulerian may have prompted its superior results 4 3 investigation of water level and sediment depth variations over time in this part the results of vof and eulerian methods are compared with experimental measurements in predicting the variation of water level and sediment depth as time elapses the mae and rmse indices are also calculated and presented for all cases to assess the agreement between experimental and numerical results for this purpose 15 time snaps are considered in a wide range of 0 04 6 s after dam break section 2 1 all graphs are presented for three fixed locations and the distances between locations from reservoir beginning are 0 76 m upstream reservoir midpoint 1 52 m dam location and 2 52 m dam downstream the channel side view and three fixed locations are illustrated in fig s12 in supplementary material for data extraction from these locations both first and second camera mid camera are used covering about 3 7 m of the flume length in fig 11 the water level variation as time elapses after dam break at 3 fixed locations are shown here the reservoir is filled up by clear water with different downstream conditions points and lines represent experimental measurements and vof results respectively the experimental and vof results are in good agreement and as the downstream condition gets more complicated the error indices increase accordingly the maximum rmse and mae were 0 0079 m and 0 0057 m respectively 2 6 and 1 9 with respect to the 0 3 m depth of reservoir water respectively as expected after dam break for up to 3 s the upstream water level at 0 76 m decreases rapidly while at the same time the downstream water level 2 52 m rises rapidly and then slowly decreases along the flume once the dam breaks the water depth at dam location 1 52 m sharply reduced and after about 0 5 s it reached less than half of its initial depth and then gradually decreases as reflected in the figure presence of downstream initial water has led to an increase in water level in the dam downstream particularly during late times 4 6 s the effect of downstream conditions on the water level in all three surveyed points upstream dam location and downstream was evident and the water level at all points for wet downstream condition was higher than dry downstream condition in fig 12 both water level and sediment depth variations have been examined for three fixed locations along the flume and results of vof and eulerian numerical methods have been compared with experimental measurements when upstream sediment depth was 0 24 m with different downstream conditions the experimental and both vof and eulerian results are in acceptable agreement with maximum rmse and mae of 0 0365 and 0 0255 m respectively 12 1 and 8 5 of initial reservoir water level 0 3 m based on the simulation assumptions such as considering the saturated sediment layer as a viscous fluid the results are acceptable the water level variation in dam upstream and downstream has behaved in the same manner as previously discussed as expected once the dam breaks the water level at dam location 1 52 m sharply reduced and after 0 5 s reached less than 0 2 m and then gradually decreased experimental results indicate that the sediment depth at the dam upstream 0 76 m and downstream 2 52 m do not change much in the first 2 s after the dam break however in the same time the sediment depth rapidly decreased about 0 1 m at the dam section 1 52 m and then slowly decreased moreover at 2 s after dam break the downstream sediment depth slowly started to increase and reached 0 025 m at 6 s it is also observed in fig 12 that different downstream conditions dry bed or wet bed at early times after dam break up to 0 4 s did not have any effect on water level variation at upstream and dam section 1 52 m however presence of downstream initial water has led to an increase in the water level at dam downstream and the effect of wet downstream condition on the water level at dam section is obvious in late times 6 s in general the experimental measurements are in good agreement with vof and eulerian results also as previously discussed in some cases with high sediment depths upstream the error values in eulerian were lower showing slightly superior performance than the vof noted that in fig s13 in supplementary material the time variation results of vof and eulerian methods have been compared with experimental measurements when upstream sediment depth is 0 03 m with different downstream conditions 4 4 investigation of correlation factor in experimental and numerical results in this section by presenting several graphs for different upstream and downstream conditions and comparing the coefficient of determination r 2 the correlation between experimental results and numerical simulations is evaluated in fig 13 a the correlation between experimental measurements and vof results in determining water level after dam break is shown for different times in this case the reservoir is filled up by clear water and downstream is wet with 0 04 m water as it can be seen the experimental measurements are highly correlated with vof results and the r 2 is 0 989 fig 13 b and c indicates the correlation of laboratory measurements versus vof or eulerian numerical methods in determining water level variation at different times after dam break for the case that the upstream sediment depth is 0 075 m and downstream is wet with 0 05 m water experimental measurements are correlated with both vof and eulerian results with r 2 values of 0 983 and 0 987 respectively which indicates an acceptable accuracy of results however a small difference in the determination coefficients shows the eulerian results have a higher precision as compared to vof results the statistical error value presented in this study for each scenario is an average of the errors calculated for different sections of the flume at various time snaps after the dam break however according to fig 13 in some locations along the flume high error values are observed for example in fig 13 b at 6 s after the dam break the error value has reached 40 50 in some locations along the flume the reason seems to be the difference between threshold shear stress in a fluid with non newtonian behavior reality and the assumption of numerical modeling in this study in which newtonian fluid is assumed this has led to significant differences between observed data and numerical results at some locations at the beginning of the dam reservoir it should be noted that the correlation analysis for the case that the upstream sediment depth is 0 2 m while downstream is dry has been presented in fig s14 in supplementary material 4 5 investigation of wave front celerity the wave front celerity values were rigorously measured by means of extracted images at four 1 m long intervals through dam downstream these four intervals totally cover 4 m length of dam downstream 1 52 m 5 52 m from reservoir beginning the measured wave front celerity values for these intervals are provided in 4 tables due to 4 downstream conditions presented in supplementary material section s11 however the mean measured wave front celerity along dam downstream for all 32 dam break scenarios are classified in table 3 investigating table 3 it is concluded that the upstream sediment depth is an important factor which determine the celerity values the deeper the upstream sediment layer the slower the dam break flood wave propagates it seems that shallower water flow on the top of the sediment layer is one of the reasons resulting in lower wave front celerity values downstream initial standing water also leads to decrease in the flood celerity deeper downstream standing water reduced the wave front celerity further reduced wave velocity due to downstream initial water level is also reported in previous studies leal et al 2006 deng et al 2018 as reflected the mean wave front celerity values along the flume are in a range of 1 08 2 32 m s based on different dam upstream and downstream conditions the variance of each mean celerity value was also calculated and classified in table 3 var line as it can be seen the calculated variance values are insignificant and varied from 0 004 to a maximum of 0 042 m 2 s 2 and the maximum variance values have occurred in the cases with deeper initial upstream sediment 5 summary and conclusion in the present study two and three phase flood waves caused by sudden dam break with silted up reservoirs have been studied both experimentally and numerically different initial conditions including various upstream sediment depths and dry bed or wet bed downstream have been considered which created a total of 32 scenarios multiphase dam break shock waves were filmed by cameras mounted along the flume and image processing method was employed to extract water level and sediment depth data from 16 locations along the flume and 15 snap times after the dam breaks numerical simulations were conducted using openfoam via vof and eulerian numerical approaches authors concluded that upstream sediment depth is an important factor in determining flood wave propagation velocity particularly higher upstream sediment depths and less water depth on it caused a slower flood wave propagation downstream it was postulated that the high sediment viscosity is a factor for the wave front celerity decrease under these conditions on the other hand by increasing upstream sediment depth both length and depth of the saturated sediment propagation to downstream area increase raising the risk of burying downstream facilities the results demonstrate a strong effect of downstream initial water on the flood wave which reduces the advancement of saturated sediment layer leading to a decrease in flood wave velocity the deeper the downstream initial water is the slower the flood wave propagates leal et al 2006 deng et al 2018 nevertheless presence of downstream initial water has led to increase in maximum flood wave height in downstream which could raise the immersion risk of structures and equipment located in prone areas despite limitations such as assuming the upstream saturated sediment layer as a viscous fluid in numerical modeling comparing the numerical results of vof and eulerian approaches with laboratory measurements showed that they are in good agreements the eulerian approach slightly outperformed vof especially in cases with high upstream sediment depths accommodating phase mixing in eulerian method is believed to have caused its superior results further good controls over the conditions in the lab such as no leakage from gate edges short gate opening time 0 08 0 16 s high imaging quality and precise computer processing of the images appeared to be among reasons leading to good matching of experimental and numerical results maximum error values in terms of mean absolute error mae varied from 0 006 m to 0 031 m 2 to 10 with respect to the reservoir height of 0 3 m and in terms of root mean square error rmse varied from 0 008 m to 0 043 m 2 6 to 14 with respect to the maximum reservoir height of 0 3 m although comparing coefficient of determination r 2 showed acceptable correlations between the measured data and the results of vof and eulerian approaches the eulerian method indicated a better correlation with experimental results however required computational time for eulerian approach was far more than that of vof in some cases twice as long it requires more complex simulation conditions especially when utilizing as a multiphase modeling tool future research could examine the potential effects of changing downstream condition along the flume on such a multiphase shock wave propagation simulating the saturated sediment layer as a fluid with non newtonian behavior or as solid particles might prove important too moreover evaluating the application of expert systems particularly artificial neural networks anns on predicting such complex issues may constitute the object of future studies first of all this is desirable to apply artificial intelligence or genetic algorithm models to make an accurate estimation for such multiphase flood waves nikoo et al 2015 2016 since artificial intelligence models may have different accuracies fusion based methods are common approaches could be conducted on the wide database provided in this research alizadeh and nikoo 2018 ghazali et al 2018 taravatrooy et al 2018 in the last this is very much the key component in future attempts to discuss the uncertainties in the peak estimation as well as the hydrograph of dam break flood using interval optimization methods factorial analysis and also the method of conditional value at risk cvar naserizade et al 2018 soltani et al 2016 tavakoli et al 2014 above all this issue would need to be explored further using different types of sediments with various grain sizes and gradations and this is desirable for future work to take into account the consolidation of sediment credit authorship contribution statement foad vosoughi conceptualization

5182,soil detachment processes are greatly impacted by vegetation recovery however the understanding of these relationships on bengggang alluvial fans in southeast china is limited in this research the impacts of near soil surface factors litter stems biological crusts and roots on soil detachment is quantitated by overland flow with two introduced grass species paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum in the alluvial fans flow scouring was performed on soil samples obtained from two grasslands under nine forms of shear stress ranging from 2 70 to 10 51 pa paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum significantly reduced the soil detachment capacity of alluvial fans by 94 and 98 respectively the roots of the two kinds of grass were most effective in reducing soil detachment 48 and 63 the situation of 80 was caused by root binding besides the contribution of biological crusts 37 and 20 was higher than that of litter stems 9 and 15 compared with bare land roots and biological crusts under paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum decreased rill erodibility by 43 and 40 60 and 20 respectively meanwhile they increased the critical shear stress by 0 92 to 3 02 fold 1 15 to 3 34 fold respectively roots of the two plants increased soil resistance more than the biological crusts mainly by root binding overall pennisetum giganteum a deep roots plant showed a slightly better performance in controlling soil detachment than paspalum mandiocanum a shallow roots plant among them the roles of roots and litter stems of pennisetum giganteum were greater than those of paspalum mandiocanum while the role of biological crusts of paspalum mandiocanum was greater than that of pennisetum giganteum these findings highlight the significance of litter stems biological crusts and roots in controlling soil erosion and are helpful for selecting suitable grasses for vegetation recovery in alluvial fans of benggang keywords gramineous plant overland flow resistance to erosion soil and water conservation vegetation restoration 1 introduction soil detachment is defined as soil particles dislodging from the soil mass caused by rainfall or surface flow govers et al 1990 owoputi and stolte 1995 soil detachment by over flow is often considered to be the main soil erosion process wang et al 2016 the soil detachment rate is defined as the amount of sediment detached per unit area per unit of time zhang et al 2009 in the case of clear water the maximum soil detachment rate occurs which is termed the soil detachment capacity nearing et al 1991 soil detachment capacity is a key parameter in many soil erosion models such as the wepp model nearing et al 1989 therefore it is necessary to quantify the mechanisms of different factors impacting soil detachment process under different conditions soil detachment is influenced by the properties of near soil surfaces containing above and belowground factors wang et al 2014 2015 the aboveground factors that influence soil detachment mainly include the plant stems litter biological crusts and surface roughness geddes and dunkerley 1999 zavala et al 2009 while the belowground factors that impact soil detachment include the inherent characteristics of plant root traits and soil properties gyssels et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 leung et al 2015 both the above and belowground soil characteristics control the soil detachment process from overland flow regarding the aboveground characteristics a series of small dams was formed by a combination of plant stems and litter the flow velocity was reduced and the energy of overland flow was dissipated by the plant stems litter and small dams geddes and dunkerley 1999 zavala et al 2009 plant litter and its decomposition residue improve soil stability descheemaeker et al 2006 wang et al 2015 biological crusts greatly improve soil resistance and reduce soil loss because soil particles adhere to the crusts through filamentous cyanobacterial binding and bonding powell et al 2015 hossein et al 2020 biofilms produced by cyanobacteria and moss also improve the physical and chemical properties of the surface colica et al 2014 rossi and de philippis 2015 chamizo et al 2015 as the thickness of the biological crust increases the soil detachment capacity decreases wang et al 2018 surface roughness also increases as biological crust increases and reduces soil detachment al qinna and abu awwad 1998 wang et al 2018 regarding the belowground characteristics almost all soil properties e g organic matter content porosity soil texture cohesion moisture content and aggregate stability affect soil detachment nachtergaele poesen 2002 vannoppen et al 2017 for example when soil permeability increases the amount of overland flow is deducted with the increase in soil porosity wang et al 2015 as soil stability increases soil resistance to overland flow increases with the increase in aggregate stability and the amount of soil organic matter zhang et al 2009 plant root systems greatly influence soil detachment vannoppen et al 2015 khanal and fox 2017 soil detachment decreases exponentially with root density de baets poesen 2010 li et al 2015 khanal and fox 2017 and the soil resistance to overland flow erosion can be enhanced by larger numbers of roots that are less than 1 mm in diameter de baets et al 2007a leung et al 2015 roots enhance soil resistance to erosion through physical binding to soil and the bonding of exudates with plant roots de baets et al 2008 regarding the binding effect of the root system plant roots penetrate the soil during growth stabilizing the soil structure de baets et al 2006 li et al 2015 regarding the bonding effect root exudates can cause soil particles to firmly adhere to the root surface which enhances soil stability and resistance de baets et al 2006 2008 the effects of different vegetation types on soil detachment processes are different owing to their different near soil surface properties for example the development of biological crusts varies as soil moisture and temperature conditions change under different land uses which results in differences in the community coverage and thickness of biological crusts belnap 2006 wang et al 2018 soil detachment can be more effectively reduced by fibrous root plants than by tap root plants de baets poesen 2010 vannoppen et al 2017 however the relationships between soil detachment and the near soil surface properties of different plants are still unknown moreover in china studies of these relationships have been confined to the loess plateau wang et al 2014 2015 2018 li et al 2015 but studies in the red soil region are limited as the climate terrain soil and vegetation in the red soil region differ from those in the loess plateau understanding these relationships in the hilly area of the red soil region of southeast china is of great significance in southern china collapsing gullies with steep walls locally called benggang fig 1 a are widespread huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 more than 239 100 gullies are present in southern china according to a 2005 survey huang et al 2019 steep walls fail suddenly and collapsing gullies develop quickly the erosion rated in these areas exceeds 500 mg ha 1 y 1 at least 50 fold higher than that of gentler slopes jiang et al 2020 a collapsing gully generally consists of upper catchments collapsing walls and alluvial fans fig 1 a zhang et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 alluvial fans are situated below the gully mouth where sediments transported out of the channel are deposited an alluvial fan has a high coarse grain content low cohesion high erodibility and low soil fertility deng et al 2017 to effectively reduce soil loss in alluvial fans some pioneer grasses with resistance to desert conditions tenacious vitality and developed roots have been selected for planting li et al 2017 according to this investigation many grasses are suitable for growth in alluvial fans including paspalum mandiocanum pennisetum giganteum digitaria sanguinalis setaria viridis and cynodon dactylon li et al 2017 among them paspalum mandiocanum fig 1 b d and pennisetum giganteum fig 1 c e are introduced grass species with fibrous roots those are extensively planted as pioneer plants in collapsing gully areas because of their strong adaptability to poor and acidic soil conditions and their good growth at present soil shear strength and soil detachment are the main topics of research on vegetation restoration in alluvial fans li et al 2017 noted that the soil shear strength in grasslands increased with increasing biomass density jiang et al 2020 showed that root length density and soil cohesion were the most important factors in predicting soil detachment capacity the properties of the near soil surface are dependent on vegetation which impacts soil detachment due to overland flow however the impacts of litter stems biological crusts and plant roots on soil detachment have not been evaluated in alluvial fans and their roles in controlling soil detachment with vegetation planting remain unclear additionally the effects of different grass species on soil detachment likely vary however these differences are also unclear therefore the two typical grass species paspalum mandiocanum with shallow root and pennisetum giganteum with deep root were researched to meet the following objectives 1 investigate the impacts of litter stems biological crusts and roots on soil detachment and soil resistance in two grasslands 2 quantify the contributions of each near soil surface factor to prevent soil detachment and improve soil resistance and 3 compare the differences in soil detachment control and soil resistance improvement resulting from the near soil surface of the two grasses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area experiments were conducted in hetian 25 39 n 116 28 e in changting county of fujian province in southeast china hetian has a subtropical monsoon climate air temperature 18 c annual precipitation 1628 mm most of which occurs from april to september 70 the weathering of granite in the tropical environment leads to the release of quartz particles and clay minerals and the soil consists of kaolinite quartz plagioclase and k feldspar huang et al 2019 in response to rain and water runoff weathered materials on the steep slopes are prone to erosion when protective vegetation cover is lost according to a 2005 survey there were 2 266 collapsing gullies in hetian accounting for 63 of the total area of the county jiang et al 2020 2 2 grass selection two introduced grasses paspalum mandiocanum fig 1 b and pennisetum giganteum fig 1 c with fibrous roots were chosen for this research they can be used both as green manure and as pasture grass paspalum mandiocanum grows rapidly due to its tolerance to poor and acidic soil conditions paspalum mandiocanum which has shallow roots accounted for 90 of the total root distribution in the top 20 cm of the soil layer fig 1 d these plants are relatively short with a height of approximately 50 cm table 1 fig 1 b pennisetum giganteum exhibits robust tillering with a tall canopy containing erect stems it can tolerate to arid and poor soil conditions pennisetum giganteum has deep roots of approximately 80 cm fig 1 e these plants are tall with a height of approximately 2 8 m table 1 fig 1 c 2 3 sample site and treatments to reduce experimental error an alluvial fan with relatively consistent accumulated thickness slopes and soil properties was selected for the experiment fig 1 a the experimental alluvial fan was divided into three areas two of which were planted separately with paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum and one that was not planted bare land as the control a total of 3 600 plants were planted per hectare in each area and each plant was treated with 1 kg of organic fertilizer as the base fertilizer point seeding was chosen for the planting of 7 5 kg of paspalum mandiocanum seeds per hectare prior to sowing a mixture was created based on a grass seeds the organic fertilizer soil ratio of 1 50 160 by weight and subsequently sown into the holes through the equal division of the seeds post sowing the soil was covered with 2 4 cm of soil pennisetum giganteum was planted with a short stem cuttage each stem had two nodes each stem was buried in a hole and then the soil was compacted in the area surrounding the stem finnally the soil at both sites was watered until it was saturated in april 2015 the two grasses were planted in june 2015 april 2016 and june 2016 urea 60 kg per hectare was applied as a topdressing in august 2016 three representative areas were selected for investigation and sampling the basic conditions of the vegetation and the soil properties are shown in tables 1 and 2 the growth of the two grasses and their near soil surface characteristics are shown in fig 1 b e five treatments t0 t1 t2 t3 and t4 table 3 were designed to assess the potential impact of the near soil surface factors litter stems biological crusts root physical binding and root chemical bonding of the two grasses in terms of the detachment caused by overland flow as described by wang et al 2014 2015 bare land was used fort0 and each grass area was divided into four plots t1 t2 t3 and t4 for t0 the bare land soil was collected as follows the topsoil layer of the biological crust was removed with a scraper for t1 the vegetation was destroyed by spraying with atomizing pesticides glyphosate isopropylamine salt 41 agent jiangsu youthchem co ltd china using a hand sprayer staddon et al 2003 reported that the plant roots no longer released exudates 1 week after plant death and it was assumed that root exudates bonded to the soil were lost in the rhizosphere after 3 weeks after 4 weeks all plant roots died but did not decompose meaning that the soil mass was influenced by root binding alone before the test was conducted scissors were used to clip the herbage near the soil surface and a brush was used to remove plant litter the biological crusts were carefully removed and a soft brush was used to slightly brush the disturbed loose soil for t2 aboveground herbages litter and crusts were removed prior to the assessments as described in t1 only live roots were contained and the impacts of physical binding and chemical bonding by root systems were reflected for t3 plant litter and herbage were removed and crusts and plant roots were considered the total effects of biological crusts and plant roots are represented in t3 for t4 the plant leaves were cut off and the stems were kept approximately 2 cm long in this way the effects of plant litter and stems were contained in contrast to the conditions of t3 these treatments addressed the effects of litter stem biological crusts and root systems reflecting the total impact of the environment in the grassland on the detachment of soil 2 4 soil sampling the five treatment types with different vegetation types were sampled sampling methods were conducted as described in jiang et al 2020 a steel ring outer diameter 10 cm internal diameter 9 8 cm depth 5 0 cm was used to collect the soil samples the steel ring was pushed vertically into the soil for sample collection after that the soil around the ring was carefully excavated after the soil sample was collected thin iron sheets were placed on the top and bottom of the steel ring and rubber bands were used to secure the steel ring and the covers then the samples were sent back to the laboratory for scouring experiments the soil samples were collected from 9 treatments 3 flow discharges 3 slopes and 5 repetitions in each measurement area for a total of 405 samples for the scouring tests using a flume 2 5 experimental devices the experiments were performed at the laboratory of the science and technology research center for soil and water conservation of fujian agriculture and forestry university a rill flume length 4 m width 0 12 m height 0 05 m fig 2 was used to measure the soil detachment capacity which was consistent with the description of jiang et al 2020 galvanized steel sheets was used to make the flume the flume slope gradient could be adjusted from 0 to 47 to simulate slope roughness and field environments soil collected from the bare land was passed through a 5 mm sieve and evenly and smoothly adhered to the flume bed an overflow tank length 0 3 m width 0 12 m height 0 3 m was connected at the flume top peristaltic pumps were used to control the flow a storage box was installed for sample collection at a depth of 0 2 m from the lower regions of the flume diameter 10 cm depth 5 0 cm at the bottom of the box water was discharged through the holes through gravity 2 6 measurement of hydraulic parameters through field observations a maximum slope gradient of 27 was found on the alluvial fans therefore the experimental slopes were set to 9 18 and 27 according to the concentrated flow discharge generated by the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 rainstorm within 5 m2 5 m length and 1 m width 10 m2 10 m length and 1 m width and 15 m2 15 m length and 1 m width the flow discharge per unit width for each set of experiments was fixed at 1 39 10 3 2 78 10 3 and 4 17 10 3 m2 s 1 10 20 and 30 l min 1 respectively dual pumps were used to control the flow discharge surface velocities were measured using kmno4 0 8 w w within 2 m distance at the lower regions of the flume for ten repetitions when the flow stabilized a correction factor of 0 8 was used to derive the mean velocity abrahams et al 1986 and which was also used to calculate the flow depth eq 1 shear stress Ï was calculated using the flow depth and the mean flow velocity eq 2 these data are shown in table 4 2 7 soil detachment capacity tests the soil detachment capacity tests were conducted according to the methods in jiang et al 2020 before scouring the soil samples were saturated to ensure uniform soil moisture for each test then a soil sample containing a handheld steel ring was gently placed into the box at the flume bottom and plasticine was fully filled into the gap between the box and ring flume slopes and flow discharge were then adjusted and boxes were placed on a thin iron sheet for hydraulic parameter assessments the iron sheet was removed after the flow discharge stabilized a plastic bucket was used to collect the sediment at a scouring depth of 2 cm the test was stopped nearing et al 1991 if the scouring depth did not approach 2 cm the duration of scouring was set to 5 min li et al 2015 assays were performed five times following scouring the sediments were allowed to settle and the supernatants were decanted the sediments were dried in an oven using forced air conditions 105 c to achieve a constant mass prior to weighing the detachment capacity d c was calculated by dividing the dry mass post oven drying of eroded soil by the sample cross sectional area and the scouring period eq 3 five samples were averaged to assess the mean detachment capacity 2 8 data analysis flow depth h m flow shear stress Ï pa zhang et al 2009 and soil

the various grasslands k r represents the slope and Ï c represents the x axis of the regression line the equation was as follows 5 d c k r Ï Ï c 2 9 statistical analyses the data were analyzed

capacity and reduction in the soil detachment capacity following each treatment in the grasslands origin 8 0 and excel 2010 were used to construct all graphs 3 results 3 1 soil detachment capacity following each treatment in different grasslands the soil detachment capacity indicated great differences among the treatments in different grasslands fig 3 bare land had the maximum mean soil detachment capacity which was 0 163 kg m 2 s 1 fig 3 the mean soil detachment capacity of each treatment in paspalum mandiocanum land ranged from 0 00096 to 0 0099 kg m 2 s 1 with an average value of 0 0055 kg m 2 s 1 in all treatments and in pennisetum giganteum land it ranged from 0 00035 to 0 0082 kg m 2 s 1 with an average value of 0 0043 kg m 2 s 1 in all treatments plant litter stems biological crusts and roots weakened the flow energy to scour soil particles for paspalum mandiocanum the average soil detachment capacity of dead roots t1 and live roots t2 was lower than that of the bare land 40 and 48 respectively upon imposing the biological crust and live root treatment t3 and the litter stem biological crust and live root treatment t4 the average soil detachment capacities of t3 and t4 were 85 and 94 respectively which were lower than that of bare land t0 the impacts of the soil surface on the soil detachment in the pennisetum giganteum land were more obvious than the impacts on soil detachment in the paspalum mandiocanum land for pennisetum giganteum upon the superimposition of t1 t2 t3 and t4 the mean soil detachment capacity were 51 63 83 and 98 respectively which were lower than that of bare land fig 3 litter stems biological crusts and roots improved the soil resistance to scour by overflow and reduced the soil detachment capacity compared to bare land the average reduction of detachment for each factor varied in the grasslands fig 4 the average values of soil detachment reduction for each factor varied from 0 0013 to 0 0080 kg m 2 s 1 in paspalum mandiocanum land and varied from 0 0019 to 0 010 m 2 s 1 in pennisetum giganteum land and the order of reduction was total roots root binding biological crust litter stems root bonding the reduction in soil detachment caused by the indicated factors litter stems roots in the pennisetum giganteum land was 4 to 33 greater than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 4 however the soil detachment capacity reductions caused by the biological crust in the pennisetum giganteum land was 50 lower than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 4 3 2 contributions of each factor in the different grasslands the contributions of different near soil surface factors differed in the two grasslands for the paspalum mandiocanum land the soil detachment capacity reduced by 94 compared to that for the bare land soil and the contributions by litter stems biological crusts and plant roots were 9 37 and 48 respectively fig 5 the contribution from roots was 4 30 and 0 30 fold higher than that from litter stems and biological crusts respectively fig 5 for the pennisetum giganteum land soil detachment declined by 98 compared to that for the that in bare land with decreases of 15 20 and 63 due to litter stems biological crusts and roots respectively the contributions from roots were 3 20 and 2 15 fold greater than those from the litter stems or biological crusts respectively the above results demonstrated that roots biological crusts litter stems contributed to the soil detachment capacity in terms of the total contribution of plant roots physical binding reduced detachment 40 and 51 for the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively more than chemical bonding 8 and 12 for the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively comparing the two grasslands the contribution of litter stems to soil detachment reduction in the pennisetum giganteum land was 1 67 times greater than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land roots physical binding and chemical bonding in the pennisetum giganteum land contributed 63 51 and 12 to the reduction in soil detachment respectively which exceeded the contributions observed in the paspalum mandiocanum land 48 40 and 8 respectively however the contribution of biological crusts in the paspalum mandiocanum land was approximately 82 higher than that in the pennisetum giganteum land 3 3 soil resistance in different grasslands the impacts of each near soil surface factor on soil resistance varied in the two grasslands for all test treatments the soil detachment capacity displayed a linear relationship with shear stress p 0 01 r 2 0 86 table 7 rill erodibility k r and critical shear stress Ïc for each treatment were calculated using a linear model eq 5 nearing et al 1989 in samples with litter stems soil detachment was not reduced by the change in soil properties so the k r and Ïc of soil samples with litter stems were not discussed k r and Ïc for the other treatments are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively rill erodibility k r declined in the absence of vegetation bare land when each of the indicated treatments was superimposed fig 6 for the paspalum mandiocanum land the k r of each treatment was between 0 0005 and 0 0018 s m 1 k r under t1 dead roots was largest at 0 0018 s m 1 followed by that for the soil samples under t2 live roots 0 0017 s m 1 and the soil samples under t3 biological crusts and live roots 0 0005 s m 1 these values were reduced by 40 43 and 83 respectively compared to that of bare land t0 0 0030 s m 1 root binding root bonding and biological crusts decreased rill erodibility by 40 3 and 40 respectively this suggests that physical binding effects and biological crusts significantly decrease soil rill erodibility while the effect of root bonding on reducing soil rill erodibility is relatively weak this result was also confirmed for the pennisetum giganteum grassland where root binding root bonding and biological crusts decreased rill erodibility by 50 10 and 20 respectively comparing the two grass species the k r in pennisetum giganteum land with dead roots t1 and live roots t2 was 83 and 71 respectively that in paspalum mandiocanum land the ability of biological crusts to reduce rill erodibility by 20 in pennisetum giganteum land was less than that 40 in paspalum mandiocanum land fig 7 shows that the critical shear stress Ïc for the different treatments significantly differed with that of paspalum mandiocanum land being between 0 59 and 1 25 pa these values are all higher than that of bare land 0 31 pa the soil samples containing live roots t2 had the largest critical shear stress 1 25 pa followed by the soil samples containing live roots and biological crusts t3 1 13 pa and the soil samples containing dead roots t1 0 59 pa these Ïc values increased 2 03 2 66 and 0 92 fold respectively compared to that of the bare land this finding was also confirmed for the pennisetum giganteum land where Ïc increased by 3 34 2 05 and 1 25 fold respectively compared to that of the bare land the above results show that dead roots live roots and biological crusts can significantly increase the soil critical shear stress upon comparison of the grass species the Ïc of soil samples containing dead roots t1 and live roots t2 in the pennisetum giganteum land was 1 17 and 1 08 times respectively that of the soil samples in paspalum mandiocanum land however Ïc of soil samples containing biological crusts and live roots t3 in the pennisetum giganteum land was lower than that of soil samples in the paspalum mandiocanum land 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of near soil surface factors of two plants on soil detachment the hydraulic flume results confirm that the near soil surface factors after the restoration of vegetation are very effective in reducing erosion in bare land in this study the contribution of pennisetum giganteum to reducing the soil d c by 98 was slightly larger than that of paspalum mandiocanum by 94 previous studies also reported that the restoration of vegetation in bare land could effectively control soil erosion in a short time katuwal et al 2013 showed that soil erosion was reduced by about 75 after four weeks of planting lolium perenne in a loamy soil zhang et al 2020 noted that after 8 months of planting chrysopogon zizanioides soil sediment yield rate on steep colluvial deposits of southeast china decreased by 86 6 wang et al 2015 reported that the total reduction in soil detachment of the 1 yr old grassland was 98 1 of that of bare land in the loess plateau of china due to the differences between the two vegetation types in the properties of litter stems biological crusts and roots the contributions of different factors controlling soil detachment are different in this study the order of contribution to reduction of soil detachment in the two grasslands was roots biological crust litter stems fig 5 however previous studies reported that canopies have the strongest effects on reducing soil erosion katuwal et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 and other studies noted that the influence of biological crusts on reducing soil erosion is the least wang et al 2014 2015 the above indicates that the impacts of near soil surface factors on reducing soil erosion are closely related to vegetation types roots played the most important role in reducing soil detachment in our study reduced by 63 and 48 in pennisetum giganteum land paspalum mandiocanum land respectively which is consistent with previous studies gyssels et al 2005 showed that roots are at least as important as canopy covers for rill erosion mamo and bubenzer 2001 found that the soil detachment for soils with roots was reduced to 64 of that for fallow soils the grass root system can enhance soil stability through root binding de baets et al 2008 li et al 2017 additionally root exudates strongly adhere to soil through intermolecular bonding van der waals forces in the rhizosphere and biochemical interactions between the plant roots and soil de baets et al 2007a de baets et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 therefore the contributions of root binding and boding are different in terms of the total contribution of plant roots in our study more than 80 in the two grasslands was contributed by the effect of root binding many researchers have also noted that the effects of roots on reducing soil loss mainly depend on root physics binding katuwal et al 2013 wang et al 2014 roots physical binding and chemical bonding in pennisetum giganteum land contributed 63 51 and 12 to the reduction in soil detachment respectively which exceeded the contributions observed in paspalum mandiocanum land 48 40 and 8 respectively these differences can be explained by the more highly developed roots of pennisetum giganteum as table 1 shows the root mass density in the topsoil of pennisetum giganteum is 3 times that of paspalum mandiocanum previous studies have also shown that soil detachment rates decrease with increasing root density de baets et al 2006 de baets poesen 2010 vannoppen et al 2017 the contribution of biological crust to reducing soil detachment was second in our study reduced by 20 and 37 in pennisetum giganteum land and paspalum mandiocanum land respectively hossein et al 2020 also noted that cyanobacteria could reduce the soil loss by 36 to 57 in comparison with those recorded for the control knapen et al 2007 noted that biological crusts could decrease soil loss by 79 and 37 for moss and crusts with dominated algae respectively a biological crust covering on the soil surface can prevent detachment by flow rossi and de philippis 2015 hossein et al 2017 filamentous cyanobacteria bind and bond to soil particles that are sufficiently intact and are not be removed thus causing a reduction in soil loss dabney et al 1993 powell et al 2015 hossein et al 2020 moreover soil particles are absorbed by moss well and are hardly washed away by water flow knapen et al 2007 wang et al 2015 third biological crust controlled soil detachment by overland flow via soil property improvement including the organic matter content soil texture aggregate stability and cohesion nachtergaele poesen 2002 vannoppen et al 2017 the contribution of biological crusts in the paspalum mandiocanum land was 1 82 times as much as that in the pennisetum giganteum land this difference may be attributed to the community of biological crusts in the two lands fig 8 there are many mosses in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 8a but very little in the pennisetum giganteum land fig 8b bowker 2007 showed that the growth of biological crusts is inversely proportional to the plant litter biomass and decreases as the plant canopy closes as shown in table 1 the average dry mass of shoot biomass and crown breadth in the paspalum mandiocanum land were 10 and 54 of those in pennisetum giganteum land hence there are less litter and canopy closure in paspalum mandiocanum land resulting in better growth in biological crusts in the paspalum mandiocanum land moss adsorbs to the soil surface well and is hardly washed away by overland flow litter stems have the least effect on reducing soil detachment in our study reduced by 15 and 9 in pennisetum giganteum land paspalum mandiocanum land respectively but their impacts cannot be neglected precious studies also have reported that litter stems contributed more than 30 on soil loss wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 a series of composite dams or barriers were formed by the combination of litter and stems in the erosion process which significantly increased their impact on flow velocity suggesting that the kinetic energy and shearing force of the flow were dissipated geddes and dunkerley 1999 zavala et al 2009 the contribution of litter stems to soil detachment reduction in the pennisetum giganteum land was 77 greater than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land this difference occurred because the biomass of pennisetum giganteum is high as shown in table 1 the average dry mass of shoot biomass in the pennisetum giganteum land was 9 33 fold greater as that in the paspalum mandiocanum land therefore there is more litter on the soil surface in the pennisetum giganteum land in addition the stem of pennisetum giganteum is thicker fig 1e meaning that the stem has a stronger blocking effect on water flow 4 2 impacts of near soil surface factors of two plants on soil resistance the near soil surface factors of biological crusts and plant roots also have a significant impact on the soil resistance to erosion by flow rill erodibility k r showed an increasing order with the factors of live roots and biological crusts t3 live roots t2 dead roots t1 successively superimposed fig 7 the reduction in k r by roots was 43 and 60 in the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively many studies have reported that roots decrease soil erodibility by increasing soil stability and shear strength mamo and bubenzer 2001 katuwal et al 2013 roots promote the stability of soil aggregates through physical entanglement root exudates organic matter release and rhizosphere microbial activity increase due to the presences of roots gale et al 2000 tisdall and oades 1982 shear strength may be related to a similar bonding mechanism soil organic matter exudates in the rhizosphere and by products from microbes in the aggregation process fattet et al 2011 the root physical effects can also increase the shear strength in which the root fibers transfer the shear stress in the soil matrix to the tensile strength of the fiber inclusions gyssels et al 2005 de baets et al 2008 therefore the wepp model had taken into account the effect of roots on rill erodibility and the adjustments to rill erodibility for roots were adopted by a negative exponential equation alberts et al 1995 root bonding decreased rill erodibility by 3 and 10 in the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively which were much lower than those by root binding 40 and 50 this suggests that the root bonding effect on reducing the soil erodibility is relatively weak this was because the grasses were planted for one more year and the soil organic matter rhizosphere exudates and microbial products by roots are relatively few the k r in the pennisetum giganteum land with dead roots t1 and live roots t2 was 84 and 67 respectively that in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 6 this can again be explained by the higher root development in pennisetum giganteum that stabilizes the root system as table 1 shows the root mass density in the topsoil of pennisetum giganteum is 3 times that of paspalum mandiocanum furthermore the root diameter of pennisetum giganteum an average root diameter of 0 33 mm is greater than that of paspalum mandiocanum an average root diameter of 0 26 mm which results in the pennisetum giganteum land having more tensile resistance and less erodibility khanal and fox 2017 noted that the erodibility decreased with root diameter increasing by power function biological crusts reduce k r by 40 and 20 compared to bare land in the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively this is because not only do biological crusts form a coherent living covering the soil surface but also residual organic matter and filaments combine with soil particles underneath the surface crust which strongly enhances soil shear strength and stability belnap 2006 algayer et al 2014 stanchi et al 2015 chamizo et al 2015 the ability of biological crusts to reduce rill erodibility in the pennisetum giganteum land was less than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 6 this is because pennisetum giganteum land has fewer biological crusts especially moss than paspalum mandiocanum land fig 8 resulting in a relatively lower effect of biological crusts adsorbing to the soil surface hence there was a weaker reduction in rill erodibility in pennisetum giganteum land when the shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress soil detachment occurs nearing et al 1989 the critical shear stress Ïc of the near soil surface factors was higher than that in bare land t0 and exhibited a descending order with live roots t2 live roots and biological crusts t3 and dead roots t1 successively superimposed fig 7 among them the Ïc in the soil sample containing biological crusts and live roots t3 was lower than that in the soil sample containing live roots t2 this may be because the content of coarse particles in the test soil was high and the stability of the surface crust was relatively poor so the particles were easy to detach from the soil mass upon comparison of the grass species the Ïc of soil samples containing live roots t2 and dead roots t1 in the pennisetum giganteum land was 1 08 and 1 17 times respectively that of the soil samples in the paspalum mandiocanum land the reason for this difference was that the roots of pennisetum giganteum were more developed than those of paspalum mandiocanum however Ïc of soil samples containing biological crusts and live roots t3 in the pennisetum giganteum land was lower than that of soil samples in the paspalum mandiocanum land again explained by the differences in the community of biological crusts and fewer moss in the pennisetum giganteum land fig 8b resulting in a relatively weak adsorption to the soil surface furthermore the surface of pennisetum giganteum land is smoother due to less moss hence lower critical shear stresse is required to start detachment of soil particles knapen et al 2007 also pointed out that moss could increase the critical shear stress more effectively than algae and bare soil and liu et al 2016 found that critical shear stress increased with increasing moss coverage 5 conclusions the near soil surface properties of paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum can significantly reduce soil detachment and improve soil resistance to erosion on alluvial fans of benggang under our test conditions roots had the strongest effect on the control of soil detachment which mainly depended on root binding the influence of biological crusts was greater than that of litter stems besides roots also reduced rill erodibility and increased critical shear stress more than the biological crusts mainly by root binding pennisetum giganteum with deep roots exhibited slightly better performance in reducing soil detachment compared to paspalum mandiocanum with shallow roots moreover roots and litter stems of pennisetum giganteum were more effective in controlling soil detachment than those of paspalum mandiocanum while the biological crusts of pennisetum giganteum were less effective than those of paspalum mandiocanum in a word these two grass species that can greatly improve the near soil surface properties and are beneficial to control soil erosion of alluvial fans are worthy of further promotion in soil and water conservation in the area of collapsing gully furthermore the mechanisms of soil surface characteristics controlling soil erosion with more plant species require further

5182,soil detachment processes are greatly impacted by vegetation recovery however the understanding of these relationships on bengggang alluvial fans in southeast china is limited in this research the impacts of near soil surface factors litter stems biological crusts and roots on soil detachment is quantitated by overland flow with two introduced grass species paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum in the alluvial fans flow scouring was performed on soil samples obtained from two grasslands under nine forms of shear stress ranging from 2 70 to 10 51 pa paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum significantly reduced the soil detachment capacity of alluvial fans by 94 and 98 respectively the roots of the two kinds of grass were most effective in reducing soil detachment 48 and 63 the situation of 80 was caused by root binding besides the contribution of biological crusts 37 and 20 was higher than that of litter stems 9 and 15 compared with bare land roots and biological crusts under paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum decreased rill erodibility by 43 and 40 60 and 20 respectively meanwhile they increased the critical shear stress by 0 92 to 3 02 fold 1 15 to 3 34 fold respectively roots of the two plants increased soil resistance more than the biological crusts mainly by root binding overall pennisetum giganteum a deep roots plant showed a slightly better performance in controlling soil detachment than paspalum mandiocanum a shallow roots plant among them the roles of roots and litter stems of pennisetum giganteum were greater than those of paspalum mandiocanum while the role of biological crusts of paspalum mandiocanum was greater than that of pennisetum giganteum these findings highlight the significance of litter stems biological crusts and roots in controlling soil erosion and are helpful for selecting suitable grasses for vegetation recovery in alluvial fans of benggang keywords gramineous plant overland flow resistance to erosion soil and water conservation vegetation restoration 1 introduction soil detachment is defined as soil particles dislodging from the soil mass caused by rainfall or surface flow govers et al 1990 owoputi and stolte 1995 soil detachment by over flow is often considered to be the main soil erosion process wang et al 2016 the soil detachment rate is defined as the amount of sediment detached per unit area per unit of time zhang et al 2009 in the case of clear water the maximum soil detachment rate occurs which is termed the soil detachment capacity nearing et al 1991 soil detachment capacity is a key parameter in many soil erosion models such as the wepp model nearing et al 1989 therefore it is necessary to quantify the mechanisms of different factors impacting soil detachment process under different conditions soil detachment is influenced by the properties of near soil surfaces containing above and belowground factors wang et al 2014 2015 the aboveground factors that influence soil detachment mainly include the plant stems litter biological crusts and surface roughness geddes and dunkerley 1999 zavala et al 2009 while the belowground factors that impact soil detachment include the inherent characteristics of plant root traits and soil properties gyssels et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 leung et al 2015 both the above and belowground soil characteristics control the soil detachment process from overland flow regarding the aboveground characteristics a series of small dams was formed by a combination of plant stems and litter the flow velocity was reduced and the energy of overland flow was dissipated by the plant stems litter and small dams geddes and dunkerley 1999 zavala et al 2009 plant litter and its decomposition residue improve soil stability descheemaeker et al 2006 wang et al 2015 biological crusts greatly improve soil resistance and reduce soil loss because soil particles adhere to the crusts through filamentous cyanobacterial binding and bonding powell et al 2015 hossein et al 2020 biofilms produced by cyanobacteria and moss also improve the physical and chemical properties of the surface colica et al 2014 rossi and de philippis 2015 chamizo et al 2015 as the thickness of the biological crust increases the soil detachment capacity decreases wang et al 2018 surface roughness also increases as biological crust increases and reduces soil detachment al qinna and abu awwad 1998 wang et al 2018 regarding the belowground characteristics almost all soil properties e g organic matter content porosity soil texture cohesion moisture content and aggregate stability affect soil detachment nachtergaele poesen 2002 vannoppen et al 2017 for example when soil permeability increases the amount of overland flow is deducted with the increase in soil porosity wang et al 2015 as soil stability increases soil resistance to overland flow increases with the increase in aggregate stability and the amount of soil organic matter zhang et al 2009 plant root systems greatly influence soil detachment vannoppen et al 2015 khanal and fox 2017 soil detachment decreases exponentially with root density de baets poesen 2010 li et al 2015 khanal and fox 2017 and the soil resistance to overland flow erosion can be enhanced by larger numbers of roots that are less than 1 mm in diameter de baets et al 2007a leung et al 2015 roots enhance soil resistance to erosion through physical binding to soil and the bonding of exudates with plant roots de baets et al 2008 regarding the binding effect of the root system plant roots penetrate the soil during growth stabilizing the soil structure de baets et al 2006 li et al 2015 regarding the bonding effect root exudates can cause soil particles to firmly adhere to the root surface which enhances soil stability and resistance de baets et al 2006 2008 the effects of different vegetation types on soil detachment processes are different owing to their different near soil surface properties for example the development of biological crusts varies as soil moisture and temperature conditions change under different land uses which results in differences in the community coverage and thickness of biological crusts belnap 2006 wang et al 2018 soil detachment can be more effectively reduced by fibrous root plants than by tap root plants de baets poesen 2010 vannoppen et al 2017 however the relationships between soil detachment and the near soil surface properties of different plants are still unknown moreover in china studies of these relationships have been confined to the loess plateau wang et al 2014 2015 2018 li et al 2015 but studies in the red soil region are limited as the climate terrain soil and vegetation in the red soil region differ from those in the loess plateau understanding these relationships in the hilly area of the red soil region of southeast china is of great significance in southern china collapsing gullies with steep walls locally called benggang fig 1 a are widespread huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 more than 239 100 gullies are present in southern china according to a 2005 survey huang et al 2019 steep walls fail suddenly and collapsing gullies develop quickly the erosion rated in these areas exceeds 500 mg ha 1 y 1 at least 50 fold higher than that of gentler slopes jiang et al 2020 a collapsing gully generally consists of upper catchments collapsing walls and alluvial fans fig 1 a zhang et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 alluvial fans are situated below the gully mouth where sediments transported out of the channel are deposited an alluvial fan has a high coarse grain content low cohesion high erodibility and low soil fertility deng et al 2017 to effectively reduce soil loss in alluvial fans some pioneer grasses with resistance to desert conditions tenacious vitality and developed roots have been selected for planting li et al 2017 according to this investigation many grasses are suitable for growth in alluvial fans including paspalum mandiocanum pennisetum giganteum digitaria sanguinalis setaria viridis and cynodon dactylon li et al 2017 among them paspalum mandiocanum fig 1 b d and pennisetum giganteum fig 1 c e are introduced grass species with fibrous roots those are extensively planted as pioneer plants in collapsing gully areas because of their strong adaptability to poor and acidic soil conditions and their good growth at present soil shear strength and soil detachment are the main topics of research on vegetation restoration in alluvial fans li et al 2017 noted that the soil shear strength in grasslands increased with increasing biomass density jiang et al 2020 showed that root length density and soil cohesion were the most important factors in predicting soil detachment capacity the properties of the near soil surface are dependent on vegetation which impacts soil detachment due to overland flow however the impacts of litter stems biological crusts and plant roots on soil detachment have not been evaluated in alluvial fans and their roles in controlling soil detachment with vegetation planting remain unclear additionally the effects of different grass species on soil detachment likely vary however these differences are also unclear therefore the two typical grass species paspalum mandiocanum with shallow root and pennisetum giganteum with deep root were researched to meet the following objectives 1 investigate the impacts of litter stems biological crusts and roots on soil detachment and soil resistance in two grasslands 2 quantify the contributions of each near soil surface factor to prevent soil detachment and improve soil resistance and 3 compare the differences in soil detachment control and soil resistance improvement resulting from the near soil surface of the two grasses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area experiments were conducted in hetian 25 39 n 116 28 e in changting county of fujian province in southeast china hetian has a subtropical monsoon climate air temperature 18 c annual precipitation 1628 mm most of which occurs from april to september 70 the weathering of granite in the tropical environment leads to the release of quartz particles and clay minerals and the soil consists of kaolinite quartz plagioclase and k feldspar huang et al 2019 in response to rain and water runoff weathered materials on the steep slopes are prone to erosion when protective vegetation cover is lost according to a 2005 survey there were 2 266 collapsing gullies in hetian accounting for 63 of the total area of the county jiang et al 2020 2 2 grass selection two introduced grasses paspalum mandiocanum fig 1 b and pennisetum giganteum fig 1 c with fibrous roots were chosen for this research they can be used both as green manure and as pasture grass paspalum mandiocanum grows rapidly due to its tolerance to poor and acidic soil conditions paspalum mandiocanum which has shallow roots accounted for 90 of the total root distribution in the top 20 cm of the soil layer fig 1 d these plants are relatively short with a height of approximately 50 cm table 1 fig 1 b pennisetum giganteum exhibits robust tillering with a tall canopy containing erect stems it can tolerate to arid and poor soil conditions pennisetum giganteum has deep roots of approximately 80 cm fig 1 e these plants are tall with a height of approximately 2 8 m table 1 fig 1 c 2 3 sample site and treatments to reduce experimental error an alluvial fan with relatively consistent accumulated thickness slopes and soil properties was selected for the experiment fig 1 a the experimental alluvial fan was divided into three areas two of which were planted separately with paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum and one that was not planted bare land as the control a total of 3 600 plants were planted per hectare in each area and each plant was treated with 1 kg of organic fertilizer as the base fertilizer point seeding was chosen for the planting of 7 5 kg of paspalum mandiocanum seeds per hectare prior to sowing a mixture was created based on a grass seeds the organic fertilizer soil ratio of 1 50 160 by weight and subsequently sown into the holes through the equal division of the seeds post sowing the soil was covered with 2 4 cm of soil pennisetum giganteum was planted with a short stem cuttage each stem had two nodes each stem was buried in a hole and then the soil was compacted in the area surrounding the stem finnally the soil at both sites was watered until it was saturated in april 2015 the two grasses were planted in june 2015 april 2016 and june 2016 urea 60 kg per hectare was applied as a topdressing in august 2016 three representative areas were selected for investigation and sampling the basic conditions of the vegetation and the soil properties are shown in tables 1 and 2 the growth of the two grasses and their near soil surface characteristics are shown in fig 1 b e five treatments t0 t1 t2 t3 and t4 table 3 were designed to assess the potential impact of the near soil surface factors litter stems biological crusts root physical binding and root chemical bonding of the two grasses in terms of the detachment caused by overland flow as described by wang et al 2014 2015 bare land was used fort0 and each grass area was divided into four plots t1 t2 t3 and t4 for t0 the bare land soil was collected as follows the topsoil layer of the biological crust was removed with a scraper for t1 the vegetation was destroyed by spraying with atomizing pesticides glyphosate isopropylamine salt 41 agent jiangsu youthchem co ltd china using a hand sprayer staddon et al 2003 reported that the plant roots no longer released exudates 1 week after plant death and it was assumed that root exudates bonded to the soil were lost in the rhizosphere after 3 weeks after 4 weeks all plant roots died but did not decompose meaning that the soil mass was influenced by root binding alone before the test was conducted scissors were used to clip the herbage near the soil surface and a brush was used to remove plant litter the biological crusts were carefully removed and a soft brush was used to slightly brush the disturbed loose soil for t2 aboveground herbages litter and crusts were removed prior to the assessments as described in t1 only live roots were contained and the impacts of physical binding and chemical bonding by root systems were reflected for t3 plant litter and herbage were removed and crusts and plant roots were considered the total effects of biological crusts and plant roots are represented in t3 for t4 the plant leaves were cut off and the stems were kept approximately 2 cm long in this way the effects of plant litter and stems were contained in contrast to the conditions of t3 these treatments addressed the effects of litter stem biological crusts and root systems reflecting the total impact of the environment in the grassland on the detachment of soil 2 4 soil sampling the five treatment types with different vegetation types were sampled sampling methods were conducted as described in jiang et al 2020 a steel ring outer diameter 10 cm internal diameter 9 8 cm depth 5 0 cm was used to collect the soil samples the steel ring was pushed vertically into the soil for sample collection after that the soil around the ring was carefully excavated after the soil sample was collected thin iron sheets were placed on the top and bottom of the steel ring and rubber bands were used to secure the steel ring and the covers then the samples were sent back to the laboratory for scouring experiments the soil samples were collected from 9 treatments 3 flow discharges 3 slopes and 5 repetitions in each measurement area for a total of 405 samples for the scouring tests using a flume 2 5 experimental devices the experiments were performed at the laboratory of the science and technology research center for soil and water conservation of fujian agriculture and forestry university a rill flume length 4 m width 0 12 m height 0 05 m fig 2 was used to measure the soil detachment capacity which was consistent with the description of jiang et al 2020 galvanized steel sheets was used to make the flume the flume slope gradient could be adjusted from 0 to 47 to simulate slope roughness and field environments soil collected from the bare land was passed through a 5 mm sieve and evenly and smoothly adhered to the flume bed an overflow tank length 0 3 m width 0 12 m height 0 3 m was connected at the flume top peristaltic pumps were used to control the flow a storage box was installed for sample collection at a depth of 0 2 m from the lower regions of the flume diameter 10 cm depth 5 0 cm at the bottom of the box water was discharged through the holes through gravity 2 6 measurement of hydraulic parameters through field observations a maximum slope gradient of 27 was found on the alluvial fans therefore the experimental slopes were set to 9 18 and 27 according to the concentrated flow discharge generated by the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 rainstorm within 5 m2 5 m length and 1 m width 10 m2 10 m length and 1 m width and 15 m2 15 m length and 1 m width the flow discharge per unit width for each set of experiments was fixed at 1 39 10 3 2 78 10 3 and 4 17 10 3 m2 s 1 10 20 and 30 l min 1 respectively dual pumps were used to control the flow discharge surface velocities were measured using kmno4 0 8 w w within 2 m distance at the lower regions of the flume for ten repetitions when the flow stabilized a correction factor of 0 8 was used to derive the mean velocity abrahams et al 1986 and which was also used to calculate the flow depth eq 1 shear stress Ï was calculated using the flow depth and the mean flow velocity eq 2 these data are shown in table 4 2 7 soil detachment capacity tests the soil detachment capacity tests were conducted according to the methods in jiang et al 2020 before scouring the soil samples were saturated to ensure uniform soil moisture for each test then a soil sample containing a handheld steel ring was gently placed into the box at the flume bottom and plasticine was fully filled into the gap between the box and ring flume slopes and flow discharge were then adjusted and boxes were placed on a thin iron sheet for hydraulic parameter assessments the iron sheet was removed after the flow discharge stabilized a plastic bucket was used to collect the sediment at a scouring depth of 2 cm the test was stopped nearing et al 1991 if the scouring depth did not approach 2 cm the duration of scouring was set to 5 min li et al 2015 assays were performed five times following scouring the sediments were allowed to settle and the supernatants were decanted the sediments were dried in an oven using forced air conditions 105 c to achieve a constant mass prior to weighing the detachment capacity d c was calculated by dividing the dry mass post oven drying of eroded soil by the sample cross sectional area and the scouring period eq 3 five samples were averaged to assess the mean detachment capacity 2 8 data analysis flow depth h m flow shear stress Ï pa zhang et al 2009 and soil

the various grasslands k r represents the slope and Ï c represents the x axis of the regression line the equation was as follows 5 d c k r Ï Ï c 2 9 statistical analyses the data were analyzed using spss 18 0 linear regression models were used to estimate the influence of shear stress on soil detachment and the fitness was evaluated by their determination coefficient or significance coefficient a homoscedasticity test was performed to determine whether the data were homogeneous p 0 05 one way anova with the lsd test p 0 05 was employed for the assessment of mean soil detachment capacity and reduction in the soil detachment capacity following each treatment in the grasslands origin 8 0 and excel 2010 were used to construct all graphs 3 results 3 1 soil detachment capacity following each treatment in different grasslands the soil detachment capacity indicated great differences among the treatments in different grasslands fig 3 bare land had the maximum mean soil detachment capacity which was 0 163 kg m 2 s 1 fig 3 the mean soil detachment capacity of each treatment in paspalum mandiocanum land ranged from 0 00096 to 0 0099 kg m 2 s 1 with an average value of 0 0055 kg m 2 s 1 in all treatments and in pennisetum giganteum land it ranged from 0 00035 to 0 0082 kg m 2 s 1 with an average value of 0 0043 kg m 2 s 1 in all treatments plant litter stems biological crusts and roots weakened the flow energy to scour soil particles for paspalum mandiocanum the average soil detachment capacity of dead roots t1 and live roots t2 was lower than that of the bare land 40 and 48 respectively upon imposing the biological crust and live root treatment t3 and the litter stem biological crust and live root treatment t4 the average soil detachment capacities of t3 and t4 were 85 and 94 respectively which were lower than that of bare land t0 the impacts of the soil surface on the soil detachment in the pennisetum giganteum land were more obvious than the impacts on soil detachment in the paspalum mandiocanum land for pennisetum giganteum upon the superimposition of t1 t2 t3 and t4 the mean soil detachment capacity were 51 63 83 and 98 respectively which were lower than that of bare land fig 3 litter stems biological crusts and roots improved the soil resistance to scour by overflow and reduced the soil detachment capacity compared to bare land the average reduction of detachment for each factor varied in the grasslands fig 4 the average values of soil detachment reduction for each factor varied from 0 0013 to 0 0080 kg m 2 s 1 in paspalum mandiocanum land and varied from 0 0019 to 0 010 m 2 s 1 in pennisetum giganteum land and the order of reduction was total roots root binding biological crust litter stems root bonding the reduction in soil detachment caused by the indicated factors litter stems roots in the pennisetum giganteum land was 4 to 33 greater than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 4 however the soil detachment capacity reductions caused by the biological crust in the pennisetum giganteum land was 50 lower than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 4 3 2 contributions of each factor in the different grasslands the contributions of different near soil surface factors differed in the two grasslands for the paspalum mandiocanum land the soil detachment capacity reduced by 94 compared to that for the bare land soil and the contributions by litter stems biological crusts and plant roots were 9 37 and 48 respectively fig 5 the contribution from roots was 4 30 and 0 30 fold higher than that from litter stems and biological crusts respectively fig 5 for the pennisetum giganteum land soil detachment declined by 98 compared to that for the that in bare land with decreases of 15 20 and 63 due to litter stems biological crusts and roots respectively the contributions from roots were 3 20 and 2 15 fold greater than those from the litter stems or biological crusts respectively the above results demonstrated that roots biological crusts litter stems contributed to the soil detachment capacity in terms of the total contribution of plant roots physical binding reduced detachment 40 and 51 for the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively more than chemical bonding 8 and 12 for the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively comparing the two grasslands the contribution of litter stems to soil detachment reduction in the pennisetum giganteum land was 1 67 times greater than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land roots physical binding and chemical bonding in the pennisetum giganteum land contributed 63 51 and 12 to the reduction in soil detachment respectively which exceeded the contributions observed in the paspalum mandiocanum land 48 40 and 8 respectively however the contribution of biological crusts in the paspalum mandiocanum land was approximately 82 higher than that in the pennisetum giganteum land 3 3 soil resistance in different grasslands the impacts of each near soil surface factor on soil resistance varied in the two grasslands for all test treatments the soil detachment capacity displayed a linear relationship with shear stress p 0 01 r 2 0 86 table 7 rill erodibility k r and critical shear stress Ïc for each treatment were calculated using a linear model eq 5 nearing et al 1989 in samples with litter stems soil detachment was not reduced by the change in soil properties so the k r and Ïc of soil samples with litter stems were not discussed k r and Ïc for the other treatments are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively rill erodibility k r declined in the absence of vegetation bare land when each of the indicated treatments was superimposed fig 6 for the paspalum mandiocanum land the k r of each treatment was between 0 0005 and 0 0018 s m 1 k r under t1 dead roots was largest at 0 0018 s m 1 followed by that for the soil samples under t2 live roots 0 0017 s m 1 and the soil samples under t3 biological crusts and live roots 0 0005 s m 1 these values were reduced by 40 43 and 83 respectively compared to that of bare land t0 0 0030 s m 1 root binding root bonding and biological crusts decreased rill erodibility by 40 3 and 40 respectively this suggests that physical binding effects and biological crusts significantly decrease soil rill erodibility while the effect of root bonding on reducing soil rill erodibility is relatively weak this result was also confirmed for the pennisetum giganteum grassland where root binding root bonding and biological crusts decreased rill erodibility by 50 10 and 20 respectively comparing the two grass species the k r in pennisetum giganteum land with dead roots t1 and live roots t2 was 83 and 71 respectively that in paspalum mandiocanum land the ability of biological crusts to reduce rill erodibility by 20 in pennisetum giganteum land was less than that 40 in paspalum mandiocanum land fig 7 shows that the critical shear stress Ïc for the different treatments significantly differed with that of paspalum mandiocanum land being between 0 59 and 1 25 pa these values are all higher than that of bare land 0 31 pa the soil samples containing live roots t2 had the largest critical shear stress 1 25 pa followed by the soil samples containing live roots and biological crusts t3 1 13 pa and the soil samples containing dead roots t1 0 59 pa these Ïc values increased 2 03 2 66 and 0 92 fold respectively compared to that of the bare land this finding was also confirmed for the pennisetum giganteum land where Ïc increased by 3 34 2 05 and 1 25 fold respectively compared to that of the bare land the above results show that dead roots live roots and biological crusts can significantly increase the soil critical shear stress upon comparison of the grass species the Ïc of soil samples containing dead roots t1 and live roots t2 in the pennisetum giganteum land was 1 17 and 1 08 times respectively that of the soil samples in paspalum mandiocanum land however Ïc of soil samples containing biological crusts and live roots t3 in the pennisetum giganteum land was lower than that of soil samples in the paspalum mandiocanum land 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of near soil surface factors of two plants on soil detachment the hydraulic flume results confirm that the near soil surface factors after the restoration of vegetation are very effective in reducing erosion in bare land in this study the contribution of pennisetum giganteum to reducing the soil d c by 98 was slightly larger than that of paspalum mandiocanum by 94 previous studies also reported that the restoration of vegetation in bare land could effectively control soil erosion in a short time katuwal et al 2013 showed that soil erosion was reduced by about 75 after four weeks of planting lolium perenne in a loamy soil zhang et al 2020 noted that after 8 months of planting chrysopogon zizanioides soil sediment yield rate on steep colluvial deposits of southeast china decreased by 86 6 wang et al 2015 reported that the total reduction in soil detachment of the 1 yr old grassland was 98 1 of that of bare land in the loess plateau of china due to the differences between the two vegetation types in the properties of litter stems biological crusts and roots the contributions of different factors controlling soil detachment are different in this study the order of contribution to reduction of soil detachment in the two grasslands was roots biological crust litter stems fig 5 however previous studies reported that canopies have the strongest effects on reducing soil erosion katuwal et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 and other studies noted that the influence of biological crusts on reducing soil erosion is the least wang et al 2014 2015 the above indicates that the impacts of near soil surface factors on reducing soil erosion are closely related to vegetation types roots played the most important role in reducing soil detachment in our study reduced by 63 and 48 in pennisetum giganteum land paspalum mandiocanum land respectively which is consistent with previous studies gyssels et al 2005 showed that roots are at least as important as canopy covers for rill erosion mamo and bubenzer 2001 found that the soil detachment for soils with roots was reduced to 64 of that for fallow soils the grass root system can enhance soil stability through root binding de baets et al 2008 li et al 2017 additionally root exudates strongly adhere to soil through intermolecular bonding van der waals forces in the rhizosphere and biochemical interactions between the plant roots and soil de baets et al 2007a de baets et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 therefore the contributions of root binding and boding are different in terms of the total contribution of plant roots in our study more than 80 in the two grasslands was contributed by the effect of root binding many researchers have also noted that the effects of roots on reducing soil loss mainly depend on root physics binding katuwal et al 2013 wang et al 2014 roots physical binding and chemical bonding in pennisetum giganteum land contributed 63 51 and 12 to the reduction in soil detachment respectively which exceeded the contributions observed in paspalum mandiocanum land 48 40 and 8 respectively these differences can be explained by the more highly developed roots of pennisetum giganteum as table 1 shows the root mass density in the topsoil of pennisetum giganteum is 3 times that of paspalum mandiocanum previous studies have also shown that soil detachment rates decrease with increasing root density de baets et al 2006 de baets poesen 2010 vannoppen et al 2017 the contribution of biological crust to reducing soil detachment was second in our study reduced by 20 and 37 in pennisetum giganteum land and paspalum mandiocanum land respectively hossein et al 2020 also noted that cyanobacteria could reduce the soil loss by 36 to 57 in comparison with those recorded for the control knapen et al 2007 noted that biological crusts could decrease soil loss by 79 and 37 for moss and crusts with dominated algae respectively a biological crust covering on the soil surface can prevent detachment by flow rossi and de philippis 2015 hossein et al 2017 filamentous cyanobacteria bind and bond to soil particles that are sufficiently intact and are not be removed thus causing a reduction in soil loss dabney et al 1993 powell et al 2015 hossein et al 2020 moreover soil particles are absorbed by moss well and are hardly washed away by water flow knapen et al 2007 wang et al 2015 third biological crust controlled soil detachment by overland flow via soil property improvement including the organic matter content soil texture aggregate stability and cohesion nachtergaele poesen 2002 vannoppen et al 2017 the contribution of biological crusts in the paspalum mandiocanum land was 1 82 times as much as that in the pennisetum giganteum land this difference may be attributed to the community of biological crusts in the two lands fig 8 there are many mosses in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 8a but very little in the pennisetum giganteum land fig 8b bowker 2007 showed that the growth of biological crusts is inversely proportional to the plant litter biomass and decreases as the plant canopy closes as shown in table 1 the average dry mass of shoot biomass and crown breadth in the paspalum mandiocanum land were 10 and 54 of those in pennisetum giganteum land hence there are less litter and canopy closure in paspalum mandiocanum land resulting in better growth in biological crusts in the paspalum mandiocanum land moss adsorbs to the soil surface well and is hardly washed away by overland flow litter stems have the least effect on reducing soil detachment in our study reduced by 15 and 9 in pennisetum giganteum land paspalum mandiocanum land respectively but their impacts cannot be neglected precious studies also have reported that litter stems contributed more than 30 on soil loss wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 a series of composite dams or barriers were formed by the combination of litter and stems in the erosion process which significantly increased their impact on flow velocity suggesting that the kinetic energy and shearing force of the flow were dissipated geddes and dunkerley 1999 zavala et al 2009 the contribution of litter stems to soil detachment reduction in the pennisetum giganteum land was 77 greater than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land this difference occurred because the biomass of pennisetum giganteum is high as shown in table 1 the average dry mass of shoot biomass in the pennisetum giganteum land was 9 33 fold greater as that in the paspalum mandiocanum land therefore there is more litter on the soil surface in the pennisetum giganteum land in addition the stem of pennisetum giganteum is thicker fig 1e meaning that the stem has a stronger blocking effect on water flow 4 2 impacts of near soil surface factors of two plants on soil resistance the near soil surface factors of biological crusts and plant roots also have a significant impact on the soil resistance to erosion by flow rill erodibility k r showed an increasing order with the factors of live roots and biological crusts t3 live roots t2 dead roots t1 successively superimposed fig 7 the reduction in k r by roots was 43 and 60 in the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively many studies have reported that roots decrease soil erodibility by increasing soil stability and shear strength mamo and bubenzer 2001 katuwal et al 2013 roots promote the stability of soil aggregates through physical entanglement root exudates organic matter release and rhizosphere microbial activity increase due to the presences of roots gale et al 2000 tisdall and oades 1982 shear strength may be related to a similar bonding mechanism soil organic matter exudates in the rhizosphere and by products from microbes in the aggregation process fattet et al 2011 the root physical effects can also increase the shear strength in which the root fibers transfer the shear stress in the soil matrix to the tensile strength of the fiber inclusions gyssels et al 2005 de baets et al 2008 therefore the wepp model had taken into account the effect of roots on rill erodibility and the adjustments to rill erodibility for roots were adopted by a negative exponential equation alberts et al 1995 root bonding decreased rill erodibility by 3 and 10 in the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively which were much lower than those by root binding 40 and 50 this suggests that the root bonding effect on reducing the soil erodibility is relatively weak this was because the grasses were planted for one more year and the soil organic matter rhizosphere exudates and microbial products by roots are relatively few the k r in the pennisetum giganteum land with dead roots t1 and live roots t2 was 84 and 67 respectively that in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 6 this can again be explained by the higher root development in pennisetum giganteum that stabilizes the root system as table 1 shows the root mass density in the topsoil of pennisetum giganteum is 3 times that of paspalum mandiocanum furthermore the root diameter of pennisetum giganteum an average root diameter of 0 33 mm is greater than that of paspalum mandiocanum an average root diameter of 0 26 mm which results in the pennisetum giganteum land having more tensile resistance and less erodibility khanal and fox 2017 noted that the erodibility decreased with root diameter increasing by power function biological crusts reduce k r by 40 and 20 compared to bare land in the paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum lands respectively this is because not only do biological crusts form a coherent living covering the soil surface but also residual organic matter and filaments combine with soil particles underneath the surface crust which strongly enhances soil shear strength and stability belnap 2006 algayer et al 2014 stanchi et al 2015 chamizo et al 2015 the ability of biological crusts to reduce rill erodibility in the pennisetum giganteum land was less than that in the paspalum mandiocanum land fig 6 this is because pennisetum giganteum land has fewer biological crusts especially moss than paspalum mandiocanum land fig 8 resulting in a relatively lower effect of biological crusts adsorbing to the soil surface hence there was a weaker reduction in rill erodibility in pennisetum giganteum land when the shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress soil detachment occurs nearing et al 1989 the critical shear stress Ïc of the near soil surface factors was higher than that in bare land t0 and exhibited a descending order with live roots t2 live roots and biological crusts t3 and dead roots t1 successively superimposed fig 7 among them the Ïc in the soil sample containing biological crusts and live roots t3 was lower than that in the soil sample containing live roots t2 this may be because the content of coarse particles in the test soil was high and the stability of the surface crust was relatively poor so the particles were easy to detach from the soil mass upon comparison of the grass species the Ïc of soil samples containing live roots t2 and dead roots t1 in the pennisetum giganteum land was 1 08 and 1 17 times respectively that of the soil samples in the paspalum mandiocanum land the reason for this difference was that the roots of pennisetum giganteum were more developed than those of paspalum mandiocanum however Ïc of soil samples containing biological crusts and live roots t3 in the pennisetum giganteum land was lower than that of soil samples in the paspalum mandiocanum land again explained by the differences in the community of biological crusts and fewer moss in the pennisetum giganteum land fig 8b resulting in a relatively weak adsorption to the soil surface furthermore the surface of pennisetum giganteum land is smoother due to less moss hence lower critical shear stresse is required to start detachment of soil particles knapen et al 2007 also pointed out that moss could increase the critical shear stress more effectively than algae and bare soil and liu et al 2016 found that critical shear stress increased with increasing moss coverage 5 conclusions the near soil surface properties of paspalum mandiocanum and pennisetum giganteum can significantly reduce soil detachment and improve soil resistance to erosion on alluvial fans of benggang under our test conditions roots had the strongest effect on the control of soil detachment which mainly depended on root binding the influence of biological crusts was greater than that of litter stems besides roots also reduced rill erodibility and increased critical shear stress more than the biological crusts mainly by root binding pennisetum giganteum with deep roots exhibited slightly better performance in reducing soil detachment compared to paspalum mandiocanum with shallow roots moreover roots and litter stems of pennisetum giganteum were more effective in controlling soil detachment than those of paspalum mandiocanum while the biological crusts of pennisetum giganteum were less effective than those of paspalum mandiocanum in a word these two grass species that can greatly improve the near soil surface properties and are beneficial to control soil erosion of alluvial fans are worthy of further promotion in soil and water conservation in the area of collapsing gully furthermore the mechanisms of soil surface characteristics controlling soil erosion with more plant species require further

corradini editor in chief with the assistance of vincent e a post associate editor hydraulic conductivity profiles hcps are of crucial importance for 3 dimensional flow and transport groundwater models easy and inexpensive methods for the estimation of such profiles increase their availability and strengthen the efficiency of the models in this study a method is presented which combines the electrical resistivity er measured over the depth of the aquifer in a borehole and the response of the aquifer to the short duration pumping from the borehole the hydraulic conductivity profile is calculated from the kozeny carman equation in which the profiles of the porosity and the mean grain size mgs are required porosity is calculated from archie s law using the intrinsic formation factor which results from the er mgs is calculated from the porosity using a relationship between them the initial form of this relationship is obtained from literature data and is then adjusted to the conditions of each particular case the adjustment is achieved by calibrating a modflow based groundwater model so that it sufficiently simulates the temporal variation of the water level measured in the borehole during the short pumping the method is applied to the estimation of the hcp in an unconsolidated alluvial aquifer in greece the sensitivity of the results to the parameters and assumptions used in the method is investigated and discussed keywords hydraulic conductivity profile electrical resistivity log grain size porosity relationship pumping test groundwater model modflow 1 introduction for detailed simulations of flow and transport in aquifers the 3 dimensional distribution of the hydraulic conductivity is important the latter can be approximated by using the hydraulic conductivity profiles hcps estimated at characteristic locations in the aquifer the methods to estimate hcps can be grouped in those using a the grain size distribution of the cutting material removed from the borehole by the drilling fluid or of samples taken at different depths see driscoll 1987 b experiments as for instance slug tests performed at different depths during the drilling of the borehole batu 1998 medici et al 2019a b and c single borehole measurements in completed boreholes as flowmeter measurements see hufschmied 1983 molz et al 1989 kaleris et al 1995 clemo 2010 multilevel slug tests see melville et al 1991 chen et al 2012 gellasch et al 2013 lo et al 2014 medici et al 2016 medici et al 2018 forced gradient tracer tests see molz et al 1988 ptak and teutsch 1994 and nuclear magnetic resonance ren et al 2019 the methods above some of which are appropriate both for porous as well as for fractured aquifers and which have proven their worth in practical applications are time consuming and costly causing that hcps required in groundwater models are mostly in a limited measure available the analogy between electric current and groundwater flow and the fact that electrical resistivity er measurements in boreholes are relatively easy and cheap see huntley 1986 slater and lesmes 2002 has encouraged the attempts of hydrogeologists to use such measurements to qualitatively assess the permeability k m2 or the hydraulic conductivity kf m s over the depth of alluvial and glacial deposits for decades k and kf are related according to equation 1 k f kg Î½ where g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity and Î½ m2 s the kinematic viscosity er measurements are performed before the installation of the casing in the borehole and while the borehole is still filled with the drilling fluid due to their effectiveness in determining the resistivity contrasts that appear between clay rich low permeability deposits and clay poor high permeability deposits er measurements are used to place the well screens in the most desirable position and are suggested as an integral part of the well construction process driscoll 1987 beyond this qualitative use of the resistivity logs attempts have been made to relate the electrical resistivity with the hydraulic properties of the aquifer archie 1942 found that the porosity Ï is related with the intrinsic formation factor fi which is defined as the ratio of the resistivity ro of clay free porous materials saturated with an electrolyte to the bulk resistivity of the electrolyte rw i e 2 f i r o r w archie s law is commonly expressed in the form see winsauer et al 1952 3 f i a Ï m where m is the cementation factor see glover 2016 and Î± is a parameter whose theoretical value is equal to 1 but practically it differs from this value due to the fact that it compensates systematic errors in the data from which it is estimated glover 2016 owing to the fact that respective generally valid relationships between formation factor and permeability do not exist electrical resistivity measurements can be useful for the estimation of the permeability in cases that the correlation between the latter and the porosity is significant investigations of detmer 1995 and morin et al 2010 in specific environments showed that the aforementioned correlation is weak on the other hand the relationships of kozeny and carman cited in bear 1972 and these of berg and van baaren cited in nelson 1994 in which permeability is proportional to the square of the grain size times porosity raised to a power and times a sorting parameter was found to provide results compatible with data in this study we use the relationship of kozeny and carman which is see bear 1972 4 k d m 2 180 Ï 3 1 Ï 2 with dm m the mean grain size the relationship is based on the concept of the capillary tubes predicts fairly well the saturated permeability of most soils and is widely used in the literature chapuis and aubertin 2003 equation 4 along with eqs 1 2 and 3 have already been used in rahman et al 2008 khalil et al 2011 khalil and santos 2013 and asfahani 2017 to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in these studies dm is considered to be constant over the depth of the aquifer however in cases where the electrical resistivity and consequently the porosity vary over the aquifer depth the assumption that dm is constant is a significant simplification the estimation of the variability of dm over the depth of an aquifer requires particular investigations which in many cases are not available Î± possibility to incorporate the dm variation in the estimation of hcps is to use relationships of the form 5 d m f Ï such relationships have been presented in the literature see for instance davis 1969 page 84 de marsily 1986 page 36 houston et al 2011 however they are not of general validity since porosity does not depend only on the mean grain size but also on the shape of the grains the nature of packing and the grain size distribution of the materials for which the relationships have been developed see biella et al 1983 therefore relationships such as those mentioned above can be used in estimations of hcps only if they can be appropriately adjusted in each particular case in this study is shown that this adjustment can be achieved by using electrical resistivity measurements performed over the depth of a borehole and a groundwater model for the simulation of the temporal variation of the groundwater level measured in the borehole during a pumping test of short duration the method which is exclusively applied in porous aquifers is presented in section 2 the available data for the boreholes in the unconsolidated alluvial aquifer of glafkos river in western greece see fig 1 where the method has been applied are presented in section 3 the numerical model is presented in section 4 the results and their sensitivity to the assumptions used in the analysis are discussed in section 5 a summary and the conclusions drawn from the investigation are presented in section 6 2 methodology and assumptions the procedure for the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity at all the locations i over the depth of the borehole where the electrical resistivity er has been measured contains two parts in the first one part a the borehole is divided in a number of sections referred to hereafter as layers and the hydraulic conductivity for each of them is estimated by manually calibrating a groundwater model in the second part part b the hydraulic conductivity at all the locations i see above is calculated from the hydraulic conductivity of the layers 2 1 part a estimation of the hydraulic conductivity of the layers that are determined in the aquifer this part of the procedure is schematically presented in fig 2 and its particular steps are explained in the following step a the intrinsic formation factor fi see eq 2 is estimated at all the locations i using er measurements performed with electrodes of two different distances and gamma ray gr measurements the detailed procedure of the fi estimation is described in section 3 2 after the aforementioned electro log measurements have been presented step b by combining information from the cutting log see section 3 2 and the vertical variation of the formation factor fi estimated in step a the layers of the aquifer used in the analysis are determined each of them corresponds to a vertical section of the borehole in which i according to the cutting log the grain size and the clay content of the material do not change significantly and ii the formation factor does not exhibit considerable variations as a rule of thumb according to which the variation of fi is considered to be not significant the following condition is used 6 f j 3 s d f i f j 3 s d where f j is the mean and sd the standard deviation of the fi values in the layer j step c from the f j values see above and eq 3 with appropriate values for the parameters Î± and m used in it the porosity Ïj of the layers is calculated for the parameter a the widely used value a 1 see also section 1 has been applied the value of the cementation factor m depends on the degree of the aquifer consolidation for unconsolidated aquifers as the alluvial aquifer investigated in this study m values from 1 3 to 1 5 are proposed in the literature see archie 1942 frohlich 1974 urish 1981 kwader 1985 morin 2006 niwas and celik 2012 here both aforementioned m values are investigated in order to evaluate their effect on the resulting hcp step d for the estimation of the layer mean grain size dmj the selection of the form of eq 5 is required as initial form are proposed eqs 7 see below that have been presented in the literature which in each particular case have to be subsequently adjusted fig 3 shows i a curve presented by houston et al 2011 ii data presented by cohen 1965 cited also in davis 1969 page 84 and iii a curve presented by castany cited in de marsily 1986 page 36 and in huysmans and dassargues 2005 the equation for the curve of houston et al 2011 approximated by a 3rd degree polynomial is 7a log d m 2 325 0 080 Ï 9 429 10 5 Ï 2 7 576 10 6 Ï 3 in order to derive corresponding equations from the data of cohen 1965 and the curve of castany both data sets have been supplemented in the area of low porosities less than 27 and 28 respectively in which values are missing by using corresponding values from the curve of houston et al 2011 the equations resulting by approximating the supplemented data sets of cohen and castany by 3rd degree polynomials are eq 7b and eq 7c respectively 7b log d m 2 275 0 095 Ï 1 800 10 3 Ï 2 2 808 10 5 Ï 3 7c log d m 4 105 0 343 Ï 0 012 Ï 2 1 923 10 4 Ï 3 a further equation providing a relationship between porosity and mean grain size has been presented by salem 2001 this equation is not considered here since it does not provide significantly different results than the equations above in this study each of the three forms of equation 7 has been used as an initial relationship from which a modified one see eq 7 in step g below is estimated that is appropriate for the calculation of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers the final form of the porosity mgs relationship is estimated in step b of section 2 2 in which the estimation of the hc at all the locations i is presented the effect of the three different forms of equation 7 on the resulting hcp is discussed in section 5 step e using the values of the layer variables Ïj and dmj estimated in steps c and d the layer hydraulic conductivity kfj is calculated from eqs 1 and 4 step f the kfj profile is used as input in a modflow groundwater model harbaugh et al 2000 which concerns the saturated zone of the aquifer around the borehole and is built according to langevin 2008 for the simulation of axisymmetric flows see section 4 the model is manually calibrated in order to appropriately simulate the temporal variation of the water level in the borehole during the pumping test the calibration of the model is used for the adjustment of the porosity mgs relationship see step d for this purpose the model is executed the complete data set used for the simulations is described in section 4 2 and the simulated time series of the water level in the borehole for the pumping and the recovery period of the short duration pumping test is compared with that measured step g if the agreement between the two time series is not satisfactory eq 7 is adjusted see also section 1 since for the model calibration only the measured drawdown in the borehole is available an adjustment is possible only for one of the coefficients in eq 7 here the logdm intercept in eq 7 is modified mostly reduced after each calibration run and the steps d e and f are repeated until a good agreement is achieved the hydraulic conductivity resulting from the calibration for each aquifer layer j is hereafter characterized as kfj calibr it should be noted that through the modification of the logdm intercept the modified eq 7 which is hereafter characterized as eq 7 is shifted toward smaller dm values compared to the initial ones equation 7 is valid for all the aquifer layers similarly as the initial eq 7 however dm in eq 7 is not referred to an actual grain size the reason is that this dm results by matching the porosity values to grain sizes obtained by shifting eq 7 through the model calibration since however dm in eq 7 is correlated to the porosity similarly as in eq 7 in which porosity and grain size are actual values for definite porous materials used for the derivation of eq 7 dm in eq 7 is here considered as a replacement grain size for the investigated aquifer this grain size is considered to incorporate the effect of all the factors determining the aquifer porosity i e the mean grain size the shape of the grains the nature of packing and the grain size distribution biella et al 1983 2 2 part b estimation of the hydraulic conductivity at all the locations i where the electrical resistivity has been measured for this purpose the values of the hydraulic conductivity kfj calibr which resulted from the model calibration have been used the following procedure is applied step a utilizing the values of the formation factor fi at all the locations i in a layer j step a in section 2 1 and eqs 3 and 7 the porosities Ïi and the dmi values are calculated from them the hydraulic conductivity values kfi at all the locations i are obtained using eqs 1 and 4 step b the mean of the kfi values in each layer j which is hereafter characterized as k fi j is calculated in general is k fi j kfj calibr this is due to the fact that kfj calibr is calculated from the mean values of the intrinsic formation factor in each layer see step b in section 2 1 whereas k fi j is the mean of the kfi values calculated from the fi values at the different locations i in a layer the differences between k fi j and kfj calibr must be eliminated since otherwise the kfi values are not compatible with the results of the calibration for this purpose the porosity mgs relationship eq 7 for each aquifer layer has to be appropriately modified this is achieved by multiplying the dmi values for which equation 7 is valid by the factor k f j c a l i b r k fi j from these new dmi values and the porosity values for which eq 7 is valid is derived a new equation characterized hereafter as eq 7 by fitting a 3rd degree polynomial this is the final porosity mgs relationship that is valid for the particular layer for which it has been calculated in contrast to eq 7 which is an approximation for the whole depth of the aquifer using eq 7 and the Ïi values step a new dmi values are calculated and from them the final kfi values are obtained that the mean of the new kfi values in each layer is equal to that obtained from the model calibration can be shown by taking into consideration that the hydraulic conductivity k fi j of a layer is related with the kfi values in the layer according to eq 9 9 k fi j 1 m i 1 m d mi 2 180 Ï i 3 1 Ï i 2 where m is the number of the locations in a layer j at which kfi has been calculated replacing in eq 9 dmi with its value multiplied by k f j c a l i b r k fi j results k fi j kfj calibr 3 test site data and processing 3 1 the test site the method described above has been applied in the coastal aquifer of glafkos river fig 1a an important alluvial groundwater reservoir for the water supply of the city of patras the third largest city of greece the area of the aquifer is about 25 km2 for the systematic monitoring of the temporal variation of the groundwater level a network of seven observation wells see fig 1b has been installed the area in which the observation wells are located is not influenced by saltwater intrusion see ziogas 2013 ziogas and kaleris 2019 the depth of the boreholes varies from 80 m to 120 m and their diameter is 12 the penetration of the boreholes into the saturated zone of the alluvial aquifer which consists of mixtures of coarse and fine gravel sand and clay varies from about 50 m to 90 m depending on the elevation of the borehole locations and the groundwater level during drilling cutting logs for all the boreholes have been recorded after the completion of drilling and while the boreholes were still filled with the drilling mud the following electro logs usually applied in porous aquifers have been recorded in each of them a gamma ray gr b spontaneous potential sp c short normal er log and d long normal er log in the short normal device which is hereafter characterized as 16nr the separation distance of the electrodes is 16 or 406 mm whereas in the long normal which is hereafter characterized as 64nr the separation distance of the electrodes is 64 or 1630 mm the casing which has been installed in the boreholes after the completion of the logs has a diameter of 6 and is screened in the sections where according to the cutting logs and the interpretation of the er logs see above the alluvial aquifer exhibits high hydraulic conductivity the space between the casing and the edge of the drilled hole was filled with gravel whose grain size varies from 2 mm to 5 mm after the installation of the casing the boreholes have been developed by using the air lift method see driscoll 1987 for removing the drilling mud from the gravel pack and the part of the aquifer in the immediate surroundings of the boreholes subsequently pumping with a constant rate has been applied in each borehole for about three to five hours and the water level in the borehole has been recorded after pumping ceased the recovery of the water level has been recorded as well in this study we present the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity profile for the borehole g4 see fig 1b which exhibits the largest penetration depth into the saturated zone of the alluvial aquifer about 93 m some preliminary results for the boreholes in glafkos aquifer have already been presented in ziogas 2013 and kaleris and ziogas 2015 3 2 data and processing fig 4 shows the cutting log the building up of the borehole and the electro logs in the saturated zone of the alluvial aquifer at the location g4 see fig 1b the vertical resolution of the electro logs is 0 20 m the cutting log fig 4a shows that the aquifer is comprised of alternating layers which are mixtures of coarse gravel fine gravel sand and clay clay layers do not exist thus the sp log adds little to the investigation see driscoll 1987 page 189 and therefore it is not presented in fig 4 the screens are positioned in the lower part of the borehole fig 4b for the estimation of the formation factor the short normal resistivity log is used as it ensures a higher resolution of the formation than the long normal one the reason is that because of the relatively short distance between the electrodes of the short normal device compared to the borehole diameter mainly the zone around the borehole which is invaded by the drilling mud is scanned see driscoll 1987 pages 184 185 the electrolyte with which this part of the formation is saturated is a mixture of the drilling mud and the formation water see schneider 1973 page 304 driscoll 1987 page 183 and is characterized as the mud filtrate lamont 1957 fig 4c shows that the gamma ray values recorded in the borehole are smaller than 35 api units although this indicates that the formation is clean i e its clay or silt content is not significant see ellis and singrer 2008 page 30 the clearness of the parts of the aquifer exhibiting the higher gr values has been investigated by using the method of worthington 1993 the procedure applied is presented in appendix a the profile of the intrinsic formation factor fi is shown in fig 4f along with the values of the apparent formation factor for the definition see appendix a in the non clean areas the thickness of the latter areas is small as indicates also the gr log fig 4c from the profile of the fi values nine aquifer layers see section 2 step b characterized by different mean values f j of the formation factor in them are defined see fig 4g the f j values of the layers satisfy eq 6 the comparison of the fig 4a and g show that sections with higher f j values correspond well to sections consisting of coarser material see also kwader 1985 morin 2006 4 numerical simulation of the short duration pumping test in borehole g4 for the estimation of the aquifer layers hydraulic conductivity 4 1 establishment of the groundwater model in order to minimize run time and output data size the radially symmetric flow has been simulated by using a two dimensional cross sectional aquifer model as proposed by langevin 2008 the model uses the modflow 2000 code harbaugh et al 2000 and adjusts several input parameters to account for the increase in flow area with radial distance from the borehole more precisely adjustments are made to all input values used in equations that contain an area or volume for instance the conductance along the model rows the vertical conductance and the specific storage see langevin 2008 it should be noted that the temporal variation of the water level in the borehole reached after some time of pumping the quasi steady state see below this enables the approximation of the unknown aquifer layers hydraulic conductivity by steady state simulations however in this study a transient model has been used since it allows checking the overall validity of the model also in refer to its efficiency in simulating the pumping test with reasonable values of the aquifer storage parameters the width of the 2d cross section i e the model dimension perpendicular to the cross section was set equal to 1 langevin 2008 this dimension is characterized hereafter as the width of the rows the length axis of the model is horizontal and is directed from the well axis to the model outer boundary the length of the first column corresponds to the inner radius of the borehole casing and is set equal to that i e 7 62 cm see section 3 the second model column corresponds to the wall of the casing pipe the subsequent six columns from the third to eighth correspond to the gravel pack and the columns from nine to 36 to the aquifer to simulate the steep hydraulic gradient in the proximity of the casing pipe a length equal to 3 of the width radius of the casing pipe is assigned to the column adjacent to the casing Ïhe length of the next columns expanded radially as multiples of 1 5 this places the center of the last column of the model the 36th column at a radial distance of 575 m the model was vertically discretized in 57 layers in the area of the well screens the vertical discretization is denser than in the other areas concerning the temporal discretization we use for the pumping period whose duration is 180 min an initial time step Î´t0 2 1 10 6 min the length of the next time steps increase as multiples of 1 09 for the recovery period whose duration is about 60 min the initial time step is Î´t0 2 10 2 min and each of the next increases by a factor 1 1 this temporal discretization ensures the proper simulation of the fast change of the hydraulic head at the beginning both of the pumping and the recovery period the upper and the lower boundaries of the model are no flow boundaries the flow in the aquifer is unconfined the outer model column in the opposite side of the well column 2d cross sectional model was set as a constant head boundary with a value equal to the groundwater level measured prior to the beginning of the pumping test the distance of this boundary from the well column see above ensures that the boundary does not affect the head drop around the well see ziogas 2013 the pumping of the water from the well at a rate of 15 m3 h is assigned to the lowermost cell of the borehole column while the simulator apportioned inflow to the borehole across the screened part of the casing halford 1997 the time series of the hydraulic head measured in the borehole during the 180 min pumping time and the 60 min recovery time are the observations which have been compared with the simulated heads in the borehole column for the calibration of the transient model the calibration consisted in the adjustment of the porosity mgs relationship and particularly of the value of the logdm intercept in eq 7 see step g in section 2 1 and fig 2 the adjustment is conducted manually with the purpose to reduce the deviations between the simulated time series of the water level in the borehole and the time series measured in it during the pumping and the recovery period of the performed test due to the significant influence of the logdm intercept in eq 7 on the resulting hydraulic conductivity of the defined aquifer layers a small number of trials was required for the calibration 4 2 hydraulic properties in the different model areas 4 2 1 the gravel pack for the hydraulic conductivity of the gravel pack kf grav is assumed that the mean grain size of the material is 3 5 mm see section 3 1 and the porosity is 23 see fig 1 the groundwater temperature during the period of the investigation was 15 c thus from eqs 1 and 3 results kf gravel 1000 m d the gravel pack is assumed to be isotropic the specific yield sy gravel is assumed to be equal to the gravel pack porosity i e sy gravel 0 23 the specific storativity is calculated from the equation s s g r a v Ï g Î± Ï Î² where Î± and Î² are the compressibility of the porous material and the water respectively with Î± 1 10 9 m2 n and Î² 4 4 10 10 m2 n see freeze and cherry 1979 page 59 and is Ï the water density the resulting value is s s grav 1 1 10 5 m 1 the values above which have been used in the investigation are the most reliable estimates of the gravel pack parameters in order to assess the effect of their uncertainties on the estimation of the hcp a sensitivity analysis is performed in section 5 2 4 2 2 the wall and the interior of the casing pipe the cells of the model which represent the wall of the casing pipe second model column are considered to be inactive except of those corresponding to the screened parts of the casing see fig 3b for these parts the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be equal to that of the gravel pack the interior of the casing pipe first model column is simulated as porous medium with high hydraulic conductivity halford 1997 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is set equal to that of the gravel pack i e 1000 m d whereas the vertical one is set equal to 1x106 m d both values are comparable to those used by halford 1997 the value of the vertical hydraulic conductivity ensures that the head losses due to the vertical flow toward the cell at the bottom of the borehole to which the water extraction is assigned see section 4 1 are very small and the hydraulic head along the screened part of the borehole can be considered to be constant the specific yield in the borehole column is set equal to 0 99 approximately equal to one see halford 1997 whereas the specific storativity whose value is of less importance is set equal to that of the gravel pack 4 2 3 the aquifer in the aquifer in addition to the unknown hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers which is estimated through the model calibration by applying the method described in step e of section 2 unknown are also the specific storativity ss a and the specific yield sy a of the aquifer which are required for the transient simulations see section 4 1 since test simulations show that the drawdown in the aquifer is limited in the first layer sy a is set equal to 0 12 which approximately corresponds to the mean of the porosity value resulting from archie s law for the upper aquifer layer for all the investigated cases the problem of the unknown ss a can be overcome taking into consideration that in the period from about 20 min after beginning of pumping until the end of pumping the drawdown in the borehole reaches the quassi steady state see fig 4 below during this period drawdown is not influenced by ss a thus in the model calibration for the first investigated case i e the case with m 1 3 and eq 7a as the initial relationship for dm f Ï we set ss a 1x10 6 m 1 a value which has been estimated for the glafkos aquifer by ziogas and kaleris 2019 the criterion for the estimation of the unknown hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers is then to estimate hc values for which the model sufficiently approximates the water level in the borehole for the period 20 min t 180 min subsequently the value of ss a is modified in order to find out how far is it possible to get better approximations of the descending and the ascending part of the curve in fig 4 and to improve the overall behavior of the model 5 results and discussion for the case in which m 1 3 and equation 7a is the initial equation for the relationship dm f Ï fig 5 shows the time series of the measured drawdown in the borehole along with the time series simulated a for the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers which resulted for ss a 1 10 6 m 1 see above and b for the same hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers and ss a 1 10 7 m 1 the fact that by further reducing the ss a value the deviations between measured and simulated drawdown in the descending part of the curve fig 5a don t reduce indicates that the model does not sufficiently simulate the process of the borehole storage although this deficiency of the model cannot be countered it has no effect on the estimation of the aquifer layers hydraulic conductivity see section 4 2 3 since on the other hand the simulation of the ascending part of the curve for ss a 1 10 7 m 1 is better than that for ss a 1 10 6 m 1 see fig 5b ss a 1 10 7 m 1 has been used in the further investigations fig 6 a shows the estimated hcp for the case with m 1 3 and eq 7a as the initial function for the relationship between dm and Ï the hydraulic conductivity varies over the depth of the aquifer about three orders of magnitude fig 6b shows the hc values from fig 6a as a function of the porosity along with the hc values resulting by assuming that dm is constant over the depth of the aquifer in this latter case the hydraulic conductivity has been calculated and shown in fig 6b for three dm values in the range resulted for the case in fig 6a as it can be seen the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and porosity in the two cases is totally different more precisely the correlation between hydraulic conductivity and porosity for the case that dm is considered as a function of porosity is negative whereas in the case that dm is set constant the correlation is positive thus for a definite porosity profile as it results from the er measurements totally different hc profiles result for the cases that the relationship dm f Ï is or is not considered in fig 7 the hcp resulting for m 1 5 is compared with that estimated for m 1 3 the increase of m from 1 3 to 1 5 leads to hc values which at some depths are significantly i e from 60 to 90 different than these obtained for m 1 3 this indicates the important effect of the m value on the hcp finally fig 8 in which the profiles calculated for m 1 3 and the three different forms of eq 7 are compared shows that the form of eq 7 used as the initial relationship between the grain size and the porosity has also a significant effect on hcp a systematic which can be recognized in the results of the investigated parameter combinations is that the deviations of the resulting profiles are stronger in the area of the lower hydraulic conductivity since the transmissivities i e the product of thickness and hc value of the areas with the higher hc values result for all the investigated cases a larger than these of the areas with the lower hc values and b approximately equal to each other the depth integrated hc values estimated for all the investigated cases do not differ significantly see table 1 the differences in the variability of the hc values over the depth of the aquifer see fig 6a 7 and 8 are illustrated also by the values of the standard deviation of the profile values in table 1 more general rules which would allow the assessment of the hcp for other combinations of the cementation factor and the form of eq 7 are difficult to be drawn from these results this implies that the hydraulic conductivity profiles have to be specifically estimated in each particular case the depth integrated values in table 1 have been compared with the value of the hydraulic conductivity estimated for the area in which the borehole g4 is located through the calibration of a 3 dimensional groundwater model for the glafkos coastal aquifer see ziogas and kaleris 2019 the model is based on seawat langevin et al 2003 which is the combination of modflow and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 for simulating density driven flow the use of seawat was necessary to take into account the narrow saltwater intrusion zone about 500 m wide near the coast of the aquifer as mentioned in section 3 1 the borehole g4 is located far away from this zone see fig 2b and is not influenced by the saltwater intrusion based on the results of a number of pumping tests the aquifer in the seawat model was considered to consist of three homogeneous and isotropic zones with different hydraulic conductivities the model was automatically calibrated using the pest code doherty 2016 and the hydraulic heads measured for a period of four years at the seven observation wells shown in fig 2b the hydraulic conductivity value which resulted from the calibration of seawat for the zone in which the observation borehole g4 is located differs significantly from the depth integrated hc values in table 1 the latter are about 4 5 times smaller than the value resulted from seawat probable reasons for this difference are that a the vertical variability of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity has not been taken into account in the calibration of seawat b the results of the two investigation methods compared are referred to different scales to a regional one and to a local one and c there are inherent uncertainties in both compared methods the comparison underlines the fact that detailed investigations at a small number of boreholes cannot provide sufficient information about the value of the hc at the scale of the aquifer further glafkos aquifer was proven to be a case in which it was possible to calibrate a largescale model so that it sufficiently simulates the temporal variation of the groundwater level without taking into account details about the vertical variability of the hc however there is no doubt that for other demanding tasks as the investigation of the vertical distribution of contaminations in the aquifer or the planning of groundwater remediation measures the knowledge of the vertical variability of the hc is indispensable the relationships between the replacement grain size see step g in section 2 1 and the porosity which resulted for each aquifer layer in this study and have been characterized as equations 7 see step b in section 2 2 are given by eq 7a or 7b or 7 c depending on which of them has been used as the initial one however with modified logdm intercepts compared to those in eq 7 the modified logdm intercepts are given for all the investigated cases and for each aquifer layer in table 2 and are significantly smaller than these in the eqs 7a 7b and 7c respectively the sensitivity of the hcp against the value of the hydraulic conductivity of the gravel pack has been investigated for two additional values of kf gravel i e for kf gravel 800 m d and 600 m d for each of these values the model has been recalibrated and the values of the hydraulic conductivity resulting at the different depths of the borehole were compared with those obtained at the same depth for kf gravel 1000 m d i e the value used in all the previous investigations see section 4 2 1 for kf gravel 800 m d i e reducing kf gravel by 20 the hc values increase by about 2 whereas for kf gravel 600 m d i e reducing kf gravel by 40 the hc values increase by about 4 the increase of the hc values is expected since the reduction of kf grav leads to the increase of the hydraulic resistance of the system gravel pack aquifer thus for the simulation of the measured drawdown in the borehole the hydraulic conductivity values over the depth of the aquifer result larger however these changes show that significant uncertainties in the estimation of kf grav have relatively small effect on the hcp concerning the storage parameters ss gravel and sy gravel the comparison of the results obtained for ss gravel from 1x10 5 m 1 to 1x10 7 m 1 on the one side and for sy gravel from 0 20 and 0 3 on the other side showed that the effect of both parameters on the estimation of the hcp is negligible the reason is that the change of storage in the gravel pack for values of the storage parameters in the aforementioned ranges is small since the radius of the gravel pack is small and the change of the water level in it during the pumping test is of the order of three centimeters thus uncertainties in the storage parameters of the gravel pack have negligible effect on the hcp it should be noted that for wells in stronger consolidated sediments in which the borehole wall is to some degree stable and the short duration pumping test could be performed before the installation of casing the uncertainty in the estimation of hcp is reduced this is due to the elimination a of the uncertainties resulting from the parameters of the gravel pack and b of the effect of the gravel pack and the casing on the apportioning of inflow across the well face during the pumping test the sensitivity of the hcp against the value of m and the Ï dm relationship underlines the importance of reliable estimations of these influence factors in each particular case this can be achieved by performing appropriate laboratory investigations for the material of the aquifer in which the method is to be applied 6 summary and conclusions the method proposed here for the estimation of hydraulic conductivity profiles in unconsolidated alluvial aquifers combines the electrical resistivity of the aquifer and its response to a short duration pumping test the fine resolution of the hydraulic conductivity profile which can be achieved by using electrical resistivity profiles with appropriate resolution makes the method particularly attractive the data required are short and long normal electrical resistivity measurements gamma ray measurements and the temporal variation of the water level in the borehole due to pumping for the analysis archie s law the kozeny carman equation and an equation providing the relationship between the mean grain size and the porosity have been used relationships between the grain size and the porosity allow taking into consideration the variability of the grain size over the depth of the aquifer whose importance for the estimation of hydraulic conductivity profiles is shown to be crucial for the initial form of such relationships literature data can be used a main issue of this work is the adjustment of the initial form of such relationships to each particular case this is achieved by calibrating a transient modflow based groundwater model for the area around the borehole using the temporal variation of the groundwater level measured in the borehole during the short pumping test the steps of the method as it has been applied for the estimation of the hcp in an alluvial aquifer in western greece are schematically shown in fig 2 and are described in section 2 the application of the method in the investigated borehole in the glafkos aquifer has been performed for two values of the cementation factor which are characteristic for unconsolidated aquifers and three forms of the relationship between porosity and mean grain size obtained from literature data the results show that both these factors significantly influence the resulting profiles by assuming that porosity and grain size are related to each other the resulting relationship between hydraulic conductivity and porosity is of totally different form as that resulting by assuming that the grain size is constant over the depth of the aquifer in the first case the correlation between hydraulic conductivity and porosity is negative whereas in the second case it is positive further the hydraulic conductivity can in the two cases differ by orders of magnitude this means that for the same porosity profile as it results from the resistivity measurements the aforementioned assumptions lead to very different hydraulic conductivity profiles uncertainties in applying the method proposed here are mainly related with the selection of the cementation factor and the relationship between the mean grain size and the porosity the uncertainties above can be evaluated by performing sensitivity analysis in which the computational effort for the simulations is limited due to the small scale of the numerical models the uncertainties can however be significantly reduced if the cementation factor and the porosity mgs relationship is estimated performing appropriate laboratory investigations of the material of the

dr vincent post for his review and the constructive comments as well as the reviewer dr giacomo medici for his thorough remarks and suggestions that significantly improved the presentation of this work appendix a clearness of the parts of the aquifer with the higher gamma ray values in this study it is assumed that in the parts of the aquifer where the gamma ray values are larger than 30 api units the porous material is not clean i e its clay and silt content is not negligible in such areas not the intrinsic but the apparent formation factor fa can be estimated the latter includes not only the contribution of the conductance of the formation water as it is the case for the intrinsic formation factor fi but also the contribution of the clay silt conductance of the no clean formations urish 1981 fa is calculated from eq a 1 a 1 f i r xo r mf rxo ohm m is the resistivity measured with the short normal device see fig 4d and rmf ohm m is the resistivity of the mud filtrate with which the aquifer in the area close to the borehole is saturated see section 3 2 according to lamont 1957 the value of rmf is not significantly different from the electrical resistivity rm of the drilling mud therefore in this analysis we set rmf rm in the investigated borehole g4 fig 1b is rm 7 7 ohm m for the parts of the aquifer in which the porous material is not clean worthington 1993 proposed the following relationship between the apparent and the intrinsic formation factor a 2 f a f i b q v r o b mho cm2 meq represents the average mobility of cations near the grain surfaces and depends on the resistivity of the formation water qv meq ml is the cation exchange capacity per unit pore volume of the rock and varies with porosity the product bqv has units of conductivity and reflects the effect of surface conduction due to clay particles see worthington 1993 finally ro ohm m see also eq 2 is the resistivity of the formation in the undisturbed zone i e in the zone farther from the borehole which is saturated with the formation water the value of ro results from the long normal resistivity log fig 4e which due to the distance of the electrodes of the device provides resistivity values from the undisturbed area farther from the borehole where the formation water is the dominating fluid see schneider 1973 page 304 driscoll 1987 page 183 having the values of fi from eq a 1 and the values of ro eq a 2 allows checking the clearness in different parts of the aquifer by plotting fa versus ro for these parts since the thickness of the sections with gr 30 ari in the investigated aquifer is relative small see fig 4c it can be assumed that the porosity and consequently the factor bqv see eq a 2 in them is approximately constant in each of the aforementioned plots we fit a straight line since according to worthington 1993 in no clean sections is fa fi the no clean sections are these in which the slope of the straight line fitted to the plot of fa versus ro is negative fa fi the intercept of the strait line in this plot equals to fi of the corresponding section for all the points in these sections the values of the formation factor calculated from eq a 1 are replaced by the intercept of the straight line of the corresponding fa versus ro plot the so estimated fi profile for the borehole g4 along with the values of the apparent formation factor in the non clean areas is shown in fig 4f

corradini editor in chief with the assistance of vincent e a post associate editor hydraulic conductivity profiles hcps are of crucial importance for 3 dimensional flow and transport groundwater models easy and inexpensive methods for the estimation of such profiles increase their availability and strengthen the efficiency of the models in this study a method is presented which combines the electrical resistivity er measured over the depth of the aquifer in a borehole and the response of the aquifer to the short duration pumping from the borehole the hydraulic conductivity profile is calculated from the kozeny carman equation in which the profiles of the porosity and the mean grain size mgs are required porosity is calculated from archie s law using the intrinsic formation factor which results from the er mgs is calculated from the porosity using a relationship between them the initial form of this relationship is obtained from literature data and is then adjusted to the conditions of each particular case the adjustment is achieved by calibrating a modflow based groundwater model so that it sufficiently simulates the temporal variation of the water level measured in the borehole during the short pumping the method is applied to the estimation of the hcp in an unconsolidated alluvial aquifer in greece the sensitivity of the results to the parameters and assumptions used in the method is investigated and discussed keywords hydraulic conductivity profile electrical resistivity log grain size porosity relationship pumping test groundwater model modflow 1 introduction for detailed simulations of flow and transport in aquifers the 3 dimensional distribution of the hydraulic conductivity is important the latter can be approximated by using the hydraulic conductivity profiles hcps estimated at characteristic locations in the aquifer the methods to estimate hcps can be grouped in those using a the grain size distribution of the cutting material removed from the borehole by the drilling fluid or of samples taken at different depths see driscoll 1987 b experiments as for instance slug tests performed at different depths during the drilling of the borehole batu 1998 medici et al 2019a b and c single borehole measurements in completed boreholes as flowmeter measurements see hufschmied 1983 molz et al 1989 kaleris et al 1995 clemo 2010 multilevel slug tests see melville et al 1991 chen et al 2012 gellasch et al 2013 lo et al 2014 medici et al 2016 medici et al 2018 forced gradient tracer tests see molz et al 1988 ptak and teutsch 1994 and nuclear magnetic resonance ren et al 2019 the methods above some of which are appropriate both for porous as well as for fractured aquifers and which have proven their worth in practical applications are time consuming and costly causing that hcps required in groundwater models are mostly in a limited measure available the analogy between electric current and groundwater flow and the fact that electrical resistivity er measurements in boreholes are relatively easy and cheap see huntley 1986 slater and lesmes 2002 has encouraged the attempts of hydrogeologists to use such measurements to qualitatively assess the permeability k m2 or the hydraulic conductivity kf m s over the depth of alluvial and glacial deposits for decades k and kf are related according to equation 1 k f kg Î½ where g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity and Î½ m2 s the kinematic viscosity er measurements are performed before the installation of the casing in the borehole and while the borehole is still filled with the drilling fluid due to their effectiveness in determining the resistivity contrasts that appear between clay rich low permeability deposits and clay poor high permeability deposits er measurements are used to place the well screens in the most desirable position and are suggested as an integral part of the well construction process driscoll 1987 beyond this qualitative use of the resistivity logs attempts have been made to relate the electrical resistivity with the hydraulic properties of the aquifer archie 1942 found that the porosity Ï is related with the intrinsic formation factor fi which is defined as the ratio of the resistivity ro of clay free porous materials saturated with an electrolyte to the bulk resistivity of the electrolyte rw i e 2 f i r o r w archie s law is commonly expressed in the form see winsauer et al 1952 3 f i a Ï m where m is the cementation factor see glover 2016 and Î± is a parameter whose theoretical value is equal to 1 but practically it differs from this value due to the fact that it compensates systematic errors in the data from which it is estimated glover 2016 owing to the fact that respective generally valid relationships between formation factor and permeability do not exist electrical resistivity measurements can be useful for the estimation of the permeability in cases that the correlation between the latter and the porosity is significant investigations of detmer 1995 and morin et al 2010 in specific environments showed that the aforementioned correlation is weak on the other hand the relationships of kozeny and carman cited in bear 1972 and these of berg and van baaren cited in nelson 1994 in which permeability is proportional to the square of the grain size times porosity raised to a power and times a sorting parameter was found to provide results compatible with data in this study we use the relationship of kozeny and carman which is see bear 1972 4 k d m 2 180 Ï 3 1 Ï 2 with dm m the mean grain size the relationship is based on the concept of the capillary tubes predicts fairly well the saturated permeability of most soils and is widely used in the literature chapuis and aubertin 2003 equation 4 along with eqs 1 2 and 3 have already been used in rahman et al 2008 khalil et al 2011 khalil and santos 2013 and asfahani 2017 to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in these studies dm is considered to be constant over the depth of the aquifer however in cases where the electrical resistivity and consequently the porosity vary over the aquifer depth the assumption that dm is constant is a significant simplification the estimation of the variability of dm over the depth of an aquifer requires particular investigations which in many cases are not available Î± possibility to incorporate the dm variation in the estimation of hcps is to use relationships of the form 5 d m f Ï such relationships have been presented in the literature see for instance davis 1969 page 84 de marsily 1986 page 36 houston et al 2011 however they are not of general validity since porosity does not depend only on the mean grain size but also on the shape of the grains the nature of packing and the grain size distribution of the materials for which the relationships have been developed see biella et al 1983 therefore relationships such as those mentioned above can be used in estimations of hcps only if they can be appropriately adjusted in each particular case in this study is shown that this adjustment can be achieved by using electrical resistivity measurements performed over the depth of a borehole and a groundwater model for the simulation of the temporal variation of the groundwater level measured in the borehole during a pumping test of short duration the method which is exclusively applied in porous aquifers is presented in section 2 the available data for the boreholes in the unconsolidated alluvial aquifer of glafkos river in western greece see fig 1 where the method has been applied are presented in section 3 the numerical model is presented in section 4 the results and their sensitivity to the assumptions used in the analysis are discussed in section 5 a summary and the conclusions drawn from the investigation are presented in section 6 2 methodology and assumptions the procedure for the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity at all the locations i over the depth of the borehole where the electrical resistivity er has been measured contains two parts in the first one part a the borehole is divided in a number of sections referred to hereafter as layers and the hydraulic conductivity for each of them is estimated by manually calibrating a groundwater model in the second part part b the hydraulic conductivity at all the locations i see above is calculated from the hydraulic conductivity of the layers 2 1 part a estimation of the hydraulic conductivity of the layers that are determined in the aquifer this part of the procedure is schematically presented in fig 2 and its particular steps are explained in the following step a the intrinsic formation factor fi see eq 2 is estimated at all the locations i using er measurements performed with electrodes of two different distances and gamma ray gr measurements the detailed procedure of the fi estimation is described in section 3 2 after the aforementioned electro log measurements have been presented step b by combining information from the cutting log see section 3 2 and the vertical variation of the formation factor fi estimated in step a the layers of the aquifer used in the analysis are determined each of them corresponds to a vertical section of the borehole in which i according to the cutting log the grain size and the clay content of the material do not change significantly and ii the formation factor does not exhibit considerable variations as a rule of thumb according to which the variation of fi is considered to be not significant the following condition is used 6 f j 3 s d f i f j 3 s d where f j is the mean and sd the standard deviation of the fi values in the layer j step c from the f j values see above and eq 3 with appropriate values for the parameters Î± and m used in it the porosity Ïj of the layers is calculated for the parameter a the widely used value a 1 see also section 1 has been applied the value of the cementation factor m depends on the degree of the aquifer consolidation for unconsolidated aquifers as the alluvial aquifer investigated in this study m values from 1 3 to 1 5 are proposed in the literature see archie 1942 frohlich 1974 urish 1981 kwader 1985 morin 2006 niwas and celik 2012 here both aforementioned m values are investigated in order to evaluate their effect on the resulting hcp step d for the estimation of the layer mean grain size dmj the selection of the form of eq 5 is required as initial form are proposed eqs 7 see below that have been presented in the literature which in each particular case have to be subsequently adjusted fig 3 shows i a curve presented by houston et al 2011 ii data presented by cohen 1965 cited also in davis 1969 page 84 and iii a curve presented by castany cited in de marsily 1986 page 36 and in huysmans and dassargues 2005 the equation for the curve of houston et al 2011 approximated by a 3rd degree polynomial is 7a log d m 2 325 0

porosities less than 27 and 28 respectively in which values are missing by using corresponding values from the curve of houston et al 2011 the equations resulting by approximating the supplemented data sets of cohen and castany by 3rd degree polynomials are eq 7b and eq 7c respectively 7b log d m 2 275 0 095 Ï 1 800 10 3 Ï 2 2 808 10 5 Ï 3 7c log d m 4 105 0 343 Ï 0 012 Ï 2 1 923 10 4 Ï 3 a further equation providing a relationship between porosity and mean grain size has been presented by salem 2001 this equation is not considered here since it does not provide significantly different results than the equations above in this study each of the three forms of equation 7 has been used as an initial relationship from which a modified one see eq 7 in step g below is estimated that is appropriate for the calculation of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers the final form of the porosity mgs relationship is estimated in step b of section 2 2 in which the estimation of the hc at all the locations i is presented the effect of the three different forms of equation 7 on the resulting hcp is discussed in section 5 step e using the values of the layer variables Ïj and dmj estimated in steps c and d the layer hydraulic conductivity kfj is calculated from eqs 1 and 4 step f the kfj profile is used as input in a modflow groundwater model harbaugh et al 2000 which concerns the saturated zone of the aquifer around the borehole and is built according to langevin 2008 for the simulation of axisymmetric flows see section 4 the model is manually calibrated in order to appropriately simulate the temporal variation of the water level in the borehole during the pumping test the calibration of the model is used for the adjustment of the porosity mgs relationship see step d for this purpose the model is executed the complete data set used for the simulations is described in section 4 2 and the simulated time series of the water level in the borehole for the pumping and the recovery period of the short duration pumping test is compared with that measured step g if the agreement between the two time series is not satisfactory eq 7 is adjusted see also section 1 since for the model calibration only the measured drawdown in the borehole is available an adjustment is possible only for one of the coefficients in eq 7 here the logdm intercept in eq 7 is modified mostly reduced after each calibration run and the steps d e and f are repeated until a good agreement is achieved the hydraulic conductivity resulting from the calibration for each aquifer layer j is hereafter characterized as kfj calibr it should be noted that through the modification of the logdm intercept the modified eq 7 which is hereafter characterized as eq 7 is shifted toward smaller dm values compared to the initial ones equation 7 is valid for all the aquifer layers similarly as the initial eq 7 however dm in eq 7 is not referred to an actual grain size the reason is that this dm results by matching the porosity values to grain sizes obtained by shifting eq 7 through the model calibration since however dm in eq 7 is correlated to the porosity similarly as in eq 7 in which porosity and grain size are actual values for definite porous materials used for the derivation of eq 7 dm in eq 7 is here considered as a replacement grain size for the investigated aquifer this grain size is considered to incorporate the effect of all the factors determining the aquifer porosity i e the mean grain size the shape of the grains the nature of packing and the grain size distribution biella et al 1983 2 2 part b estimation of the hydraulic conductivity at all the locations i where the electrical resistivity has been measured for this purpose the values of the hydraulic conductivity kfj calibr which resulted from the model calibration have been used the following procedure is applied step a utilizing the values of the formation factor fi at all the locations i in a layer j step a in section 2 1 and eqs 3 and 7 the porosities Ïi and the dmi values are calculated from them the hydraulic conductivity values kfi at all the locations i are obtained using eqs 1 and 4 step b the mean of the kfi values in each layer j which is hereafter characterized as k fi j is calculated in general is k fi j kfj calibr this is due to the fact that kfj calibr is calculated from the mean values of the intrinsic formation factor in each layer see step b in section 2 1 whereas k fi j is the mean of the kfi values calculated from the fi values at the different locations i in a layer the differences between k fi j and kfj calibr must be eliminated since otherwise the kfi values are not compatible with the results of the calibration for this purpose the porosity mgs relationship eq 7 for each aquifer layer has to be appropriately modified this is achieved by multiplying the dmi values for which equation 7 is valid by the factor k f j c a l i b r k fi j from these new dmi values and the porosity values for which eq 7 is valid is derived a new equation characterized hereafter as eq 7 by fitting a 3rd degree polynomial this is the final porosity mgs relationship that is valid for the particular layer for which it has been calculated in contrast to eq 7 which is an approximation for the whole depth of the aquifer using eq 7 and the Ïi values step a new dmi values are calculated and from them the final kfi values are obtained that the mean of the new kfi values in each layer is equal to that obtained from the model calibration can be shown by taking into consideration that the hydraulic conductivity k fi j of a layer is related with the kfi values in the layer according to eq 9 9 k fi j 1 m i 1 m d mi 2 180 Ï i 3 1 Ï i 2 where m is the number of the locations in a layer j at which kfi has been calculated replacing in eq 9 dmi with its value multiplied by k f j c a l i b r k fi j results k fi j kfj calibr 3 test site data and processing 3 1 the test site the method described above has been applied in the coastal aquifer of glafkos river fig 1a an important alluvial groundwater reservoir for the water supply of the city of patras the third largest city of greece the area of the aquifer is about 25 km2 for the systematic monitoring of the temporal variation of the groundwater level a network of seven observation wells see fig 1b has been installed the area in which the observation wells are located is not influenced by saltwater intrusion see ziogas 2013 ziogas and kaleris 2019 the depth of the boreholes varies from 80 m to 120 m and their diameter is 12 the penetration of the boreholes into the saturated zone of the alluvial aquifer which consists of mixtures of coarse and fine gravel sand and clay varies from about 50 m to 90 m depending on the elevation of the borehole locations and the groundwater level during drilling cutting logs for all the boreholes have been recorded after the completion of drilling and while the boreholes were still filled with the drilling mud the following electro logs usually applied in porous aquifers have been recorded in each of them a gamma ray gr b spontaneous potential sp c short normal er log and d long normal er log in the short normal device which is hereafter characterized as 16nr the separation distance of the electrodes is 16 or 406 mm whereas in the long normal which is hereafter characterized as 64nr the separation distance of the electrodes is 64 or 1630 mm the casing which has been installed in the boreholes after the completion of the logs has a diameter of 6 and is screened in the sections where according to the cutting logs and the interpretation of the er logs see above the alluvial aquifer exhibits high hydraulic conductivity the space between the casing and the edge of the drilled hole was filled with gravel whose grain size varies from 2 mm to 5 mm after the installation of the casing the boreholes have been developed by using the air lift method see driscoll 1987 for removing the drilling mud from the gravel pack and the part of the aquifer in the immediate surroundings of the boreholes subsequently pumping with a constant rate has been applied in each borehole for about three to five hours and the water level in the borehole has been recorded after pumping ceased the recovery of the water level has been recorded as well in this study we present the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity profile for the borehole g4 see fig 1b which exhibits the largest penetration depth into the saturated zone of the alluvial aquifer about 93 m some preliminary results for the boreholes in glafkos aquifer have already been presented in ziogas 2013 and kaleris and ziogas 2015 3 2 data and processing fig 4 shows the cutting log the building up of the borehole and the electro logs in the saturated zone of the alluvial aquifer at the location g4 see fig 1b the vertical resolution of the electro logs is 0 20 m the cutting log fig 4a shows that the aquifer is comprised of alternating layers which are mixtures of coarse gravel fine gravel sand and clay clay layers do not exist thus the sp log adds little to the investigation see driscoll 1987 page 189 and therefore it is not presented in fig 4 the screens are positioned in the lower part of the borehole fig 4b for the estimation of the formation factor the short normal resistivity log is used as it ensures a higher resolution of the formation than the long normal one the reason is that because of the relatively short distance between the electrodes of the short normal device compared to the borehole diameter mainly the zone around the borehole which is invaded by the drilling mud is scanned see driscoll 1987 pages 184 185 the electrolyte with which this part of the formation is saturated is a mixture of the drilling mud and the formation water see schneider 1973 page 304 driscoll 1987 page 183 and is characterized as the mud filtrate lamont 1957 fig 4c shows that the gamma ray values recorded in the borehole are smaller than 35 api units although this indicates that the formation is clean i e its clay or silt content is not significant see ellis and singrer 2008 page 30 the clearness of the parts of the aquifer exhibiting the higher gr values has been investigated by using the method of worthington 1993 the procedure applied is presented in appendix a the profile of the intrinsic formation factor fi is shown in fig 4f along with the values of the apparent formation factor for the definition see appendix a in the non clean areas the thickness of the latter areas is small as indicates also the gr log fig 4c from the profile of the fi values nine aquifer layers see section 2 step b characterized by different mean values f j of the formation factor in them are defined see fig 4g the f j values of the layers satisfy eq 6 the comparison of the fig 4a and g show that sections with higher f j values correspond well to sections consisting of coarser material see also kwader 1985 morin 2006 4 numerical simulation of the short duration pumping test in borehole g4 for the estimation of the aquifer layers hydraulic conductivity 4 1 establishment of the groundwater model in order to minimize run time and output data size the radially symmetric flow has been simulated by using a two dimensional cross sectional aquifer model as proposed by langevin 2008 the model uses the modflow 2000 code harbaugh et al 2000 and adjusts several input parameters to account for the increase in flow area with radial distance from the borehole more precisely adjustments are made to all input values used in equations that contain an area or volume for instance the conductance along the model rows the vertical conductance and the specific storage see langevin 2008 it should be noted that the temporal variation of the water level in the borehole reached after some time of pumping the quasi steady state see below this enables the approximation of the unknown aquifer layers hydraulic conductivity by steady state simulations however in this study a transient model has been used since it allows checking the overall validity of the model also in refer to its efficiency in simulating the pumping test with reasonable values of the aquifer storage parameters the width of the 2d cross section i e the model dimension perpendicular to the cross section was set equal to 1 langevin 2008 this dimension is characterized hereafter as the width of the rows the length axis of the model is horizontal and is directed from the well axis to the model outer boundary the length of the first column corresponds to the inner radius of the borehole casing and is set equal to that i e 7 62 cm see section 3 the second model column corresponds to the wall of the casing pipe the subsequent six columns from the third to eighth correspond to the gravel pack and the columns from nine to 36 to the aquifer to simulate the steep hydraulic gradient in the proximity of the casing pipe a length equal to 3 of the width radius of the casing pipe is assigned to the column adjacent to the casing Ïhe length of the next columns expanded radially as multiples of 1 5 this places the center of the last column of the model the 36th column at a radial distance of 575 m the model was vertically discretized in 57 layers in the area of the well screens the vertical discretization is denser than in the other areas concerning the temporal discretization we use for the pumping period whose duration is 180 min an initial time step Î´t0 2 1 10 6 min the length of the next time steps increase as multiples of 1 09 for the recovery period whose duration is about 60 min the initial time step is Î´t0 2 10 2 min and each of the next increases by a factor 1 1 this temporal discretization ensures the proper simulation of the fast change of the hydraulic head at the beginning both of the pumping and the recovery period the upper and the lower boundaries of the model are no flow boundaries the flow in the aquifer is unconfined the outer model column in the opposite side of the well column 2d cross sectional model was set as a constant head boundary with a value equal to the groundwater level measured prior to the beginning of the pumping test the distance of this boundary from the well column see above ensures that the boundary does not affect the head drop around the well see ziogas 2013 the pumping of the water from the well at a rate of 15 m3 h is assigned to the lowermost cell of the borehole column while the simulator apportioned inflow to the borehole across the screened part of the casing halford 1997 the time series of the hydraulic head measured in the borehole during the 180 min pumping time and the 60 min recovery time are the observations which have been compared with the simulated heads in the borehole column for the calibration of the transient model the calibration consisted in the adjustment of the porosity mgs relationship and particularly of the value of the logdm intercept in eq 7 see step g in section 2 1 and fig 2 the adjustment is conducted manually with the purpose to reduce the deviations between the simulated time series of the water level in the borehole and the time series measured in it during the pumping and the recovery period of the performed test due to the significant influence of the logdm intercept in eq 7 on the resulting hydraulic conductivity of the defined aquifer layers a small number of trials was required for the calibration 4 2 hydraulic properties in the different model areas 4 2 1 the gravel pack for the hydraulic conductivity of the gravel pack kf grav is assumed that the mean grain size of the material is 3 5 mm see section 3 1 and the porosity is 23 see fig 1 the groundwater temperature during the period of the investigation was 15 c thus from eqs 1 and 3 results kf gravel 1000 m d the gravel pack is assumed to be isotropic the specific yield sy gravel is assumed to be equal to the gravel pack porosity i e sy gravel 0 23 the specific storativity is calculated from the equation s s g r a v Ï g Î± Ï Î² where Î± and Î² are the compressibility of the porous material and the water respectively with Î± 1 10 9 m2 n and Î² 4 4 10 10 m2 n see freeze and cherry 1979 page 59 and is Ï the water density the resulting value is s s grav 1 1 10 5 m 1 the values above which have been used in the investigation are the most reliable estimates of the gravel pack parameters in order to assess the effect of their uncertainties on the estimation of the hcp a sensitivity analysis is performed in section 5 2 4 2 2 the wall and the interior of the casing pipe the cells of the model which represent the wall of the casing pipe second model column are considered to be inactive except of those corresponding to the screened parts of the casing see fig 3b for these parts the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be equal to that of the gravel pack the interior of the casing pipe first model column is simulated as porous medium with high hydraulic conductivity halford 1997 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is set equal to that of the gravel pack i e 1000 m d whereas the vertical one is set equal to 1x106 m d both values are comparable to those used by halford 1997 the value of the vertical hydraulic conductivity ensures that the head losses due to the vertical flow toward the cell at the bottom of the borehole to which the water extraction is assigned see section 4 1 are very small and the hydraulic head along the screened part of the borehole can be considered to be constant the specific yield in the borehole column is set equal to 0 99 approximately equal to one see halford 1997 whereas the specific storativity whose value is of less importance is set equal to that of the gravel pack 4 2 3 the aquifer in the aquifer in addition to the unknown hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers which is estimated through the model calibration by applying the method described in step e of section 2 unknown are also the specific storativity ss a and the specific yield sy a of the aquifer which are required for the transient simulations see section 4 1 since test simulations show that the drawdown in the aquifer is limited in the first layer sy a is set equal to 0 12 which approximately corresponds to the mean of the porosity value resulting from archie s law for the upper aquifer layer for all the investigated cases the problem of the unknown ss a can be overcome taking into consideration that in the period from about 20 min after beginning of pumping until the end of pumping the drawdown in the borehole reaches the quassi steady state see fig 4 below during this period drawdown is not influenced by ss a thus in the model calibration for the first investigated case i e the case with m 1 3 and eq 7a as the initial relationship for dm f Ï we set ss a 1x10 6 m 1 a value which has been estimated for the glafkos aquifer by ziogas and kaleris 2019 the criterion for the estimation of the unknown hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers is then to estimate hc values for which the model sufficiently approximates the water level in the borehole for the period 20 min t 180 min subsequently the value of ss a is modified in order to find out how far is it possible to get better approximations of the descending and the ascending part of the curve in fig 4 and to improve the overall behavior of the model 5 results and discussion for the case in which m 1 3 and equation 7a is the initial equation for the relationship dm f Ï fig 5 shows the time series of the measured drawdown in the borehole along with the time series simulated a for the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers which resulted for ss a 1 10 6 m 1 see above and b for the same hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer layers and ss a 1 10 7 m 1 the fact that by further reducing the ss a value the deviations between measured and simulated drawdown in the descending part of the curve fig 5a don t reduce indicates that the model does not sufficiently simulate the process of the borehole storage although this deficiency of the model cannot be countered it has no effect on the estimation of the aquifer layers hydraulic conductivity see section 4 2 3 since on the other hand the simulation of the ascending part of the curve for ss a 1 10 7 m 1 is better than that for ss a 1 10 6 m 1 see fig 5b ss a 1 10 7 m 1 has been used in the further investigations fig 6 a shows the estimated hcp for the case with m 1 3 and eq 7a as the initial function for the relationship between dm and Ï the hydraulic conductivity varies over the depth of the aquifer about three orders of magnitude fig 6b shows the hc values from fig 6a as a function of the porosity along with the hc values resulting by assuming that dm is constant over the depth of the aquifer in this latter case the hydraulic conductivity has been calculated and shown in fig 6b for three dm values in the range resulted for the case in fig 6a as it can be seen the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and porosity in the two cases is totally different more precisely the correlation between hydraulic conductivity and porosity for the case that dm is considered as a function of porosity is negative whereas in the case that dm is set constant the correlation is positive thus for a definite porosity profile as it results from the er measurements totally different hc profiles result for the cases that the relationship dm f Ï is or is not considered in fig 7 the hcp resulting for m 1 5 is compared with that estimated for m 1 3 the increase of m from 1 3 to 1 5 leads to hc values which at some depths are significantly i e from 60 to 90 different than these obtained for m 1 3 this indicates the important effect of the m value on the hcp finally fig 8 in which the profiles calculated for m 1 3 and the three different forms of eq 7 are compared shows that the form of eq 7 used as the initial relationship between the grain size and the porosity has also a significant effect on hcp a systematic which can be recognized in the results of the investigated parameter combinations is that the deviations of the resulting profiles are stronger in the area of the lower hydraulic conductivity since the transmissivities i e the product of thickness and hc value of the areas with the higher hc values result for all the investigated cases a larger than these of the areas with the lower hc values and b approximately equal to each other the depth integrated hc values estimated for all the investigated cases do not differ significantly see table 1 the differences in the variability of the hc values over the depth of the aquifer see fig 6a 7 and 8 are illustrated also by the values of the standard deviation of the profile values in table 1 more general rules which would allow the assessment of the hcp for other combinations of the cementation factor and the form of eq 7 are difficult to be drawn from these results this implies that the hydraulic conductivity profiles have to be specifically estimated in each particular case the depth integrated values in table 1 have been compared with the value of the hydraulic conductivity estimated for the area in which the borehole g4 is located through the calibration of a 3 dimensional groundwater model for the glafkos coastal aquifer see ziogas and kaleris 2019 the model is based on seawat langevin et al 2003 which is the combination of modflow and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 for simulating density driven flow the use of seawat was necessary to take into account the narrow saltwater intrusion zone about 500 m wide near the coast of the aquifer as mentioned in section 3 1 the borehole g4 is located far away from this zone see fig 2b and is not influenced by the saltwater intrusion based on the results of a number of pumping tests the aquifer in the seawat model was considered to consist of three homogeneous and isotropic zones with different hydraulic conductivities the model was automatically calibrated using the pest code doherty 2016 and the hydraulic heads measured for a period of four years at the seven observation wells shown in fig 2b the hydraulic conductivity value which resulted from the calibration of seawat for the zone in which the observation borehole g4 is located differs significantly from the depth integrated hc values in table 1 the latter are about 4 5 times smaller than the value resulted from seawat probable reasons for this difference are that a the vertical variability of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity has not been taken into account in the calibration of seawat b the results of the two investigation methods compared are referred to different scales to a regional one and to a local one and c there are inherent uncertainties in both compared methods the comparison underlines the fact that detailed investigations at a small number of boreholes cannot provide sufficient information about the value of the hc at the scale of the aquifer further glafkos aquifer was proven to be a case in which it was possible to calibrate a largescale model so that it sufficiently simulates the temporal variation of the groundwater level without taking into account details about the vertical variability of the hc however there is no doubt that for other demanding tasks as the investigation of the vertical distribution of contaminations in the aquifer or the planning of groundwater remediation measures the knowledge of the vertical variability of the hc is indispensable the relationships between the replacement grain size see step g in section 2 1 and the porosity which resulted for each aquifer layer in this study and have been characterized as equations 7 see step b in section 2 2 are given by eq 7a or 7b or 7 c depending on which of them has been used as the initial one however with modified logdm intercepts compared to those in eq 7 the modified logdm intercepts are given for all the investigated cases and for each aquifer layer in table 2 and are significantly smaller than these in the eqs 7a 7b and 7c respectively the sensitivity of the hcp against the value of the hydraulic conductivity of the gravel pack has been investigated for two additional values of kf gravel i e for kf gravel 800 m d and 600 m d for each of these values the model has been recalibrated and the values of the hydraulic conductivity resulting at the different depths of the borehole were compared with those obtained at the same depth for kf gravel 1000 m d i e the value used in all the previous investigations see section 4 2 1 for kf gravel 800 m d i e reducing kf gravel by 20 the hc values increase by about 2 whereas for kf gravel 600 m d i e reducing kf gravel by 40 the hc values increase by about 4 the increase of the hc values is expected since the reduction of kf grav leads to the increase of the hydraulic resistance of the system gravel pack aquifer thus for the simulation of the measured drawdown in the borehole the hydraulic conductivity values over the depth of the aquifer result larger however these changes show that significant uncertainties in the estimation of kf grav have relatively small effect on the hcp concerning the storage parameters ss gravel and sy gravel the comparison of the results obtained for ss gravel from 1x10 5 m 1 to 1x10 7 m 1 on the one side and for sy gravel from 0 20 and 0 3 on the other side showed that the effect of both parameters on the estimation of the hcp is negligible the reason is that the change of storage in the gravel pack for values of the storage parameters in the aforementioned ranges is small since the radius of the gravel pack is small and the change of the water level in it during the pumping test is of the order of three centimeters thus uncertainties in the storage parameters of the gravel pack have negligible effect on the hcp it should be noted that for wells in stronger consolidated sediments in which the borehole wall is to some degree stable and the short duration pumping test could be performed before the installation of casing the uncertainty in the estimation of hcp is reduced this is due to the elimination a of the uncertainties resulting from the parameters of the gravel pack and b of the effect of the gravel pack and the casing on the apportioning of inflow across the well face during the pumping test the sensitivity of the hcp against the value of m and the Ï dm relationship underlines the importance of reliable estimations of these influence factors in each particular case this can be achieved by performing appropriate laboratory investigations for the material of the aquifer in which the method is to be applied 6 summary and conclusions the method proposed here for the estimation of hydraulic conductivity profiles in unconsolidated alluvial aquifers combines the electrical resistivity of the aquifer and its response to a short duration pumping test the fine resolution of the hydraulic conductivity profile which can be achieved by using electrical resistivity profiles with appropriate resolution makes the method particularly attractive the data required are short and long normal electrical resistivity measurements gamma ray measurements and the temporal variation of the water level in the borehole due to pumping for the analysis archie s law the kozeny carman equation and an equation providing the relationship between the mean grain size and the porosity have been used relationships between the grain size and the porosity allow taking into consideration the variability of the grain size over the depth of the aquifer whose importance for the estimation of hydraulic conductivity profiles is shown to be crucial for the initial form of such relationships literature data can be used a main issue of this work is the adjustment of the initial form of such relationships to each particular case this is achieved by calibrating a transient modflow based groundwater model for the area around the borehole using the temporal variation of the groundwater level measured in the borehole during the short pumping test the steps of the method as it has been applied for the estimation of the hcp in an alluvial aquifer in western greece are schematically shown in fig 2 and are described in section 2 the application of the method in the investigated borehole in the glafkos aquifer has been performed for two values of the cementation factor which are characteristic for unconsolidated aquifers and three forms of the relationship between porosity and mean grain size obtained from literature data the results show that both these factors significantly influence the resulting profiles by assuming that porosity and grain size are related to each other the resulting relationship between hydraulic conductivity and porosity is of totally different form as that resulting by assuming that the grain size is constant over the depth of the aquifer in the first case the correlation between hydraulic conductivity and porosity is negative whereas in the second case it is positive further the hydraulic conductivity can in the two cases differ by orders of magnitude this means that for the same porosity profile as it results from the resistivity measurements the aforementioned assumptions lead to very different hydraulic conductivity profiles uncertainties in applying the method proposed here are mainly related with the selection of the cementation factor and the relationship between the mean grain size and the porosity the uncertainties above can be evaluated by performing sensitivity analysis in which the computational effort for the simulations is limited due to the small scale of the numerical models the uncertainties can however be significantly reduced if the cementation factor and the porosity mgs relationship is estimated performing appropriate laboratory investigations of the material of the

dr vincent post for his review and the constructive comments as well as the reviewer dr giacomo medici for his thorough remarks and suggestions that significantly improved the presentation of this work appendix a clearness of the parts of the aquifer with the higher gamma ray values in this study it is assumed that in the parts of the aquifer where the gamma ray values are larger than 30 api units the porous material is not clean i e its clay and silt content is not negligible in such areas not the intrinsic but the apparent formation factor fa can be estimated the latter includes not only the contribution of the conductance of the formation water as it is the case for the intrinsic formation factor fi but also the contribution of the clay silt conductance of the no clean formations urish 1981 fa is calculated from eq a 1 a 1 f i r xo r mf rxo ohm m is the resistivity measured with the short normal device see fig 4d and rmf ohm m is the resistivity of the mud filtrate with which the aquifer in the area close to the borehole is saturated see section 3 2 according to lamont 1957 the value of rmf is not significantly different from the electrical resistivity rm of the drilling mud therefore in this analysis we set rmf rm in the investigated borehole g4 fig 1b is rm 7 7 ohm m for the parts of the aquifer in which the porous material is not clean worthington 1993 proposed the following relationship between the apparent and the intrinsic formation factor a 2 f a f i b q v r o b mho cm2 meq represents the average mobility of cations near the grain surfaces and depends on the resistivity of the formation water qv meq ml is the cation exchange capacity per unit pore volume of the rock and varies with porosity the product bqv has units of conductivity and reflects the effect of surface conduction due to clay particles see worthington 1993 finally ro ohm m see also eq 2 is the resistivity of the formation in the undisturbed zone i e in the zone farther from the borehole which is saturated with the formation water the value of ro results from the long normal resistivity log fig 4e which due to the distance of the electrodes of the device provides resistivity values from the undisturbed area farther from the borehole where the formation water is the dominating fluid see schneider 1973 page 304 driscoll 1987 page 183 having the values of fi from eq a 1 and the values of ro eq a 2 allows checking the clearness in different parts of the aquifer by plotting fa versus ro for these parts since the thickness of the sections with gr 30 ari in the investigated aquifer is relative small see fig 4c it can be assumed that the porosity and consequently the factor bqv see eq a 2 in them is approximately constant in each of the aforementioned plots we fit a straight line since according to worthington 1993 in no clean sections is fa fi the no clean sections are these in which the slope of the straight line fitted to the plot of fa versus ro is negative fa fi the intercept of the strait line in this plot equals to fi of the corresponding section for all the points in these sections the values of the formation factor calculated from eq a 1 are replaced by the intercept of the straight line of the corresponding fa versus ro plot the so estimated fi profile for the borehole g4 along with the values of the apparent formation factor in the non clean areas is shown in fig 4f 
5184,at site flood frequency analysis ffa in arid semi arid watersheds poses unique challenges to researchers and practitioners due to the generally limited data records this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of ffa in arid semi arid watersheds in relation to the unique characteristics of these regions such as the limited number of floods occurring each year and the large variability of the flood peak discharges study cases in israel and the us are examined and compared with non arid watersheds characterized by mediterranean climate and with synthetic flood records results show that the tail of extreme value distributions describing arid semi arid watersheds is found to be heavier than the one describing mediterranean watersheds the number of yearly floods and the variability of flood peak discharge are shown to have a crucial impact on the accuracy of the quantile estimates with smaller number of events per year and larger coefficient of variation of flood peak discharge being related to larger errors in the estimated quantiles partial duration series approach provides a slightly reduced bias in the estimates but should not be blindly preferred over annual maxima series as it presents comparable estimation uncertainty in general the generalized extreme value and the generalized pareto distribution are found to be non optimal choices for the examined arid semi arid watersheds keywords flood frequency analysis arid semi arid regions annual maxima series partial duration series extreme value theory parameter estimation 1 introduction hydrological design and flood risk management require estimates of quantiles of the peak discharges characterized by low yearly exceedance probability at a given location flood frequency analysis ffa aims at identifying analytical distributions reproducing the cumulative distribution of observed extreme flood peaks e g the series of annual maximum peak and whose tail is expected to represent the probability of exceeding extreme and potentially still unobserved discharges the typical approach relies on observations and assumes stationarity of both catchment hydrological response and climatic forcing however despite the large amount of research devoted to the topic there is still no consensus on a standard methodology able to provide information for an arbitrary gauged catchment and even less for ungauged catchments or nonstationary conditions coles 2001 franÃ§ois et al 2019 katz 2002 a large number of studies focus on two distribution classes to describe extreme flood peak discharges namely the generalized extreme value gev distribution for annual maxima and the generalized pareto gp distribution for the peaks exceeding a large threshold these choices originate from the extreme value theorem fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 which demonstrates that the extreme values of independent and identically distributed random variables can only converge to these distributions as stated by haan 2002 there is no direct theoretical connection between any analytical form of the frequency distribution and the underlying mechanisms governing flood flows except through the limit theorems and these general results provide a priori knowledge of the distribution describing the extremes thus limiting the problem to the estimation of the distribution parameters however reality is far from the asymptotic behavior and even in presence of perfectly measured independent and identically distributed peaks an infinite number of floods per year or a large enough threshold are required for the theorem to hold and practitioners sometimes rely on different distributions which seem to better represent the available observations however the gev and gp distributions are widely used for ffa worldwide as they represent a commonly accepted background ashkar and ba 2017 ben zvi 2016 castillo and hadi 1997 hosking et al 1985 hosking and wallis 1987 katz 2002 martins and stedinger 2000 meirovich et al 1998 morrison and smith 2002 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 rahman et al 2013 solari et al 2017 villarini and smith 2010 this becomes crucial for future studies aiming at describing extreme flood peaks at large global scales such as the ones already performed for precipitation e g papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 depending on the available data series applications may follow two approaches the first is based on the maximum flood peak discharges observed during equally long temporal blocks which are expected to follow a gev distribution it is usually known by annual maxima series ams as due to meteorological periodicity reasons the temporal blocks are chosen to be of a year length the second approach based on independent flood peaks exceeding a high pre defined threshold is known as partial duration series pds or peaks over threshold in this case the exceedances are expected to follow a gp distribution the choice among these stands with the practitioner and depends on the available data the sought level of complexity in the data treatment and a trade off between estimation bias and uncertainty davison et al 1990 specifically ams makes use of limited data and allows to easily ensure independence of the flood peaks while pds allows to include more than one flood per year attempting to decrease the parameter estimation variance at the price of methodological complexities i e independence of flood peaks needs to be ensured and a proper threshold needs to be chosen among others two methods are more frequently used for the distribution parameter estimation from the data series the maximum likelihood ml and the probability weighted moments pwm greenwood et al 1979 sillitto 1951 the pwm method is formally equivalent to the method of the l moments since pwm and l moments are linearly related ferreira and de haan 2015 hosking et al 1985 hosking and wallis 1987 martins and stedinger 2000 the ml method is generally deemed more accurate for the general case while the pwm is renowned for a reduced estimation variance in presence of short records and reduced sensitivity to outliers i e values particularly larger than the typical values in the record arid semi arid regions cover about a third of the land area globally with indications that both the extent of the area and the residing population living there are increasing huang et al 2016 nicholson 2011 despite this studies focusing on ffa in these regions are quite rare zaman et al 2012 in non arid regions many studies comparing the ams and pds approaches are available sometimes finding the pds e g bezak et al 2014 on the sava river in slovenia rahman et al 2013 on some regions of australia or the ams approach to be preferable rahman et al 2013 on other regions of australia interestingly recent studies based on data from the us could not find particular improvements of the pds over the ams in presence of short data records schumer et al 2014 hu et al 2019 similarly contrasting results are available on the parameter estimation method rahman et al 2013 even if general agreement on the better performance of pwm for limited data records was reached martins and stedinger 2000 hu et al 2019 regional growth curves i e dimensionless frequency curves representing the regional analogous to at site frequency curves of arid regions were found to be heavier tailed than humid regions farquharson et al 1992 zaman et al 2012 also as a consequence of the limited number of floods observed in each year in a global scale regional ffa study smith et al 2014 show that arid regional regression models perform poorer than humid regional models presumably because arid regions are spatially more heterogeneous in particular arid regions represent a particularly interesting case as they pose a number of climate specific challenges arid catchments are characterized by a small number of flows per year with frequent no flow years by a large variability of flood peak discharges and by limited lengths of observational records cohn et al 2013 knighton and nanson 2001 schumer et al 2014 as such arid regions are further away from the asymptotic behavior described above this together with the generally limited length of observational records might create practical problems for the parameter estimation and in the case of pds for the choice of the threshold it is thus crucial to understand the effects of these characteristics on ffa in arid semi arid watersheds to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive study fully exploring the impact of arid flood record characteristics on ffa this study focuses on two study regions israel and us with two climatic zones each arid semi arid and mediterranean and uses observed flood records and synthetic records from a specifically developed stochastic flood generator to improve our understanding of these issues three research questions are addressed 1 what are the tail characteristics of flood distributions in arid semi arid catchments in comparison to more humid regions 2 how do sparse flood occurrence short record length and other arid semi arid flood characteristics affect ffa and its uncertainty 3 which approach and parameter estimation methods are more adequate for ffa in arid semi arid catchments the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the study regions and data collection and processing are presented in section 3 ffa and flood generator methods are provided in section 4 the results of the study are presented discussion and conclusions sections 5 and 6 respectively end the paper 2 study regions and data the study focuses on watersheds characterized by arid semi arid climate regimes in israel and us fig 1 mediterranean watersheds in the same two areas are used as a comparison because they are geographically close and thus characterized by similar precipitation patterns and seasonality but larger yearly precipitation amounts the climatic regions are defined following the koppen geiger classification peel et al 2007 arid semi arid watersheds are defined as arid hot desert bwh or arid hot steppe bsh climates while mediterranean watersheds by temperate hot and dry summer csa climate arid semi arid watersheds in israel are located in the southern part of the country fig 1 mean annual precipitation ranges between 20 and 500 mm yr 1 flood occurrence and magnitude fig 2 a follow the precipitation climatology with most of the floods in the winter months december to february when mediterranean lows deliver most of the annual precipitation to the area and fewer floods but with larger unit peak discharges in the transition months when strong convection is frequently brought by active red sea troughs and more rarely tropical plumes armon et al 2018 kahana et al 2002 the israeli watersheds are characterized by large areas of bare rock and shallow soils such as lithosols with mostly absence of vegetation and with the presence of debris cover and desert pavement some of the watersheds mainly in the north eastern part of the study region have wetter upstream areas where one can find more urbanization and cultivated areas over more developed soils such as luvisols some sections of the channel beds are covered in alluviums greenbaum et al 2006 shentsis et al 1999 zoccatelli et al 2019 selected mediterranean watersheds in israel are situated in the northern part of the country with mean annual precipitation ranging between 400 and 700 mm yr 1 flood data obtained from the israeli hydrological service have gone through the regular data quality assurance of such institutions stage discharge rating curves are examined and updated when necessary stations are visited regularly however one should be aware that streamflow data in arid regions may suffer from inherent challenges such as changes in channel cross sections during flood events due to incision or sediment deposition few direct measurements at high flood stages due to limited accessibility in such situations sub optimal flow conditions due to the typical steep gradients and possible non uniform flow over the cross sections events with corrupted or unreliable data were removed from the data set the gaps in this study were not great and did not affect the analysis as the data for frequency analysis does not depend on sequential uninterrupted data the obtained data were already separated into independent flood events data records include flood peak discharges from all flow events recorded in the hydrometric stations after quality control 18 stations were chosen for the arid semi arid region fig 1 and table a 1 and 16 for the mediterranean region fig 1 and table a 3 based on the criterion of having at least 15 years of quality controlled data the arid semi arid us study area includes watersheds clustered in two areas in the southwestern part of the country us watersheds exhibit a broad range of hydrogeological properties like the israeli watersheds extensive regions of bare rock and shallow soils characterize a number of the watersheds for a summary of watershed properties and their relations to flood processes in arid semi arid watersheds in the us see smith et al 2018 and references therein in arizona the watersheds belong to the lower colorado region with mean annual precipitation between 200 and 700 mm yr 1 in texas three watersheds belong to the texas gulf region and one watershed to the rio grande river basin the mean annual precipitation ranges between 400 and 600 mm yr 1 floods mostly 50 occur during summer fig 2b in phase with the largest unit peak discharges however large floods are also reported during winter in the transition seasons there are fewer floods with very low unit peak discharge the mediterranean watersheds of the us regions are situated in the northern part of california and southern oregon with the mean annual precipitation ranging from 500 to over 900 mm yr 1 we use us geological survey usgs stream gaging records to examine flood peak distributions see ryberg et al 2017 a recent summary of usgs discharge measurements is provided in turnipseed and sauer 2010 measurements of many extreme floods are made by indirect discharge methods involving field measurements of peak water surface profiles and channel cross sections combined with hydraulic computations costa and jarrett 2008 indirect measurements are made for floods at stream gaging sites when the gage is destroyed or fails to operate properly peak discharge from indirect measurements have significant errors especially for the most extreme flood peaks in arid semi arid regions see costa and jarrett 2008 smith et al 2019 2018 flood records were retrieved from the usgs including i continuous data records containing instantaneous discharge values and ii annual peak discharge records that typically have longer records in addition to the 15 year quality controlled minimum record watersheds draining more than 5000 km2 or with substantial urban areas were excluded from the analysis to better match the characteristics of the israeli watersheds after this selection 21 arid semi arid watersheds fig 1 and table a 2 and 36 mediterranean watersheds were used for the analysis fig 1 and table a 4 both types of records were retained for arid semi arid watersheds while only the annual peak discharge records were used for mediterranean watersheds analysis continuous data required separation of independent floods events are considered independent when separated by at least 24 h with discharge lower than twice the median flow of the station after sensitivity analysis this threshold was chosen as the largest threshold providing consistent estimates of the distribution parameters across the watersheds 3 methods 3 1 flood frequency analysis when dealing with ffa one should consider that identical distribution is assumed i e stationarity as the available records are typically short and over dispersed potential non stationary models cannot be extracted from the available data we will thus stand with serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and assume stationarity in light of the relatively short and high variance available records 3 2 ams approach ams are prepared by taking the maximum peak discharge observed in each hydrological year oct 1st sep 30th the gev has the following cumulative distribution function coles 2001 1 g x e x p 1 Î¾ x Î¼ Ï 1 Î¾ Î¾ 0 exp exp x Î¼ Ï Î¾ 0 where x is the data Î¼ is the location parameter Ï is the scale parameter and Î¾ is the shape parameter a shape parameter larger than 0 indicates a power type tail the decay rate is slower than exponential and a shape parameter smaller than 0 indicates upper bounded distributions 3 3 pds approach pds data consist of all the independent flood peaks exceeding a given threshold the threshold selection is far from being straightforward see dupuis 1999 and scarrott and macdonald 2012 for an in depth review and despite few automatic methods have been recently proposed for precipitation data e g fukutome et al 2015 solari et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge there is no method that has shown superiority over others across regions and climates additionally depending on the tail type the threshold selection was shown to be a potential source of systematic bias in the results papalexiou et al 2018 novel approaches ben zvi 2016 solari et al 2017 have been tested and found to lack robustness across regions and watersheds in particular large instability was reported for arid semi arid watersheds in order to adopt a robust methodology able to work in diverse climatic conditions we decided to adopt a simple and commonly used approach that sets the threshold able to identify a pre defined number of floods per year ben zvi 2016 reports that literature recommends to use between 1 and 5 floods per year dealing with arid watersheds the only way to fulfill the high enough requirement of evt is to use a small factor and therefore following cunnane 1979 and many others we adopt the recommended number of 1 65 flood per year sensitivity analyses on our watersheds showed no significant deviation of the results for factors between 1 5 and 2 the gp distribution is expected as the limiting distribution of the of a series of independent and identically distributed random variables exceeding a high enough threshold coles 2001 davison et al 1990 the gp has the following cumulative distribution function coles 2001 2 g x 1 1 Î¾ x Î¼ Ï 1 Î¾ Î¾ 0 1 exp x Î¼ Ï Î¾ 0 where x is the data Î¼ is the location parameter Ï is the scale parameter and Î¾ is the shape parameter as for the case of the gev a shape parameter larger smaller than 0 indicates a heavy light tail of the distribution the gp location parameter is also known as the threshold and x Î¼ is also referred to as exceedances above the threshold 3 4 parameter estimation methods in this study the ml and pwm methods are applied to derive the three parameters Î¼ Ï and Î¾ of the gev distribution fitting the ams and two Ï and Î¾ of the three parameters of the gp distribution fitting the pds as the gp location parameter Î¼ i e the threshold is set prior to parameter estimation for both methods we used the gevfit and gpdfit functions from the fextremes r package wuertz 2006 to estimate the parameters and calculate the distribution quantiles 3 5 uncertainty range estimation uncertainty is quantified using a non parametric bootstrapping method hall et al 2004 overeem et al 2008 as recommended by hall et al 2004 we used 1000 samples with replacement among the hydrological years in the record in the case of pds the threshold discharge and the peaks exceeding the threshold are newly determined at each resample the distribution parameters are then estimated and the quantiles calculated uncertainty is quantified as the 95 range i e the range between the 2 5 and the 97 5 bounds for assessment of the extent of the uncertainty a normalized uncertainty range is defined as the ratio of the uncertainty range i e the difference between the 97 5 and the 2 5 bounds by the estimated return level 3 6 estimation of the tail heaviness we quantify the heaviness of the distribution tails using the tail ratio defined here as the ratio between the 100 year and the 10 year flood peaks heavier tails will be characterized by larger ratios and vice versa the method is similar to the method presented in smith et al 2018 but the ratio between maximal observed and 10 year flood peak was used 3 7 uncertainty in shape parameter estimated from short records record length is a major contributor to ffa uncertainty martins and stedinger 2000 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 and due to the lower density of monitoring stations is a typical issue affecting arid semi arid regions nicholson 2011 here we examine the effect of record length on the uncertainty in the shape parameter estimation to do so stations with records exceeding 50 years were selected 3 stations from israel and 11 from us ensembles were created by bootstrapping 1000 repetitions records increasing from 15 years to the full record length of the station and the uncertainty in the gev pwm shape parameter was computed for as the 95 interval 3 8 synthetic arid semi arid flood generator a synthetic flood generator is developed to produce realistic flood records characterized by i the desired distribution of the number of floods observed annually and ii the desired parent distribution describing the flood peak discharges in arid semi arid regions the distribution of the annual number of floods is often over dispersed 80 of the examined watersheds fig 3 thus a negative binomial distribution more adequate in over dispersed conditions than a poisson distribution lang et al 1999 was chosen concerning the parent distribution describing the flood peak discharges four distributions were examined weibull pareto log normal and gamma in this case both goodness of fit tests and graphical diagnosis were used it was found that the log normal distribution best fits the data of most of the arid semi arid stations where this might be the case in this study other distributions may be better for modelling peak discharge distribution for other regions or climates log normal distribution of flood peak was also found to be a good model for ordinary events by zhang et al 2019 parameters of the negative binomial and log normal distributions were estimated at each station using the ml method in the fitdistrplus and mass r packages delignette muller and dutang 2015 venables and ripley 2002 the obtained parameters are presented in fig 4 and their median values were used in the flood generator to create arid semi arid flood records with the desired characteristics 4 results 4 1 ffa in arid semi arid regions fig 5 shows the 10 and 100 year flood unit peak discharge estimated using ml and pwm over arid semi arid watersheds in israel as a function of the catchment area the regional envelope curve for eastern mediterranean region presented by tarolli et al 2012 is superimposed by construction envelope curves provide an estimate of the regional upper bound to the unit peak discharges to be expected as a function of the watershed area enzel et al 1993 if the data record used to build the curves is complete only particularly rare floods are expected to exceed the envelope curves the figure shows that in many cases 100 year floods estimated using ml substantially exceed the regional envelope curve this indicates that ml provides unreliable estimates for our dataset thus we will focus hereafter on the pwm estimation method across the regions the normalized uncertainty of lower quantiles e g 10 years is smaller for gp than for gev fig 6 the normalized uncertainty for israel is larger than that of the us for the gev distribution and for larger quantiles this may be attributed to the shorter records available for stations in israel medians are 34 5 and 50 years for israel and us respectively the normalized uncertainty tends to increase with return period for gp while no consistent pattern is observed for gev fig 6 with the 10 year normalized uncertainty being larger than the 50 year it is worth noting that the general behavior of the uncertainties for the two approaches is consistent among the two study regions instilling confidence in the robustness of the results fig 7 also shows how the pds approach generally provides smaller uncertainty in particular for shorter return periods 10 and 50 year while less advantages are observed for longer return periods 100 and 250 year particularly in the us given the recent debate on the topic e g hu et al 2019 marra et al 2018 schlÃ¶gl and laaha 2016 we test the common assumption that the pds approach is preferable over the ams due to the larger amount of data points used in the former for the parameters estimation ben zvi 2016 castillo and hadi 1997 morrison and smith 2002 focusing on arid semi arid watersheds to do so we examined whether pds estimated values are within the uncertainty range of ams estimates and vice versa fig 7 all values were normalized by dividing by the estimated pds gp peak discharge fig 7a and ams gev estimated peak discharge fig 7b almost in all cases the estimated values of the gp or gev are within the uncertainty range of the competing distribution with the only exception of the us in which the longer return periods e g 50 and 100 year of the gp estimation is sometimes comparable to the upper gev uncertainty bound a similar analysis is performed based on the synthetic flood record a long synthetic flood record is created 105 years to represent the population 1000 series of 60 years similar to real site record lengths are sampled and their flood peak discharge and uncertainty is estimated using gev pwm and gp pwm fig 8 in this case the reference discharge for a given quantile can be empirically derived from the population results here show that gp slightly outperforms gev it is however worth noting how both approaches underestimate the reference peak discharge this aspect will be addressed in detail in the following 4 2 comparison of arid semi arid vs mediterranean watersheds in this section the arid semi arid climate watersheds are compared with the mediterranean climate watersheds owing to the type of available data only the ams approach is used for such comparison the results above however showed comparable behavior among the two approaches pwm is chosen for the parameter estimation due to the superior performance highlighted above fig 9 presents the distributions of the tail ratios in the different regions and climates the distributions of the tail ratio for the gev pwm were compared using the welch test welch 1951 followed by the ad hoc games howell test games and howell 1976 for pairwise comparison both tests are specifically suitable for heteroscedastic samples with unequal sizes heteroscedasticity was determined using the levene and bartlett tests levene 1960 snedecor and cochran 1989 all differences were found to be significant with one interesting exception no significant difference is observed between israeli mediterranean watersheds and arid us watersheds this should not come as a surprise given that the climatic classification considers many factors including temperature and seasonality while other factors such as the mean annual precipitation amounts are comparable in the two areas the distribution of unit peak discharge for different return periods and climatic regions is presented in fig 10 a the unit peak discharge for mediterranean regions is larger for shorter return periods i e 10 50 years but peak discharge of arid semi arid floods of 100 and 250 year return periods are found to exceed the corresponding mediterranean floods in the us in addition the ratio of the 250 year to the 10 year flood was examined this ratio can be used to compare the upper tail across watersheds in a similar manner to the upper tail ratio that is used in smith et al 2018 the mean ratio for the arid semi arid watersheds 6 84 for israel 7 06 for the us is larger than the one in mediterranean watersheds 5 04 for israel 2 68 for the us a comparison of the normalized uncertainty ranges across the analyzed climates and regions indicates that the median normalized uncertainty range is larger for the arid semi arid watersheds fig 10b in particular the uncertainty range of the us mediterranean watersheds is significantly smaller than the other climate regions this is probably due to the longer record length median of 74 years as compared to 34 5 50 and 42 of arid semi arid israel arid semi arid us and mediterranean israel regions respectively even if the possibility that gev and gp are better suited to these watersheds than arid ones cannot be excluded 4 3 sensitivity to the characteristics of arid semi arid flood records fig 11 shows the uncertainty in the gev pwm tail ratio estimated from record between 15 years and the full length for stations that have at least 50 year record as expected uncertainty range is negatively correlated with record length and its rate of change decreases with record length second we explore the effects of record length on the estimation of quantiles and parameters using the synthetic flood generator records of 15 to 500 year long were created and the 100 year flood magnitude was estimated for both gev and gp for this analysis the reference 100 year flood is known from the full 105 year synthetic record and the bias defined as the ratio between the estimated and reference peak discharge is computed fig 12 a both distributions tend to underestimate the 100 year flood i e a value of 1 is equal to no bias for all record lengths longer records provide less biased estimates but a clear convergence to the reference value is not reported even for 500 year records this non convergence of the estimates to the record is counter intuitive and could be related to the fact that in the arid watersheds of israel it is quite common to have one two or even no floods in a given year table a 1 while for the arid semi arid watersheds in the us the number of floods in a year may exceed ten but still remaining limited table a 2 and fig 12d bottom in order to quantify the extent of the estimation error we created different synthetic series with different mean number of flood events per year by altering the mean parameter of the negative binomial distribution describing the number of yearly floods the log normal distribution describing the individual floods intensities was kept unchanged fig 12d presents the bias as a function of the mean number of events per year the distributions of the mean number of annual floods for all stations in the study are given at the bottom of fig 12d grouped by climate as expected the bias for all the distributions and estimation methods decreases when the mean number of events per year increases and converges to 1 for 20 30 floods per year both distributions tend to underestimate the reference value by up to 20 for less than 5 events per year the occurrence of years with no flow is a common feature in the arid semi arid watersheds in israel in the us stations all years had at least one flood event the fraction of years with no flows ranges up to 37 with a mean of 15 3 in the israeli arid watersheds using the synthetic flood generator we quantified the effect of no flow years on ffa of the gev distribution fig 12b in general underestimation of the 50 and 100 year return periods is observed as a consequence of years with no flows the underestimation worsens as the percent of years with no flow increases but it is most notable in the extreme case of 50 years with no flow another typical feature of flood discharge in arid semi arid regions is its large variability chouaib et al 2018 nicholson 2011 this translates to a larger coefficient of variation cv of flood peak discharges than in humid regions salinas et al 2014 fig 12c bottom in order to examine what is affected by this the accuracy of 100 year flood estimation we produced synthetic records representing different cvs by alterations of the synthetic generator lognormal distribution and leaving the binomial distribution describing the number of yearly floods unchanged the distributions of the cv for all stations in the study are given at the bottom of fig 12c grouped by climate as expected the relative error increases as cv increases both distributions underestimate the 100 year flood for large cvs e g for cv 5 the gev pwm is 0 91 of the reference flood and the gp pwm is 0 93 of the reference flood but for a cv smaller than 3 the estimation is quite accurate gp seems the more accurate for most cv values 5 discussion rainfall frequency studies have shown evidences of a heavier tail in arid semi arid regions ben zvi 2009 marra et al 2017 marra and morin 2015 morin et al 2020 and few ffa studies have shown some degree of inheritance in the flood tail characteristics farquharson et al 1992 smith et al 2014 zaman et al 2012 we found the tail of flood distributions in arid semi arid watersheds to be significantly heavier than in mediterranean watersheds of the same region fig 9 this confirms what is reported for rainfall and may be attributed to the climatic and physical characteristics of arid semi arid watersheds such as high energy high intensity convective rainfall events camarasa belmonte and soriano 2014 zaman et al 2012 low infiltration capacities morin and benyamini 1977 and to the small scale of the examined watersheds more likely to respond to the more skewed distributions of short duration rainfall marra and morin 2015 and of the synoptic events more characterizing the arid portions of the region marra et al 2019 at the same time statistical reasons related to the smaller number of floods per year are likely to contribute to this and cannot be excluded a priori our results confirm the vital importance of quantification and communication of the uncertainty in the estimated quantiles in arid semi arid watersheds the uncertainty range may be as large as the estimated quantiles surprisingly also for relatively short return periods fig 6 it is a common belief that in presence of short records the pds approach should outperform the ams thanks to the larger amount of data used for the parameter estimation bezak et al 2014 nagy et al 2017 this however comes at the price of methodological complexities threshold estimation separation of independent floods which might lead to biases in ffa in arid areas owing to the high variability of flood peak discharge a simple threshold estimation method must be adopted we found similar performance between gev and gp in terms of uncertainty estimation fig 7 fig 8 confirming previous results by hu et al 2019 marra et al 2018 and schlÃ¶gl and laaha 2016 results from this study show how parameter estimation by means of ml in arid semi arid watersheds often leads to unrealistic values fig 5 this confirms previous findings in which pwm was shown to outperform ml in the estimation of parameters from short data records e g martins and stedinger 2000 hosking and wallis 1987 dupuis 1999 and stresses the particular importance of parameter estimation method for arid semi arid regions gev and gp seem to provide poorer estimates in arid areas due to the small number of floods per year in addition since the lognormal distribution is in the domain of attraction of the gumbel distribution i e the gev with shape parameter equal to zero but this convergence is very slow the fact that flood peaks in these areas were found to follow such distribution an extremely large number of floods per year are required to reach the asymptotic gev more specifically i the limited mean number of floods per year fig 12b and d and ii the large variability of flood peak discharge fig 12c are found to significantly affect peak discharge estimates the pds approach is found to perform slightly better since the use of a threshold is likely to remove low flows and no flows from data series used for the parameter estimation regionalization approaches could be attempted to decrease the observed uncertainties even if the lack of data makes it more difficult to define homogeneous regions in arid areas with respect to other regions alternative estimation methods such as the mixed method by morrison and smith 2002 as well as recently developed methodologies for extreme value analysis might be able to overcome the limitations of traditional methods in arid regions the metastatistical extreme value framework marani and ignaccolo 2015 which allows to relax the asymptotic assumption on the number of floods per year and vastly increase the data sample thus reducing the issues related to short record lengths marra et al 2018 zorzetto et al 2016 was recently tested to model extreme flood peak discharge in a large sample of catchments in the contiguous unites states and found to outperform traditional methods in more than 75 of the cases miniussi et al 2020 more specifically its simplified version marra et al 2019 promises improved estimates of the flood peak discharge distribution in presence of limited number of floods in each year 6 conclusions this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the use of the generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto gp distributions flood frequency analysis in arid semi arid watersheds special attention is given to the impact of the peculiar characteristics of these watersheds namely i the limited number of floods per year and ii the large variability of flood peak discharges study cases in israel and the us are examined together with control watersheds characterized by mediterranean climate and synthetic flood records reproducing the characteristics of arid semi arid records the main findings of the study are as follows for the examined data records the tail ratio of extreme floods in arid semi arid watersheds is larger than the one describing mediterranean watersheds indicating a heavier tail and confirming previous observations on short duration rainfall the mean number of floods per year and the coefficient of variation of flood peak discharge have a crucial impact on the accuracy of the estimates a smaller number of events per year and b larger coefficient of variation of the flood peak discharge distributions are related to large errors in the estimated quantiles irrespective of the adopted approach annual maxima vs partial duration series the use of partial duration series approach provides slightly improved estimates because the use of a threshold reduces the amount of low flows and no flows in the data series however no significant advantage is observed in term of estimation uncertainty estimates obtained using one of the two approaches are consistently within the other s uncertainty range from a practical point of view due to the increase complexity partial duration series should be preferred only after a careful examination of the characteristics of individual case of interest arid watersheds are further from the asymptotic behavior than catchments in more humid hydro climatic conditions and the gev and gp distributions provided poorer estimates of extreme quantiles in arid than in mediterranean this problem was enhanced when maximum likelihood methods were used for the parameter estimation in arid semi arid regions the challenges faced by practitioners when assessing design floods through flood frequency analysis are exacerbated in general findings from this study indicate that in arid semi arid watersheds maximal likelihood estimation method should not be used even in presence of long data records the partial duration series approach should not be blindly preferred over the annual maxima series approach and the uncertainty in the estimated quantiles should not be overlooked credit

5184,at site flood frequency analysis ffa in arid semi arid watersheds poses unique challenges to researchers and practitioners due to the generally limited data records this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of ffa in arid semi arid watersheds in relation to the unique characteristics of these regions such as the limited number of floods occurring each year and the large variability of the flood peak discharges study cases in israel and the us are examined and compared with non arid watersheds characterized by mediterranean climate and with synthetic flood records results show that the tail of extreme value distributions describing arid semi arid watersheds is found to be heavier than the one describing mediterranean watersheds the number of yearly floods and the variability of flood peak discharge are shown to have a crucial impact on the accuracy of the quantile estimates with smaller number of events per year and larger coefficient of variation of flood peak discharge being related to larger errors in the estimated quantiles partial duration series approach provides a slightly reduced bias in the estimates but should not be blindly preferred over annual maxima series as it presents comparable estimation uncertainty in general the generalized extreme value and the generalized pareto distribution are found to be non optimal choices for the examined arid semi arid watersheds keywords flood frequency analysis arid semi arid regions annual maxima series partial duration series extreme value theory parameter estimation 1 introduction hydrological design and flood risk management require estimates of quantiles of the peak discharges characterized by low yearly exceedance probability at a given location flood frequency analysis ffa aims at identifying analytical distributions reproducing the cumulative distribution of observed extreme flood peaks e g the series of annual maximum peak and whose tail is expected to represent the probability of exceeding extreme and potentially still unobserved discharges the typical approach relies on observations and assumes stationarity of both catchment hydrological response and climatic forcing however despite the large amount of research devoted to the topic there is still no consensus on a standard methodology able to provide information for an arbitrary gauged catchment and even less for ungauged catchments or nonstationary conditions coles 2001 franÃ§ois et al 2019 katz 2002 a large number of studies focus on two distribution classes to describe extreme flood peak discharges namely the generalized extreme value gev distribution for annual maxima and the generalized pareto gp distribution for the peaks exceeding a large threshold these choices originate from the extreme value theorem fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 which demonstrates that the extreme values of independent and identically distributed random variables can only converge to these distributions as stated by haan 2002 there is no direct theoretical connection between any analytical form of the frequency distribution and the underlying mechanisms governing flood flows except through the limit theorems and these general results provide a priori knowledge of the distribution describing the extremes thus limiting the problem to the estimation of the distribution parameters however reality is far from the asymptotic behavior and even in presence of perfectly measured independent and identically distributed peaks an infinite number of floods per year or a large enough threshold are required for the theorem to hold and practitioners sometimes rely on different distributions which seem to better represent the available observations however the gev and gp distributions are widely used for ffa worldwide as they represent a commonly accepted background ashkar and ba 2017 ben zvi 2016 castillo and hadi 1997 hosking et al 1985 hosking and wallis 1987 katz 2002 martins and stedinger 2000 meirovich et al 1998 morrison and smith 2002 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 rahman et al 2013 solari et al 2017 villarini and smith 2010 this becomes crucial for future studies aiming at describing extreme flood peaks at large global scales such as the ones already performed for precipitation e g papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 depending on the available data series applications may follow two approaches the first is based on the maximum flood peak discharges observed during equally long temporal blocks which are expected to follow a gev distribution it is usually known by annual maxima series ams as due to meteorological periodicity reasons the temporal blocks are chosen to be of a year length the second approach based on independent flood peaks exceeding a high pre defined threshold is known as partial duration series pds or peaks over threshold in this case the exceedances are expected to follow a gp distribution the choice among these stands with the practitioner and depends on the available data the sought level of complexity in the data treatment and a trade off between estimation bias and uncertainty davison et al 1990 specifically ams makes use of limited data and allows to easily ensure independence of the flood peaks while pds allows to include more than one flood per year attempting to decrease the parameter estimation variance at the price of methodological complexities i e independence of flood peaks needs to be ensured and a proper threshold needs to be chosen among others two methods are more frequently used for the distribution parameter estimation from the data series the maximum likelihood ml and the probability weighted moments pwm greenwood et al 1979 sillitto 1951 the pwm method is formally equivalent to the method of the l moments since pwm and l moments are linearly related ferreira and de haan 2015 hosking et al 1985 hosking and wallis 1987 martins and stedinger 2000 the ml method is generally deemed more accurate for the general case while the pwm is renowned for a reduced estimation variance in presence of short records and reduced sensitivity to outliers i e values particularly larger than the typical values in the record arid semi arid regions cover about a third of the land area globally with indications that both the extent of the area and the residing population living there are increasing huang et al 2016 nicholson 2011 despite this studies focusing on ffa in these regions are quite rare zaman et al 2012 in non arid regions many studies comparing the ams and pds approaches are available sometimes finding the pds e g bezak et al 2014 on the sava river in slovenia rahman et al 2013 on some regions of australia or the ams approach to be preferable rahman et al 2013 on other regions of australia interestingly recent studies based on data from the us could not find particular improvements of the pds over the ams in presence of short data records schumer et al 2014 hu et al 2019 similarly contrasting results are available on the parameter estimation method rahman et al 2013 even if general agreement on the better performance of pwm for limited data records was reached martins and stedinger 2000 hu et al 2019 regional growth curves i e dimensionless frequency curves representing the regional analogous to at site frequency curves of arid regions were found to be heavier tailed than humid regions farquharson et al 1992 zaman et al 2012 also as a consequence of the limited number of floods observed in each year in a global scale regional ffa study smith et al 2014 show that arid regional regression models perform poorer than humid regional models presumably because arid regions are spatially more heterogeneous in particular arid regions represent a particularly interesting case as they pose a number of climate specific challenges arid catchments are characterized by a small number of flows per year with frequent no flow years by a large variability of flood peak discharges and by limited lengths of observational records cohn et al 2013 knighton and nanson 2001 schumer et al 2014 as such arid regions are further away from the asymptotic behavior described above this together with the generally limited length of observational records might create practical problems for the parameter estimation and in the case of pds for the choice of the threshold it is thus crucial to understand the effects of these characteristics on ffa in arid semi arid watersheds to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive study fully exploring the impact of arid flood record characteristics on ffa this study focuses on two study regions israel and us with two climatic zones each arid semi arid and mediterranean and uses observed flood records and synthetic records from a specifically developed stochastic flood generator to improve our understanding of these issues three research questions are addressed 1 what are the tail characteristics of flood distributions in arid semi arid catchments in comparison to more humid regions 2 how do sparse flood occurrence short record length and other arid semi arid flood characteristics affect ffa and its uncertainty 3 which approach and parameter estimation methods are more adequate for ffa in arid semi arid catchments the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the study regions and data collection and processing are presented in section 3 ffa and flood generator methods are provided in section 4 the results of the study are presented discussion and conclusions sections 5 and 6 respectively end the paper 2 study regions and data the study focuses on watersheds characterized by arid semi arid climate regimes in israel and us fig 1 mediterranean watersheds in the same two areas are used as a comparison because they are geographically close and thus characterized by similar precipitation patterns and seasonality but larger yearly precipitation amounts the climatic regions are defined following the koppen geiger classification peel et al 2007 arid semi arid watersheds are defined as arid hot desert bwh or arid hot steppe bsh climates while mediterranean watersheds by temperate hot and dry summer csa climate arid semi arid watersheds in israel are located in the southern part of the country fig 1 mean annual precipitation ranges between 20 and 500 mm yr 1 flood occurrence and magnitude fig 2 a follow the precipitation climatology with most of the floods in the winter months december to february when mediterranean lows deliver most of the annual precipitation to the area and fewer floods but with larger unit peak discharges in the transition months when strong convection is frequently brought by active red sea troughs and more rarely tropical plumes armon et al 2018 kahana et al 2002 the israeli watersheds are characterized by large areas of bare rock and shallow soils such as lithosols with mostly absence of vegetation and with the presence of debris cover and desert pavement some of the watersheds mainly in the north eastern part of the study region have wetter upstream areas where one can find more urbanization and cultivated areas over more developed soils such as luvisols some sections of the channel beds are covered in alluviums greenbaum et al 2006 shentsis et al 1999 zoccatelli et al 2019 selected mediterranean watersheds in israel are situated in the northern part of the country with mean annual precipitation ranging between 400 and 700 mm yr 1 flood data obtained from the israeli hydrological service have gone through the regular data quality assurance of such institutions stage discharge rating curves are examined and updated when necessary stations are visited regularly however one should be aware that streamflow data in arid regions may suffer from inherent challenges such as changes in channel cross sections during flood events due to incision or sediment deposition few direct measurements at high flood stages due to limited accessibility in such situations sub optimal flow conditions due to the typical steep gradients and possible non uniform flow over the cross sections events with corrupted or unreliable data were removed from the data set the gaps in this study were not great and did not affect the analysis as the data for frequency analysis does not depend on sequential uninterrupted data the obtained data were already separated into independent flood events data records include flood peak discharges from all flow events recorded in the hydrometric stations after quality control 18 stations were chosen for the arid semi arid region fig 1 and table a 1 and 16 for the mediterranean region fig 1 and table a 3 based on the criterion of having at least 15 years of quality controlled data the arid semi arid us study area includes watersheds clustered in two areas in the southwestern part of the country us watersheds exhibit a broad range of hydrogeological properties like the israeli watersheds extensive regions of bare rock and shallow soils characterize a number of the watersheds for a summary of watershed properties and their relations to flood processes in arid semi arid watersheds in the us see smith et al 2018 and references therein in arizona the watersheds belong to the lower colorado region with mean annual precipitation between 200 and 700 mm yr 1 in texas three watersheds belong to the texas gulf region and one watershed to the rio grande river basin the mean annual precipitation ranges between 400 and 600 mm yr 1 floods mostly 50 occur during summer fig 2b in phase with the largest unit peak discharges however large floods are also reported during winter in the transition seasons there are fewer floods with very low unit peak discharge the mediterranean watersheds of the us regions are situated in the northern part of california and southern oregon with the mean annual precipitation ranging from 500 to over 900 mm yr 1 we use us geological survey usgs stream gaging records to examine flood peak distributions see ryberg et al 2017 a recent summary of usgs discharge measurements is provided in turnipseed and sauer 2010 measurements of many extreme floods are made by indirect discharge methods involving field measurements of peak water surface profiles and channel cross sections combined with hydraulic computations costa and jarrett 2008 indirect measurements are made for floods at stream gaging sites when the gage is destroyed or fails to operate properly peak discharge from indirect measurements have significant errors especially for the most extreme flood peaks in arid semi arid regions see costa and jarrett 2008 smith et al 2019 2018 flood records were retrieved from the usgs including i continuous data records containing instantaneous discharge values and ii annual peak discharge records that typically have longer records in addition to the 15 year quality controlled minimum record watersheds draining more than 5000 km2 or with substantial urban areas were excluded from the analysis to better match the characteristics of the israeli watersheds after this selection 21 arid semi arid watersheds fig 1 and table a 2 and 36 mediterranean watersheds were used for the analysis fig 1 and table a 4 both types of records were retained for arid semi arid watersheds while only the annual peak discharge records were used for mediterranean watersheds analysis continuous data required separation of independent floods events are considered independent when separated by at least 24 h with discharge lower than twice the median flow of the station after sensitivity analysis this threshold was chosen as the largest threshold providing consistent estimates of the distribution parameters across the watersheds 3 methods 3 1 flood frequency analysis when dealing with ffa one should consider that identical distribution is assumed i e stationarity as the available records are typically short and over dispersed potential non stationary models cannot be extracted from the available data we will thus stand with serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and assume stationarity in light of the relatively short and high variance available records 3 2 ams approach ams are prepared by taking the maximum peak discharge observed in each hydrological year oct 1st sep 30th the gev has the following cumulative distribution function coles 2001 1 g x e x p 1 Î¾ x Î¼ Ï 1 Î¾ Î¾ 0 exp exp x Î¼ Ï Î¾ 0 where x is the data Î¼ is the location parameter Ï is the scale parameter and Î¾ is the shape parameter a shape parameter larger than 0 indicates a power type tail the decay rate is slower than exponential and a shape parameter smaller than 0 indicates upper bounded distributions 3 3 pds approach pds data consist of all the independent flood peaks exceeding a given threshold the threshold selection is far from being straightforward see dupuis 1999 and scarrott and macdonald 2012 for an in depth review and despite few automatic methods have been recently proposed for precipitation data e g fukutome et al 2015 solari et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge there is no method that has shown superiority over others across regions and climates additionally depending on the tail type the threshold selection was shown to be a potential source of systematic bias in the results papalexiou et al 2018 novel approaches ben zvi 2016 solari et al 2017 have been tested and found to lack robustness across regions and watersheds in particular large instability was reported for arid semi arid watersheds in order to adopt a robust methodology able to work in diverse climatic conditions we decided to adopt a simple and commonly used approach that sets the threshold able to identify a pre defined number of floods per year ben zvi 2016 reports that literature recommends to use between 1 and 5 floods per year dealing with arid watersheds the only way to fulfill the high enough requirement of evt is to use a small factor and therefore following cunnane 1979 and many others we adopt the recommended number of 1 65 flood per year sensitivity analyses on our watersheds showed no significant deviation of the results for factors between 1 5 and 2 the gp distribution is expected as the limiting distribution of the of a series of independent and identically distributed random variables exceeding a high enough threshold coles 2001 davison et al 1990 the gp has the following cumulative distribution function coles 2001 2 g x 1 1 Î¾ x Î¼ Ï 1 Î¾ Î¾ 0 1 exp x Î¼ Ï Î¾ 0 where x is the data Î¼ is the location parameter Ï is the scale parameter and Î¾ is the shape parameter as for the case of the gev a shape parameter larger smaller than 0 indicates a heavy light tail of the distribution the gp location parameter is also known as the threshold and x Î¼ is also referred to as exceedances above the threshold 3 4 parameter estimation methods in this study the ml and pwm methods are applied to derive the three parameters Î¼ Ï and Î¾ of the gev distribution fitting the ams and two Ï and Î¾ of the three parameters of the gp distribution fitting the pds as the gp location parameter Î¼ i e the threshold is set prior to parameter estimation for both methods we used the gevfit and gpdfit functions from the fextremes r package wuertz 2006 to estimate the parameters and calculate the distribution quantiles 3 5 uncertainty range estimation uncertainty is quantified using a non parametric bootstrapping method hall et al 2004 overeem et al 2008 as recommended by hall et al 2004 we used 1000 samples with replacement among the hydrological years in the record in the case of pds the threshold discharge and the peaks exceeding the threshold are newly determined at each resample the distribution parameters are then estimated and the quantiles calculated uncertainty is quantified as the 95 range i e the range between the 2 5 and the 97 5 bounds for assessment of the extent of the uncertainty a normalized uncertainty range is defined as the ratio of the uncertainty range i e the difference between the 97 5 and the 2 5 bounds by the estimated return level 3 6 estimation of the tail heaviness we quantify the heaviness of the distribution tails using the tail ratio defined here as the ratio between the 100 year and the 10 year flood peaks heavier tails will be characterized by larger ratios and vice versa the method is similar to the method presented in smith et al 2018 but the ratio between maximal observed and 10 year flood peak was used 3 7 uncertainty in shape parameter estimated from short records record length is a major contributor to ffa uncertainty martins and stedinger 2000 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 and due to the lower density of monitoring stations is a typical issue affecting arid semi arid regions nicholson 2011 here we examine the effect of record length on the uncertainty in the shape parameter estimation to do so stations with records exceeding 50 years were selected 3 stations from israel and 11 from us ensembles were created by bootstrapping 1000 repetitions records increasing from 15 years to the full record length of the station and the uncertainty in the gev pwm shape parameter was computed for as the 95 interval 3 8 synthetic arid semi arid flood generator a synthetic flood generator is developed to produce realistic flood records characterized by i the desired distribution of the number of floods observed annually and ii the desired parent distribution describing the flood peak discharges in arid semi arid regions the distribution of the annual number of floods is often over dispersed 80 of the examined watersheds fig 3 thus a negative binomial distribution more adequate in over dispersed conditions than a poisson distribution lang et al 1999 was chosen concerning the parent distribution describing the flood peak discharges four distributions were examined weibull pareto log normal and gamma in this case both goodness of fit tests and graphical diagnosis were used it was found that the log normal distribution best fits the data of most of the arid semi arid stations where this might be the case in this study other distributions may be better for modelling peak discharge distribution for other regions or climates log normal distribution of flood peak was also found to be a good model for ordinary events by zhang et al 2019 parameters of the negative binomial and log normal distributions were estimated at each station using the ml method in the fitdistrplus and mass r packages delignette muller and dutang 2015 venables and ripley 2002 the obtained parameters are presented in fig 4 and their median values were used in the flood generator to create arid semi arid flood records with the desired characteristics 4 results 4 1 ffa in arid semi arid regions fig 5 shows the 10 and 100 year flood unit peak discharge estimated using ml and pwm over arid semi arid watersheds in israel as a function of the catchment area the regional envelope curve for eastern mediterranean region presented by tarolli et al 2012 is superimposed by construction envelope curves provide an estimate of the regional upper bound to the unit peak discharges to be expected as a function of the watershed area enzel et al 1993 if the data record used to build the curves is complete only particularly rare floods are expected to exceed the envelope curves the figure shows that in many cases 100 year floods estimated using ml substantially exceed the regional envelope curve this indicates that ml provides unreliable estimates for our dataset thus we will focus hereafter on the pwm estimation method across the regions the normalized uncertainty of lower quantiles e g 10 years is smaller for gp than for gev fig 6 the normalized uncertainty for israel is larger than that of the us for the gev distribution and for larger quantiles this may be attributed to the shorter records available for stations in israel medians are 34 5 and 50 years for israel and us respectively the normalized uncertainty tends to increase with return period for gp while no consistent pattern is observed for gev fig 6 with the 10 year normalized uncertainty being larger than the 50 year it is worth noting that the general behavior of the uncertainties for the two approaches is consistent among the two study regions instilling confidence in the robustness of the results fig 7 also shows how the pds approach generally provides smaller uncertainty in particular for shorter return periods 10 and 50 year while less advantages are observed for longer return periods 100 and 250 year particularly in the us given the recent debate on the topic e g hu et al 2019 marra et al 2018 schlÃ¶gl and laaha 2016 we test the common assumption that the pds approach is preferable over the ams due to the larger amount of data points used in the former for the parameters estimation ben zvi 2016 castillo and hadi 1997 morrison and smith 2002 focusing on arid semi arid watersheds to do so we examined whether pds estimated values are within the uncertainty range of ams estimates and vice versa fig 7 all values were normalized by dividing by the estimated pds gp peak discharge fig 7a and ams gev estimated peak discharge fig 7b almost in all cases the estimated values of the gp or gev are within the uncertainty range of the competing distribution with the only exception of the us in which the longer return periods e g 50 and 100 year of the gp estimation is sometimes comparable to the upper gev uncertainty bound a similar analysis is performed based on the synthetic flood record a long synthetic flood record is created 105 years to represent the population 1000 series of 60 years similar to real site record lengths are sampled and their flood peak discharge and uncertainty is estimated using gev pwm and gp pwm fig 8 in this case the reference discharge for a given quantile can be empirically derived from the population results here show that gp slightly outperforms gev it is however worth noting how both approaches underestimate the reference peak discharge this aspect will be addressed in detail in the following 4 2 comparison of arid semi arid vs mediterranean watersheds in this section the arid semi arid climate watersheds are compared with the mediterranean climate watersheds owing to the type of available data only the ams approach is used for such comparison the results above however showed comparable behavior among the two approaches pwm is chosen for the parameter estimation due to the superior performance highlighted above fig 9 presents the distributions of the tail ratios in the different regions and climates the distributions of the tail ratio for the gev pwm were compared using the welch test welch 1951 followed by the ad hoc games howell test games and howell 1976 for pairwise comparison both tests are specifically suitable for heteroscedastic samples with unequal sizes heteroscedasticity was determined using the levene and bartlett tests levene 1960 snedecor and cochran 1989 all differences were found to be significant with one interesting exception no significant difference is observed between israeli mediterranean watersheds and arid us watersheds this should not come as a surprise given that the climatic classification considers many factors including temperature and seasonality while other factors such as the mean annual precipitation amounts are comparable in the two areas the distribution of unit peak discharge for different return periods and climatic regions is presented in fig 10 a the unit peak discharge for mediterranean regions is larger for shorter return periods i e 10 50 years but peak discharge of arid semi arid floods of 100 and 250 year return periods are found to exceed the corresponding mediterranean floods in the us in addition the ratio of the 250 year to the 10 year flood was examined this ratio can be used to compare the upper tail across watersheds in a similar manner to the upper tail ratio that is used in smith et al 2018 the mean ratio for the arid semi arid watersheds 6 84 for israel 7 06 for the us is larger than the one in mediterranean watersheds 5 04 for israel 2 68 for the us a comparison of the normalized uncertainty ranges across the analyzed climates and regions indicates that the median normalized uncertainty range is larger for the arid semi arid watersheds fig 10b in particular the uncertainty range of the us mediterranean watersheds is significantly smaller than the other climate regions this is probably due to the longer record length median of 74 years as compared to 34 5 50 and 42 of arid semi arid israel arid semi arid us and mediterranean israel regions respectively even if the possibility that gev and gp are better suited to these watersheds than arid ones cannot be excluded 4 3 sensitivity to the characteristics of arid semi arid flood records fig 11 shows the uncertainty in the gev pwm tail ratio estimated from record between 15 years and the full length for stations that have at least 50 year record as expected uncertainty range is negatively correlated with record length and its rate of change decreases with record length second we explore the effects of record length on the estimation of quantiles and parameters using the synthetic flood generator records of 15 to 500 year long were created and the 100 year flood magnitude was estimated for both gev and gp for this analysis the reference 100 year flood is known from the full 105 year synthetic record and the bias defined as the ratio between the estimated and reference peak discharge is computed fig 12 a both distributions tend to underestimate the 100 year flood i e a value of 1 is equal to no bias for all record lengths longer records provide less biased estimates but a clear convergence to the reference value is not reported even for 500 year records this non convergence of the estimates to the record is counter intuitive and could be related to the fact that in the arid watersheds of israel it is quite common to have one two or even no floods in a given year table a 1 while for the arid semi arid watersheds in the us the number of floods in a year may exceed ten but still remaining limited table a 2 and fig 12d bottom in order to quantify the extent of the estimation error we created different synthetic series with different mean number of flood events per year by altering the mean parameter of the negative binomial distribution describing the number of yearly floods the log normal distribution describing the individual floods intensities was kept unchanged fig 12d presents the bias as a function of the mean number of events per year the distributions of the mean number of annual floods for all stations in the study are given at the bottom of fig 12d grouped by climate as expected the bias for all the distributions and estimation methods decreases when the mean number of events per year increases and converges to 1 for 20 30 floods per year both distributions tend to underestimate the reference value by up to 20 for less than 5 events per year the occurrence of years with no flow is a common feature in the arid semi arid watersheds in israel in the us stations all years had at least one flood event the fraction of years with no flows ranges up to 37 with a mean of 15 3 in the israeli arid watersheds using the synthetic flood generator we quantified the effect of no flow years on ffa of the gev distribution fig 12b in general underestimation of the 50 and 100 year return periods is observed as a consequence of years with no flows the underestimation worsens as the percent of years with no flow increases but it is most notable in the extreme case of 50 years with no flow another typical feature of flood discharge in arid semi arid regions is its large variability chouaib et al 2018 nicholson 2011 this translates to a larger coefficient of variation cv of flood peak discharges than in humid regions salinas et al 2014 fig 12c bottom in order to examine what is affected by this the accuracy of 100 year flood estimation we produced synthetic records representing different cvs by alterations of the synthetic generator lognormal distribution and leaving the binomial distribution describing the number of yearly floods unchanged the distributions of the cv for all stations in the study are given at the bottom of fig 12c grouped by climate as expected the relative error increases as cv increases both distributions underestimate the 100 year flood for large cvs e g for cv 5 the gev pwm is 0 91 of the reference flood and the gp pwm is 0 93 of the reference flood but for a cv smaller than 3 the estimation is quite accurate gp seems the more accurate for most cv values 5 discussion rainfall frequency studies have shown evidences of a heavier tail in arid semi arid regions ben zvi 2009 marra et al 2017 marra and morin 2015 morin et al 2020 and few ffa studies have shown some degree of inheritance in the flood tail characteristics farquharson et al 1992 smith et al 2014 zaman et al 2012 we found the tail of flood distributions in arid semi arid watersheds to be significantly heavier than in mediterranean watersheds of the same region fig 9 this confirms what is reported for rainfall and may be attributed to the climatic and physical characteristics of arid semi arid watersheds such as high energy high intensity convective rainfall events camarasa belmonte and soriano 2014 zaman et al 2012 low infiltration capacities morin and benyamini 1977 and to the small scale of the examined watersheds more likely to respond to the more skewed distributions of short duration rainfall marra and morin 2015 and of the synoptic events more characterizing the arid portions of the region marra et al 2019 at the same time statistical reasons related to the smaller number of floods per year are likely to contribute to this and cannot be excluded a priori our results confirm the vital importance of quantification and communication of the uncertainty in the estimated quantiles in arid semi arid watersheds the uncertainty range may be as large as the estimated quantiles surprisingly also for relatively short return periods fig 6 it is a common belief that in presence of short records the pds approach should outperform the ams thanks to the larger amount of data used for the parameter estimation bezak et al 2014 nagy et al 2017 this however comes at the price of methodological complexities threshold estimation separation of independent floods which might lead to biases in ffa in arid areas owing to the high variability of flood peak discharge a simple threshold estimation method must be adopted we found similar performance between gev and gp in terms of uncertainty estimation fig 7 fig 8 confirming previous results by hu et al 2019 marra et al 2018 and schlÃ¶gl and laaha 2016 results from this study show how parameter estimation by means of ml in arid semi arid watersheds often leads to unrealistic values fig 5 this confirms previous findings in which pwm was shown to outperform ml in the estimation of parameters from short data records e g martins and stedinger 2000 hosking and wallis 1987 dupuis 1999 and stresses the particular importance of parameter estimation method for arid semi arid regions gev and gp seem to provide poorer estimates in arid areas due to the small number of floods per year in addition since the lognormal distribution is in the domain of attraction of the gumbel distribution i e the gev with shape parameter equal to zero but this convergence is very slow the fact that flood peaks in these areas were found to follow such distribution an extremely large number of floods per year are required to reach the asymptotic gev more specifically i the limited mean number of floods per year fig 12b and d and ii the large variability of flood peak discharge fig 12c are found to significantly affect peak discharge estimates the pds approach is found to perform slightly better since the use of a threshold is likely to remove low flows and no flows from data series used for the parameter estimation regionalization approaches could be attempted to decrease the observed uncertainties even if the lack of data makes it more difficult to define homogeneous regions in arid areas with respect to other regions alternative estimation methods such as the mixed method by morrison and smith 2002 as well as recently developed methodologies for extreme value analysis might be able to overcome the limitations of traditional methods in arid regions the metastatistical extreme value framework marani and ignaccolo 2015 which allows to relax the asymptotic assumption on the number of floods per year and vastly increase the data sample thus reducing the issues related to short record lengths marra et al 2018 zorzetto et al 2016 was recently tested to model extreme flood peak discharge in a large sample of catchments in the contiguous unites states and found to outperform traditional methods in more than 75 of the cases miniussi et al 2020 more specifically its simplified version marra et al 2019 promises improved estimates of the flood peak discharge distribution in presence of limited number of floods in each year 6 conclusions this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the use of the generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto gp distributions flood frequency analysis in arid semi arid watersheds special attention is given to the impact of the peculiar characteristics of these watersheds namely i the limited number of floods per year and ii the large variability of flood peak discharges study cases in israel and the us are examined together with control watersheds characterized by mediterranean climate and synthetic flood records reproducing the characteristics of arid semi arid records the main findings of the study are as follows for the examined data records the tail ratio of extreme floods in arid semi arid watersheds is larger than the one describing mediterranean watersheds indicating a heavier tail and confirming previous observations on short duration rainfall the mean number of floods per year and the coefficient of variation of flood peak discharge have a crucial impact on the accuracy of the estimates a smaller number of events per year and b larger coefficient of variation of the flood peak discharge distributions are related to large errors in the estimated quantiles irrespective of the adopted approach annual maxima vs partial duration series the use of partial duration series approach provides slightly improved estimates because the use of a threshold reduces the amount of low flows and no flows in the data series however no significant advantage is observed in term of estimation uncertainty estimates obtained using one of the two approaches are consistently within the other s uncertainty range from a practical point of view due to the increase complexity partial duration series should be preferred only after a careful examination of the characteristics of individual case of interest arid watersheds are further from the asymptotic behavior than catchments in more humid hydro climatic conditions and the gev and gp distributions provided poorer estimates of extreme quantiles in arid than in mediterranean this problem was enhanced when maximum likelihood methods were used for the parameter estimation in arid semi arid regions the challenges faced by practitioners when assessing design floods through flood frequency analysis are exacerbated in general findings from this study indicate that in arid semi arid watersheds maximal likelihood estimation method should not be used even in presence of long data records the partial duration series approach should not be blindly preferred over the annual maxima series approach and the uncertainty in the estimated quantiles should not be overlooked credit
