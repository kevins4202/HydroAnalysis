5725,ice soil mixture landslide dams formed frequently in the tibetan plateau in response to global warming which pose great threats to both upstream and downstream areas due to inundation and lake bursting on 17 october 2018 a large landslide induced by an ice avalanche at the sedongpu basin of the yarlung tsangpo blocked the main course of the river near gyalha the barrier lake level rose quickly and the dam was overtopped naturally at 13 30 on 19 october 2018 generating a dam breaching flood with a peak flow rate of 32 000 m3 s this paper presents a comprehensive study of the disaster chain of landslide barrier lake dam breaching river flooding in the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon detailed geological and hydrological characteristics of the study region rapid prediction of the dam breaching hydrograph using an erosion based numerical model and analysis of the flood routing in a 460 km canyon reach along the yarlung tsangpo the simulated peak discharge at the dam site is over 30 000 m3 s and the corresponding dam breaching and flood routing hydrographs agree well with the observations two additional scenarios with larger inflow rates are also considered results show that with a larger inflow into the barrier lake the erosion of the dam body becomes more rapid when the inflow rate is increased by six times the peak dam breaching discharge can be doubled the study serves as basis to manage the flood risks due to landslide dam bursting on the yarlung tsangpo or similar rivers keywords ice avalanche landslide landslide dam barrier lake dam breaching flood routing 1 formation and bursting of the gyalha barrier lake the yarlung tsangpo is the highest large river in the world with an average elevation of 4000 m the river originates from chemayungdung glacier in southwestern tibet and flows eastward on the tibetan plateau it bends sharply in southeastern tibet where it passes between two peaks the 7 782 m namcha barwa and the 7 294 m gyala peri fig 1 the river then cuts its way through the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon and into arunachal where it is called siang down the river from arunachal the river becomes broader and after reaching assam it is also known as the brahmaputra the river further flows into bangladesh from assam where it is called padma it crosses china india and bangladesh with a length of about 3 350 km a catchment area of 66 6 104 km2 and an annual mean runoff of 66 29 1010 m3 liu 1999 at around 5 am 17 october 2018 a very large landslide struck the yarlung tsangpo in southeastern tibet china 7 km downstream the gyalha village and about 175 km upstream medog in the vicinity of 29 47 7 20 n 94 55 24 e fig 1 the landslide originated from the left bank of the yarlung tsangpo inside the sedongpu basin formed a landslide dam and blocked the main course of the yarlung tsangpo fig 2 a the landslide dam was composed of massive ice and debris 40 60 million m3 in volume 310 620 m in width and 79 m in height jin 2019 tong et al 2018 cctv news 2018a the gyalha landslide was featured with mixtures of ice and soil materials which marched into the yarlung tsangpo and spread laterally along the river by 2 3 km the barrier lake level increased very quickly at the noon of 17 october the lake behind the landslide dam was 15 km long the water level rose 40 m above the original water level and the reservoir volume reached about 150 million m3 on the morning of 18 october the water level of the barrier lake was already 50 m higher than the ground surface of the gyalha village and the lake was at risk of breaking fig 3 shows the inundated gyalha village after the formation of the landslide dam where the access road to the village was completely submerged more than 20 000 people in the mainling county and medog county could be affected by the barrier lake due to either inundation or lake bursting authorities in tibet activated the highest level of emergency response and evacuated at least 6 000 residents the breach of the landslide dam could also bring massive floods along the siang river in arunachal posing a great threat to the people in the region thus the chinese and india governments exchanged information on 18 october to cope with this disaster the upper siang district administration has warned residents in the siang valley to take precautionary measures ndtv 2018 by 7 am 19 october the lake water level had risen about 75 m above the original level and was still rising at an average rate of 0 61 m per hour cctv news 2018a eventually at 13 30 pm on 19 october the gyalha landslide dam was overtopped fig 2b with a lake capacity larger than 500 million m3 xinhua net 2018a the peak breaching flow was as large as 32 000 m3 s at the dam site and resumed its base flow on 20 october jin 2019 landslides frequently occurred in the sedongpu basin due to glacial activities the yarlung tsangpo near sedongpu had been partially blocked after the nyingchi earthquake in 2017 thus can be blocked more easily the mixtures of ice and debris from ice avalanches are very unstable hence the barrier dam may break quickly releasing a large quantity of water once a landslide dam forms and blocks a major river it may pose a great threat to residents both upstream and downstream the dam for instance an extremely large landslide on 9 april 2000 at zhamu creek 48 km northeast of the gyalha landslide 30 12 03 n 94 58 03 e fig 1 blocked the yigong river that is a tributary of the yarlung tsangpo lu et al 2003 the landslide dam breached on 10 june 2000 releasing a massive impounded water volume of about 3 km3 resulting in a dam breaching flood with a peak discharge of 120 000 m3 s shang et al 2003 the burst of the barrier lake affected 4 000 people in the downstream since most landslide dams are short lived with 51 of landslide dams breaching within one week timely evacuation of downstream people is extremely important peng and zhang 2013a peng and zhang 2013b the prediction of the dam breaching time flow rate and the downstream flood routing process is important for evaluating the dam breaching flood risks and making a successful emergency management plan the focus of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the gyalha landslide barrier lake dam breaching flooding disaster chain in the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon taking the gyalha landslide as a benchmark the processes of dam breaching and flood routing with plausible larger inflows into the barrier lake are also simulated results of dam breaching process flow rate final breach size and subsequent flood routing are analyzed and compared detailed information of the geometric and hydraulic conditions of the dam the dam breaching simulation the flooding routing process and the resulting outflow hydrographs are presented in this paper 2 geological and geomorphological characteristics 2 1 topography of the studying river reach and the sedongpu basin the studying river reach for flood routing analysis starts from the gyalha landslide dam site to the downstream pasighat village fig 1 which is the main portion of the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon the canyon is the deepest and longest canyon in the world which stretches 496 km with an average depth of 5 000 m passing between the peaks of the namcha barwa 7 782 m and gyala peri 7 294 m the elevation of the canyon entrance at pei village in mainling county is about 2880 m whereas the elevation at pasighat village is around 150 m corresponding to a water level drop of 2 730 m the deep cut of riverbed is caused by the rapid uplift of the eastern tibet the canyon crosses the eastern himalayan syntaxis where the continental collision between the eurasian plate and the india plate is at its strongest the topography for the flood routing analysis can be extracted from a digital elevation model such as alos world 3d 30 m aw3d30 in this study tadono et al 2014 takaku et al 2016 downloadable from https www eorc jaxa jp alos en aw3d30 data index htm as shown in fig 4 the elevation at the gyalha landslide dam site is about 2 742 m while the elevation decreases sharply to about 150 m at pasighat fig 4b shows three typical cross sections a c along the river reach representing cross sections at the upper middle and lower river reach slopes of riverbanks become gentler from the upstream to the downstream on 17 october 2018 the gyalha landslide occurred on the left bank of the yarlung tsangpo in the sedongpu basin 29 47 7 20 n 94 55 24 e the sedongpu basin has a catchment area of 66 89 km2 and an average elevation of 4 540 m the highest point in the basin is the gyala peri peak of 7 294 m while the lowest point is 2 746 m with a large elevation difference of 4 548 m the basin strata are mainly composed of proterozoic namjagbarwa group and the primary bedrocks are proterozoic marble and gneiss pt which are interbedded and can lose stability under glacier erosion and freeze thaw weathering huang et al 2007 the sedongpu basin has a special steep gentle relatively steep ladder terrain from the top to the bottom fig 5 50 of the basin is steeper than 30 with an average slope of 34 89 tong et al 2018 the middle area of the basin is gentle with slopes smaller than 15 which is also the area covered with glaciers and moraines due to the ladder terrain the collapse of rocks and glaciers from the upper steep part accumulated in the gentle area providing massive loose materials to move along the lower relative steep area once triggered by snow melt or intense rainfall thus the basin with massive loose materials is susceptible to large scale debris flows there are 12 branches of well developed glaciers in the upper sedongpu basin and the gyalha landslide was believed to be induced by large avalanches the runout materials were a mixture of glacier and rocks which impacted into the accumulations and moraines in the lower part formed a large debris flow and dammed the yarlung tsangpo tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the avalanches were triggered under the conditions of steep terrain broken rock masses global warming regional rainfall glacier ablation and antecedent earthquake activities 2 2 structure of the gyalha landslide dam the gyalha landslide was triggered by avalanches from the upper glaciers of the sedongpu basin fig 6 the mixtures of ice and disintegrated soils marched approximately 4 7 km into yalung tsangpo hu et al 2018 the nearby yigong landslide in april 2000 showed the similar feature which was triggered by snow melt and rainfall and the debris marched about 8 km into the yigong river zhou et al 2016 entraining the colluvium with snow and ice the yigong landslide dam consisted mainly of angular coarse clasts in a matrix of gravel and finer fractions the lithology was composed of disintegrated granite marble and gneiss shang et al 2003 fig 7 shows some cut and scour features left by mass movement through zhamu creek valley and the materials left in the deposition zone of the gyalha landslide the landslide deposits at both yigong and gyalha are loose fine debris with high erodibility therefore in this study the soil materials of the gyalha landslide dam was benchmarked against the yigong landslide dam which will be introduced later the size of the gyalha landslide dam is interpreted based on satellite images and remote sensing imhe 2018 hu et al 2018 the profiles of the longitudinal section and the cross section of the dam are shown in fig 8 along the river the crest length of the landslide dam is about 300 m the upstream and downstream lengths of the dam are estimated to be 720 and 880 m respectively the elevations at the base and crest of the dam are 2 758 m and 2 837 m respectively giving a dam height of 79 m other information about the dam can be referred to table 1 3 hydrological characteristics the yarlung tsangpo is an important international river with several major tributaries including lhasa river nyang river nimu maqu river and parlung tsangpo it is a major freshwater resource for china and downstream south asian countries ren et al 2018 sun et al 2019 having an important influence on asian hydrology and affecting millions of people 3 1 glacier retreat in tibetan plateau the tibetan plateau is the largest glacier area in the world with a total glacier area of 46 640 km2 of which 9 014 km2 is in the yarlung tsangpo basin jia et al 2008 glaciers are very sensitive to climate change fig 9 shows changes of annual mean air temperature of the yarlung tsangpo basin from the source to the pasighat from 1957 to 2004 liu et al 2007 showing a gradually increasing trend glaciers in the tibet himalaya region show accelerated retreat with a substantial decrease of snow cover due to global warming oerlemans 2005 yao et al 2007 prasad et al 2009 fig 10 shows significant glacier reduction in the region of the gyalha landslide from 19 jan 2017 to 19 jan 2018 melting water from glacier snow accounts for a considerable proportion of the runoff of the yarlung tsangpo the annual glacier meltwater is 148 8 108 m3 accounting for about 9 of its annual runoff jia et al 2008 glacier related debris flows are consequences of general glacier retreat due to global warming and exposure of large quantities of unconsolidated unvegetated and sometimes ice cored glacial sediments chiarle et al 2007 these sediments are easily mobilized by floods from heavy precipitation snowmelt or glacial lake outbursts which help to initiate rock avalanches and landslides glaciological phenomena as ice snow avalanches and glacial floods can have significant impacts upon society over a very short time scale minutes days richardson and reynolds 2000 3 2 precipitation and runoff in the studying region precipitation in the yarlung tsangpo basin is dominated by the indian summer monsoon circulation the monsoonal moisture penetrates into the southern tibetan plateau and moves upward along the main course of the yarlung tsangpo due to the block of the himalayas the long term annual mean runoff in the downstream part of the yarlung tsangpo is about 1 500 3 000 mm which becomes as large as 5 000 mm at pasighat and decreases sharply at the horse show bend area near the namcha barwa jia et al 2008 fig 11 shows the annual runoff from 1970 to 2013 and the long term intra annual distribution of the runoff from 1960 to 2009 at the nuxia hydrological station located at 76 km upstream of the gyalha landslide dam site liu and liang 2011 wang et al 2016b although the annual runoff only shows a slightly increasing trend the monthly runoff within a year varies significantly showing a notable climate dependent feature the runoff is large in the summer and autumn in the rainy august the monthly runoff can be as large as 23 4 of the annual runoff 3 3 past barrier lakes near sedongpu basin the sedongpu basin is a region where rock avalanches landslides and debris flows occur frequently based on the literature tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 and satellite images the blockages of the yarlung tsangpo in the sedongpu basin in the history are summarized in table 2 most of the blockages were caused by ice avalanches some typical satellite images of sedongpu basin with different remaining landslide dams are shown in fig 12 the gyalha landslide on 17 october 2018 was believed to be affected by the ms 6 9 nyingchi earthquake at mainling county on 18 nov 2017 hu et al 2018 tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the earthquake triggered at least 529 landslides including rockslides avalanches and rock falls hu et al 2018 it induced three large landslide dams one of which was located at the identical location of the gyalha landslide dam these landslide dams breached afterward the residuals of these dams make the river narrower fig 12 it should be noticed that about two weeks after the gyalha landslide on 17 october 2018 a new landslide occurred at the same location on 29 october which also blocked the yarlung tsangpo and the dam was overtopped shortly afterwards fig 12d 3 4 characteristics of the gyalha barrier lake in 2018 after the formation of the gyalha landslide dam on 17 october 2018 a barrier lake formed momentarily the water level and flow rate at the dexing hydrological station fig 1 in medog county 173 km downstream the dam dropped from 74 28 m at 8 pm on 16 october to 73 m at 8 am on 17 october and further to 71 27 m at 2 pm on 17 october the corresponding flow rate reduced from 3 430 m3 s to 2 620 m3 s from 8 pm 16 october to 8 am 17 october and to 1 580 m3 s by 2 pm on 17 october xinhua net 2018b the inundation areas and the lake volumes at different lake water levels are determined using a digital elevation model aw3d30 fig 13 shows the relation between the lake surface elevation and the lake volume derived from the digital elevation model the final lowest elevation of the crest of the dam is 2 837 m determining a maximum water depth before overtopping of 79 m and a lake capacity of about 4 9 108 m3 after the formation of the barrier lake the water volume stored in the first hour was about 8 106 m3 xinhua net 2018c indicating an initial incoming flow rate of 2 222 m3 s thus the time required to fill the barrier lake was about 2 6 days implying a short lifespan of the landslide dam fig 14 further shows the inundation area of the barrier lake just before breaching the barrier lake stretches 27 km upstream with an inundation area of around 11 km2 the gyahla village was partially inundated and the access road to the gyahla village was completely submerged fig 3b 4 modelling of barrier lake bursting and flood routing process 4 1 principle of dam breaching simulation the dam breaching process can be simulated as a process of erosion of the dam materials by the overtopping flow e g jian et al 2017 zhong et al 2018 begam et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 a simple linear equation is widely used to estimate the erosion rate e of both cohesive and gravelly landslide dam materials in water flow e g hanson and simon 2001 briaud 2008 shi et al 2015 okeke and wang 2016 zhong et al 2018 etc 1 e k d τ τ c where kd is the coefficient of erodibility τ is the shear stress at the soil water interface and τc is the critical shear stress at initiation of soil erosion kd and τc can be measured in situ or estimated using several empirical equations e g mitchener and torfs 1996 julian and torres 2006 annandale 2006 thoman and niezgoda 2008 chang et al 2011 the shear stress at the soil water interface can be calculated as 2 τ γ w r h s where γw is the unit weight of water n m3 rh is the hydraulic radius m s is the energy slope which is equal to the slope gradient for a trapezoid breach cross section rh can be obtained as 3 r h h z cos α w b sin α 2 h z w b sin α h z where h is the elevation of the water surface m z is the elevation of the breach bottom m wb is the breach bottom width m and α is the angle of the side slope the breach discharge through a trapezoid breach can be calculated based on the broad crested weir flow assumption which satisfies the condition of landslide dams with a large channel length but a small slope singh and scarlatos 1988 4 q b 1 7 w b h z tan α h z 3 2 the hydrodynamics is modelled by solving the continuity equation of the lake together with the breach outflow through a broad crested weir 5 a s dh dt q in q out where as is the lake water surface area m2 qin and qout are the inflow and outflow rates of the reservoir in this study an erosion based numerical model daba chang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2016 is used to simulate the breaching process the model has three advantages compared with other models i e dambrk breach beed 1 the variations in soil erodibility along depth can be considered 2 the steepening process of the landslide dam can be taken into account and 3 the final size of the breach does not need to be assumed the breach evolution in the daba model is divided into three phases in the cross section and the longitudinal section on the cross section fig 15 a at the beginning the soil at the dam crest can erode easily when overtopped naturally during the first phase the width of the breach will not change but the breach depth and breach bottom width increase slightly until the bank slope reaches a critical angle αc then in phase ii the breach size develops significantly both horizontally and vertically while keeping the bank slope angle at αc this process continues until the shear stress by overtopped water flow cannot overcome the soil erosive resistance at the channel bed or the bank side indicating that the breach process comes to the final phase then in phase iii when the soil at the channel bed cannot be eroded the breach only develops in the horizontal direction the breach width increases gradually at a constant slope angle αc while the breach erosion depth does not change significantly when the soil at the two side walls do not erode the erosion process can only cut in the vertical direction the breach depth increases but the breach bottom width decreases on the longitudinal section fig 15b in the beginning water flows over the dam crest and cuts the toe of the downstream slope until it reaches a limit angle βf then the downstream slope keeps eroding while maintaining the slope angle at βf in the phase ii this process continues until the downstream slope eventually meets the upstream slope which implies the longitudinal breach process goes into phase iii in phase iii the breach of the downstream slope develops dramatically with a sharp decrease of the dam crest elevation 4 2 erodibility of the dam materials referring to eq 1 soil erodibility can be described by the coefficient of erodibility kd and the critical shear stress at initiation of soil erosion τc τc indicates the potential of erosion in soils while kd represents how fast the soil erodes kd and τc are functions of basic soil properties and soil state which can be obtained by laboratory tests field tests or empirical equations kd and τc in this study were obtained based on the empirical equations proposed by chang et al 2011 which are particularly for broadly graded landslide deposits 6 k d 20075 e 4 77 c u 0 76 7 τ c 6 8 pi 1 68 p 1 73 e 0 97 where e is the void ratio cu is the coefficient of uniformity pi is the plasticity index and p is the fines content with particle size smaller than 0 063 mm when the fines content is smaller than 10 τc is recommended to be estimated as annandale 2006 8 τ c 2 3 g d 50 ρ s ρ w t a n ϕ where g is the gravitational acceleration ρs is the soil mass density ρw is the water mass density ϕ is the friction angle and d50 is the mean particle size the soil materials of the gyalha landslide are benchmarked against the yigong landslide materials both being ice soil mixtures in the tibet plateau the materials of the yigong and gyalha landslides travelled long distances and were highly disintegrated thus the distributions of kd and τc with depth for the upper part of the gyalha landslide dam can be referred to those for the materials of yigong landslide dam while the lower part that was not fully disintegrated is referred to the tangjiashan landslide dam shi et al 2015 the soil grain size distributions at the deposition zone of the yigong landslide hu et al 2015 kang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2016a are summarized in fig 16 a for the gyalha landslide dam liu et al 2019 reported a soil rock ratio of about 8 2 and cai 2019 found soil rock ratio values in the range of 6 4 7 3 both of which are in the range of 10 0 3 5 6 5 for the benchmark yigong materials fig 16a here the boundary between soil and rock is defined as 10 mm cai et al 2019 the bulk density of the yigong landslide deposits is 1 845 g cm3 the specific gravity is 2 718 and the friction angle is about 37 hu et al 2009 2015 wang et al 2016a using eqs 6 8 the variations of kd and τc for the gyalha landslide dam with depth are shown in fig 16b and c furthermore a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the influence of soil erodibility on the overtopping process the analysis is conducted by 1 changing kd by 10 and 20 while maintaining τc as a constant and 2 changing τc by 10 and 20 while keeping kd unchanged the hydrographs of the overtopping process are quite similar when kd is changed fig 17 a with variations of the peak flow rate up to 16 and a maximum time difference of 48 min the influence of τc is very small as shown in fig 17b with the development of overtopping the shear stress τ at the soil water interface is much larger than the initiation critical shear stress τc thus the effect of τc is not significant 4 3 principle of flood routing simulation the unsteady flooding routing

assumed to be 0 06 and 0 12 for the channel bed and riverbank respectively the study river reach is from the gyalha landslide dam site to the downstream pasighat village fig 1 with a river length of 460 km based on the aforementioned digital elevation model the river is divided into two parts according to the rive gradient as shown in fig 4a in the first river reach the water elevation changes from 2742 m to 1800 m with a river length of 110 km and a large water level drop of 8 6 m per kilometer thus the cross sections in this reach are set densely at a small interval of 0 05 km in the second river reach the elevation changes from 1800 m to 150 m in a river length of 370 km corresponding to a smaller water level drop of 4 5 m per kilometer the cross sections are then set at a larger interval of 1 km a total of 2764 cross sections along the river are finally determined based on the breaching hydrograph at the dam site given by daba and the input topography information of the studying river reach the flooding routing process in this study is simulated using a one dimensional hydrodynamic model hec ras usace 2016 5 results of barrier lake breaching and flood routing analyses 5 1 barrier lake bursting on 19 october 2018 the gyalha landslide dam was overtopped naturally at 13 30 on 19 october 2018 the inflow rate into the barrier lake was 2222 m3 s by then a small initial channel with a gentle slope angle is assumed in the daba model as shown in table 1 the hydrograph at the dam site simulated by using daba is presented in fig 18 the simulated peak discharge at the dam site is 31 685 m3 s which is almost the same as the reported value of 32 000 m3 s jin 2019 based on the flood routing results the time at the peak outflow at the gyalha landslide dam site is determined at 19 11 on 19 october fig 18 also illustrates the attenuation of the peak discharge along the river at dexing hydrological station the predicted peak discharge is 25 741 m3 s occurring at 23 37 on 19 october whereas the reported maximum discharge is 23 400 m3 s at 23 40 on 19 october china daily 2018 the simulated peak flow rate decreases to about 21 216 m3 s at tuting by 3 04 on 20 october and to 11 235 m3 s at pasighat by 18 32 on 20 october moreover at 7 00 on 20 october i e about 17 5 h after the dam breach the discharge at dexing hydrological station dropped significantly to 6230 m3 s cctv news 2018b while the predicted discharge at that time is 6635 m3 s with a small difference of 6 5 by 7 00 on 20 october the total water volume passing dexing was 550 million m3 after deducting 40 million m3 from other tributaries approximately 510 million m3 of water has been drained cctv news 2018b the reservoir level was lowered by about 56 m and the threat of the flooding was dismissed fig 19 further shows changes of the relative water level at tuting the water level started to decrease at about 11 30 on 17 october and the river flow diminished at 2 30 on 18 october with limited flow from other tributaries i e about 21 5 h after the formation of the gyalha landslide dam sandrp 2018 it dramatically rose up to about 15 m at 2 30 on 20 october and returned to the base flow on the early morning of 21 october the predicted maximum water level rise at tuting is 16 4 m occurring at 3 04 am on 20 october which is close to the observations 5 2 analysis of dam breaching scenarios with larger river inflow rates the runoff of yarlung tsangpo shows a strong climate dependent feature and mainly concentrates in the summer jia et al 2008 liu and liang 2011 summer is also the time for glacier melting jansson et al 2003 there are a large number of glaciers in the lower yarlung tsangpo basin where the studying area is located hence the meltwater from the glaciers in summer is of particular importance yao et al 2010 ren et al 2018 if ice avalanches develop in the glaciers on the high mountains of sedongpu and the landslide debris blocks the yarlung tsangpo at a time of large runoff the damming may cause more catastrophic consequences therefore it is critical to explore impacts of landslide lake bursts under possibly large runoff conditions which directly affect the duration and development of the dam breaching process the final breach size and the subsequent flood routing process fig 20 presents the runoff of the latest large flood in the yarlung tsangpo in 1998 and the intra annual distribution of runoff from 1960 to 2009 at nuxia hydrological station liu 1999 liu and liang 2011 the maximum flow rate in 1998 is 13 487 m3 s which is 2 6 times the maximum monthly mean flow rate of 5119 m3 s in august in this study the maximum flow rate of 13 487 m3 s and the maximum monthly mean flow rate of 5119 m3 s are used to represent the possibly large runoffs of the downstream yarlung tsangpo table 3 shows results of the dam breaching simulations taking the gyalha landslide dam as a benchmark with a larger inflow rate the time of overtopping decreases dramatically the time for evacuating downstream residents also shortens from 62 5 h to 27 1 h and even to only 10 3 h when the inflow rate increases from 2222 m3 s to 5119 m3 s and further to 13 487 m3 s hence the dam breaching risk will intensify when the river blockage occurs in the rainy season when the dam is overtopped naturally the subsequent peak flow increases obviously with the increasing inflow rate comparing the conditions of the gyalha landslide and the maximum flood flow in 1998 the dam breaching peak flow rate is nearly doubled when the inflow is increased by five times the total breach duration and the erosion degree of the dam body also differ greatly under the three different inflow conditions with a larger inflow rate the breach initiation time becomes shorter the materials erode more rapidly and the dam breaching process develops very quickly on the cross section when the initial runoff is larger the breach process goes into phase ii and phase iii fig 15a more quickly causing a significant enlargement of breach size in both horizontal and vertical directions on the longitudinal section the breaching process will go into phase iii fig 15b sooner the erosion of the downstream slope will develop more dramatically and the dam crest elevation will lower sharply it can be found that in the case of the maximum runoff of flood in 1998 the landslide dam can be completely eroded in 13 8 h fig 21 shows results of the flood routing process along the river the trends of the attenuation of peak discharge are quite similar for the three inflow conditions however the magnitude and arrival time of the peak discharge along the river are quite different taking the gyalha landslide dam as a benchmark the peak discharge along the river is 23 larger at the maximum monthly runoff condition and increases dramatically by 83 at the 1998 flood flow condition the corresponding average arrival times of the peak flow at dexing tuting and pasighat are about 2 8 h and 1 4 h earlier respectively which shortens the time for emergency actions thus it is suggested to install a monitoring and warning system for the sedongpu basin to assist emergency management 6 summary and conclusions this paper reports the formation and breach of the gyalha landslide dam on yarlung tsangpo in 2018 and a comprehensive analysis of a typical mountain landslide barrier lake dam breach flooding disaster chain the dam breaching hydrograph is simulated using an overtopping erosion based dam breaching model daba and the flood routing in the 460 km long grand canyon is analyzed using one dimensional saint venant equations the simulated peak discharges at the dam site and dexing are 31 685 and 25 741 m3 s respectively which agree well with observed values of 32 000 and 23 400 m3 s respectively investigations of the dam breach and flood routing process under two larger plausible inflow conditions are further conducted the maximum flow of the flood in 1998 and the annual maximum mean monthly runoff under a larger inflow the duration of dam breaching decreases significantly and the scour and erosion of the dam body become more rapid when the inflow rate is increased by five times the peak discharge can be doubled the sedongpu basin has 12 well developed glaciers where landslides induced by ice melting occurred frequently and blocked the yarlung tsangpo in recent years once an ice soil mixture dam breaks the flood routing process can be very fast in the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon thus a long time monitoring and warning system is suggested to assist risk

5725,ice soil mixture landslide dams formed frequently in the tibetan plateau in response to global warming which pose great threats to both upstream and downstream areas due to inundation and lake bursting on 17 october 2018 a large landslide induced by an ice avalanche at the sedongpu basin of the yarlung tsangpo blocked the main course of the river near gyalha the barrier lake level rose quickly and the dam was overtopped naturally at 13 30 on 19 october 2018 generating a dam breaching flood with a peak flow rate of 32 000 m3 s this paper presents a comprehensive study of the disaster chain of landslide barrier lake dam breaching river flooding in the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon detailed geological and hydrological characteristics of the study region rapid prediction of the dam breaching hydrograph using an erosion based numerical model and analysis of the flood routing in a 460 km canyon reach along the yarlung tsangpo the simulated peak discharge at the dam site is over 30 000 m3 s and the corresponding dam breaching and flood routing hydrographs agree well with the observations two additional scenarios with larger inflow rates are also considered results show that with a larger inflow into the barrier lake the erosion of the dam body becomes more rapid when the inflow rate is increased by six times the peak dam breaching discharge can be doubled the study serves as basis to manage the flood risks due to landslide dam bursting on the yarlung tsangpo or similar rivers keywords ice avalanche landslide landslide dam barrier lake dam breaching flood routing 1 formation and bursting of the gyalha barrier lake the yarlung tsangpo is the highest large river in the world with an average elevation of 4000 m the river originates from chemayungdung glacier in southwestern tibet and flows eastward on the tibetan plateau it bends sharply in southeastern tibet where it passes between two peaks the 7 782 m namcha barwa and the 7 294 m gyala peri fig 1 the river then cuts its way through the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon and into arunachal where it is called siang down the river from arunachal the river becomes broader and after reaching assam it is also known as the brahmaputra the river further flows into bangladesh from assam where it is called padma it crosses china india and bangladesh with a length of about 3 350 km a catchment area of 66 6 104 km2 and an annual mean runoff of 66 29 1010 m3 liu 1999 at around 5 am 17 october 2018 a very large landslide struck the yarlung tsangpo in southeastern tibet china 7 km downstream the gyalha village and about 175 km upstream medog in the vicinity of 29 47 7 20 n 94 55 24 e fig 1 the landslide originated from the left bank of the yarlung tsangpo inside the sedongpu basin formed a landslide dam and blocked the main course of the yarlung tsangpo fig 2 a the landslide dam was composed of massive ice and debris 40 60 million m3 in volume 310 620 m in width and 79 m in height jin 2019 tong et al 2018 cctv news 2018a the gyalha landslide was featured with mixtures of ice and soil materials which marched into the yarlung tsangpo and spread laterally along the river by 2 3 km the barrier lake level increased very quickly at the noon of 17 october the lake behind the landslide dam was 15 km long the water level rose 40 m above the original water level and the reservoir volume reached about 150 million m3 on the morning of 18 october the water level of the barrier lake was already 50 m higher than the ground surface of the gyalha village and the lake was at risk of breaking fig 3 shows the inundated gyalha village after the formation of the landslide dam where the access road to the village was completely submerged more than 20 000 people in the mainling county and medog county could be affected by the barrier lake due to either inundation or lake bursting authorities in tibet activated the highest level of emergency response and evacuated at least 6 000 residents the breach of the landslide dam could also bring massive floods along the siang river in arunachal posing a great threat to the people in the region thus the chinese and india governments exchanged information on 18 october to cope with this disaster the upper siang district administration has warned residents in the siang valley to take precautionary measures ndtv 2018 by 7 am 19 october the lake water level had risen about 75 m above the original level and was still rising at an average rate of 0 61 m per hour cctv news 2018a eventually at 13 30 pm on 19 october the gyalha landslide dam was overtopped fig 2b with a lake capacity larger than 500 million m3 xinhua net 2018a the peak breaching flow was as large as 32 000 m3 s at the dam site and resumed its base flow on 20 october jin 2019 landslides frequently occurred in the sedongpu basin due to glacial activities the yarlung tsangpo near sedongpu had been partially blocked after the nyingchi earthquake in 2017 thus can be blocked more easily the mixtures of ice and debris from ice avalanches are very unstable hence the barrier dam may break quickly releasing a large quantity of water once a landslide dam forms and blocks a major river it may pose a great threat to residents both upstream and downstream the dam for instance an extremely large landslide on 9 april 2000 at zhamu creek 48 km northeast of the gyalha landslide 30 12 03 n 94 58 03 e fig 1 blocked the yigong river that is a tributary of the yarlung tsangpo lu et al 2003 the landslide dam breached on 10 june 2000 releasing a massive impounded water volume of about 3 km3 resulting in a dam breaching flood with a peak discharge of 120 000 m3 s shang et al 2003 the burst of the barrier lake affected 4 000 people in the downstream since most landslide dams are short lived with 51 of landslide dams breaching within one week timely evacuation of downstream people is extremely important peng and zhang 2013a peng and zhang 2013b the prediction of the dam breaching time flow rate and the downstream flood routing process is important for evaluating the dam breaching flood risks and making a successful emergency management plan the focus of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the gyalha landslide barrier lake dam breaching flooding disaster chain in the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon taking the gyalha landslide as a benchmark the processes of dam breaching and flood routing with plausible larger inflows into the barrier lake are also simulated results of dam breaching process flow rate final breach size and subsequent flood routing are analyzed and compared detailed information of the geometric and hydraulic conditions of the dam the dam breaching simulation the flooding routing process and the resulting outflow hydrographs are presented in this paper 2 geological and geomorphological characteristics 2 1 topography of the studying river reach and the sedongpu basin the studying river reach for flood routing analysis starts from the gyalha landslide dam site to the downstream pasighat village fig 1 which is the main portion of the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon the canyon is the deepest and longest canyon in the world which stretches 496 km with an average depth of 5 000 m passing between the peaks of the namcha barwa 7 782 m and gyala peri 7 294 m the elevation of the canyon entrance at pei village in mainling county is about 2880 m whereas the elevation at pasighat village is around 150 m corresponding to a water level drop of 2 730 m the deep cut of riverbed is caused by the rapid uplift of the eastern tibet the canyon crosses the eastern himalayan syntaxis where the continental collision between the eurasian plate and the india plate is at its strongest the topography for the flood routing analysis can be extracted from a digital elevation model such as alos world 3d 30 m aw3d30 in this study tadono et al 2014 takaku et al 2016 downloadable from https www eorc jaxa jp alos en aw3d30 data index htm as shown in fig 4 the elevation at the gyalha landslide dam site is about 2 742 m while the elevation decreases sharply to about 150 m at pasighat fig 4b shows three typical cross sections a c along the river reach representing cross sections at the upper middle and lower river reach slopes of riverbanks become gentler from the upstream to the downstream on 17 october 2018 the gyalha landslide occurred on the left bank of the yarlung tsangpo in the sedongpu basin 29 47 7 20 n 94 55 24 e the sedongpu basin has a catchment area of 66 89 km2 and an average elevation of 4 540 m the highest point in the basin is the gyala peri peak of 7 294 m while the lowest point is 2 746 m with a large elevation difference of 4 548 m the basin strata are mainly composed of proterozoic namjagbarwa group and the primary bedrocks are proterozoic marble and gneiss pt which are interbedded and can lose stability under glacier erosion and freeze thaw weathering huang et al 2007 the sedongpu basin has a special steep gentle relatively steep ladder terrain from the top to the bottom fig 5 50 of the basin is steeper than 30 with an average slope of 34 89 tong et al 2018 the middle area of the basin is gentle with slopes smaller than 15 which is also the area covered with glaciers and moraines due to the ladder terrain the collapse of rocks and glaciers from the upper steep part accumulated in the gentle area providing massive loose materials to move along the lower relative steep area once triggered by snow melt or intense rainfall thus the basin with massive loose materials is susceptible to large scale debris flows there are 12 branches of well developed glaciers in the upper sedongpu basin and the gyalha landslide was believed to be induced by large avalanches the runout materials were a mixture of glacier and rocks which impacted into the accumulations and moraines in the lower part formed a large debris flow and dammed the yarlung tsangpo tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the avalanches were triggered under the conditions of steep terrain broken rock masses global warming regional rainfall glacier ablation and antecedent earthquake activities 2 2 structure of the gyalha landslide dam the gyalha landslide was triggered by avalanches from the upper glaciers of the sedongpu basin fig 6 the mixtures of ice and disintegrated soils marched approximately 4 7 km into yalung tsangpo hu et al 2018 the nearby yigong landslide in april 2000 showed the similar feature which was triggered by snow melt and rainfall and the debris marched about 8 km into the yigong river zhou et al 2016 entraining the colluvium with snow and ice the yigong landslide dam consisted mainly of angular coarse clasts in a matrix of gravel and finer fractions the lithology was composed of disintegrated granite marble and gneiss shang et al 2003 fig 7 shows some cut and scour features left by mass movement through zhamu creek valley and the materials left in the deposition zone of the gyalha landslide the landslide deposits at both yigong and gyalha are loose fine debris with high erodibility therefore in this study the soil materials of the gyalha landslide dam was benchmarked against the yigong landslide dam which will be introduced later the size of the gyalha landslide dam is interpreted based on satellite images and remote sensing imhe 2018 hu et al 2018 the profiles of the longitudinal section and the cross section of the dam are shown in fig 8 along the river the crest length of the landslide dam is about 300 m the upstream and downstream lengths of the dam are estimated to be 720 and 880 m respectively the elevations at the base and crest of the dam are 2 758 m and 2 837 m respectively giving a dam height of 79 m other information about the dam can be referred to table 1 3 hydrological characteristics the yarlung tsangpo is an important international river with several major tributaries including lhasa river nyang river nimu maqu river and parlung tsangpo it is a major freshwater resource for china and downstream south asian countries ren et al 2018 sun et al 2019 having an important influence on asian hydrology and affecting millions of people 3 1 glacier retreat in tibetan plateau the tibetan plateau is the largest glacier area in the world with a total glacier area of 46 640 km2 of which 9 014 km2 is in the yarlung tsangpo basin jia et al 2008 glaciers are very sensitive to climate change fig 9 shows changes of annual mean air temperature of the yarlung tsangpo basin from the source to the pasighat from 1957 to 2004 liu et al 2007 showing a gradually increasing trend glaciers in the tibet himalaya region show accelerated retreat with a substantial decrease of snow cover due to global warming oerlemans 2005 yao et al 2007 prasad et al 2009 fig 10 shows significant glacier reduction in the region of the gyalha landslide from 19 jan 2017 to 19 jan 2018 melting water from glacier snow accounts for a considerable proportion of the runoff of the yarlung tsangpo the annual glacier meltwater is 148 8 108 m3 accounting for about 9 of its annual runoff jia et al 2008 glacier related debris flows are consequences of general glacier retreat due to global warming and exposure of large quantities of unconsolidated unvegetated and sometimes ice cored glacial sediments chiarle et al 2007 these sediments are easily mobilized by floods from heavy precipitation snowmelt or glacial lake outbursts which help to initiate rock avalanches and landslides glaciological phenomena as ice snow avalanches and glacial floods can have significant impacts upon society over a very short time scale minutes days richardson and reynolds 2000 3 2 precipitation and runoff in the studying region precipitation in the yarlung tsangpo basin is dominated by the indian summer monsoon circulation the monsoonal moisture penetrates into the southern tibetan plateau and moves upward along the main course of the yarlung tsangpo due to the block of the himalayas the long term annual mean runoff in the downstream part of the yarlung tsangpo is about 1 500 3 000 mm which becomes as large as 5 000 mm at pasighat and decreases sharply at the horse show bend area near the namcha barwa jia et al 2008 fig 11 shows the annual runoff from 1970 to 2013 and the long term intra annual distribution of the runoff from 1960 to 2009 at the nuxia hydrological station located at 76 km upstream of the gyalha landslide dam site liu and liang 2011 wang et al 2016b although the annual runoff only shows a slightly increasing trend the monthly runoff within a year varies significantly showing a notable climate dependent feature the runoff is large in the summer and autumn in the rainy august the monthly runoff can be as large as 23 4 of the annual runoff 3 3 past barrier lakes near sedongpu basin the sedongpu basin is a region where rock avalanches landslides and debris flows occur frequently based on the literature tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 and satellite images the blockages of the yarlung tsangpo in the sedongpu basin in the history are summarized in table 2 most of the blockages were caused by ice avalanches some typical satellite images of sedongpu basin with different remaining landslide dams are shown in fig 12 the gyalha landslide on 17 october 2018 was believed to be affected by the ms 6 9 nyingchi earthquake at mainling county on 18 nov 2017 hu et al 2018 tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the earthquake triggered at least 529 landslides including rockslides avalanches and rock falls hu et al 2018 it induced three large landslide dams one of which was located at the identical location of the gyalha landslide dam these landslide dams breached afterward the residuals of these dams make the river narrower fig 12 it should be noticed that about two weeks after the gyalha landslide on 17 october 2018 a new landslide occurred at the same location on 29 october which also blocked the yarlung tsangpo and the dam was overtopped shortly afterwards fig 12d 3 4 characteristics of the gyalha barrier lake in 2018 after the formation of the gyalha landslide dam on 17 october 2018 a barrier lake formed momentarily the water level and flow rate at the dexing hydrological station fig 1 in medog county 173 km downstream the dam dropped from 74 28 m at 8 pm on 16 october to 73 m at 8 am on 17 october and further to 71 27 m at 2 pm on 17 october the corresponding flow rate reduced from 3 430 m3 s to 2 620 m3 s from 8 pm 16 october to 8 am 17 october and to 1 580 m3 s by 2 pm on 17 october xinhua net 2018b the inundation areas and the lake volumes at different lake water levels are determined using a digital elevation model aw3d30 fig 13 shows the relation between the lake surface elevation and the lake volume derived from the digital elevation model the final lowest elevation of the crest of the dam is 2 837 m determining a maximum water depth before overtopping of 79 m and a lake capacity of about 4 9 108 m3 after the formation of the barrier lake the water volume stored in the first hour was about 8 106 m3 xinhua net 2018c indicating an initial incoming flow rate of 2 222 m3 s thus the time required to fill the barrier lake was about 2 6 days implying a short lifespan of the landslide dam fig 14 further shows the inundation area of the barrier lake just before breaching the barrier lake stretches 27 km upstream with an inundation area of around 11 km2 the gyahla village was partially inundated and the access road to the gyahla village was completely submerged fig 3b 4 modelling of barrier lake bursting and flood routing process 4 1 principle of dam breaching simulation the dam breaching process can be simulated as a process of erosion of the dam materials by the overtopping flow e g jian et al 2017 zhong et al 2018 begam et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 a simple linear equation is widely used to estimate the erosion rate e of both cohesive and gravelly landslide dam materials in water flow e g hanson and simon 2001 briaud 2008 shi et al 2015 okeke and wang 2016 zhong et al 2018 etc 1 e k d τ τ c where kd is the coefficient of erodibility τ is the shear stress at the soil water interface and τc is the critical shear stress at initiation of soil erosion kd and τc can be measured in situ or estimated using several empirical equations e g mitchener and torfs 1996 julian and torres 2006 annandale 2006 thoman and niezgoda 2008 chang et al 2011 the shear stress at the soil water interface can be calculated as 2 τ γ w r h s where γw is the unit weight of water n m3 rh is the hydraulic radius m s is the energy slope which is equal to the slope gradient for a trapezoid breach cross section rh can be obtained as 3 r h h z cos α w b sin α 2 h z w b sin α h z where h is the elevation of the water surface m z is the elevation of the breach bottom m wb is the breach bottom width m and α is the angle of the side slope the breach discharge through a trapezoid breach can be calculated based on the broad crested weir flow assumption which satisfies the condition of landslide dams with a large channel length but a small slope singh and scarlatos 1988 4 q b 1 7 w b h z tan α h z 3 2 the hydrodynamics is modelled by solving the continuity equation of the lake together with the breach outflow through a broad crested weir 5 a s dh dt q in q out where as is the lake water surface area m2 qin and qout are the inflow and outflow rates of the reservoir in this study an erosion based numerical model daba chang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2016 is used to simulate the breaching process the model has three advantages compared with other models i e dambrk breach beed 1 the variations in soil erodibility along depth can be considered 2 the steepening process of the landslide dam can be taken into account and 3 the final size of the breach does not need to be assumed the breach evolution in the daba model is divided into three phases in the cross section and the longitudinal section on the cross section fig 15 a at the beginning the soil at the dam crest can erode easily when overtopped naturally during the first phase the width of the breach will not change but the breach depth and breach bottom width increase slightly until the bank slope reaches a critical angle αc then in phase ii the breach size develops significantly both horizontally and vertically while keeping the bank slope angle at αc this process continues until the shear stress by overtopped water flow cannot overcome the soil erosive resistance at the channel bed or the bank side indicating that the breach process comes to the final phase then in phase iii when the soil at the channel bed cannot be eroded the breach only develops in the horizontal direction the breach width increases gradually at a constant slope angle αc while the breach erosion depth does not change significantly when the soil at the two side walls do not erode the erosion process can only cut in the vertical direction the breach depth increases but the breach bottom width decreases on the longitudinal section fig 15b in the beginning water flows over the dam crest and cuts the toe of the downstream slope until it reaches a limit angle βf then the downstream slope keeps eroding while maintaining the slope angle at βf in the phase ii this process continues until the downstream slope eventually meets the upstream slope which implies the longitudinal breach process goes into phase iii in phase iii the breach of the downstream slope develops dramatically with a sharp decrease of the dam crest elevation 4 2 erodibility of the dam materials referring to eq 1 soil erodibility can be described by the coefficient of erodibility kd and the critical shear stress at initiation of soil erosion τc τc indicates the potential of erosion in soils while kd represents how fast the soil erodes kd and τc are functions of basic soil properties and soil state which can be obtained by laboratory tests field tests or empirical equations kd and τc in this study were obtained based on the empirical equations proposed by chang et al 2011 which are particularly for broadly graded landslide deposits 6 k d 20075 e 4 77 c u 0 76 7 τ c 6 8 pi 1 68 p 1 73 e 0 97 where e is the void ratio cu is the coefficient of uniformity pi is the plasticity index and p is the fines content with particle size smaller than 0 063 mm when the fines content is smaller than 10 τc is recommended to be estimated as annandale 2006 8 τ c 2 3 g d 50 ρ s ρ w t a n ϕ where g is the gravitational acceleration ρs is the soil mass density ρw is the water mass density ϕ is the friction angle and d50 is the mean particle size the soil materials of the gyalha landslide are benchmarked against the yigong landslide materials both being ice soil mixtures in the tibet plateau the materials of the yigong and gyalha landslides travelled long distances and were highly disintegrated thus the distributions of kd and τc with depth for the upper part of the gyalha landslide dam can be referred to those for the materials of yigong landslide dam while the lower part that was not fully disintegrated is referred to the tangjiashan landslide dam shi et al 2015 the soil grain size distributions at the deposition zone of the yigong landslide hu et al 2015 kang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2016a are summarized in fig 16 a for the gyalha landslide dam liu et al 2019 reported a soil rock ratio of about 8 2 and cai 2019 found soil rock ratio values in the range of 6 4 7 3 both of which are in the range of 10 0 3 5 6 5 for the benchmark yigong materials fig 16a here the boundary between soil and rock is defined as 10 mm cai et al 2019 the bulk density of the yigong landslide deposits is 1 845 g cm3 the specific gravity is 2 718 and the friction angle is about 37 hu et al 2009 2015 wang et al 2016a using eqs 6 8 the variations of kd and τc for the gyalha landslide dam with depth are shown in fig 16b and c furthermore a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the influence of soil erodibility on the overtopping process the analysis is conducted by 1 changing kd by 10 and 20 while maintaining τc as a constant and 2 changing τc by 10 and 20 while keeping kd unchanged the hydrographs of the overtopping process are quite similar when kd is changed fig 17 a with variations of the peak flow rate up to 16 and a maximum time difference of 48 min the influence of τc is very small as shown in fig 17b with the development of overtopping the shear stress τ at the soil water interface is much larger than the initiation critical shear stress τc thus the effect of τc is not significant 4 3 principle of flood routing simulation the unsteady flooding routing

assumed to be 0 06 and 0 12 for the channel bed and riverbank respectively the study river reach is from the gyalha landslide dam site to the downstream pasighat village fig 1 with a river length of 460 km based on the aforementioned digital elevation model the river is divided into two parts according to the rive gradient as shown in fig 4a in the first river reach the water elevation changes from 2742 m to 1800 m with a river length of 110 km and a large water level drop of 8 6 m per kilometer thus the cross sections in this reach are set densely at a small interval of 0 05 km in the second river reach the elevation changes from 1800 m to 150 m in a river length of 370 km corresponding to a smaller water level drop of 4 5 m per kilometer the cross sections are then set at a larger interval of 1 km a total of 2764 cross sections along the river are finally determined based on the breaching hydrograph at the dam site given by daba and the input topography information of the studying river reach the flooding routing process in this study is simulated using a one dimensional hydrodynamic model hec ras usace 2016 5 results of barrier lake breaching and flood routing analyses 5 1 barrier lake bursting on 19 october 2018 the gyalha landslide dam was overtopped naturally at 13 30 on 19 october 2018 the inflow rate into the barrier lake was 2222 m3 s by then a small initial channel with a gentle slope angle is assumed in the daba model as shown in table 1 the hydrograph at the dam site simulated by using daba is presented in fig 18 the simulated peak discharge at the dam site is 31 685 m3 s which is almost the same as the reported value of 32 000 m3 s jin 2019 based on the flood routing results the time at the peak outflow at the gyalha landslide dam site is determined at 19 11 on 19 october fig 18 also illustrates the attenuation of the peak discharge along the river at dexing hydrological station the predicted peak discharge is 25 741 m3 s occurring at 23 37 on 19 october whereas the reported maximum discharge is 23 400 m3 s at 23 40 on 19 october china daily 2018 the simulated peak flow rate decreases to about 21 216 m3 s at tuting by 3 04 on 20 october and to 11 235 m3 s at pasighat by 18 32 on 20 october moreover at 7 00 on 20 october i e about 17 5 h after the dam breach the discharge at dexing hydrological station dropped significantly to 6230 m3 s cctv news 2018b while the predicted discharge at that time is 6635 m3 s with a small difference of 6 5 by 7 00 on 20 october the total water volume passing dexing was 550 million m3 after deducting 40 million m3 from other tributaries approximately 510 million m3 of water has been drained cctv news 2018b the reservoir level was lowered by about 56 m and the threat of the flooding was dismissed fig 19 further shows changes of the relative water level at tuting the water level started to decrease at about 11 30 on 17 october and the river flow diminished at 2 30 on 18 october with limited flow from other tributaries i e about 21 5 h after the formation of the gyalha landslide dam sandrp 2018 it dramatically rose up to about 15 m at 2 30 on 20 october and returned to the base flow on the early morning of 21 october the predicted maximum water level rise at tuting is 16 4 m occurring at 3 04 am on 20 october which is close to the observations 5 2 analysis of dam breaching scenarios with larger river inflow rates the runoff of yarlung tsangpo shows a strong climate dependent feature and mainly concentrates in the summer jia et al 2008 liu and liang 2011 summer is also the time for glacier melting jansson et al 2003 there are a large number of glaciers in the lower yarlung tsangpo basin where the studying area is located hence the meltwater from the glaciers in summer is of particular importance yao et al 2010 ren et al 2018 if ice avalanches develop in the glaciers on the high mountains of sedongpu and the landslide debris blocks the yarlung tsangpo at a time of large runoff the damming may cause more catastrophic consequences therefore it is critical to explore impacts of landslide lake bursts under possibly large runoff conditions which directly affect the duration and development of the dam breaching process the final breach size and the subsequent flood routing process fig 20 presents the runoff of the latest large flood in the yarlung tsangpo in 1998 and the intra annual distribution of runoff from 1960 to 2009 at nuxia hydrological station liu 1999 liu and liang 2011 the maximum flow rate in 1998 is 13 487 m3 s which is 2 6 times the maximum monthly mean flow rate of 5119 m3 s in august in this study the maximum flow rate of 13 487 m3 s and the maximum monthly mean flow rate of 5119 m3 s are used to represent the possibly large runoffs of the downstream yarlung tsangpo table 3 shows results of the dam breaching simulations taking the gyalha landslide dam as a benchmark with a larger inflow rate the time of overtopping decreases dramatically the time for evacuating downstream residents also shortens from 62 5 h to 27 1 h and even to only 10 3 h when the inflow rate increases from 2222 m3 s to 5119 m3 s and further to 13 487 m3 s hence the dam breaching risk will intensify when the river blockage occurs in the rainy season when the dam is overtopped naturally the subsequent peak flow increases obviously with the increasing inflow rate comparing the conditions of the gyalha landslide and the maximum flood flow in 1998 the dam breaching peak flow rate is nearly doubled when the inflow is increased by five times the total breach duration and the erosion degree of the dam body also differ greatly under the three different inflow conditions with a larger inflow rate the breach initiation time becomes shorter the materials erode more rapidly and the dam breaching process develops very quickly on the cross section when the initial runoff is larger the breach process goes into phase ii and phase iii fig 15a more quickly causing a significant enlargement of breach size in both horizontal and vertical directions on the longitudinal section the breaching process will go into phase iii fig 15b sooner the erosion of the downstream slope will develop more dramatically and the dam crest elevation will lower sharply it can be found that in the case of the maximum runoff of flood in 1998 the landslide dam can be completely eroded in 13 8 h fig 21 shows results of the flood routing process along the river the trends of the attenuation of peak discharge are quite similar for the three inflow conditions however the magnitude and arrival time of the peak discharge along the river are quite different taking the gyalha landslide dam as a benchmark the peak discharge along the river is 23 larger at the maximum monthly runoff condition and increases dramatically by 83 at the 1998 flood flow condition the corresponding average arrival times of the peak flow at dexing tuting and pasighat are about 2 8 h and 1 4 h earlier respectively which shortens the time for emergency actions thus it is suggested to install a monitoring and warning system for the sedongpu basin to assist emergency management 6 summary and conclusions this paper reports the formation and breach of the gyalha landslide dam on yarlung tsangpo in 2018 and a comprehensive analysis of a typical mountain landslide barrier lake dam breach flooding disaster chain the dam breaching hydrograph is simulated using an overtopping erosion based dam breaching model daba and the flood routing in the 460 km long grand canyon is analyzed using one dimensional saint venant equations the simulated peak discharges at the dam site and dexing are 31 685 and 25 741 m3 s respectively which agree well with observed values of 32 000 and 23 400 m3 s respectively investigations of the dam breach and flood routing process under two larger plausible inflow conditions are further conducted the maximum flow of the flood in 1998 and the annual maximum mean monthly runoff under a larger inflow the duration of dam breaching decreases significantly and the scour and erosion of the dam body become more rapid when the inflow rate is increased by five times the peak discharge can be doubled the sedongpu basin has 12 well developed glaciers where landslides induced by ice melting occurred frequently and blocked the yarlung tsangpo in recent years once an ice soil mixture dam breaks the flood routing process can be very fast in the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon thus a long time monitoring and warning system is suggested to assist risk

hybrid integration approach based on j48 decision trees j48 adaboost ab bagging bag randomsubspace rs dagging dag and rotation forest rf algorithms for constructing a groundwater spring potential map the performance of the ensemble models were evaluated at the wuqi county in shaanxi province china at first a groundwater spring inventory map with 235 groundwater springs was constructed the groundwater spring database was randomly divided into a training 70 of the total number of groundwater springs and validating subset remaining 30 secondly sixteen groundwater spring related variables were selected and analyzed such as elevation slope aspect planform and profile curvature curvature topographic wetness index stream transport and stream power indexes distance from river network lithology soil and landuse cover normalized difference vegetation index mean annual rainfall and distance from road network the contribution of each groundwater spring related variable so as to identify the most predictive was based on the correlation attribute evaluation method the predictive performance of each model was evaluated by estimating the area under the receiver operating

study highlights that the proposed ensemble methodology is efficient and highly accurate appropriate for groundwater spring potential mapping keywords groundwater spring potential mapping machine learning gis tree based ensemble models china 1 introduction groundwater has been referred as one of the most crucial natural resource since it influences in a very significant degree the evolution of the geo environment and human development in relation to the other fresh water resource groundwater has significant advantages chowdhury et al 2009 manap et al 2013 groundwater exhibit in general lower pollution vulnerability and higher water quality it also appears in most cases having a lower susceptibility value in relation to environmental threats and climate change impacts neshat et al 2014 mogaji et al 2016 it has been well established that about one third of the world s population depends on groundwater supplies which has as a result the reduction of its volume in global scale according to a bundesanstalt für geowissenschaften und rohstoffe bgr report bgr 2011 the decade 2000 2010 there has been an increase in the consumption of groundwater nearly 1000 km3 year whereas the global groundwater recharge at 12 700 km3 year according to several scientists groundwater spring potential mapping gspm the process of locating areas with high probability of groundwater springs presence could provide useful information and knowledge in relative protection and management programs corsini et al 2009 oh et al 2011 moghaddam et al 2015 naghibi and dashtpagerdi 2017 in recent years numerous gspm studies which implement remote sensing rs techniques and geographical information system gis have been carried out successfully elbeih 2015 israil et al 2006 javed and wani 2009

mogaji et al 2016 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 and the logistic regression kim et al 2006 ozdemir 2011 lee et al 2012 recently machine learning techniques have also been applied in gspm studies with most frequently used adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system moosavi et al 2013 khosravi et al 2018 chen et al 2019a termeh et al 2019 random forest zabihi et al 2016 shannon s entropy naghibi et al 2015 classification and regression tree naghibi et al 2016 boosted regression tree naghibi et al 2018 maximum entropy rahmati et al 2016 artificial neural network model emamgholizadeh et al 2014 and generalized additive model falah et al 2017 have been found useful in the field of gspm ensemble methods are machine learning techniques in which a prediction model is formed from a combination of base classifiers hong et al 2018 since the 90 s ensemble methods had become a hot topic with a great number of researchers from different domains such as statistics data mining machine learning and pattern recognition developing and applying them in various classification and regression problems ensemble methods received much attention in recent years as they appear capable of performing well with complex and high dimensional data lee et al 2012 the most popular ensemble methods are the adaboost freund and schapire 1997 bagging breiman 1996 random subspace ho 1998 and rotation forest methods rodriguez et al 2006 until recently few studies have introduced ensemble methods in groundwater potential mapping naghibi et al 2017 presented a novel heterogeneous ensemble model which integrated adaboost bagging generalized additive model naïve bayes and frequency ration method the authors report that the novel ensemble method could be considered as a technique to reduce possible errors and over fitting in each of them and make an average strong model with better predictions kordestani et al 2018 proposed an em which combined evidential belief function and boosted regression tree techniques stating that the developed model provided highly accurate outcomes as manages ideal the weaknesses of each method a similar study that incorporates a number of ensemble machine learning methods was introduced by martínez santos and renard 2019 the authors report the advantage of ensemble methods against standard statistical methods especially in cases where there is enough ground truth data and a sufficiently meaningful set of explanatory variables is available providing added value by incorporating a measure of uncertainty to the results the main goal of the study was to evaluate the predictive performance of various tree based ensemble models concerning gspm the evaluation of different methods and techniques is a hot topic in groundwater spring potential assessments since the procedure of evaluation may contribute further to the understanding of the presence or absence of groundwater springs thus our attempt involves some kind of novelty beside the fact that adaboost ab bagging bag randomsubspace rs dagging dag and rotation forest rf with j48 decision tree j48 method being the base classifier have not been used in groundwater spring mapping wuqi county in shaanxi province china was chosen as a testing area so as to validate their performance 2 study area wuqi county is located between longitudes of 107 38 57 and 108 32 49 e and between latitudes of 36 33 33 and 37 24 27 n covering an area of 3791 km2 fig 1 wuqi county is characterized by a semi arid temperate continental monsoon climate the precipitation distribution which is largely affected by geographical factors atmospheric circulation landform and other factors appears to be uneven with the boundaries of the county the mean annual rainfall is estimated to be 500 mm while the evaporation is estimated 1541 7 mm almost 3 times the amount of the annual rainfall the relative humidity it is estimated to be 56 whereas the average annual wind speed is estimated to be 1 3 m s concerning the elevation of the research area it varies from 1230 m to 1800 m a s l whereas slopes from 0 to 59 84 about 84 22 has a slopes between 10 and 50 whereas areas with a slopes higher than 50 and less than 10 account for 0 04 and 15 73 of the total study area respectively geologically wuqi county belongs to northern shaanxi slope of erdos platform located in syncline structure which appears to be relatively simple with stable structure absence of large folds or fault structure 3 methodology the proposed methodology has four distinct phase procedures fig 2 i selection of data identification of the spring and non spring locations preparation of data ii perform a feature selection procedure applying the correlation attribute evaluation method iii apply ab j48 bag j48 rs j48 dag j48 and rf j48 models and iv validate and compare the ensemble models weka waikato environment for knowledge analysis 3 9 2 and arcgis 10 5 software was used during the study for data analysis and the construction of the groundwater spring potential maps 3 1 first phase the first phase involved identifying the spring and non spring areas and the construction of the necessary inventory map non spring areas were randomly selected from the free of groundwater spring s space by applying the create random points found in the data management tools in the arcgis platform esri 2015 a total of 235 springs and 235 non spring areas were reported also in this phase sixteen groundwater spring related variables were initially selected based on previous related studies khosravi et al 2018 chen et al 2019b martínez santos and renard 2019 tien bui et al 2019 the initial variables included elevation slope aspect planform and profile curvature curvature topographic wetness index stream transport and stream power indexes distance from river network lithology soil and landuse cover normalized difference vegetation index mean annual rainfall and distance from road network details of initial variables are presented below slope elevation and aspect are considered to contribute in the presence of groundwater springs climatic conditions specifically precipitation temperature humidity and evapotranspiration but also soil and vegetation profiles and soil moisture appear to have different patterns and trends which largely depend from the morphological settings of the surroundings moghaddam et al 2015 fig 3 a b c as for the three curvature indexes profile curvature is parallel to the direction of the maximum slope affecting the acceleration or deceleration of flow across the surface whereas planform curvature is perpendicular to the direction of the maximum slope and is related to the convergence and divergence of flow across a surface the curvature index is considered an index that expresses the flow patterns of a ground surface chen et al 2019c zhao and chen 2020 fig 3d e f according to pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 twi may contribute to the presence of groundwater springs as it can assist in identifying the location and size of saturated source zones fig 3g also spi which expresses the erosive power of water assuming that discharge is relative to specific catchment area and sti which expresses the capacity of sediment transport are identified as very important factors in the occurrence of groundwater springs chen et al 2020a fig 3h i distance from rivers has a great influence in the occurrence of groundwater springs since it affects the moisture content of soil and rock on the slope and also the infiltration rate miraki et al 2019 fig 3j the distance from road network is considered to have an influence on the occurrence of groundwater springs since its presence can cause local hydrological and erosion issues while affecting indirectly the groundwater table forman and alexander 1998 cuo et al 2006 also the presence of a road may influence the amount of soil moisture but also the infiltration rate as a result of the removal of geological formations and the disturbance of the surface during of the construction phase cuo et al 2006 chen et al 2019b fig 3k soil cover is also used in the present study as it is well known the type of soil cover affects the rate of surface and subsurface runoff production but the infiltration rate thus providing an indication of the potential occurrence of springs chen et al 2020a based on the soil information system of china in 2005 by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences national soil survey office 1995 the area is covered by new soils alluvial soils cultivated loessial soils sticky black loessial soils and red clay soils fig 3l both land use cover and ndvi have a great influence concerning the occurrence of groundwater springs they are mainly used to describe the status of the surface vegetation that in turn influences recharge rates and the presence of groundwater essential for the growth of vegetation communities maitre et al 1999 supervised algorithms were used for analyzing landsat images so as to produce land use cover specifically the maximum likelihood algorithms found in the arcgis platform and the image classification tool esri 2015 were applied in order to identify five land use classes including farm land forest land grass land water body and residential areas fig 3m τhe geospatial data cloud archive available at http www gscloud cn was the source for the landsat 8 operational land imagery resolution 30 m which was used to estimate the ndvi the index was classified into six classes using the natural break classification technique which groups classes based on break points that are characterized by large jumps in data values such the ones that can be identified in ndvi files tsangaratos and ilia 2016 pham et al 2018 park and kim 2019 fig 3n concerning the variable that expressed the mean annual rainfall it was created by using the ordinary kriging technique khorsandi et al 2006 and data of seventeen meteorological stations data span from 1980 to 2016 which were provided by the meteorological bureau of shaanxi province http www weather org cn ordinary kriging was found to provide better results in terms of accuracy against inverse distance weighting idw that probably could be attributed to the sparse meteorological station network the produced rainfall raster was classified into three classes 400 mm year 400 450 mm year 450 mm year fig 3o finally lithology has been considered as a significant feature in groundwater spring occurrence since two characteristics the porosity and the permeability of a lithological unit are directly associated with the presence or absence of groundwater springs ozdemir 2011 rahmati et al 2016 according to china s geological map http www cgs gov cn the study area is covered by loess sandstone mudstone and siltstone fig 3p each of the above variables was transformed into raster format with a grid cell size of 30x30m 3 2 second phase feature selection it is likely that some of the groundwater spring related variables have null contribution in the modelling process or introduce noise in the final outcome and should be removed chen et al 2018 to estimate the degree of influence of each groundwater spring related variable the correlation attribute evaluation cae method was used the cae method evaluates the contribution of a variable by calculating the pearson s correlation between the variable and the class witten et al 2011 3 3 third phase ensemble methods during the third phase the ensemble framework that was followed during the study created five different homogenous ensemble models based on the adaboost bagging dagging random subspace and rotation forest methods which had the j48 decision tree classifier as the base learner the j48 decision tree method is the c4 5 pruned decision tree quinlan 1993 which has been developed by the weka project team and programmed to classify unknown samples by sorting from root to leaf nodes anzola et al 2015 a brief description of the five ensemble methods will follow bagging is one of the first ensemble methods introduced in the mid 90 s by breiman 1996 bagging uses a bootstrap sampling technique which involves three distinct steps tien bui et al 2016 a a set of training subsets are constructed by randomly re sampling the training dataset b for each subset a classifier is applied and c a final model is constructed by aggregating all the classifiers bagging insures improvement in the classification accuracy by decreasing the variance of the classification error hong et al 2018 adaboost is considered as one of the most widely used boosting algorithms first introduced by freund and schapire 1997 adaboost uses an adaptive re sampling technique in order to choose training samples and make predictions which involves the following steps tien bui et al 2016 a a training subset is constructed randomly from the training dataset and a classifier is applied based on the training subset the data of which are assigned equal weights b the misclassified cases will receive higher weights whereas the weights of the correctly classified cases remain the same c a normalization process follows and a new training subset will be formed following the same procedure of step a the learning phase ends when certain stopping criteria are reached the final adboost model is a weighted sum of all the classifiers adaboost appears with enhanced predictive performance as it controls both bias and variance schapire 2003 the random subspace method was first introduced by ho 1998 as a method for improving accuracy through combining the power of multiple classifiers the method implements a pseudorandom procedure to select components of a feature vector which involves the following ho 1998 li et al 2013 a a small number of feature components are selected and construct a subspace b all instances are projected to this subspace and for each subspace a classifier is applied only to those projected instances c decision are made by simple majority voting in the final decision rule the dagging method was introduced by ting and witten 1997 the dagging method splits the training dataset into a number of disjoint stratified folds and trains each fold of data with the supplied base learner in case of classification problems the predictions are made by a majority vote technique whereas for regression problems by using an averaging procedure rotation forest is another newly proposed successful ensemble classifier generation technique kuncheva and whitaker 2003 in this study rotation forest is used to map the groundwater spring potentiality by building diverse and highly accurate classifiers rodriguez et al 2006 the framework of it can be described as follows let x be the training sample set y be the corresponding labels and h be the feature set assuming that there are n training samples and n features in a dataset then x is a matrix n n let ω be the set of class labels ω 1 ω 2 ω c from which y takes values assuming that the feature set is split randomly into k subsets with the approximate size there are l decision trees in a rotation forest which are denoted by d1 d2 dl hence l and k are the two parameters that should be determined in advance the training set for an individual classifier di is processed with the following steps a split h into k disjointed subsets randomly assuming that each feature subset contains m n k features b let hi j be the subset of features for training classifier di and xi j be the dataset x for the features in hi j c construct a sparse rotation matrix ri with the obtained coefficient in matrix ci j d the final result is obtained by combining the outputs of the multiple classifiers repeating the first three steps several times the success of rotation forest lies in the application of rotation matrix constructed by linear transformed subsets liu and huang 2008 3 4 fourth phase validation and comparison the receiver operating characteristics roc curve is a common method to assess the accuracy of a model pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 chen et al 2019d 2019e the roc curve can be generated by plotting on the y axis the sensitivity value and on the x axis the 100 specificity the area under the roc curve auc can be used to assess the learning and predictive performance of models and a larger auc indicates a better model chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 besides the roc curve sensitivity specificity accuracy acc positive predictive rates ppr and negative predictive rates npr were also estimated according to the following formulas chen et al 2020b 1 sensitivity tp tp f n 2 specificity tn tn f p 3 accuracy tp t n tp t n f p f n 4 positive p r e d i c t i v e r a t e tp tp f p 5 negative p r e d i c t i v e r a

inaccurately classified chen et al 2020b 4 results the second phase involved the selection of the predictive variables based on their predictive capabilities evaluated by using the cae method and a ten fold cross validation process tien bui et al 2016 according to the results of the cae method all of the sixteen variables were selected for further analysis the highest am value was calculated for the distance to rivers 0 427 followed by the distance to roads 0 392 elevation 0 329 slope aspect 0 236 land use 0 211 rainfall 0 200 soil cover 0 174 slope angle 0 173 twi 0 163 ndvi 0 110 spi 0 103

method that were estimated during a tuning process based on a trial and error procedure based on the outcomes of the training process rf j48 model showed the highest performance concerning the classification of groundwater spring potential having a sensitivity index equal to 0 848 followed by the ab j48 model 0 836 the bag j48 model 0 8300 the rs j48 0 764 and the dag j48 0 745 respectively table 3 the sensitivity index for the base classifier j48 was equal to 0 770 slightly higher than the sensitivity values of the rs j48 and dag j48 models concerning the classification of the non groundwater spring locations the highest performance is also achieved by the rf j48 specificity 0 806 followed by the ab j48 model 0 770 the rs j48 0 764 the bag j48 model 0 739 and the dag j48 0 721 respectively table 3 the base learner j48 had a specificity value of 0 764 achieving a better classification than the bag j48 and dag j48 models in terms of overall accuracy the rf j48 model classified correctly 82 70 of the training dataset and the ab j48 model showing an accuracy percentage equal to 80 30 the bag j48 model followed with classification accuracy 78 50 slightly better than the j48 76 70 the rs j48 model and dag j48 presented a slightly worst performance than the j48 76 40 and 73 30 respectively the estimation of the auc values indicates that all models performed well with the rf j48 presenting the highest performance auc 0 919 followed by the ab j48 auc 0 868 the bag j48 auc 0 861 the rs j48 model auc 0 845 and the dag j48 auc 0 804 respectively fig 4 the base learner j48 presented the worst performance auc 0 803 in respect with the comparison of the predictive performance between the ensemble models and the base learner j48 the calculation of the statistical indexes and the auc values showed that all ensemble models performed better than the j48 model table 4 fig 5 the sensitivity and specificity index for the base classifier j48 was equal to 0 643 the classification accuracy equal to 64 30 and the auc value equal to 0 665 the rf j48 model had the best performance among the other ensemble models in terms of specificity 0 786 accuracy 75 00 auc 0 797 and the second best performance in terms of sensitivity 0 714 following the ab j48 model 0 729 the ab j48 model showed a slightly lower auc value 0 793 and a much lower specificity value 0 643 and accuracy percentage 68 60 the bag j48 and dag j48 models performed quiet well in terms of accuracy with 70 90 and 70 70 of the validation dataset been correctly classified the rs j48 model showed the worst performance among the ensemble methods considering the classification accuracy 65 70 slightly higher than the j48 model and in respect with sensitivity index 0 643 the next phase involved the construction of the gsp maps by implementing the trained ensemble models the produced gsp maps were reclassified into five groundwater potential classes namely very low low moderate high and very high using the natural breaks method the spatial distribution of the very high class is quite similar in all models following the spatial distribution of the river network and the road network however covering a different percentage of land fig 6 the very low and low classes among the models differ both in spatial distribution and coverage with the ab j48 model having the highest percentage and a rather uniform spatial distribution within the research area fig 7 illustrates the distribution of the groundwater spring potential classes estimated for all models based on the produced gsp maps the rf j48 rs j48 and bag j48 models appear with a similar distribution pattern specifically the extent each class occupies within the research area is decreasing when moving from very low to very high potential classes ab j48 model appears with a different pattern having very low values within the inner classes low moderate and high 4 70 4 03 and 2 88 and higher values in the very low and very high classes 68 07 and 20 32 respectively also the base classifier j48 shows a similar distribution to the ab j48 model however only moderate and high classes occupy a small portion of the research area 5 15 and 3 83 the dag j48 model has the lowest percentage of very high potential class 6 61 followed by the rf j48 model 7 24 the bag j48 model 8 32 and the rs j48 model 9 62 5 discussions the cae analysis indicated that the distance from the river network and the road network were the most significant variables followed by the elevation and slope aspect lithology cover curvature plan and profile curvature appeared to be the least significant variables reviewing relevant literature concerning the influence the geo environmental variables have on the occurrence of groundwater springs it was apparent that our findings were in agreement with most cases chen et al 2019a stated that the variables lithology altitude and also distance from river network were the most important variables similar naghibi et al 2018 assessed the variables importance using the learning vector quantization method and concluded that altitude drainage density and slope had the highest importance among other variables also naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 stated that altitude was the most important variable whereas pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 reported that based on the results of an effect analysis slope aspect was the most important several studies identify the development of the river network expressed either by the distance from the spring or the drainage density have been identified as important variable elevation and slope aspect as primary morphological parameters influence the presence and development of soil and vegetation profiles that may affect the infiltration rate and also the influence the weather and climatic conditions that may affect the amount of surface water al abadi and shahid 2015 zabihi et al 2016 in our case the presence of the variable distance from the road network as the second most significant variable that influence the presence of groundwater springs could be simply justified by the fact that the road network largely follows the river network however the presence of a groundwater spring is greatly influenced by the geo morphological geological tectonic hydrological hydrogeological and the climatic conditions of an area pradhan 2009 moghaddam et al 2015 balamurugan et al 2017 according to naghibi and moradi dashtpagerdi 2017 different modeling processes could also influence the identification of the significance of groundwater spring related variables the results of the present study are in agreement with previous outcomes concerning gspm and the usage of ensemble models similar findings have been reported from other researchers that studied different classification problems such as landslide and flood phenomena which attribute the superiority of the ensemble models against individual predictive models to their ability to reduce both bias and variance and also the ability to avoid over fitting issues tien bui et al 2013 hong et al 2018 in the present study rf j48 model achieved the highest improvement compared with the base learner j48 and the other ensemble models as reported by rodriguez et al 2006 rf ensemble model implements a feature extraction technique so as to select the optimal set of variables for training the base classifier a procedure that is not followed in other ensemble methods like adaboost and bagging as a result more accurate predictions are made the ab j48 model produced a rather sharp outcome with very low gp class covering 68 07 of the total area and the very high gp class covering 20 32 the j48 model showed a similar spatial distribution pattern with the ab j48 model on the other hand rf j48 model produced a smoother gspm map with a decreasing percentage of coverage concerning the groundwater potential class while moving from the very low to the very high groundwater spring potential class despite their high predictive performance the tree based ensemble methods as most of machine learning approaches relay on the quantity and certainly the quality of inputs also another crucial point that could influence their performance is the process of identifying the non spring areas both issues may limit their efficiency and results should always be used with caution concerning future work plans the presented tree based ensemble methods could be applied to an area with different geo environment settings so as to evaluate their predictive performance also the usage of datasets with different percentage of training and testing data could serve as an additional evaluation criterion concerning their predictive performance finally the tree based ensemble methods should be applied to other assessments concerning natural hazards 6 conclusions the present study focused on evaluating the predictive performance of five ensemble models used for the construction of a groundwater spring potential map specifically adaboost bagging random subspace dagging and rotation forest which used as a base learner the j48 decision tree model were implemented in wuqi county shaanxi province china sixteen groundwater spring related variables elevation slope aspect planform and profile curvature curvature topographic wetness index stream transport index stream power index distance from river network lithology soil and landuse cover normalized difference vegetation index mean annual rainfall and distance from road network were evaluated the results of

learning gis tree based ensemble models china 1 introduction groundwater has been referred as one of the most crucial natural resource since it influences in a very significant degree the evolution of the geo environment and human development in relation to the other fresh water resource groundwater has significant advantages chowdhury et al 2009 manap et al 2013 groundwater exhibit in general lower pollution vulnerability and higher water quality it also appears in most cases having a lower susceptibility value in relation to environmental threats and climate change impacts neshat et al 2014 mogaji et al 2016 it has been well established that about one third of the world s population depends on groundwater supplies which has as a result the reduction of its volume in global scale according to a bundesanstalt für geowissenschaften und rohstoffe bgr report bgr 2011 the decade 2000 2010 there has been an increase in the consumption of groundwater nearly 1000 km3 year whereas the global groundwater recharge at 12 700 km3 year according to several scientists groundwater spring potential mapping gspm the process of locating areas with high probability of groundwater springs presence could provide useful information and knowledge in relative protection and management programs corsini et al 2009 oh et al 2011 moghaddam et al 2015 naghibi and dashtpagerdi 2017 in recent years numerous gspm studies which implement remote sensing rs techniques and geographical information system gis have been carried out successfully elbeih 2015 israil et al 2006 javed and wani 2009 kumar et al 2013 2014 kumar and kumar 2010 manap et al 2014 ozdemir 2011 rahmati et al 2015 thilagavathi et al 2015 zabihi et al 2016 examples of expert based and statistical models include multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods murthy and mamo 2009 chenini and mammou 2010 gupta and srivastava 2010 the analytical hierarchy process technique machiwal et al 2011 rahmati et al 2015 shekhar

mogaji et al 2016 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 and the logistic regression kim et al 2006 ozdemir 2011 lee et al 2012 recently machine learning techniques have also been applied in gspm studies with most frequently used adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system moosavi et al 2013 khosravi et al 2018 chen et al 2019a termeh et al 2019 random forest zabihi et al 2016 shannon s entropy naghibi et al 2015 classification and regression tree naghibi et al 2016 boosted regression tree naghibi et al 2018 maximum entropy rahmati et al 2016 artificial neural network model emamgholizadeh et al 2014 and generalized additive model falah et al 2017 have been found useful in the field of gspm ensemble methods are machine learning techniques in which a prediction model is formed from a combination of base classifiers hong et al 2018 since the 90 s ensemble methods had become a hot topic with a great number of researchers from different domains such as statistics data mining machine learning and pattern recognition developing and applying them in various classification and regression problems ensemble methods received much attention in recent years as they appear capable of performing well with complex and high dimensional data lee et al 2012 the most popular ensemble methods are the adaboost freund and schapire 1997 bagging breiman 1996 random subspace ho 1998 and rotation forest methods rodriguez et al 2006 until recently few studies have introduced ensemble methods in groundwater potential mapping naghibi et al 2017 presented a novel heterogeneous ensemble model which integrated adaboost bagging generalized additive model naïve bayes and frequency ration method the authors report that the novel ensemble method could be considered as a technique to reduce possible errors and over fitting in each of them and make an average strong model with better predictions kordestani et al 2018 proposed an em which combined evidential belief function and boosted regression tree techniques stating that the developed model provided highly accurate outcomes as manages ideal the weaknesses of each method a similar study that incorporates a number of ensemble machine learning methods was introduced by martínez santos and renard 2019 the authors report the advantage of ensemble methods against standard statistical methods especially in cases where there is enough ground truth data and a sufficiently meaningful set of explanatory variables is available providing added value by incorporating a measure of uncertainty to the results the main goal of the study was to evaluate the predictive performance of various tree based ensemble models concerning gspm the evaluation of different methods and techniques is a hot topic in groundwater spring potential assessments since the procedure of evaluation may contribute further to the understanding of the presence or absence of groundwater springs thus our attempt involves some kind of novelty beside the fact that adaboost ab bagging bag randomsubspace rs dagging dag and rotation forest rf with j48 decision tree j48 method being the base classifier have not been used in groundwater spring mapping wuqi county in shaanxi province china was chosen as a testing area so as to validate their performance 2 study area wuqi county is located between longitudes of 107 38 57 and 108 32 49 e and between latitudes of 36 33 33 and 37 24 27 n covering an area of 3791 km2 fig 1 wuqi county is characterized by a semi arid temperate continental monsoon climate the precipitation distribution which is largely affected by geographical factors atmospheric circulation landform and other factors appears to be uneven with the boundaries of the county the mean annual rainfall is estimated to be 500 mm while the evaporation is estimated 1541 7 mm almost 3 times the amount of the annual rainfall the relative humidity it is estimated to be 56 whereas the average annual wind speed is estimated to be 1 3 m s concerning the elevation of the research area it varies from 1230 m to 1800 m a s l whereas slopes from 0 to 59 84 about 84 22 has a slopes between 10 and 50 whereas areas with a slopes higher than 50 and less than 10 account for 0 04 and 15 73 of the total study area respectively geologically wuqi county belongs to northern shaanxi slope of erdos platform located in syncline structure which appears to be relatively simple with stable structure absence of large folds or fault structure 3 methodology the proposed methodology has four distinct phase procedures fig 2 i selection of data identification of the spring and non spring locations preparation of data ii perform a feature selection procedure applying the correlation attribute evaluation method iii apply ab j48 bag j48 rs j48 dag j48 and rf j48 models and iv validate and compare the ensemble models weka waikato environment for knowledge analysis 3 9 2 and arcgis 10 5 software was used during the study for data analysis and the construction of the groundwater spring potential maps 3 1 first phase the first phase involved identifying the spring and non spring areas and the construction of the necessary inventory map non spring areas were randomly selected from the free of groundwater spring s space by applying the create random points found in the data management tools in the arcgis platform esri 2015 a total of 235 springs and 235 non spring areas were reported also in this phase sixteen groundwater spring related variables were initially selected based on previous related studies khosravi et al 2018 chen et al 2019b martínez santos and renard 2019 tien bui et al 2019 the initial variables included elevation slope aspect planform and profile curvature curvature topographic wetness index stream transport and stream power indexes distance from river network lithology soil and landuse cover normalized difference vegetation index mean annual rainfall and distance from road network details of initial variables are presented below slope elevation and aspect are considered to contribute in the presence of groundwater springs climatic conditions specifically precipitation temperature humidity and evapotranspiration but also soil and vegetation profiles and soil moisture appear to have different patterns and trends which largely depend from the morphological settings of the surroundings moghaddam et al 2015 fig 3 a b c as for the three curvature indexes profile curvature is parallel to the direction of the maximum slope affecting the acceleration or deceleration of flow across the surface whereas planform curvature is perpendicular to the direction of the maximum slope and is related to the convergence and divergence of flow across a surface the curvature index is considered an index that expresses the flow patterns of a ground surface chen et al 2019c zhao and chen 2020 fig 3d e f according to pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 twi may contribute to the presence of groundwater springs as it can assist in identifying the location and size of saturated source zones fig 3g also spi which expresses the erosive power of water assuming that discharge is relative to specific catchment area and sti which expresses the capacity of sediment transport are identified as very important factors in the occurrence of groundwater springs chen et al 2020a fig 3h i distance from rivers has a great influence in the occurrence of groundwater springs since it affects the moisture content of soil and rock on the slope and also the infiltration rate miraki et al 2019 fig 3j the distance from road network is considered to have an influence on the occurrence of groundwater springs since its presence can cause local hydrological and erosion issues while affecting indirectly the groundwater table forman and alexander 1998 cuo et al 2006 also the presence of a road may influence the amount of soil moisture but also the infiltration rate as a result of the removal of geological formations and the disturbance of the surface during of the construction phase cuo et al 2006 chen et al 2019b fig 3k soil cover is also used in the present study as it is well known the type of soil cover affects the rate of surface and subsurface runoff production but the infiltration rate thus providing an indication of the potential occurrence of springs chen et al 2020a based on the soil information system of china in 2005 by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences national soil survey office 1995 the area is covered by new soils alluvial soils cultivated loessial soils sticky black loessial soils and red clay soils fig 3l both land use cover and ndvi have a great influence concerning the occurrence of groundwater springs they are mainly used to describe the status of the surface vegetation that in turn influences recharge rates and the presence of groundwater essential for the growth of vegetation communities maitre et al 1999 supervised algorithms were used for analyzing landsat images so as to produce land use cover specifically the maximum likelihood algorithms found in the arcgis platform and the image classification tool esri 2015 were applied in order to identify five land use classes including farm land forest land grass land water body and residential areas fig 3m τhe geospatial data cloud archive available at http www gscloud cn was the source for the landsat 8 operational land imagery resolution 30 m which was used to estimate the ndvi the index was classified into six classes using the natural break classification technique which groups classes based on break points that are characterized by large jumps in data values such the ones that can be identified in ndvi files tsangaratos and ilia 2016 pham et al 2018 park and kim 2019 fig 3n concerning the variable that expressed the mean annual rainfall it was created by using the ordinary kriging technique khorsandi et al 2006 and data of seventeen meteorological stations data span from 1980 to 2016 which were provided by the meteorological bureau of shaanxi province http www weather org cn ordinary kriging was found to provide better results in terms of accuracy against inverse distance weighting idw that probably could be attributed to the sparse meteorological station network the produced rainfall raster was classified into three classes 400 mm year 400 450 mm year 450 mm year fig 3o finally lithology has been considered as a significant feature in groundwater spring occurrence since two characteristics the porosity and the permeability of a lithological unit are directly associated with the presence or absence of groundwater springs ozdemir 2011 rahmati et al 2016 according to china s geological map http www cgs gov cn the study area is covered by loess sandstone mudstone and siltstone fig 3p each of the above variables was transformed into raster format with a grid cell size of 30x30m 3 2 second phase feature selection it is likely that some of the groundwater spring related variables have null contribution in the modelling process or introduce noise in the final outcome and should be removed chen et al 2018 to estimate the degree of influence of each groundwater spring related variable the correlation attribute evaluation cae method was used the cae method evaluates the contribution of a variable by calculating the pearson s correlation between the variable and the class witten et al 2011 3 3 third phase ensemble methods during the third phase the ensemble framework that was followed during the study created five different homogenous ensemble models based on the adaboost bagging dagging random subspace and rotation forest methods which had the j48 decision tree classifier as the base learner the j48 decision tree method is the c4 5 pruned decision tree quinlan 1993 which has been developed by the weka project team and programmed to classify unknown samples by sorting from root to leaf nodes anzola et al 2015 a brief description of the five ensemble methods will follow bagging is one of the first ensemble methods introduced in the mid 90 s by breiman 1996 bagging uses a bootstrap sampling technique which involves three distinct steps tien bui et al 2016 a a set of training subsets are constructed by randomly re sampling the training dataset b for each subset a classifier is applied and c a final model is constructed by aggregating all the classifiers bagging insures improvement in the classification accuracy by decreasing the variance of the classification error hong et al 2018 adaboost is considered as one of the most widely used boosting algorithms first introduced by freund and schapire 1997 adaboost uses an adaptive re sampling technique in order to choose training samples and make predictions which involves the following steps tien bui et al 2016 a a training subset is constructed randomly from the training dataset and a classifier is applied based on the training subset the data of which are assigned equal weights b the misclassified cases will receive higher weights whereas the weights of the correctly classified cases remain the same c a normalization process follows and a new training subset will be formed following the same procedure of step a the learning phase ends when certain stopping criteria are reached the final adboost model is a weighted sum of all the classifiers adaboost appears with enhanced predictive performance as it controls both bias and variance schapire 2003 the random subspace method was first introduced by ho 1998 as a method for improving accuracy through combining the power of multiple classifiers the method implements a pseudorandom procedure to select components of a feature vector which involves the following ho 1998 li et al 2013 a a small number of feature components are selected and construct a subspace b all instances are projected to this subspace and for each subspace a classifier is applied only to those projected instances c decision are made by simple majority voting in the final decision rule the dagging method was introduced by ting and witten 1997 the dagging method splits the training dataset into a number of disjoint stratified folds and trains each fold of data with the supplied base learner in case of classification problems the predictions are made by a majority vote technique whereas for regression problems by using an averaging procedure rotation forest is another newly proposed successful ensemble classifier generation technique kuncheva and whitaker 2003 in this study rotation forest is used to map the groundwater spring potentiality by building diverse and highly accurate classifiers rodriguez et al 2006 the framework of it can be described as follows let x be the training sample set y be the corresponding labels and h be the feature set assuming that there are n training samples and n features in a dataset then x is a matrix n n let ω be the set of class labels ω 1 ω 2 ω c from which y takes values assuming that the feature set is split randomly into k subsets with the approximate size there are l decision trees in a rotation forest which are denoted by d1 d2 dl hence l and k are the two parameters that should be determined in advance the training set for an individual classifier di is processed with the following steps a split h into k disjointed subsets randomly assuming that each feature subset contains m n k features b let hi j be the subset of features for training classifier di and xi j be the dataset x for the features in hi j c construct a sparse rotation matrix ri with the obtained coefficient in matrix ci j d the final result is obtained by combining the outputs of the multiple classifiers repeating the first three steps several times the success of rotation forest lies in the application of rotation matrix constructed by linear transformed subsets liu and huang 2008 3 4 fourth phase validation and comparison the receiver operating characteristics roc curve is a common method to assess the accuracy of a model pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 chen et al 2019d 2019e the roc curve can be generated by plotting on the y axis the sensitivity value and on the x axis the 100 specificity the area under the roc curve auc can be used to assess the learning and predictive performance of models and a larger auc indicates a better model chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 besides the roc curve sensitivity specificity accuracy acc positive predictive rates ppr and negative predictive rates npr were also estimated according to the following formulas chen et al 2020b 1 sensitivity tp tp f n 2 specificity tn tn f p 3 accuracy tp t n tp t n f p f n 4 positive p r e d i c t i v e r a t e tp tp f p 5 negative p r e d i c t i v e r a t e tn tn f n where tp true positive and tn true negative are the number of pixels that are accurately classified and fp false positive and fn false negative are the numbers of pixels that are inaccurately classified chen et al 2020b 4 results the second phase involved the selection of the predictive variables based on their predictive capabilities evaluated by using the cae method and a ten fold cross validation process tien bui et al 2016 according to the results of the cae method all of the sixteen variables were selected for further analysis the highest am value was calculated for the distance to rivers 0 427 followed by the distance to roads 0 392 elevation 0 329 slope aspect 0 236 land use 0 211 rainfall 0 200 soil cover 0 174 slope angle 0 173 twi 0 163 ndvi 0 110 spi 0 103 sti 0 093 curvature 0 089 profile curvature 0 084 lithology cover 0 059 and plan curvature 0 040 table 1 table 2 illustrates the optimal values used for the structural parameters for each ensemble method that were estimated during a tuning process based on a trial and error procedure based on the outcomes of the training process rf j48 model showed the highest performance concerning the classification of groundwater spring potential having a sensitivity index equal to 0 848 followed by the ab j48 model 0 836 the bag j48 model 0 8300 the rs j48 0 764 and the dag j48 0 745 respectively table 3 the sensitivity index for the base classifier j48 was equal to 0 770 slightly higher than the sensitivity values of the rs j48 and dag j48 models concerning the classification of the non groundwater spring locations the highest performance is also achieved by the rf j48 specificity 0 806 followed by the ab j48 model 0 770 the rs j48 0 764 the bag j48 model 0 739 and the dag j48 0 721 respectively table 3 the base learner j48 had a specificity value of 0 764 achieving a better classification than the bag j48 and dag j48 models in terms of overall accuracy the rf j48 model classified correctly 82 70 of the training dataset and the ab j48 model showing an accuracy percentage equal to 80 30 the bag j48 model followed with classification accuracy 78 50 slightly better than the j48 76 70 the rs j48 model and dag j48 presented a slightly worst performance than the j48 76 40 and 73 30 respectively the estimation of the auc values indicates that all models performed well with the rf j48 presenting the highest performance auc 0 919 followed by the ab j48 auc 0 868 the bag j48 auc 0 861 the rs j48 model auc 0 845 and the dag j48 auc 0 804 respectively fig 4 the base learner j48 presented the worst performance auc 0 803 in respect with the comparison of the predictive performance between the ensemble models and the base learner j48 the calculation of the statistical indexes and the auc values showed that all ensemble models performed better than the j48 model table 4 fig 5 the sensitivity and specificity index for the base classifier j48 was equal to 0 643 the classification accuracy equal to 64 30 and the auc value equal to 0 665 the rf j48 model had the best performance among the other ensemble models in terms of specificity 0 786 accuracy 75 00 auc 0 797 and the second best performance in terms of sensitivity 0 714 following the ab j48 model 0 729 the ab j48 model showed a slightly lower auc value 0 793 and a much lower specificity value 0 643 and accuracy percentage 68 60 the bag j48 and dag j48 models performed quiet well in terms of accuracy with 70 90 and 70 70 of the validation dataset been correctly classified the rs j48 model showed the worst performance among the ensemble methods considering the classification accuracy 65 70 slightly higher than the j48 model and in respect with sensitivity index 0 643 the next phase involved the construction of the gsp maps by implementing the trained ensemble models the produced gsp maps were reclassified into five groundwater potential classes namely very low low moderate high and very high using the natural breaks method the spatial distribution of the very high class is quite similar in all models following the spatial distribution of the river network and the road network however covering a different percentage of land fig 6 the very low and low classes among the models differ both in spatial distribution and coverage with the ab j48 model having the highest percentage and a rather uniform spatial distribution within the research area fig 7 illustrates the distribution of the groundwater spring potential classes estimated for all models based on the produced gsp maps the rf j48 rs j48 and bag j48 models appear with a similar distribution pattern specifically the extent each class occupies within the research area is decreasing when moving from very low to very high potential classes ab j48 model appears with a different pattern having very low values within the inner classes low moderate and high 4 70 4 03 and 2 88 and higher values in the very low and very high classes 68 07 and 20 32 respectively also the base classifier j48 shows a similar distribution to the ab j48 model however only moderate and high classes occupy a small portion of the research area 5 15 and 3 83 the dag j48 model has the lowest percentage of very high potential class 6 61 followed by the rf j48 model 7 24 the bag j48 model 8 32 and the rs j48 model 9 62 5 discussions the cae analysis indicated that the distance from the river network and the road network were the most significant variables followed by the elevation and slope aspect lithology cover curvature plan and profile curvature appeared to be the least significant variables reviewing relevant literature concerning the influence the geo environmental variables have on the occurrence of groundwater springs it was apparent that our findings were in agreement with most cases chen et al 2019a stated that the variables lithology altitude and also distance from river network were the most important variables similar naghibi et al 2018 assessed the variables importance using the learning vector quantization method and concluded that altitude drainage density and slope had the highest importance among other variables also naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 stated that altitude was the most important variable whereas pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 reported that based on the results of an effect analysis slope aspect was the most important several studies identify the development of the river network expressed either by the distance from the spring or the drainage density have been identified as important variable elevation and slope aspect as primary morphological parameters influence the presence and development of soil and vegetation profiles that may affect the infiltration rate and also the influence the weather and climatic conditions that may affect the amount of surface water al abadi and shahid 2015 zabihi et al 2016 in our case the presence of the variable distance from the road network as the second most significant variable that influence the presence of groundwater springs could be simply justified by the fact that the road network largely follows the river network however the presence of a groundwater spring is greatly influenced by the geo morphological geological tectonic hydrological hydrogeological and the climatic conditions of an area pradhan 2009 moghaddam et al 2015 balamurugan et al 2017 according to naghibi and moradi dashtpagerdi 2017 different modeling processes could also influence the identification of the significance of groundwater spring related variables the results of the present study are in agreement with previous outcomes concerning gspm and the usage of ensemble models similar findings have been reported from other researchers that studied different classification problems such as landslide and flood phenomena which attribute the superiority of the ensemble models against individual predictive models to their ability to reduce both bias and variance and also the ability to avoid over fitting issues tien bui et al 2013 hong et al 2018 in the present study rf j48 model achieved the highest improvement compared with the base learner j48 and the other ensemble models as reported by rodriguez et al 2006 rf ensemble model implements a feature extraction technique so as to select the optimal set of variables for training the base classifier a procedure that is not followed in other ensemble methods like adaboost and bagging as a result more accurate predictions are made the ab j48 model produced a rather sharp outcome with very low gp class covering 68 07 of the total area and the very high gp class covering 20 32 the j48 model showed a similar spatial distribution pattern with the ab j48 model on the other hand rf j48 model produced a smoother gspm map with a decreasing percentage of coverage concerning the groundwater potential class while moving from the very low to the very high groundwater spring potential class despite their high predictive performance the tree based ensemble methods as most of machine learning approaches relay on the quantity and certainly the quality of inputs also another crucial point that could influence their performance is the process of identifying the non spring areas both issues may limit their efficiency and results should always be used with caution concerning future work plans the presented tree based ensemble methods could be applied to an area with different geo environment settings so as to evaluate their predictive performance also the usage of datasets with different percentage of training and testing data could serve as an additional evaluation criterion concerning their predictive performance finally the tree based ensemble methods should be applied to other assessments concerning natural hazards 6 conclusions the present study focused on evaluating the predictive performance of five ensemble models used for the construction of a groundwater spring potential map specifically adaboost bagging random subspace dagging and rotation forest which used as a base learner the j48 decision tree model were implemented in wuqi county shaanxi province china sixteen groundwater spring related variables elevation slope aspect planform and profile curvature curvature topographic wetness index stream transport index stream power index distance from river network lithology soil and landuse cover normalized difference vegetation index mean annual rainfall and distance from road network were evaluated the results of a correlation attribute evaluation analysis indicated the high predictive capabilities of all groundwater spring related variables based on the outcomes of the learning procedure the ensemble models recorded higher predictive performance compared with the performance of the base learner moreover rotation forest j48 model achieved the highest prediction accuracy auc value 0 797 followed by adaboost j48 model auc value 0 793 bagging j48 0 768 random subspace j48 0 766 and dagging j48 0 748 overall tree based ensemble models have proven to be efficient accurate and reliable predictive

5727,the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes comprised an mw 6 2 foreshock and an mw 7 0 mainshock that occurred at 21 26 jst on april 14 and at 01 25 jst on april 16 respectively ruptures and vibrations associated with these earthquakes induced effects on streams discharge in kumamoto and oita prefectures however few studies have conducted comprehensive investigation of such changes in those areas in this study 174 measurements of river water level were carried out as reflecting increase decrease or no change after the foreshock or after the mainshock when compared with the level before the foreshock trends of increase and decrease after the foreshock mainshock were recognized at 6 and 19 37 and 15 stream gauges respectively the ones that showed a trend of increase after the mainshock were located mostly in mountainous areas elevation 300 m a coseismic increase in river water level suggested increased groundwater supply from the mountains via enhanced permeability the difference in river discharge between upstream and downstream gauges relative to the suizenji fault zone revealed a huge volume approx 900 000 m3 of river water was lost from the river during the 12 h period following the mainshock it is possible that the missing river water flowed into new fault zones formed by the earthquakes keywords the 2016 kumamoto earthquake river water level river discharge mountain groundwater 1 introduction previous studies have reported river water level changes caused by earthquakes and the processes associated with observed increase decrease of discharge have been discussed for example montgomery and manga 2003 reviewed three types of mechanism proposed to explain changes in streamflow observed after the occurrence of an earthquake aquifer deformation change in hydraulic conductivity or the opening closing of near surface fractures and consolidation of surficial deposits subsequently manga and wang 2007 suggested that the reasons for change in streamflow could be divided into five categories expulsion of deep crustal fluids resulting from coseismic elastic strain changes in near surface permeability consolidation or liquefaction of near surface deposits rupturing of subsurface reservoirs and release of water trapped in fault zones river discharge increase has also been reported in association with earthquake induced rupturing of pressurized hydrothermal reservoirs during the 2003 san simeon earthquake in the usa wang et al 2004 and enhanced vertical permeability induced by dynamic strain in the maule m8 8 earthquake in chile mohr et al 2016 the mw 6 2 foreshock and mw 7 0 mainshock of the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes occurred at 21 26 jst on april 14 and at 01 25 jst on april 16 respectively the epicenters of the foreshock and the mainshock were located at 32142 00 n 130148 00 e and 32148 00 n 130148 00 e respectively at depths of 11 12 km around the hinagu and futagawa active faults in the kumamoto area in addition many fault zones were activated and some foreshocks mw 5 0 occurred in the oita area consequently numerous landslides and mudflows triggered by these earthquakes occurred in kumamoto and oita prefectures and the ruptures and vibrations associated with the earthquakes induced river water changes within these areas there are a lot of springs and dense groundwater observation networks in the kumamoto region some earlier studies have considered the groundwater changes attributable to the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes i e hosono et al 2018 2019 however only a few studies have investigated river water changes in the kumamoto area i e ichiyanagi and ando 2017 koizumi et al 2019 this study investigated the spatial distribution of river water change throughout a wide area of kumamoto and oita prefectures caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes furthermore processes potentially responsible for the observed earthquake induced river water changes were proposed 2 study area and methods the kumamoto region is composed of the paleozoic basement of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks the pre aso volcanic rocks of tertiarye quaternary age the quaternary aso volcanic rocks and overlaying alluvium deposits hosono et al 2013 this region is characterized by active groundwater flows within quaternary volcanic pyroclastic deposits porous lava and alluvial deposits hosono et al 2019 there are two aquifers shallow unconfined aquifer is composed of pyroclastic and alluvial sedimentary deposits deep coffined aquifer is composed of porous andesitic lava and pyroclastic deposits hosono et al 2013 hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity of these aquifers are 5 0 10 4 1 0 10 7 m s and 0 1 0 2 respectively mori et al 2016 these near surface groundwater systems represent the upper 200 m that overlie relatively impermeable basement of paleozoic metasedimentary rocks and pliocene to quaternary volcanic rocks hosono et al 2019 on the other hand the oita region is composed of the mesozoic metamorphic rocks pleistocene sediments and volcanic rocks yoshioka et al 1997 data of river water level and discharge were collected from the water and disaster management bureau of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism the rivers division of the kumamoto prefectural government office and the rivers division of the oita prefectural government office hourly river water level data were collected at 59 and 115 stream gauges in kumamoto prefecture and oita prefecture respectively the distribution of river gauges and the river networks are shown in fig 1 moreover the main faults the futagawa and hinagu strike slip faults in kumamoto region and the beppu haneyama normal fault system in oita region and newly recognized postseismic fault zones fujiwara et al 2016 and the epicenters of the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes are also shown in the figure the 2016 kumamoto earthquake sequence involved strike slip and normal displacement with a northwest southeast extension and focal depths of 3 17 km hosono et al 2019 change in river water level at each stream gauge following the foreshock and the mainshock was classified into one of three trends increase decrease and no change first the minimum min average ave and maximum max values of river water level were calculated before the foreshock from 01 00 jst on april 13 to 21 00 jst on april 14 then if the minimum value between the foreshock and the mainshock from 22 00 jst on april 14 to 01 00 jst on april 16 was lower than the min ave min value it was classified as a decrease in contrast if the maximum value between the foreshock and the mainshock was higher than the max max ave value it was classified as an increase however if the river water level after the foreshock was between the min ave min and the max max ave values it was classified as no change similarly the river water level at each stream gauge following the mainshock from 02 00 jst to 22 00 jst on april 16 was classified into one of the three trends the differences in river water level between the period before the foreshock at 21 00 jst on april 14 and the min or max after both the foreshock and the mainshock were also calculated to find out only clear differences in river water level from before the foreshock not only out of range but more severe criteria was applied in addition hourly discharge data at five stream gauges on the shira river were collected from the water information system of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of river water level changes the spatial distribution of the trend in river water level changes between the period before the foreshock and after both the foreshock and the mainshock is shown in fig 2 in the case of the foreshock river water level showed trends of increase and decrease at 6 and 19 stream gauges respectively most stream gauges that showed a change in river water level only in the kumamoto region were located near the epicenter and active fault zones which suggests the changes were associated with earthquake magnitude correlation between the magnitude of streamflow response and distance from an earthquake epicenter has been highlighted following the m6 8 nisqually earthquake in the usa mongomery et al 2003 in the case of the mainshock river water level showed trends of increase and decrease at 37 and 15 stream gauges respectively the number of stream gauges that showed a trend of increase following the mainshock was much higher than following the foreshock this is in agreement with many previous studies that have reported that streamflow increases following a seismic event montgomery and manga 2003 the stream gauges that showed a trend of increase following the mainshock were located mostly in the mountainous area similarly previous studies have reported rapid release of water from mountains following the 1999 chi chi earthquake in taiwan wang et al 2010 and new flows that originated from groundwater in nearby mountains released by the 2014 south napa earthquake in the usa wang and manga 2015 the relationship between differences in water level change and elevation of the stream gauges is shown in fig 3 following the foreshock only one stream gauge reported a change in river water level of approximately 0 8 m the change at most stream gauges was within 0 2 m following the mainshock most stream gauges reported a change in river water level of 0 4 to 0 6 m the elevation of stream gauges that showed positive or negative change after the foreshock was 10 m and 300 m respectively whereas the corresponding elevation after the mainshock was 10 and 500 m respectively gauging stations at an elevation of 300 m showed only positive change after the mainshock it suggests that an increase in discharge after the earthquakes originated from increased groundwater supply in the mountains via enhanced vertical permeability wang and manga 2015 and extensive coseismic fractures that allowed subvertical groundwater drainage from the mountains wang et al 2010 concerning the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes hosono et al 2019 mentioned that the observed groundwater level rise in recharge areas of kumamoto region was caused by coseismic mountain water release due to permeability enhancement increasing the spatial distribution of change in river water level following the foreshock and the mainshock was found not to correspond with seismic intensity defined by the japan meteorological agency kato et al 2016 or with the horizontal and vertical displacement geospatial information authority of japan 2016 there are also no correlations between volumetric strain and water level change in unconfined and confined groundwaters hosono et al 2019 the aso bridge on the shira river collapsed during huge landslides triggered by the seismic events and some irrigation dams and reservoirs were damaged hazarika et al 2017 heavy damage was inflicted on river dikes e g cracks settlement and boil sands liquefaction in the basins of the shira and midori rivers mukunoki et al 2016 lin and chiba 2017 and pipelines supplying water to the city of kumamoto were damaged wham et al 2017 the trend of change of river water level at some gauging stations might have been affected by such damage rather than by the seismic inertial forces of the earthquakes directly therefore it is difficult to recognize the direct impact of the earthquakes from the spatial distribution of river water change actually koizumi et al 2019 investigated daily streamflow rates at some gauges before and after the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes only in the kumamoto area and mentioned a decrease in the water holding capacity of the catchment caused by earthquake induced landslides can explain delayed streamflow increase 3 2 flow discharge in the shira river the changes in river water level and discharge at five stream gauges on the shira river were compared as shown in fig 4 both active fault zones and new fault zones are also shown in this figure the relative changes in hourly water level from each reference level at tateno yoshihaa bridge myoken bridge kokai bridge and yotsugi bridge during april 14 16 2016 are shown in fig 5 a the river water level at tateno dropped immediately after the mainshock from 1 63 m at 11 00 jst to 1 01 m at 04 00 jst although it recovered quickly to 1 85 m at 05 00 jst on april 16 surprisingly river levels decreased by approximately 0 6 m during a 3 h period and then increased by approximately 0 8 m during a 1 h period many new fault zones were formed near tateno stream gauge by the earthquakes especially on the western side of the aso caldera mountains fujiwara et al 2016 these new fault zones could have affected river water loss similarly the river water level at the kokai and yotsugi bridges decreased by approximately 0 2 m during the 12 h period following the mainshock although it subsequently increased rapidly by approximately 0 5 m the increase in water level following the mainshock in comparison with the period before the foreshock might be attributable to increased groundwater drainage from the mountains through coseismic extensive fractures wang et al 2004 these water levels rose at gauging stations after the mainshock was concluded by the released mountain waters and precipitation in the upstream catchment hosono et al 2019 in contrast the river water level at the myoken and yoshihara bridges increased after the mainshock the change in river discharge at the yoshihara and yotsugi bridges is shown in fig 5 b the yotsugi bridge is located about 11 km downstream from the yoshihara bridge before the mainshock the river discharge at the yoshihara bridge was approximately 35 m3 s however after the mainshock it increased to about 55 m3 s at 09 00 jst and then it increased subsequently to more than 90 m3 s after 12 00 jst on april 16 in contrast the river discharge at the yotsugi bridge decreased from 15 to 8 m3 s immediately following the foreshock when the mainshock occurred river discharge decreased gradually from 10 to 4 m3 s by 12 00 jst although it subsequently increased suddenly to 30 m3 s by 14 00 jst on april 16 the difference in the change of river discharge between upstream and downstream stream gauges would be very interesting unfortunately continuous discharge data were unavailable at other stream gauges following the mainshock the difference in river discharge between the yoshihara and yotsugi bridges is shown in fig 5 c the difference in discharge between these two locations was approximately 20 m3 s before the foreshock and 60 m3 s after the mainshock the accumulated difference between them was at least 881 530 m3 during the 12 h period following the mainshock 02 00 13 00 jst on april 16 this indicates that a huge volume of river water approximately 900 000 m3 was lost during this 12 h period new fault zones formed by large 10 5 extensional volumetric strain are crosscut groundwater flow systems and the shira river very high hydraulic conductivities 1 0 cm s and average porosity 0 2 of the aquifers were assumed for the suizenji fault systems and approximately 2 7 107 m3 of groundwater loss by crustal ruptures within this area were calculated hosono et al 2019 therefore it is possible that the lost river water flowed into these new faults 4 conclusions the spatial distribution of the change in river water level at 174 stream gauges in kumamoto and oita prefectures was analyzed based on comparison of the levels before and after the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes most stream gauges that exhibited change in river water level after the foreshock were located near either the epicenter or the active fault zones however the spatial distribution of change in river water level after the mainshock did not correspond with seismic intensity or with horizontal and vertical displacement most stream gauges in mountainous areas especially those with elevation 300 m showed a trend of increase after the mainshock suggesting that subvertical groundwater drainage from mountains was increased via enhanced vertical permeability analysis of the change in river discharge of the shira river after the mainshock revealed the loss of a huge volume of river water approximately 900 000 m3 in a 12 h period between the yoshihara and yotsugi bridges it is possible that the lost river water flowed into new faults found in this area following the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes credit authorship contribution statement kimpei ichiyanagi

5727,the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes comprised an mw 6 2 foreshock and an mw 7 0 mainshock that occurred at 21 26 jst on april 14 and at 01 25 jst on april 16 respectively ruptures and vibrations associated with these earthquakes induced effects on streams discharge in kumamoto and oita prefectures however few studies have conducted comprehensive investigation of such changes in those areas in this study 174 measurements of river water level were carried out as reflecting increase decrease or no change after the foreshock or after the mainshock when compared with the level before the foreshock trends of increase and decrease after the foreshock mainshock were recognized at 6 and 19 37 and 15 stream gauges respectively the ones that showed a trend of increase after the mainshock were located mostly in mountainous areas elevation 300 m a coseismic increase in river water level suggested increased groundwater supply from the mountains via enhanced permeability the difference in river discharge between upstream and downstream gauges relative to the suizenji fault zone revealed a huge volume approx 900 000 m3 of river water was lost from the river during the 12 h period following the mainshock it is possible that the missing river water flowed into new fault zones formed by the earthquakes keywords the 2016 kumamoto earthquake river water level river discharge mountain groundwater 1 introduction previous studies have reported river water level changes caused by earthquakes and the processes associated with observed increase decrease of discharge have been discussed for example montgomery and manga 2003 reviewed three types of mechanism proposed to explain changes in streamflow observed after the occurrence of an earthquake aquifer deformation change in hydraulic conductivity or the opening closing of near surface fractures and consolidation of surficial deposits subsequently manga and wang 2007 suggested that the reasons for change in streamflow could be divided into five categories expulsion of deep crustal fluids resulting from coseismic elastic strain changes in near surface permeability consolidation or liquefaction of near surface deposits rupturing of subsurface reservoirs and release of water trapped in fault zones river discharge increase has also been reported in association with earthquake induced rupturing of pressurized hydrothermal reservoirs during the 2003 san simeon earthquake in the usa wang et al 2004 and enhanced vertical permeability induced by dynamic strain in the maule m8 8 earthquake in chile mohr et al 2016 the mw 6 2 foreshock and mw 7 0 mainshock of the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes occurred at 21 26 jst on april 14 and at 01 25 jst on april 16 respectively the epicenters of the foreshock and the mainshock were located at 32142 00 n 130148 00 e and 32148 00 n 130148 00 e respectively at depths of 11 12 km around the hinagu and futagawa active faults in the kumamoto area in addition many fault

5728,ground penetrating radar gpr has been widely used for shallow subsurface exploration in recent decades the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda was proposed and has been proved as one of the most efficient algorithms for data assimilation in variational fields in this paper es mda is first applied as the assimilation scheme to inversely model the soil hydraulic parameters by using gpr data as the observation in a synthetic example presented hydrus 1d is applied to generate the water content data and later converted into gpr data as observations based on the petrophysical relationship several synthetic experiments are performed to evaluate the related factors and test the performance of gpr data assimilation via es mda the results show that the novel approach can accurately estimate soil hydraulic parameters and effectively characterize the water content distribution keywords data assimilation parameters estimation ground penetrating radar ensemble smoother soil water content 1 introduction the unsaturated zone is an important part of atmospheric precipitation and surface water conversion to groundwater and the soil water content is a crucial property in evaluating the unsaturated zone estimation of soil hydraulic parameters and description of water content distribution are important for hydrogeology agriculture and many other fields the geophysical method is an efficient way for vadose zone investigation e g the study of revil et al 2017 showed that electrical potential data is correlated to the depth of the vadose zone and water table ground penetrating radar gpr is a high resolution geophysical technique and the relationship between permittivity and hydraulic parameters topp et al 1980 knoll et al 1995 makes it possible to estimate water content with gpr the ground wave method is one of the most commonly used gpr techniques to measure soil water content hubbard et al 2002 used ground wave data to estimate the soil water content at a vineyard and the results showed that this approach can provide a high resolution profile for shallow soil moisture wijewardana and galagedara 2010 applied the ground wave method to estimate the spatial and temporal variability of soil water content in raised bed agricultural beds the gpr measurements correlated well with gravimetrically measured values which indicated the accuracy of this method steelman and endres 2011 compared several commonly used empirical relationships between dielectric and hydraulic parameters with ground wave method the results show that different equations have various fitting degrees to different soil textures and should be considered in practice qin et al 2013 applied the ground wave method to monitor the near surface water content distribution in the arid zone the result shows that gpr is suitable for large scale ground detection based on the ground wave method researchers have done some improvements pettinelli et al 2007 carried out an experiment to demonstrate the strong relationship between soil hydraulic parameters and gpr early time signals this study provides a new approach to calculate soil water content di matteo et al 2012 and pettinelli et al 2014 tested the accuracy of using average envelope amplitude aea to estimate soil moisture and revealed the best time range of gpr signals for calculations and this method has been widely used since then although ground wave measurement is fast and easy to apply it only performs well in a shallow depth in order to obtain deeper soil water content other detection techniques need to be considered binley et al 2001 and alumbaugh et al 2002 applied the cross borehole method to estimate soil water content in the unsaturated zone the high resolution and accurate results indicated the possibility of using this technique in the heterogeneous environment galagedara et al 2002 2003 measured the spatial and temporal variability of soil water content with the cross borehole method compared with tdr measurements the results illustrated that water tends to flow to high moisture zones rucker and ferré 2003 2004 2005 did a lot of work using borehole gpr to

temperature data to update hydraulic parameters and water content they compared the influence of covariance matrix on the results and suggested the locations of temperature sensors the sequential data assimilation process of enkf requires a restart of simulation at each step which may cause a huge computational cost and is not feasible in many situations therefore other alternated methods were proposed van leeuwen and evensen 1996 introduced the ensemble soother es as an alternative way to enkf instead of assimilating observation data one time step after another the es simultaneously assimilates all the data to achieve a global update which makes it run faster and easier to implement in practice bailey and baù 2010 applied es to assimilate hydraulic head and return flow measurements into groundwater modeling the results of hydraulic conductivity estimation demonstrated the effectiveness and low computational burden of es skjervheim and evensen 2011 illustrated that es is an efficient method for reservoir history matching problems which can greatly shorten the assimilation time however the es only returns one global update the result may not be as good as enkf evensen and van leeuwen 2000 indicated that enkf sometimes performs better than es due to the sequential data assimilation this recursive process can keep the state vectors close to the reference in 2013 emerick and reynolds introduced ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda in which the same measurements can be used multiple times to reach a better update result and it is easy and efficient to implement in practice emerick and reynolds 2013a b applied es mda in a field case in which a turbidite reservoir was studied the result showed that es mda could produce a more realistic model than the model obtained by engineers manually fokker et al 2016 succeeded in constraining the parameters of the gas reservoir by assimilating line of sight radar measurements with es mda maucec et al 2016 integrated reservoir modeling for an oil field with es mda in this study production and pressure data were assimilated in the reservoir model resulted in better predictive values zhao et al 2017 proposed a new history matching method for channelized reservoir by using es mda and dct methods in this paper gpr measurement is first applied as the observation data to calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters via es mda several synthetic cases are designed to test the capability of the new method the result shows that assimilate gpr data into es mda can effectively calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters and have a better prediction on the soil moisture the rest of this paper is organized as follows the methods used in this paper are explained in section 2 synthetic experiments are conducted in section 3 to test the performance of the proposed approach then the results and influencing factors are discussed in section 4 finally the conclusion is presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 water flow modeling in this paper hydrus 1d is used to simulate the one dimensional water movement in the unsaturated zone the governing equation can be described by a modified form of the richards equation richards 1931 1 θ t z k h z c o s φ s where θ is volumetric water content t is time z is the vertical coordinate positive upward k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity h is the water pressure head φ is the angle between the flow direction and the vertical axis and s is the sink term the parameters θ h and k are determined by the equations mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 expressed as follows 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θ r and θ s are residual and saturated soil water content respectively α n and m are shape parameters k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and s e is the effective saturation the pore connectivity and tortuosity parameter l was estimated to be 0 5 by mualem 1976 and the value was used in most studies since then 2 2 gpr method the whole process of obtaining water content measured by gpr is shown in fig 4 the relative permittivity used in gpr forward modeling is converted from the reference soil water content with the relationship described by complex refractive index model crim knoll et al 1995 the conversion formula is shown below 4 ε r θ ε w β 1 ϕ ε s β ϕ θ ε a β 1 β where ε r is the relative permittivity θ is volumetric water content ε w ε s and ε a are the permittivity of water soil particles and air respectively ϕ is porosity and β is a parameter related to the direction of electric field here we set β to 0 5 after obtaining the permittivity ε r we establish the gpr forward model with the same depth as the hydrus 1d model since we only focus on vertical flow transport the width of the gpr forward model is set to 20 cm for the sake of simplifying the problem the propagation of electromagnetic wave can be expressed by maxwell s equations 5 e μ 0 μ r h t 6 e ε 0 ε r e t σ e e where e indicates the electric field strength v m h indicates the magnetic field strength a m μ 0 is the permeability of vacuum h m μ r is the relative permeability ε 0 is the permittivity of vacuum f m ε r is the relative permittivity σ e is the conductivity s m and t is the time s the equations mentioned above can be solved by the finite difference time domain fdtd method this method was proposed by yee 1966 and we use fdtd for gpr forward modeling with perfectly matched layer pml boundary condition berenger 1994 the frequency of gpr used in this paper is 400 mhz the cross borehole gpr technique is shown in fig 1 the transmitting and receiving antennas are located in two parallel boreholes at the same depth after data collection the transmitting and receiving antennas move to the next location and so on the width of the soil column w m between the transmitter and receiver is able to be measured and we can get the travel time t travel s of an electromagnetic wave through the data collected then the wave velocity v m s can be calculated by the equation v w t travel the relationship between wave velocity and permittivity is as follows davis and annan 1989 7 v c ε r where c is the velocity of light generally taken as 3 108 m s through eq 7 we can get the relative permittivity ε r c v 2 then adjusting eq 4 to calculate water content measured by gpr as follows 8 θ ε r 1 ϕ ε s ϕ ε a ε w ε a where ϕ and ε s depend on soil type ε a and ε w are usually equal to 1 and 81 respectively in order to get the travel time t travel we apply the sta l t a method to automatically pick the first arrival of the gpr signal this method was first proposed by stevenson 1976 for picking the microseismic events arrivals the short term average sta over long term average lta at sample point i is obtained through 9 sta i 1 n s j i n l n s 2 i n l n s 2 c f j 10 lta i 1 n l j i n l c f j 11 sta l t a i sta i lta i λ where n s and n l are the number of samples in time windows to calculate the sta and lta respectively there are many kinds of time windows and the time windows we used in this paper is shown in fig 2 the sta window is placed in the middle of the lta window n s 40 n l 200 the parameter λ is the trigger threshold if the value of sta l t a is greater than λ then the point i is considered to be the arrival time cf is the characteristic function and there are four commonly used cfs 12 cf 1 x i 13 cf 2 x i 2 14 cf 3 x i x i 1 15 cf 4 x i 2 x i 1 x i 1 as shown in fig 3 b e these cfs are easy to be affected by noise and the time windows and threshold value λ need to be changed for different signals these shortages make the sta l t a method unstable in practical work in this study we adopt an improved sta l t a method proposed by liu et al 2017 the new method introduced a weighting factor k and adjusted the characteristic function as follows 16 k i 1 len x i i 1 len x i 17 cf 5 x i 1 2 k x i 1 x i 2 where len is the length of the signal to be measured x i is the signal amplitude at sample i and x i is the derivative we first choose a single track signal of gpr data as a reference to determine the time windows of sta and lta and since we use the global maximum value to find the first arrival time it is no need to set threshold λ as shown in fig 3 f the improved method still works well in the presence of noise 2 3 data assimilation method the es mda method is applied to assimilate water content measured by gpr into hydrus 1d modeling with this method the measurement data can be assimilated multiple times to achieve a better result in this paper we focus on parameter estimation and the parameter matrix at the i th step can be described as follows 18 ψ i m 11 m 21 m 12 m 22 m 1 n m 2 n m m 1 m m 2 m mn i where the subscript m is the number of unknown parameters and n is the number of ensemble size in history matching applications the forward model can be defined as the following form 19 d f m where d is a vector containing n d predicted water content f is the forward operator such as hydrus 1d in this study m is a vector containing n m model parameters is the model error the parameter estimation problem is to estimate the parameters that best reflect the gpr measurement d obs and the perturbed gpr measurement d uc is 20 d uc d obs α i c d 1 2 z d where α i is the inflation coefficient of the i th iteration c d is the measurement error covariance and z d n 0 i n d the es mda algorithm can be implemented by the following steps 1 choose the number of iterations n a and the factor α i for each iteration i 1 n a 1 α i 1 2 generate the initial n e parameter ensembles 3 for each ensemble run the forward model from time zero 4 perturb the measurement vector using eq 20 5 update the ensembles as follows 21 m j i 1 m j i c md i c dd i α i c d 1 d uc j i d j i j 1 n e where c md i is the cross covariance between the model parameters and the predicted data and c dd i is the auto covariance of the predicted data 22 c md i 1 n e 1 j 1 n e m j i m i d j i d i t 23 c dd i 1 n e 1 j 1 n e d j i d i d j i d i t 6 repeat 3 to 5 until i n a fig 5 shows the process of the proposed approach in this paper 3 synthetic experiments synthetic experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach the soil hydraulic parameters are obtained from rosetta 3 zhang and schaap 2017 an improved artificial neural network ann analysis method which allows us to estimate the van genuchten water retention parameters van genuchten 1980 with the component of soil texture e g the proportion of sand silt and clay the soil texture in this project is selected as loamy sand since it is a common soil in gpr detection environment the components percent of sand and clay are given as the average values in carsel and parrish 1988 and the percentage of silt is 100 minus the sum of the proportion of sand and clay the prior value ranges and the reference values of the soil components and soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 1 the initial ensembles of the soil hydraulic parameters are generated from uniform distributions using the rand function in matlab the hydrus 1d model is shown in fig 6 the depth of the model is 200 cm and it is divided into 40 grid cells the initial pressure head is 200 0 cm from top to bottom the upper boundary condition is set to atmospheric bc with surface layer we consider a period of 30 days and the rainfall data is shown in fig 7 the data is obtained from a meteorological observatory the lower boundary condition is set to free drainage the gpr observations are located at 5 depths 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm and 50 cm the parameters ϕ and ε s in eqs 4 and 8 are set to 40 and 4 8 knight and endres 1990 respectively based on these settings the following experiments are conducted 1 ensemble size test four kinds of ensemble size 50 100 200 500 are tested by running the two parameter estimation α a n d k s the two most variable parameters the number of iterations n a is 4 in this case and α i n a the results are expressed as the average of 10 runs to reduce the error 2 comparison of iteration times different number of iterations 2 4 8 10 15 20 are used to compare the performance of two parameter estimation α a n d k s the ensemble size is 50 in this case and for each type of iteration time we set α i n a the results are shown as the average of 10 runs the root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate the accuracy of results and the indicator spread is used to quantify the dispersion of parameter estimation the indicator rs is also used here and smaller rs corresponds to better performance zheng et al 2019 the three indicators are calculated using following equations 24 rmse 1 n m j 1 n m m j m ref 2 25 spread 1 n m j 1 n m v a r m j 26 rs rmse 2 spread 2 where n m is the number of estimated parameters m j is the mean of estimated parameters m ref is the reference parameters and var m j is the variance of estimation results the indicator dm is used to represent the data mismatch 27 dm 1 n i 1 n d i d ref 2 where d i is the assimilation soil water content d ref is the reference soil water content and n equals ensemble size multiplied by simulation periods 3 multiparameter estimation different numbers of unknown parameters are tested in this case for a single parameter problem we estimate k s for two parameter problem we estimate k s and α for three parameter problem we test α n and k s then five parameters θ r θ s α n k s are updated at the same time the iteration time n a is 8 α i n a and the ensemble size is 50 we also run each kind of experiment 10 times to reduce the error 4 results and discussion 4 1 ensemble size the realization number is a crucial factor in the ensemble based method sometimes we can get a better result by increasing the ensemble size but there is no standard way to choose the ensemble size a larger ensemble size will result in more computational cost so we need to balance the accuracy and the efficiency the mean and standard deviation of α a n d k s are plotted in fig 8 a and b as shown in fig 8 a the estimated standard deviation of α of the 50 realizations is a little smaller than the other three ensembles while the mean values of the other three ensembles are closer to the reference value but the improvements are not obvious in fig 8 b the results of the k s estimation of the four kinds of ensemble size are almost the same only some tiny differences in the mean values therefore 50 realizations are enough for parameter estimation in this project 4 2 iteration times the es mda performs multiple small corrections on ensemble members rather than a single gauss newton update emerick and reynolds 2013a b increasing the number of iterations n a is helpful to reduce the error to get a better result fig 9 shows the performance of different iteration times in fig 9 a the three lines of rmse spread and rs are in a downward trend especially from 2 times to 8 times the values decrease dramatically as the iteration time increases to 10 15 and 20 the results only improved a little as shown in fig 9 b the dm of 2 times and 4 times are larger than the others especially near the surface and bottom of the soil profile while the dm of 8 times 10 times and 15 times are almost the same therefore 8 iterations are sufficient enough to gain a better updating result in this project 4 3 multiparameter problem in order to test the sensitivity of the parameter variabilities on the proposed method we conducted the experiment of which the different number of parameters are estimated as shown in fig 10 a the rmse of single parameter and two parameter decrease as the assimilation step increases and the rmse of three parameter shows the same trend but slightly larger however the rmse of the five parameter estimation shows an upward trend the values of spread of different parameter tests are all reduced which means the data dispersion decreases as the assimilation step increases the figure of rs shows the same trend as rmse the results of five parameter estimation become even worse when the assimilation step increases we think the bad performance of five parameter estimation is that the values of the five parameters will be adjusted simultaneously after each assimilation step but during the procedure the inner connection of the five parameters is not considered thus the adjustment results may exceed the reasonable range to solve the multiparameter problem and get a better estimation other information is needed to constrain the process as we can see from the results the proposed method works well when estimating a small number of parameters e g one two and three but when five parameters are updated at the same time the errors are much larger therefore in order to get a better estimation for the 5 parameters instead of estimating them at the same time we update the soil component first then use rosetta 3 to calculate the 5 parameters fig 10 a c show the rmse spread and rs of updating soil component all of them are much smaller than updating three or five parameters fig 10 d shows the errors of soil moisture prediction the dm by updating soil component the purple line is between the dm by updating two parameters and three parameters the dm of five parameter is the largest especially near the bottom of the soil profile the results illustrate that a better result can be achieved by using the relationship between soil component and hydraulic parameters in addition to the parameter estimation the prediction of water content can also be used as the validation for the new method the soil component estimation and water content prediction results of updating the soil component are shown in fig 11 as we can see from fig 11 a the standard deviations of sand and clay decrease as the assimilation progresses after 8 times assimilation the average percentages of sand and clay are 81 25 and 6 92 respectively which are very close to the reference values fig 11 b d correspond to the prediction results of water content at 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm the average of predicted soil water content is almost the same as the reference value and is better than the gpr measurements which indicates the update is effective besides the variation trend of water content at 10 cm is consistent with the rainfall data to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of parameter estimation of updating the soil components we test two other soil textures loam and sand which are also common in the gpr detection environment the relevant parameters and their values are shown in table 2 and table 3 as shown in fig 12 a and fig 14 a the values of rmse of updating 5 parameters simultaneously show an upward trend although the values of spread decrease especially the results of sand the errors are larger in contrast the results of updating the soil components are much better after assimilating the observation data the rmse and spread both converge to quite small values figs 12 b and 14 b are the data mismatches as expected the dm of updating soil components is much smaller than updating five parameters fig 13 a and fig 15 a correspond to the average percentages of sand and clay after 8 times assimilation the average sand content of loam is 40 39 and the average clay content is 19 59 which is not much different from the reference value the average sand content of sand is 92 71 after assimilation and the average clay content is 2 89 which is almost the same as the reference value during the 30 days the average of the predicted water content is closer to the reference value than the gpr measurement as shown in fig 13 b d and fig 15 b d same as the loamy sand the variation trend of water content is consistent with that of rainfall at 10 cm and the changes in water content gradually decrease as the depth increases 5 conclusion in this paper a new approach for estimating soil hydraulic parameters by combining the gpr technique with es mda is proposed several synthetic experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed approach and evaluate the sensitive factors through the ensemble size test 50 realizations are proved to be enough for this study in the experiment of assimilation times the errors of parameter estimation and moisture prediction decrease as the assimilation time increases but the results only improved a little when the time is greater than 8 considering the computational cost 8 times of iteration is efficient enough in this study the parameter estimation results of the proposed method are very close to the reference values when estimating one or two parameters and the results are still good even three parameters are updated at the same time but when five parameters are updated simultaneously the error is much larger therefore instead of updating five parameters together we update the soil component first and then we use rosetta 3 to get the soil hydraulic parameters the relationship between soil component and hydraulic parameters can effectively limit parameter adjustment and reduce errors this method by updating soil component using es mda and gpr technique is more practical to apply since measuring soil component is much easier than measuring hydraulic parameters three kinds of soil textures are tested in the synthetic study to verify the effectiveness of the new approach the results show that the method of updating soil component can estimate parameters accurately and better characterize the distribution of soil water content by assimilating water content data via es mda and it provides a new way to predict the soil water content declaration of competing interest the

5728,ground penetrating radar gpr has been widely used for shallow subsurface exploration in recent decades the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda was proposed and has been proved as one of the most efficient algorithms for data assimilation in variational fields in this paper es mda is first applied as the assimilation scheme to inversely model the soil hydraulic

ensemble smoother soil water content 1 introduction the unsaturated zone is an important part of atmospheric precipitation and surface water conversion to groundwater and the soil water content is a crucial property in evaluating the unsaturated zone estimation of soil hydraulic parameters and description of water content distribution are important for hydrogeology agriculture and many other fields the geophysical method is an efficient way for vadose zone investigation e g the study of revil et al 2017 showed that electrical potential data is correlated to the depth of the vadose zone and water table ground penetrating radar gpr is a high resolution geophysical technique and the relationship between permittivity and hydraulic parameters topp et al 1980 knoll et al 1995 makes it possible to estimate water content with gpr the ground wave method is one of the most commonly used gpr techniques to measure soil water content hubbard et al 2002 used ground wave data to estimate the soil water content at a vineyard and the results showed that this approach can provide a high resolution profile for shallow soil moisture wijewardana and galagedara 2010 applied the ground wave method to estimate the spatial and temporal variability of soil water content in raised bed agricultural beds the gpr measurements correlated well with gravimetrically measured values which indicated the accuracy of this method steelman and endres 2011 compared several commonly used empirical relationships between dielectric and hydraulic parameters with ground wave method the results show that different equations have various fitting degrees to different soil textures and should be considered in practice qin et al 2013 applied the ground wave method to monitor the near surface water content distribution in the arid zone the result shows that gpr is suitable for large scale ground detection based on the ground wave method researchers have done some improvements pettinelli et al 2007

matteo et al 2012 and pettinelli et al 2014 tested the accuracy of using average envelope amplitude aea to estimate soil moisture and revealed the best time range of gpr signals for calculations and this method has been widely used since then although ground wave measurement is fast and easy to apply it only performs well in a shallow depth in order to obtain deeper soil water content other detection techniques need to be considered binley et al 2001 and alumbaugh et al 2002 applied the cross borehole method to estimate soil water content in the unsaturated zone the high resolution and accurate results indicated the possibility of using this technique in the heterogeneous environment galagedara et al 2002 2003 measured the spatial and temporal variability of soil water content with the cross borehole method compared with tdr measurements the results illustrated that water tends to flow to high moisture zones rucker and ferré 2003 2004 2005 did a lot of work using borehole gpr to

over long term average lta at sample point i is obtained through 9 sta i 1 n s j i n l n s 2 i n l n s 2 c f j 10 lta i 1 n l j i n l c f j 11 sta l t a i sta i lta i λ where n s and n l are the number of samples in time windows to calculate the sta and lta respectively there are many kinds of time windows and the time windows we used in this paper is shown in fig 2 the sta window is placed in the middle of the lta window n s 40 n l 200 the parameter λ is the trigger threshold if the value of sta l t a is greater than λ then the point i is considered to be the arrival time cf is the characteristic function and there are four commonly used cfs 12 cf 1 x i 13 cf 2 x i 2 14 cf 3 x i x i 1 15 cf 4 x i 2 x i 1 x i 1 as shown in fig 3 b e these cfs are easy to be affected by noise and the time windows and threshold value λ need to be changed for different signals these shortages make the sta l t a method unstable in practical work in this study we adopt an improved sta l t a method proposed by liu et al 2017 the new method introduced a weighting factor k and adjusted the characteristic function as follows 16 k i 1 len x i i 1 len x i 17 cf 5 x i 1 2 k x i 1 x i 2 where len is the length of the signal to be measured x i is the signal amplitude at sample i and x i is the derivative we first choose a single track signal of gpr data as a reference to determine the time windows of sta and lta and since we use the global maximum value to find the first arrival time it is no need to set threshold λ as shown in fig 3 f the improved method still works well in the presence of noise 2 3 data assimilation method the es mda method is applied to assimilate water content measured by gpr into hydrus 1d modeling with this method the measurement data can be assimilated multiple times to achieve a better result in this paper we focus on parameter estimation and the parameter matrix at the i th step can be described as follows 18 ψ i m 11 m 21 m 12 m 22 m 1 n m 2 n m m 1 m m 2 m mn i where the subscript m is the number of unknown parameters and n is the number of ensemble size in history matching applications the forward model can be defined as the following form 19 d f m where d is a vector containing n d predicted water content f is the forward operator such as hydrus 1d in this study m is a vector containing n m model parameters is the model error the parameter estimation problem is to estimate the parameters that best reflect the gpr measurement d obs and the perturbed gpr measurement d uc is 20 d uc d obs α i c d 1 2 z d where α i is the inflation coefficient of the i th iteration c d is the measurement error covariance and z d n 0 i n d the es mda algorithm can be implemented by the following steps 1 choose the number of iterations n a and the factor α i for each iteration i 1 n a 1 α i 1 2 generate the initial n e parameter ensembles 3 for each ensemble run the forward model from time zero 4 perturb the measurement vector using eq 20 5 update the ensembles as follows 21 m j i 1 m j i c md i c dd i α i c d 1 d uc j i d j i j 1 n e where c md i is the cross covariance between the model parameters and the predicted data and c dd i is the auto covariance of the predicted data 22 c md i 1 n e 1 j 1 n e m j i m i d j i d i t 23 c dd i 1 n e 1 j 1 n e d j i d i d j i d i t 6 repeat 3 to 5 until i n a fig 5 shows the process of the proposed approach in this paper 3 synthetic experiments synthetic experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach the soil hydraulic parameters are obtained from rosetta 3 zhang and schaap 2017 an improved artificial neural network ann analysis method which allows us to estimate the van genuchten water retention parameters van genuchten 1980 with the component of soil texture e g the proportion of sand silt and clay the soil texture in this project is selected as loamy sand since it is a common soil in gpr detection environment the components percent of sand and clay are given as the average values in carsel and parrish 1988 and the percentage of silt is 100 minus the sum of the proportion of sand and clay the prior value ranges and the reference values of the soil components and soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 1 the initial ensembles of the soil hydraulic parameters are generated from uniform distributions using the rand function in matlab the hydrus 1d model is shown in fig 6 the depth of the model is 200 cm and it is divided into 40 grid cells the initial pressure head is 200 0 cm from top to bottom the upper boundary condition is set to atmospheric bc with surface layer we consider a period of 30 days and the rainfall data is shown in fig 7 the data is obtained from a meteorological observatory the lower boundary condition is set to free drainage the gpr observations are located at 5 depths 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm and 50 cm the parameters ϕ and ε s in eqs 4 and 8 are set to 40 and 4 8 knight and endres 1990 respectively based on these settings the following experiments are conducted 1 ensemble size test four kinds of ensemble size 50 100 200 500 are tested by running the two parameter estimation α a n d k s the two most variable parameters the number of iterations n a is 4 in this case and α i n a the results are expressed as the average of 10 runs to reduce the error 2 comparison of iteration times different number of iterations 2 4 8 10 15 20 are used to compare the performance of two parameter estimation α a n d k s the ensemble size is 50 in this case and for each type of iteration time we set α i n a the results are shown as the average of 10 runs the root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate the accuracy of results and the indicator spread is used to quantify the dispersion of parameter estimation the indicator rs is also used here and smaller rs corresponds to better performance zheng et al 2019 the three indicators are calculated using following equations 24 rmse 1 n m j 1 n m m j m ref 2 25 spread 1 n m j 1 n m v a r m j 26 rs rmse 2 spread 2 where n m is the number of estimated parameters m j is the mean of estimated parameters m ref is the reference parameters and var m j is the variance of estimation results the indicator dm is used to represent the data mismatch 27 dm 1 n i 1 n d i d ref 2 where d i is the assimilation soil water content d ref is the reference soil water content and n equals ensemble size multiplied by simulation periods 3 multiparameter estimation different numbers of unknown parameters are tested in this case for a single parameter problem we estimate k s for two parameter problem we estimate k s and α for three parameter problem we test α n and k s then five parameters θ r θ s α n k s are updated at the same time the iteration time n a is 8 α i n a and the ensemble size is 50 we also run each kind of experiment 10 times to reduce the error 4 results and discussion 4 1 ensemble size the realization number is a crucial factor in the ensemble based method sometimes we can get a better result by increasing the ensemble size but there is no standard way to choose the ensemble size a larger ensemble size will result in more computational cost so we need to balance the accuracy and the efficiency the mean and standard deviation of α a n d k s are plotted in fig 8 a and b as shown in fig 8 a the estimated standard deviation of α of the 50 realizations is a little smaller than the other three ensembles while the mean values of the other three ensembles are closer to the reference value but the improvements are not obvious in fig 8 b the results of the k s estimation of the four kinds of ensemble size are almost the same only some tiny differences in the mean values therefore 50 realizations are enough for parameter estimation in this project 4 2 iteration times the es mda performs multiple small corrections on ensemble members rather than a single gauss newton update emerick and reynolds 2013a b increasing the number of iterations n a is helpful to reduce the error to get a better result fig 9 shows the performance of different iteration times in fig 9 a the three lines of rmse spread and rs are in a downward trend especially from 2 times to 8 times the values decrease dramatically as the iteration time increases to 10 15 and 20 the results only improved a little as shown in fig 9 b the dm of 2 times and 4 times are larger than the others especially near the surface and bottom of the soil profile while the dm of 8 times 10 times and 15 times are almost the same therefore 8 iterations are sufficient enough to gain a better updating result in this project 4 3 multiparameter problem in order to test the sensitivity of the parameter variabilities on the proposed method we conducted the experiment of which the different number of parameters are estimated as shown in fig 10 a the rmse of single parameter and two parameter decrease as the assimilation step increases and the rmse of three parameter shows the same trend but slightly larger however the rmse of the five parameter estimation shows an upward trend the values of spread of different parameter tests are all reduced which means the data dispersion decreases as the assimilation step increases the figure of rs shows the same trend as rmse the results of five parameter estimation become even worse when the assimilation step increases we think the bad performance of five parameter estimation is that the values of the five parameters will be adjusted simultaneously after each assimilation step but during the procedure the inner connection of the five parameters is not considered thus the adjustment results may exceed the reasonable range to solve the multiparameter problem and get a better estimation other information is needed to constrain the process as we can see from the results the proposed method works well when estimating a small number of parameters e g one two and three but when five parameters are updated at the same time the errors are much larger therefore in order to get a better estimation for the 5 parameters instead of estimating them at the same time we update the soil component first then use rosetta 3 to calculate the 5 parameters fig 10 a c show the rmse spread and rs of updating soil component all of them are much smaller than updating three or five parameters fig 10 d shows the errors of soil moisture prediction the dm by updating soil component the purple line is between the dm by updating two parameters and three parameters the dm of five parameter is the largest especially near the bottom of the soil profile the results illustrate that a better result can be achieved by using the relationship between soil component and hydraulic parameters in addition to the parameter estimation the prediction of water content can also be used as the validation for the new method the soil component estimation and water content prediction results of updating the soil component are shown in fig 11 as we can see from fig 11 a the standard deviations of sand and clay decrease as the assimilation progresses after 8 times assimilation the average percentages of sand and clay are 81 25 and 6 92 respectively which are very close to the reference values fig 11 b d correspond to the prediction results of water content at 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm the average of predicted soil water content is almost the same as the reference value and is better than the gpr measurements which indicates the update is effective besides the variation trend of water content at 10 cm is consistent with the rainfall data to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of parameter estimation of updating the soil components we test two other soil textures loam and sand which are also common in the gpr detection environment the relevant parameters and their values are shown in table 2 and table 3 as shown in fig 12 a and fig 14 a the values of rmse of updating 5 parameters simultaneously show an upward trend although the values of spread decrease especially the results of sand the errors are larger in contrast the results of updating the soil components are much better after assimilating the observation data the rmse and spread both converge to quite small values figs 12 b and 14 b are the data mismatches as expected the dm of updating soil components is much smaller than updating five parameters fig 13 a and fig 15 a correspond to the average percentages of sand and clay after 8 times assimilation the average sand content of loam is 40 39 and the average clay content is 19 59 which is not much different from the reference value the average sand content of sand is 92 71 after assimilation and the average clay content is 2 89 which is almost the same as the reference value during the 30 days the average of the predicted water content is closer to the reference value than the gpr measurement as shown in fig 13 b d and fig 15 b d same as the loamy sand the variation trend of water content is consistent with that of rainfall at 10 cm and the changes in water content gradually decrease as the depth increases 5 conclusion in this paper a new approach for estimating soil hydraulic parameters by combining the gpr technique with es mda is proposed several synthetic experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed approach and evaluate the sensitive factors through the ensemble size test 50 realizations are proved to be enough for this study in the experiment of assimilation times the errors of parameter estimation and moisture prediction decrease as the assimilation time increases but the results only improved a little when the time is greater than 8 considering the computational cost 8 times of iteration is efficient enough in this study the parameter estimation results of the proposed method are very close to the reference values when estimating one or two parameters and the results are still good even three parameters are updated at the same time but when five parameters are updated simultaneously the error is much larger therefore instead of updating five parameters together we update the soil component first and then we use rosetta 3 to get the soil hydraulic parameters the relationship between soil component and hydraulic parameters can effectively limit parameter adjustment and reduce errors this method by updating soil component using es mda and gpr technique is more practical to apply since measuring soil component is much easier than measuring hydraulic parameters three kinds of soil textures are tested in the synthetic study to verify the effectiveness of the new approach the results show that the method of updating soil component can estimate parameters accurately and better characterize the distribution of soil water content by assimilating water content data via es mda and it provides a new way to predict the soil water content declaration of competing interest the

5729,although the hydrological services of individual wetlands have been much acknowledged their cumulative effect at the watershed scale has not been assessed as extensively in this study a distributed hydrological modeling platform the physitel hydrotel was used to i investigate watershed hydrological processes with and without abundant wetlands and ii quantify the effect of wetlands on streamflow specifically baseflow and quickflow in the upper nenjiang river basin northeast china the modeling results showed that wetlands can strongly affect quickflow and baseflow consequently modifying the watershed hydrograph the study demonstrated the flow regulation services of wetlands at various temporal i e daily monthly seasonal and annual and spatial scales i e sub watersheds of different sizes specifically wetland presence seemed to have stronger influence on baseflow and quickflow in the summer season than in the winter the cumulative effect of wetlands on quickflow and baseflow quantity enhanced with the increasing wetland area anthropogenic activities such as reclamation and settlements could affect the regulation services of wetlands to some extent these findings indicate that wetlands exert significant effects on watershed hydrological processes by modifying the temporal variability of quickflow and baseflow in this region therefore it is important to protect and restore wetlands in the upstream portion of a watershed as a means of sustaining flow regulation and water resources in river basins keywords flow regulation services wetlands quickflow baseflow watershed hydrological processes 1 introduction wetlands provide important ecosystem functions and services including flood mitigation aquatic habitats source water supply recreation and water purification millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 among the services those associated with flood attenuation and baseflow contribution at the watershed scale come to mind kadykalo and findlay 2016 langan et al 2018 these services are important for enhancing and maintaining hydrological resilience to future changes induced by climate and human impacts within a watershed mitsch and gosselink 2007 mclaughlin et al 2014 fossey and rousseau 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 hydrologic models have been used to quantitatively assess flow regulation services of wetlands acreman and holden 2013 hughes et al 2014 golden et al 2014 evenson et al 2015 2016 2018 ahmed 2016 fossey et al 2016 lee et al 2018 perez valdivia et al 2017 for example the soil and water assessment tool swat model with wetland modules and subsequent improvements has been widely used to examine the effect of wetlands on watershed hydrology liu et al 2008 wang et al 2010 evenson et al 2015 2018 golden et al 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 lee et al 2018 yeo et al 2019a b these improvements have contributed to simulation efficiency of hydrological processes and accordingly flow regulation services of wetlands lee et al 2018 however most of the aforementioned studies focused on either isolated wetlands iws or riparian wetlands rws and our knowledge about the cumulative effect of variable wetlands on initial runoff and baseflow contribution numerous studies have shown that wetlands can generally reduce floods increase low flows and decrease runoff however estimates of these flow regulations provided by wetlands can bear large uncertainties acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo et al 2016 for instance fossey and rousseau 2016 assessed current and future hydroclimate projections and postulated that conservation of wetland areas could potentially increase 2 year 20 year and 100 year peak flows in another study on future climate change effects in a midwestern us watershed walter and others 2016 found that wetlands could potentially be a robust nature based solution for peak flow reduction with consistent reductions from the past to future time periods and across all climate projections in their literature review bullock and acreman 2003 showed that wetlands have been found to both reduce and increase floods in a more recent literature review acreman and holden 2013 reported that wetlands normally reduce peak flows but can also contribute to a higher peak flow under certain conditions these diverging findings show a need for more research on the hydrological services of wetlands at the watershed scale quickflow is defined to occur over a short period of time following major precipitation events while baseflow is defined as the quantity of flow occurring for some time after the end of the event hornberger et al 1998 evenson et al 2015 ficklin et al 2016 baseflow and quickflow and their mixing have an effect on water quantity and quality zhang and schilling 2005 gomez velez et al 2015 aquatic ecosystem structure and function blaen et al 2018 flood and drought padilla et al 1994 water resources management and regulation hornbeck et al 1993 perrine et al 2013 quickflow depends on a number of factors including precipitation intensity soil physical and hydraulic properties and watershed and drainage network characteristics therefore quickflow in a watershed can vary largely being responsible for flood magnitude stream baseflow reflects watershed storage and is therefore often responsible for low flow variability padilla et al 1994 ficklin et al 2016 buttle 2018 because of these assessment of the wetland effect on baseflow and quickflow can improve our understanding of the streamflow regulation services of wetlands however there has been very little research into the quantitative effect of wetlands on watershed baseflow and quickflow in this study a distributed hydrological modelling platform with specific riparian wetland rw and isolated wetland iw modules physitel hydrotel fortin et al 2001 rousseau et al 2011 fossey et al 2016 was applied to a river basin in northeast china the primary goal of the study was to quantify the effect of wetlands on stream quickflow and baseflow the study focused on three questions i how do wetlands affect monthly seasonal winter and summer and annual quickflow and baseflow ii can wetlands both increase and decrease quickflow and baseflow simultaneously and iii if so how and to what extent wetlands can modulate qucikflow and baseflow temporally and spatially 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data availability this modeling study was conducted in the upper nenjiang river basin unrb in northeast china fig 1 a the total drainage area of the unrb is 61 249 km2 serving as the most important source water area for agricultural irrigation and natural wetlands in the region these wetlands support diverse habitats and many endangered wildlife species wu et al 2018 the unrb consists of a headwater sub watershed shihuiyao drainage area and four sub watersheds duobukuli river gan river menlu river and keluo river fig 1 the region has a cold temperate climate with long and chilly winters with widespread snow cover soils are seasonaly frozen and permafrost the topography changes frequently from rolling hills to deep river valleys with an average gradient of 3 35 long term average monthly temperature in this region ranges from 21 5 c in january to 20 4 c in july with an annual mean of 1 5 c annual precipitation ranges from 390 mm to 704 mm precipitation mainly occurs during the summer season april september which accounts for about 89 of the annual total precipitation major land cover types include forest wetlands and grassland accounting for 51 6 18 3 and 12 2 of the unrb respectively fig 1b the upper nenjiang river basin has abundant wetland areas with several nationally important wetland preservers including the nanwen wetland ramsar site menlu national nature reserve and keluo nature reserve these wetlands are more vulnerable than other ecosystems to future climate because of their higher latitude and significant climate change found in the region feng et al 2011 within the unrb riparian wetlands rws and isolated wetlands iws and their contributing area cover 2 5 and 15 8 13 8 and 40 3 of the total drainage area fig 1c table 1 the digital elevation model land use land cover lulc types hydrographic network and soil maps were used to delineate spatial modeling units e g sub watersheds and relatively homogeneous hydrological units and to

platform http www resdc cn daily streamflow records from 2011 to 2016 were collected from the following six river hydrological stations shihuiyao headwater watershed guli duobukuli river basin kumotun mainstream huolongmn menlu river basin kehou keluo river basin and liujiatun gan river basin daily meteorological data including precipitation and air temperature for the period 1990 2017 were obtained from 49 weather stations in the region administered by the nenjiang nierji hydraulic and hydropower ltd company http www cnnej cn and national meteorological information centre of china http data cma cn 2 2 model description calibration and assessment the physitel hydrotel distributed hydrological modelling platform was used in this study to assess the effects of wetlands on qucikflow and baseflow the modelling platform coupled with isolated iw and riparian rw wetland modules using the hydrologically equivalent wetland hew concept developed by liu et al 2008 and wang et al 2008 allows for the explicit assessment of the effect of wetlands on watershed hydrology a complete description of the modelling approach can be found in fossey et al 2015 a brief description is provided in the following paragraph physitel is a specialized gis framework while hydrotel is a continuous distributed hydrologic model turcotte et al 2001 2003 2007 fortin et al 2001 rousseau et al 2011 bouda et al 2011 2014 noël et al 2013 fossey et al 2016 ibarra zavaleta et al 2017 foulon and rousseau 2018 physitel is used for delineating watersheds into relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhus and interconnected river segments for each of these units a single value can be assigned for soil type and percentages of each land cover classes rousseau et al 2011 physitel provides altitude slope and flow orientation for each rhhu along with characteristics of each rs slope and default bathymetric characteristics such as full bank water depth and river width as well as contributing drainage area of iws and rws see liu et al 2008 hydrotel is a continuous watershed model which integrates remote sensing gis climatic and other data and runs on intra or daily time steps in flow simulation the model has the following modules to perform modeling computationally meteorological data interpolation snowpack dynamics soil temperature and freezing depth potential evapotranspiration vertical water budget overland water routing and channel routing in addition a wetland module is developed for the model to solve flow attenuation and storage with watersheds the soil temperature and freezing depth module used in this study is based on the model described in rankinen et al 2004 the model calculates soil temperature at various depths at a daily time step with consideration of the influence of snow cover simplifications made by rankinen et al 2004 neglected the influence of changes in soil water content on soil temperature to properly integrate wetlands in the hydrotel modeling three pre processing steps are performed by physitel namely i identification of wetland types iws and rws ii computation of the wetland surface and drainage areas and iii quantification of wetland parameters using the aforementioned wetland map and datasets the distinction between isolated and riparian hew is determined by their connectivity to the natural drainage network fossey et al 2016 isolated wetlands are characterized as a specific subset of wetland systems which have no or limited direct hydrologic connection to the drainage network golden et al 2014 and are mainly governed by water table fluctuations induced by precipitation groundwater and upland conditions winter and labaugh 2003 riparian wetlands defined as the areas periodically inundated by floods from bordering rivers brooks et al 2011 and whose water dynamics are mainly dependent on river and groundwater contributions fossey et al 2016 the parameters of each wetland module are characterized by physitel those of the iw module are related to the following i ratio defining the relationship between the surface of hew when the wetland is at maximum and normal water levels respectively frac ii an adjustable value of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying soil ksat bs iii evaporation from hew defined as a percentage of potential evapotranspiration calculated at the rhhu scale c ev iv a coefficient of production i e contribution to terrestrial flow and v an area volume relationship fossey et al 2016 for rws in addition to the aforementioned parameters frac and ksat bs three specific parameters are determined i an adjustable value of bank saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat bk and two threshold values defining ii maximum dwet max and iii normal dwet nor water levels the information is then exported to hydrotel for this study the unrb was discretized into seven sub watersheds for iws the hydrogeological processes are integrated in the vertical water budget bv3c fortin et al 2001 at the rhhu scale for rws the water balance is partially integrated in the vertical water budget bv3c of an rhhu and directly connected to the associated river segment via the kinematic wave equation these representations provide a modelling approach capable of simulating water balance at the wetland scale while accounting for their interaction with their surroundings contributing drainage area and hydrologic connectivity in this study the hydrotel model coupled with the two wetland modules iws and rws was calibrated against observed streamflow at a daily time step over 6 years 1 year warm up 2010 10 01 2011 09 30 5 year calibration 2011 10 01 2016 09 30 periods arsenault et al 2018 showed that the calibration on the full dataset can be viewed as the optimal calibration strategy as it generates the most robust parameter sets and provides the best model accuracy using the methodology introduced by tolson and shoemaker 2007 the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm was used for calibration with respect to the discharge records of the seven sub watersheds fig 1 dds has been recognized as an efficient tool for calibration of complex and large parameter space hydrological models e g foulon and rousseau 2018 the dds algorithm automatically scales the search space to decrease the number of model evaluations required to reach the optimal region of best quality fitness function tolson and shoemaker 2007 the perturbation factor of single dds parameter was set to the default value 0 2 in the optimization process see tolson and shoemaker 2007 automatic calibration was performed based on the maximization of the zhang performance metric zhang et al 2008 zhang represents a meta objective function which considers a set of information including equal weights of combination of metrics regarding high flows low flows timing and bias the function has been found to be capable of improving process representation and parameter inference fowler et al 2018 zhang also corrects the underestimation of variability only using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and provides more balance between the expected qualities of a model it is calculated as zhang 1 0 25 f 1 f 2 f 3 f

shift between the simulated and observed streamflow f4 was selected to ensure mass balance over the period of the calibration zhang value can vary within the range 1 an efficiency value of 1 corresponds to a perfect fit between the simulated and the observed series in this study the 12 most sensitive parameters of the computational modules of hydrotel were calibrated for complete details please refer to turcotte et al 2003 and foulon and rousseau 2018 2 3 quantitative assessment of the effects of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow the paired simulation framework based on model runs with wetlands ww and without wetlands wow has been used by evenson et al 2015 fossey et al 2016 fossey and rousseau 2016 ahmed 2016 and lee et al 2018 for the quantitative assessment of the hydrological effects of wetlands in this study the simulations with and without wetlands are referred to as baseline scenario current wetlands and reference simulation scenario 100 wetland removal for six sub watersheds and the entire watershed respectively the without wetland scenarios are dealt in this study as follows when the wetland modules are turned off wetland area are not removed but they are treated as the land cover of saturated soils and thus their explicit storage properties are not accounted for in the modeling this is a basic assumption in the present analysis this framework represents the common way of tackling the issue of how to assess the hydrological functions of wetlands using hydrological models such as swat liu et al 2008 wang et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 mike 11 ahmed 2016 and hydrotel fossey et al 2016 fossey and rousseau 2016 simulations of streamflow for the seven sub watersheds were run from 2000 to 2016 using calibrated hydrotel with one year spin up period i e 2000 hydrorecession a matlab toolbox for streamflow recession analysis was used to separate total daily streamflow into baseflow and quickflow arciniega esparza et al 2017 this toolbox applies the inverse relationship of the wittenberg s algorithm wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 to separate the observed hydrograph into baseflow and quickflow the wetland specific impact wsi metric was adopted to determine the hydrological impact of wetlands according to fossey et al 2016 this index provides a mean of normalizing the hydrological impact increase or decrease in stream metrics with respect to wetland area as outlined in the following equation 6 ws i bforqf s ww s wow a where wsibf or qf mm is the index of wetland impact expressed as streamflow parameter baseflow and quickflow reduction or increase per unit area of a considered wetland sww m3 s and swow m3 s are streamflow parameters calculated from simulated streamflow during ww and wow scenarios respectively a in km2 is the wetland area in a specific watershed first we calculated daily wsi bf or qf using daily simulated streamflow with and without wetland modules scenarios for the six sub watersheds and the entire watershed then we obtained monthly seasonal and annual averaged wsibf or qf from daily wsi bf or qf to further investigate the combined effect of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow we extracted the corresponding positive and negative values of daily wsis to quantify the actual increase and decrease by wetlands then we separately calculated average negative and positive daily wsi values for all the days of the years 2001 to 2016 the analysis of variance nova was used with a significance level of 5 to determine whether there were significant differences in the indicators between ww and wow scenarios over different temporal scales 3 results 3 1 model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 criterion correlation coefficient cc gupta et al 2009 the percentage bias pbias yapo et al 1996 and kge kling et al 2012 were used to assess model performance as shown in fig 2 the nse criterion values were over 0 60 in seven watersheds for the period of calibration the pbias values of all calibration results were 10 especially near zero in majority watersheds the ccs for the best simulation results were 0 75 moreover both kge and zhang achieved a satisfactory value 0 70 during the calibration period according to the hydrologic model performance rating described by moriasi et al 2007 gupta et al 2009 and kling et al 2012 our model calibration was successful these calibration results demonstrated that streamflows in the study area can be well simulated by the the physitel hydrotel model under different land use and climate conditions 3 2 the overall impact of wetlands the partitioning of mean annual precipitation p mm into actual evapotranspiration aet mm and water yield wy mm under the two types of scenarios with without wetlands were calculated using model outputs table 2 the seven sub watersheds received different p and generated uneven aet and wy during the 6 year study period the modeling results showed that the watersheds would have lower aet if all wetlands were removed conversely wetlands decreased wy by 14 03 3 65 3 79 8 84 6 59 and 6 90 in shihuiyao duobukuli menlu kumotun keluo gan and nenjiang respectively therefore wetlands in the watersheds contributed to a reduced variability in annual water fluxes but the different intensity of wy responses 3 3 effect of wetlands on baseflow to evaluate the effect of wetlands on baseflow the monthly fig 3 seasonal and annual fig 4 wetland specific impacts wsi were calculated for each of the seven watersheds as shown in fig 3 wetlands generally induced monthly baseflow support i e positive values of wsis at the seven outlets except for the gan watershed other six sub watersheds showed significant support on baseflow from april to september p 0 05 and a slight effect on baseflow during the other 5 months p 0 05 for the shihuoyao duobukuli kumotun and nenjiang sub watersheds wsi gradually rose from january to august or september and steadily fell afterward for the keluo and gan sub watersheds wetlands greatly supported baseflow during two separated periods namely in april menlu or may keluo and gan and from june to september menlu and keluo or to october gan p 0 05 however the variability of monthly and monthly averaged wsi varied across the seven watersheds for shihuoyao duobukuli menlu kumotun keluo and nenjiang wetlands had relative low variability in wsi values while the majority of them were positive which indicated obvious and steady baseflow support of wetlands conversely for gan wsi values indicated a strong variation in baseflow support and baseflow reduction negative value of wsi by wetlands specifically wetlands in gan mainly induced baseflow reduction in april 0 002 mm and june 0 002 mm and slight baseflow support in may 0 003 mm while exhibiting significant baseflow support from july to october 0 032 mm 0 032 mm 0 034 mm and 0 018 mm respectively p 0 05 in terms of the impact of wetlands on average winter fig 4a and summer baseflows fig 4b at the seven outlets wetlands seemed to have induced more baseflow support during summer months than during the winter months apparently wetlands exhibited much greater baseflow support in gan river basin than at the other six outlets during both summer and winter while for the other six outlets showed significant baseflow support during summer and weak baseflow support during winter at the annual scale wetland mainly induced baseflow support from 2001 to 2016 fig 4c similar to the monthly variability of wsis annual wsis varied remarkably in the gan sub watershed followed by the shihuiyao sub watershed the average values of wsis in these two sub watersheds were larger than those of the other five sub watersheds ranging from 0 000 to 0 011 mm and from 0 001 to 0 016 mm respectively moreover 8 out of 12 years of all seven outlets had negative wsi values indicating a very small reduction in annual baseflow caused by wetlands therefore the above results implied that wetlands generally exerted a considerable support service on monthly seasonal and annual baseflows 3 4 effect of wetlands on quickflow wetlands generally induced reduction in monthly baseflows negative values of wsi for all the outlets fig 5 specifically wetlands overall reduced quickflow substantially from april to october p 0 05 while affecting quickflow infinitesimally during other months at the seven outlets however the variation of wsi was spatially different for the duobukuli kumotun keluo gan and nenjiang sub watersheds wsi experienced a single peak curve from january to december while it showed a two peak curve for the shihuiuyao and menlu sub watersheds from monthly wsi and monthly average in fig 5 it is noteworthy that although wetlands in the gan sub watershed had a greater effect on quickflow the value of wsi in the watershed exhibited greater variation than those in the other watersheds moreover the strongest reduction p 0 05 in quickflow coming from wetlands occurred in march in menlu 0 001 mm in june in duobukuli 0 019 mm keluo 0 010 mm and nenjiang 0 014 mm in august in shihuiyao 0 011 mm kumotun 0 009 mm and gan 0 039 mm the regulation services of wetlands on quickflow had spatial and temporal variation due to watershed characteristics such as the physical geography of each watershed based on seasonal wsis wetlands seemed to reduce qucikflow during summer considerably the average value of wsis ranged from 0 017 to 0 006 mm p 0 05 but only marginally during winter from 0 002 to 0 mm fig 6 a and 6b similar to the varying characteristics of annual wsis on baseflow wetlands influenced quickflow most in gan during both summer and winter p 0 05 in addition the wsi of gan varied remarkably and was larger than those of the other six outlets fig 6c the twelve year average wsi value was 0 010 mm and the annual wsis ranged from 0 030 to 0 015 mm indicating that wetlands mainly exhibited reduction in both seasonal and annual quickflows furthermore the impact of wetlands on quickflow was very small because of marginal wsi values for a few years thus as described above wetlands mainly reduced monthly seasonal and annual quickflows 3 5 combined effect of wetlands on daily baseflow and quickflow wetlands in the upper nenjiang river basin mainly reduced monthly seasonal and annual quickflow and but increased monthly seasonal and annual baseflow figs 3 4 5 and 6 however this wetland effect occurred under a certain condition wetlands overall increased more than reduced baseflow which was more apparent from julian days 100 to 300 fig 7 p 0 05 however the intensity of these two opposite effects varied across watersheds wetlands increased baseflow mostly in duobukuli with average daily wsi of 0 0338 mm followed by gan with average value of 0 0187 mm also wetlands decreased baseflow in duobukuli and gan with values of 0 013 mm and 0 012 mm respectively for other five watersheds although wetlands exerted a lesser effect on baseflow compared to gan and duobukuli the increase ascribed to wetlands were even larger than the decrease concretely the average increase reduction were 0 0002 mm 0 0006 mm 0 0010 mm 0 0028 mm 0 0028 mm 0 0091 mm and 0 0003 mm 0 0022 mm for shihuiyao keluo menlu kunmotun and nenjiang respectively the evidence points to the likelihood that the reduction effect increase with the increase effect it should be noted that the increase effect of wetlands occurred several times more than the reduction effect namely 2 60 mm 1 56 mm 3 00 mm 2 80 mm 3 25 mm and 7 33 mm in duobukuli gan shihuiyao keluo menlu kunmotun and nenjiang respectively conversely more reduction than increase in quickflow by wetlands was observed which was clearly depicted in julian days from 70 to 300 across the seven watersheds fig 8 the average reduction increase were 0 0104 mm 0 0079 mm 0 0098 mm 0 0057 mm 0 0097 mm 0 0036 mm 0 0080 mm 0 0035 mm 0 0101 mm 0 0038 mm 0 0182 mm 0 0061 mm and 0 0077 mm 0 0025 mm for shihuiyao duobukuli keluo menlu kunmotun gan and nenjiang respectively wetlands seemed to increase quickflow considerably but decrease quickflow slightly for instance wetlands in shihuiyao increased qucikflow with an average wsi value of 0 1682 mm p 0 05 and decreased quickflow with a much lower average wsi value of 0 1060 mm p 0 05 from the 100th to 170th day moreover unlike the varying characteristics of daily baseflow wsi quickflow wsi had a larger magnitude and variability especially in menlu keluo and gan these results indicated that wetlands affected quickflow more than baseflow on daily monthly seasonal and annual scales 4 discussion 4 1 combined effect of wetlands on quick flow and baseflow previous studies have recognized that wetlands can provide important hydrological services including flood attenuation low flow support and other changes in the hydrological processes ahmed 2016 fossey et al 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 kadykalo et al 2016 in this study we quantitatively assessed the effect of wetlands on daily monthly seasonal and annual baseflows and quickflows we found that i wetlands attenuate but seldom also increase quickflow ii wetlands increase baseflow but seldom also decrease baseflow and iii wetlands regulate quickflow more than they do baseflow on daily monthly seasonal and annual scales these findings improve our understanding about how and to what extent wetlands affect baseflow and quickflow over different temporal scales although wetlands mainly reduce quickflow and increase baseflow they can also increase quickflow and decrease baseflow to some extent the study by langan et al 2018 indicated that wetlands can influence watershed hydrology through long and short term surface water storage which can aid or undermine attenuation of flood waters the contradictory results can be found in fossey and rousseau 2016 and walters and babbar sebens 2016 which concluded that wetlands could potentially increase or decrease or completely decrease peak flows respectively there are several conditions under which the enhancement of floods by wetlands can occur i wetlands may contribute to a higher flood peak because they are fully saturated during wet winter months burt 1994 ii permanently saturated wetlands with little or no storage capacity may generate or augment floods relative to semi saturated or unsaturated wetlands morris and camino 2011 iii the soil of wetlands with plentiful macropore networks could lead to greater flow velocities and eventually enhance river flow peaks even if it is dominated by subsurface flow jones 2010 iv synchronicity between tributary and main channel peaks can occur even when wetland contribute to the attenuation of flood flows acreman and holden 2013 on the other hand bullock and acreman 2003 noted that many studies reported reduction of floods by wetlands some found evidence of wetlands increasing floods while others concluded no impact this is because many basin features can play a role in flow generation including initial storage conditions rainfall drainage area soil type vegetation cover and slope and the influence of these factors may be greater than that of wetlands under circumstance acreman and holden 2013 the null impact of wetlands could be more highlighted in basins with lower coverage of wetlands especially during major catastrophic floods where the entire basin may be saturated thus wetlands could possibly increase the risk of flood aggravate hydrological droughts or have no effect on streamflow under certain conditions this implies that water resources management and regulation should consider more detailed site specific information to make the right decision wetlands in the upper nenjiang river basin strongly affected both annual baseflow and qucikflow in 2013 across the seven studied outlets fig 4c and fig 6c in the summer of 2013 the nenjiang river basin had its largest floods since 1984 known as a once in a century flood wang et al 2015a b as an example fig 9 illustrates the effect of wetlands on flood processes with respect to quickflow baseflow and streamflow differences streamflow with wetlands minus streamflow simulated without wetlands in shihuiyao pristine watershed gan larger variability of wsi kumotun middle unrb and nenjiang the outlet of entire watershed peak flow and streamflow reductions were observed at four outlets during the 2013 flood events this result is consistent with other studies that show reduction in peak flow and streamflow regulated by wetlands jackson 1987 wu et al 2008 yang et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 ahmed 2016 fossey et al 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 however wetlands mainly decrease streamflows negative streamflow delta values during the rising stage and increase streamflow positive streamflow delta value during the recession stage specifically wetlands mainly attenuated streamflows by abundantly decreasing quickflow and slightly increasing baseflow at the first stage while predominantly amplified streamflow by considerably increasing baseflow and marginally decreasing quickflow subsequently fig 9 it should be noted that these attenuation and amplification processes has more variability in gan which substantiates the aforementioned results introduced in fig 3 and fig 5 simultaneously the amount of increased baseflow by wetlands was enormously larger than the attenuation on quickflow during the recession stage this results may be explained by the fact that gan had the largest area ratio of wetlands but the lowest contributing area ratio table 1 the contributing area of wetland represented as the sum of the area of all portions of relatively homogeneous hydrologic response units draining to wetlands evenson et al 2015 2016 plays an important role in determining the dynamic and hysteresis nature of rainfall runoff processes between upland and wetlands lee et al 2018 on the other hand the wetland area can largely affect how much water can be stored ultimately in a watershed acreman and holden 2013 fossey et al 2016 therefore the larger capacity for receiving water and lower efficiency to storage water could lead to a marked change in attenuation and amplification processes 4 2 spatial difference of wetland hydrological regulation services we found that the intensification of baseflow and quickflow by wetlands varied across sub watersheds we calculated area ratio of land cover especially the area and ration of wetland and their contributing area in the seven sub watersheds table 1 and fig 10 the landscape of shihuiyao and duobukuli was less disturbed by human activities and the two sub watersheds are geographically closed to one another the area ratio of wetlands was higher in shihuoyao than in duobuku table 1 however the ratios of wetland drainage area in the two sub watersheds were opposite this difference led to a greater increase in daily monthly seasonal and annual baseflows figs 3 4 and 7 but a smaller decrease in daily monthly seasonal and annual quickflows in shihuiyao figs 5 6 and 10 this implies that the contributing area of wetlands plays an important role in the regulation of quickflow and wetland area mainly contributes to baseflow support in this study more importantly the contributing area of wetlands accounts for a larger part of each sub watershed with percentages over 50 fig 10 therefore estimation of hydrological services of wetlands should consider both wetland area and their contributing area moreover the hydrogeological characteristics of the watershed e g groundwater dependent wetlands mainly receive water from underlying aquifers such as seeps springs and geothermal discharges can modify or even control water balance of wetlands and eventually determine the capacity of hydrological services of wetlands gilvear et al 1993 siegela 1988 for example seasonal frozen and permafrost soils acts as a restrictive subsurface layer perch water above it and provide a source of water through summer thaw across the regions ping et al 1992 the relative thicker and broader non frozen soil make it transformed from poorly drained soils in the winter to well drained soils in the summer and behaved a more baseflow support in the latter period woo and young 2006 this suggests that wetland characteristics associated with landscape attributes as well as geomorphic and hydrogeological conditions in a basin can potentially limit or promote hydrological services of wetlands fossey et al 2016 golden et al 2016 cowley et al 2018 the areal percentage of anthropogenic land cover farmland and settlements was greater in menlu 13 64 keluo 35 86 gan 14 39 and nenjiang 15 15 than in the other two sub watersheds fig 10 in terms of daily and monthly wsis the regulation of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow had obvious double peak characteristics in gan menlu and keluo figs 5 and 7 specifically wetlands had a stronger effect on baseflow and quckflow during spring and summer floods than in other periods for gan although wetlands had the strongest regulation on monthly seasonal and annual baseflows and quickflows in this sub watershed the variability of wsi decreased the baseflow and increased the quickflow to some extent this can be partially explained by the lowest ratio of wetland area 13 2 and greater anthropogenic disturbance in this sub watershed yang et al 2008 and martinez martinez et al 2014 reported that as wetland area increases the mitigation of streamflow by wetlands becomes larger keluo has the largest wetland coverage 23 4 and the lowest contributing area 33 82 but the strongest human disturbance this leads to a relatively low effect of wetlands on monthly quickflow and baseflow in june while they have a large effect before may and after july figs 5 and 7 this may attribute to larger area of water diversion from stream network for irrigation in the downstream keluo basin where larger area of dry farmland exist fig 1 the water diversion from stream network can impair low flow support services of wetlands in dry season to some extent comparing hydrological services of wetlands in two pristine sub watersheds shihuiyao and duobukuli anthropogenic activities mainly referring to farmland changed the intensification and temporal variation of the effect of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow as discussed by acreman and holden 2013 many wetland systems have undergone changes in hydrological function due to human intervention e g drainage which may alter the role of wetlands on downstream flood risk although paddy field dry farmland and settlements are mainly located at the downstream end of gan keluo and menlu fig 1c the primary regulation regime of wetlands has changed a lot compared with shihuiyao and duobukkuli especially during the 2013 flood event fig 9 because anthropogenic land is likely to result in a complex response in water availability and recycling in wetlands due to modification of evapotranspiration rates from changes in vegetation significant alteration of water movement within wetlands as a result of water table manipulations langan et al 2018 considering climate change and anthropogenic activities wetlands will be continuously transformed to farmland with a higher fragmentation wang et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the conversion of wetlands into other land use and subsequent degradation of wetland functions could further exacerbate current extreme hydrological events under changing climate conditions erwin 2009 thus protection and rehabilitation of damaged wetlands in the unrb has become a major subject of adaptation and may be highly beneficial for flood and drought management the cumulative impacts of wetlands on baseflow and quicflow were also different in this study as stream order increases moving from the headwater sub watershed shihuiyao to the middle sub watershed of the unrb kumotun and to the outlet of the entire basin nenjiang the effect of wetlands on monthly and seasonal baseflows and quickflows diminished at first but became stronger afterwards compared to kumotun and shihuiyao nenjiang had a weaker variability of wsis providing at first more support on baseflow and attenuation on quickflow as well as less reduction on baseflow and slight increase in quickflow in further downstream figs 3 5 7 and 8 these results corroborate those of lee et al 2018 and ahmed 2014 who demonstrated that wetlands can strongly influence downstream outlet flow by altering water transport mechanisms in upstream areas however the intensity of reduction in quickflow and increase in baseflow were not always enhanced with the increase of cumulative drainage area we also can find evidence from changes in attenuation and amplification effect of wetlands on quickflow and bsseflow during the 2013 flood events fig 9 this divergence may be attributed to decreasing ratios of wetlands and the increasing ratio of anthropogenic land cover from shihuiyao to kumotun and to nenjiang fig 10 moreover the effect of wetlands on floods downstream may be modified by the flood coming from tributaries and be overwhelmed by processes operating elsewhere in the basin acreman and holden 2013 nonetheless wetland types and spatial distribution fossey et al 2016 lee et al 2018 topographies cowley et al 2018 associated with farmland types e g paddy field and dry farmland and forest fragmentation tang et al 2012 wang et al 2015a b in the study area may also affect the hydrological services of wetlands hence there is a need for further research on examining how the level of service provisioning of wetlands is likely to change under different land management scenarios 4 3 implication limitation and further study simulation of the effect of wetlands on upstream streamflows have implication for understanding the spatial and temporal variations of hydrologic processes in upstream systems and protecting downstream ecosystems our simulation results further indicated that wetlands act to stabilize downstream flow fluctuations in response to quickflow and baseflow the hydrological services by wetlands could be more critical in the future since the frequency and intensity of hydrological extreme events are expected to increase in this region li et al 2016 chen and zhang 2017 in recent years multipurpose water resource management plans have been implemented to make the songhua river basin become china s future major grain production base and wetland reserve in the downstream region of the nenjiang river basin wu et al 2018 the hydrological services provided by wetlands in the upstream an indisputable nature based solution cohen shacham et al 2016 bridgewater 2018 can provide supportive solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation challenges therefore protection of wetlands becomes a valuable mitigation measure for curbing potential effects of climate variability on hydrological extremes in this region and for contributing to water resources management in the downstream region of the nenjiang river basin the limitation of this study should also be acknowledged first we separated baseflow and quickflow from simulated streamflows by hydrotel using a nonlinear reservoir algorithm namely wittenberg s algorithm regardless of the origin of water that is observed or simulated streamflow second we estimated evaporation from wetlands using a conceptual method that lacks of an explicit consideration of different potential evaporation between open water and vegetation within wetlands this could lead to either underestimation or overestimation of wetland evaporation because vegetation considerably contributes to water loss of wetlands krasnostein and oldham 2004 mohamed et al 2012 specifically wetland evaporation is site specific and a strong function of the biophysical factors linked to vegetation type and water supply mohamed et al 2012 uncertainty remains about the estimation of baseflow and quickflow due to difficulties in measuring baseflow it should be possible therefore to obtain baseflow and quickflow from hydrotel directly and further investigation although the model structure cannot be readily exploited to assess them directly but it would be possible secondly wetland water balance monitoring data e g soil moisture measurements wetland area evapotranspiration water table and local groundwater stage levels should be utilized to further validate our model as they become available additionally we did not clear out the reason to temporal alternative variability of amplification or attenuation effect of wetlands for instance what are the decisive factors for the amplification or attenuation effect of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow namely whether there exist reasonable threshold values involving wetland characteristics e g types area soil properties and capacity of water storage precipitation regime e g concentration intensity and duration and physical geography finally we presented that the flow regulation services of wetlands can be altered by anthropogenic land cover especially with respect to the effect on hydrological extremes however we only investigated how wetlands influenced baseflow and quickflow during the 2013 flood events hence it is unclear to what extent floods and hydrological droughts are attenuated or enhanced by wetlands of different types and sizes associated with anthropogenic disturbance 5 summary and conclusions this study used the physitel hydrotel distributed hydrological modelling platform to evaluate the effects of wetlands on quickflow and baseflow within the upper nenjiang river basin northeast china the modeling results indicated that wetlands strongly affect hydrological fluxes to control watershed hydrological processes at our study site specifically wetlands decrease hydrological fluxes by slightly increasing actual evapotranspiration and decreasing water yield in the study area in addition wetlands can attenuate quickflow remarkably but can also increase qucikflow slightly while supporting baseflow largely and reducing baseflow to some extent overall wetlands seem to regulate quickflow more than baseflow these wetland flow regulation services show significant multi temporal variation characteristics namely daily monthly seasonal and annual scales variation at the sub watershed and the basin scales our study also showed that wetlands influence both baseflow and quickflow more strongly during the summer than during the winter wetland characteristics i e wetland area and contributing area associated with land cover in a river basin can potentially limit or promote their flow regulation services resulting in different regulation patterns but the overall cumulative effect of wetlands on flood attenuation is enhanced with the increase of their drainage area anthropogenic activities and decreasing wetland area can alter the regulation services of wetlands which could undermine their effect on hydrological extremes to some extent based on these findings we conclude that wetlands exert significant effects on streamflows by considerably modifying mitigating or augmenting the temporal variability of quickflow and baseflow the hydrological services provided by wetlands in the upstream portion of a river basin can potentially provide a nature based solution for climate mitigation and adaptation challenges thus protection and restoration of upstream wetlands have become necessary and essential to maintain significant flow regulations and beneficial effect to water resources management downstream credit authorship contribution statement yanfeng wu conceptualization writing original draft

5729,although the hydrological services of individual wetlands have been much acknowledged their cumulative effect at the watershed scale has not been assessed as extensively in this study a distributed hydrological modeling platform the physitel hydrotel was used to i investigate watershed hydrological processes with and without abundant wetlands and ii quantify the effect of wetlands on streamflow specifically baseflow and quickflow in the upper nenjiang river basin northeast china the modeling results showed that wetlands can strongly affect quickflow and baseflow consequently modifying the watershed hydrograph the study demonstrated the flow regulation services of wetlands at various temporal i e daily monthly seasonal and annual and spatial scales i e sub watersheds of different sizes specifically wetland presence seemed to have stronger influence on baseflow and quickflow in the summer season than in the winter the cumulative effect of wetlands on quickflow and baseflow quantity enhanced with the increasing wetland area anthropogenic activities such as reclamation and settlements could affect the regulation services of wetlands to some extent these findings indicate that wetlands exert significant effects on watershed hydrological processes by modifying the temporal variability of quickflow and baseflow in this region therefore it is important to protect and restore wetlands in the upstream portion of a watershed as a means of sustaining flow regulation and water resources in river basins keywords flow regulation services wetlands quickflow baseflow watershed hydrological processes 1 introduction wetlands provide important ecosystem functions and services including flood mitigation aquatic habitats source water supply recreation and water purification millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 among the services those associated with flood attenuation and baseflow contribution at the watershed scale come to mind kadykalo and findlay 2016 langan et al 2018 these services are important for enhancing and maintaining hydrological resilience to future changes induced by climate and human impacts within a watershed mitsch and gosselink 2007 mclaughlin et al 2014 fossey and rousseau 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 hydrologic models have been used to quantitatively assess flow regulation services of wetlands acreman and holden 2013 hughes et al 2014 golden et al 2014 evenson et al 2015 2016 2018 ahmed 2016 fossey et al 2016 lee et al 2018 perez valdivia et al 2017 for example the soil and water assessment tool swat model with wetland modules and subsequent improvements has been widely used to examine the effect of wetlands on watershed hydrology liu et al 2008 wang et al 2010 evenson et al 2015 2018 golden et al 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 lee et al 2018 yeo et al 2019a b these improvements have contributed to simulation efficiency of hydrological processes and accordingly flow regulation services of wetlands lee et al 2018 however most of the aforementioned studies focused on either isolated wetlands iws or riparian wetlands rws and our knowledge about the cumulative effect of variable wetlands on initial runoff and baseflow contribution numerous studies have shown that wetlands can generally reduce floods increase low flows and decrease runoff however estimates of these flow regulations provided by wetlands can bear large uncertainties acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo et al 2016 for instance fossey and rousseau 2016 assessed current and future hydroclimate projections and postulated that conservation of wetland areas could potentially increase 2 year 20 year and 100 year peak flows in another study on future climate change effects in a midwestern us watershed walter and others 2016 found that wetlands could potentially be a robust nature based solution for peak flow reduction with consistent reductions from the past to future time periods and across all climate projections in their literature review bullock and acreman 2003 showed that wetlands have been found to both reduce and increase floods in a more recent literature review acreman and holden 2013 reported that wetlands normally reduce peak flows but can also contribute to a higher peak flow under certain conditions these diverging findings show a need for more research on the hydrological services of wetlands at the watershed scale quickflow is defined to occur over a short period of time following major precipitation events while baseflow is defined as the quantity of flow occurring for some time after the end of the event hornberger et al 1998 evenson et al 2015 ficklin et al 2016 baseflow and quickflow and their mixing have an effect on water quantity and quality zhang and schilling 2005 gomez velez et al 2015 aquatic ecosystem structure and function blaen et al 2018 flood and drought padilla et al 1994 water resources management and regulation hornbeck et al 1993 perrine et al 2013 quickflow depends on a number of factors including precipitation intensity soil physical and hydraulic properties and watershed and drainage network characteristics therefore quickflow in a watershed can vary largely being responsible for flood magnitude stream baseflow reflects watershed storage and is therefore often responsible for low flow variability padilla et al 1994 ficklin et al 2016 buttle 2018 because of these assessment of the wetland effect on baseflow and quickflow can improve our understanding of the streamflow regulation services of wetlands however there has been very little research into the quantitative effect of wetlands on watershed baseflow and quickflow in this study a distributed hydrological modelling platform with specific riparian wetland rw and isolated wetland iw modules physitel hydrotel fortin et al 2001 rousseau et al 2011 fossey et al 2016 was applied to a river basin in northeast china the primary goal of the study was to quantify the effect of wetlands on stream quickflow and baseflow the study focused on three questions i how do wetlands affect monthly seasonal winter and summer and annual quickflow and baseflow ii can wetlands both increase and decrease quickflow and baseflow simultaneously and iii if so how and to what extent wetlands can modulate qucikflow and baseflow temporally and spatially 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data availability this modeling study was conducted in the upper nenjiang river basin unrb in northeast china fig 1 a the total drainage area of the unrb is 61 249 km2 serving as the most important source water area for agricultural irrigation and natural wetlands in the region these wetlands support diverse habitats and many endangered wildlife species wu et al 2018 the unrb consists of a headwater sub watershed shihuiyao drainage area and four sub watersheds duobukuli river gan river menlu river and keluo river fig 1 the region has a cold temperate climate with long and chilly winters with widespread snow cover soils are seasonaly frozen and permafrost the topography changes frequently from rolling hills to deep river valleys with an average gradient of 3 35 long term average monthly temperature in this region ranges from 21 5 c in january to 20 4 c in july with an annual mean of 1 5 c annual precipitation ranges from 390 mm to 704 mm precipitation mainly occurs during the summer season april september which accounts for about 89 of the annual total precipitation major land cover types include forest wetlands and grassland accounting for 51 6 18 3 and 12 2 of the unrb respectively fig 1b the upper nenjiang river basin has abundant wetland areas with several nationally important wetland preservers including the nanwen wetland ramsar site menlu national nature reserve and keluo nature reserve these wetlands are more vulnerable than other ecosystems to future climate because of their higher latitude and significant climate change found in the region

interconnected river segments for each of these units a single value can be assigned for soil type and percentages of each land cover classes rousseau et al 2011 physitel provides altitude slope and flow orientation for each rhhu along with characteristics of each rs slope and default bathymetric characteristics such as full bank water depth and river width as well as contributing drainage area of iws and rws see liu et al 2008 hydrotel is a continuous watershed model which integrates remote sensing gis climatic and other data and runs on intra or daily time steps in flow simulation the model has the following modules to perform modeling computationally meteorological data interpolation snowpack dynamics soil temperature and freezing depth potential evapotranspiration vertical water budget overland water routing and channel routing in addition a wetland module is developed for the model to solve flow attenuation and storage with watersheds the soil temperature and freezing depth module used in this study is based on the model described in rankinen et al 2004 the model calculates soil temperature at various depths at a daily time step with consideration of the influence of snow cover simplifications made by rankinen et al 2004 neglected the influence of changes in soil water content on soil temperature to properly integrate wetlands in the hydrotel modeling three pre processing steps are performed by physitel namely i identification of wetland types iws and rws ii computation of the wetland surface and drainage areas and iii quantification of wetland parameters using the aforementioned wetland map and datasets the distinction between isolated and riparian hew is determined by their connectivity to the natural drainage network fossey et al 2016 isolated wetlands are characterized as a specific subset of wetland systems which have no or limited direct hydrologic connection to the drainage network golden et al 2014 and are mainly governed by water table fluctuations induced by precipitation groundwater and upland conditions winter and labaugh 2003 riparian wetlands defined as the areas periodically inundated by floods from bordering rivers brooks et al 2011 and whose water dynamics are mainly dependent on river and groundwater contributions fossey et al 2016 the parameters of each wetland module are characterized by physitel those of the iw module are related to the following i ratio defining the relationship between the surface of hew when the wetland is at maximum and normal water levels respectively frac ii an adjustable value of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying soil ksat bs iii evaporation from hew defined as a percentage of potential evapotranspiration calculated at the rhhu scale c ev iv a coefficient of production i e contribution to terrestrial flow and v an area volume relationship fossey et al 2016 for rws in addition to the aforementioned parameters frac and ksat bs three specific parameters are determined i an adjustable value of bank saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat bk and two threshold values defining ii maximum dwet max and iii normal dwet nor water levels the information is then exported to hydrotel for this study the unrb was discretized into seven sub watersheds for iws the hydrogeological processes are integrated in the vertical water budget bv3c fortin et al 2001 at the rhhu scale for rws the water balance is partially integrated in the vertical water budget bv3c of an rhhu and directly connected to the associated river segment via the kinematic wave equation these representations provide a modelling approach capable of simulating water balance at the wetland scale while accounting for their interaction with their surroundings contributing drainage area and hydrologic connectivity in this study the hydrotel model coupled with the two wetland modules iws and rws was calibrated against observed streamflow at a daily time step over 6 years 1 year warm up

generates the most robust parameter sets and provides the best model accuracy using the methodology introduced by tolson and shoemaker 2007 the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm was used for calibration with respect to the discharge records of the seven sub watersheds fig 1 dds has been recognized as an efficient tool for calibration of complex and large parameter space hydrological models e g foulon and rousseau 2018 the dds algorithm automatically scales the search space to decrease the number of model evaluations required to reach the optimal region of best quality fitness function tolson and shoemaker 2007 the perturbation factor of single dds parameter was set to the default value 0 2 in the optimization process see tolson and shoemaker 2007 automatic calibration was performed based on the maximization of the zhang performance metric zhang et al 2008 zhang represents a meta objective function which considers a set of information including equal weights of combination of metrics regarding high flows low flows timing and bias the function has been found to be capable of improving process representation and parameter inference fowler et al 2018 zhang also

please refer to turcotte et al 2003 and foulon and rousseau 2018 2 3 quantitative assessment of the effects of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow the paired simulation framework based on model runs with wetlands ww and without wetlands wow has been used by evenson et al 2015 fossey et al 2016 fossey and rousseau 2016 ahmed 2016 and lee et al 2018 for the quantitative assessment of the hydrological effects of wetlands in this study the simulations with and without wetlands are referred to as baseline scenario current wetlands and reference simulation scenario 100 wetland removal for six sub watersheds and the entire watershed respectively the without wetland scenarios are dealt in this study as follows when the wetland modules are turned off wetland area are not removed but they are treated as the land cover of saturated soils and thus their explicit storage properties are not accounted for in the modeling this is a basic assumption in the present analysis this framework represents the common way of tackling the issue of how to assess the hydrological functions of wetlands using hydrological models such as swat liu et al 2008 wang et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 mike 11 ahmed 2016 and hydrotel fossey et al 2016 fossey and rousseau 2016 simulations of streamflow for the seven sub watersheds were run from 2000 to 2016 using calibrated hydrotel with one year spin up period i e 2000 hydrorecession a matlab toolbox for streamflow recession analysis was used to separate total daily streamflow into baseflow and quickflow arciniega esparza et al 2017 this toolbox applies the inverse relationship of the wittenberg s algorithm wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 to separate the observed hydrograph into baseflow and quickflow the wetland specific impact wsi metric was adopted to determine the hydrological impact of wetlands according to fossey et al 2016 this index provides a mean of normalizing the hydrological impact increase or decrease in stream metrics with respect to wetland area as outlined in the following equation 6 ws i bforqf s ww s wow a where wsibf or qf mm is the index of wetland impact expressed as streamflow parameter baseflow and quickflow reduction or increase per unit area of a considered wetland sww m3 s and swow m3 s are streamflow parameters calculated from simulated streamflow during ww and wow scenarios respectively a in km2 is the wetland area in a specific watershed first we calculated daily wsi bf or qf using daily simulated streamflow with and without wetland modules scenarios for the six sub watersheds and the entire watershed then we obtained monthly seasonal and annual averaged wsibf or qf from daily wsi bf or qf to further investigate the combined effect of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow we extracted the corresponding positive and negative values of daily wsis to quantify the actual increase and decrease by wetlands then we separately calculated average negative and positive daily wsi values for all the days of the years 2001 to 2016 the analysis of variance nova was used with a significance level of 5 to determine whether there were significant differences in the indicators between ww and wow scenarios over different temporal scales 3 results 3 1 model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 criterion correlation coefficient cc gupta et al 2009 the percentage bias pbias yapo et al 1996 and kge kling et al 2012 were used to assess model performance as shown in fig 2 the nse criterion values were over 0 60 in seven watersheds for the period of calibration the pbias values of all calibration results were 10 especially near zero in majority watersheds the ccs for the best simulation results were 0 75 moreover both kge and zhang achieved a satisfactory value 0 70 during the calibration period according to the hydrologic model performance rating described by moriasi et al 2007 gupta et al 2009 and kling et al 2012 our model calibration was successful these calibration results demonstrated that streamflows in the study area can be well simulated by the the physitel hydrotel model under different land use and climate conditions 3 2 the overall impact of wetlands the partitioning of mean annual precipitation p mm into actual evapotranspiration aet mm and water yield wy mm under the two types of scenarios with without wetlands were calculated using model outputs table 2 the seven sub watersheds received different p and generated uneven aet and wy during the 6 year study period the modeling results showed that the watersheds would have lower aet if all wetlands were removed conversely wetlands decreased wy by 14 03 3 65 3 79 8 84 6 59 and 6 90 in shihuiyao duobukuli menlu kumotun keluo gan and nenjiang respectively therefore wetlands in the watersheds contributed to a reduced variability in annual water fluxes but the different intensity of wy responses 3 3 effect of wetlands on baseflow to evaluate the effect of wetlands on baseflow the monthly fig 3 seasonal and annual fig 4 wetland specific impacts wsi were calculated for each of the seven watersheds as shown in fig 3 wetlands generally induced monthly baseflow support i e positive values of wsis at the seven outlets except for the gan watershed other six sub watersheds showed significant support on baseflow from april to september p 0 05 and a slight effect on baseflow during the other 5 months p 0 05 for the shihuoyao duobukuli kumotun and nenjiang sub watersheds wsi gradually rose from january to august or september and steadily fell afterward for the keluo and gan sub watersheds wetlands greatly supported baseflow during two separated periods namely in april menlu or may keluo and gan and from june to september menlu and keluo or to october gan p 0 05 however the variability of monthly and monthly averaged wsi varied across the seven watersheds for shihuoyao duobukuli menlu kumotun keluo and nenjiang wetlands had relative low variability in wsi values while the majority of them were positive which indicated obvious and steady baseflow support of wetlands conversely for gan wsi values indicated a strong variation in baseflow support and baseflow reduction negative value of wsi by wetlands specifically wetlands in gan mainly induced baseflow reduction in april 0 002 mm and june 0 002 mm and slight baseflow support in may 0 003 mm while exhibiting significant baseflow support from july to october 0 032 mm 0 032 mm 0 034 mm and 0 018 mm respectively p 0 05 in terms of the impact of wetlands on average winter fig 4a and summer baseflows fig 4b at the seven outlets wetlands seemed to have induced more baseflow support during summer months than during the winter months apparently wetlands exhibited much greater baseflow support in gan river basin than at the other six outlets during both summer and winter while for the other six outlets showed significant baseflow support during summer and weak baseflow support during winter at the annual scale wetland mainly induced baseflow support from 2001 to 2016 fig 4c similar to the monthly variability of wsis annual wsis varied remarkably in the gan sub watershed followed by the shihuiyao sub watershed the average values of wsis in these two sub watersheds were larger than those of the other five sub watersheds ranging from 0 000 to 0 011 mm and from 0 001 to 0 016 mm respectively moreover 8 out of 12 years of all seven outlets had negative wsi values indicating a very small reduction in annual baseflow caused by wetlands therefore the above results implied that wetlands generally exerted a considerable support service on monthly seasonal and annual baseflows 3 4 effect of wetlands on quickflow wetlands generally induced reduction in monthly baseflows negative values of wsi for all the outlets fig 5 specifically wetlands overall reduced quickflow substantially from april to october p 0 05 while affecting quickflow infinitesimally during other months at the seven outlets however the variation of wsi was spatially different for the duobukuli kumotun keluo gan and nenjiang sub watersheds wsi experienced a single peak curve from january to december while it showed a two peak curve for the shihuiuyao and menlu sub watersheds from monthly wsi and monthly average in fig 5 it is noteworthy that although wetlands in the gan sub watershed had a greater effect on quickflow the value of wsi in the watershed exhibited greater variation than those in the other watersheds moreover the strongest reduction p 0 05 in quickflow coming from wetlands occurred in march in menlu 0 001 mm in june in duobukuli 0 019 mm keluo 0 010 mm and nenjiang 0 014 mm in august in shihuiyao 0 011 mm kumotun 0 009 mm and gan 0 039 mm the regulation services of wetlands on quickflow had spatial and temporal variation due to watershed characteristics such as the physical geography of each watershed based on seasonal wsis wetlands seemed to reduce qucikflow during summer considerably the average value of wsis ranged from 0 017 to 0 006 mm p 0 05 but only marginally during winter from 0 002 to 0 mm fig 6 a and 6b similar to the varying characteristics of annual wsis on baseflow wetlands influenced quickflow most in gan during both summer and winter p 0 05 in addition the wsi of gan varied remarkably and was larger than those of the other six outlets fig 6c the twelve year average wsi value was 0 010 mm and the annual wsis ranged from 0 030 to 0 015 mm indicating that wetlands mainly exhibited reduction in both seasonal and annual quickflows furthermore the impact of wetlands on quickflow was very small because of marginal wsi values for a few years thus as described above wetlands mainly reduced monthly seasonal and annual quickflows 3 5 combined effect of wetlands on daily baseflow and quickflow wetlands in the upper nenjiang river basin mainly reduced monthly seasonal and annual quickflow and but increased monthly seasonal and annual baseflow figs 3 4 5 and 6 however this wetland effect occurred under a certain condition wetlands overall increased more than reduced baseflow which was more apparent from julian days 100 to 300 fig 7 p 0 05 however the intensity of these two opposite effects varied across watersheds wetlands increased baseflow mostly in duobukuli with average daily wsi of 0 0338 mm followed by gan with average value of 0 0187 mm also wetlands decreased baseflow in duobukuli and gan with values of 0 013 mm and 0 012 mm respectively for other five watersheds although wetlands exerted a lesser effect on baseflow compared to gan and duobukuli the increase ascribed to wetlands were even larger than the decrease concretely the average increase reduction were 0 0002 mm 0 0006 mm 0 0010 mm 0 0028 mm 0 0028 mm 0 0091 mm and 0 0003 mm 0 0022 mm for shihuiyao keluo menlu kunmotun and nenjiang respectively the evidence points to the likelihood that the reduction effect increase with the increase effect it should be noted that the increase effect of wetlands occurred several times more than the reduction effect namely 2 60 mm 1 56 mm 3 00 mm 2 80 mm 3 25 mm and 7 33 mm in duobukuli gan shihuiyao keluo menlu kunmotun and nenjiang respectively conversely more reduction than increase in quickflow by wetlands was observed which was clearly depicted in julian days from 70 to 300 across the seven watersheds fig 8 the average reduction increase were 0 0104 mm 0 0079 mm 0 0098 mm 0 0057 mm 0 0097 mm 0 0036 mm 0 0080 mm 0 0035 mm 0 0101 mm 0 0038 mm 0 0182 mm 0 0061 mm and 0 0077 mm 0 0025 mm for shihuiyao duobukuli keluo menlu kunmotun gan and nenjiang respectively wetlands seemed to increase quickflow considerably but decrease quickflow slightly for instance wetlands in shihuiyao increased qucikflow with an average wsi value of 0 1682 mm p 0 05 and decreased quickflow with a much lower average wsi value of 0 1060 mm p 0 05 from the 100th to 170th day moreover unlike the varying characteristics of daily baseflow wsi quickflow wsi had a larger magnitude and variability especially in menlu keluo and gan these results indicated that wetlands affected quickflow more than baseflow on daily monthly seasonal and annual scales 4 discussion 4 1 combined effect of wetlands on quick flow and baseflow previous studies have recognized that wetlands can provide important hydrological services including flood attenuation low flow support and other changes in the hydrological processes ahmed 2016 fossey et al 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 kadykalo et al 2016 in this study we quantitatively assessed the effect of wetlands on daily monthly seasonal and annual baseflows and quickflows we found that i wetlands attenuate but seldom also increase quickflow ii wetlands increase baseflow but seldom also decrease baseflow and iii wetlands regulate quickflow more than they do baseflow on daily monthly seasonal and annual scales these findings improve our understanding about how and to what extent wetlands affect baseflow and quickflow over different temporal scales although wetlands mainly reduce quickflow and increase baseflow they can also increase quickflow and decrease baseflow to some extent the study by langan et al 2018 indicated that wetlands can influence watershed hydrology through long and short term surface water storage which can aid or undermine attenuation of flood waters the contradictory results can be found in fossey and rousseau 2016 and walters and babbar sebens 2016 which concluded that wetlands could potentially increase or decrease or completely decrease peak flows respectively there are several conditions under which the enhancement of floods by wetlands can occur i wetlands may contribute to a higher flood peak because they are fully saturated during wet winter months burt 1994 ii permanently saturated wetlands with little or no storage capacity may generate or augment floods relative to semi saturated or unsaturated wetlands morris and camino 2011 iii the soil of wetlands with plentiful macropore networks could lead to greater flow velocities and eventually enhance river flow peaks even if it is dominated by subsurface flow jones 2010 iv synchronicity between tributary and main channel peaks can occur even when wetland contribute to the attenuation of flood flows acreman and holden 2013 on the other hand bullock and acreman 2003 noted that many studies reported reduction of floods by wetlands some found evidence of wetlands increasing floods while others concluded no impact this is because many basin features can play a role in flow generation including initial storage conditions rainfall drainage area soil type vegetation cover and slope and the influence of these factors may be greater than that of wetlands under circumstance acreman and holden 2013 the null impact of wetlands could be more highlighted in basins with lower coverage of wetlands especially during major catastrophic floods where the entire basin may be saturated thus wetlands could possibly increase the risk of flood aggravate hydrological droughts or have no effect on streamflow under certain conditions this implies that water resources management and regulation should consider more detailed site specific information to make the right decision wetlands in the upper nenjiang river basin strongly affected both annual baseflow and qucikflow in 2013 across the seven studied outlets fig 4c and fig 6c in the summer of 2013 the nenjiang river basin had its largest floods since 1984 known as a once in a century flood wang et al 2015a b as an example fig 9 illustrates the effect of wetlands on flood processes with respect to quickflow baseflow and streamflow differences streamflow with wetlands minus streamflow simulated without wetlands in shihuiyao pristine watershed gan larger variability of wsi kumotun middle unrb and nenjiang the outlet of entire watershed peak flow and streamflow reductions were observed at four outlets during the 2013 flood events this result is consistent with other studies that show reduction in peak flow and streamflow regulated by wetlands jackson 1987 wu et al 2008 yang et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 ahmed 2016 fossey et al 2016 walters and babbar sebens 2016 however wetlands mainly decrease streamflows negative streamflow delta values during the rising stage and increase streamflow positive streamflow delta value during the recession stage specifically wetlands mainly attenuated streamflows by abundantly decreasing quickflow and slightly increasing baseflow at the first stage while predominantly amplified streamflow by considerably increasing baseflow and marginally decreasing quickflow subsequently fig 9 it should be noted that these attenuation and amplification processes has more variability in gan which substantiates the aforementioned results introduced in fig 3 and fig 5 simultaneously the amount of increased baseflow by wetlands was enormously larger than the attenuation on quickflow during the recession stage this results may be explained by the fact that gan had the largest area ratio of wetlands but the lowest contributing area ratio table 1 the contributing area of wetland represented as the sum of the area of all portions of relatively homogeneous hydrologic response units draining to wetlands evenson et al 2015 2016 plays an important role in determining the dynamic and hysteresis nature of rainfall runoff processes between upland and wetlands lee et al 2018 on the other hand the wetland area can largely affect how much water can be stored ultimately in a watershed acreman and holden 2013 fossey et al 2016 therefore the larger capacity for receiving water and lower efficiency to storage water could lead to a marked change in attenuation and amplification processes 4 2 spatial difference of wetland hydrological regulation services we found that the intensification of baseflow and quickflow by wetlands varied across sub watersheds we calculated area ratio of land cover especially the area and ration of wetland and their contributing area in the seven sub watersheds table 1 and fig 10 the landscape of shihuiyao and duobukuli was less disturbed by human activities and the two sub watersheds are geographically closed to one another the area ratio of wetlands was higher in shihuoyao than in duobuku table 1 however the ratios of wetland drainage area in the two sub watersheds were opposite this difference led to a greater increase in daily monthly seasonal and annual baseflows figs 3 4 and 7 but a smaller decrease in daily monthly seasonal and annual quickflows in shihuiyao figs 5 6 and 10 this implies that the contributing area of wetlands plays an important role in the regulation of quickflow and wetland area mainly contributes to baseflow support in this study more importantly the contributing area of wetlands accounts for a larger part of each sub watershed with percentages over 50 fig 10 therefore estimation of hydrological services of wetlands should consider both wetland area and their contributing area moreover the hydrogeological characteristics of the watershed e g groundwater dependent wetlands mainly receive water from underlying aquifers such as seeps springs and geothermal discharges can modify or even control water balance of wetlands and eventually determine the capacity of hydrological services of wetlands gilvear et al 1993 siegela 1988 for example seasonal frozen and permafrost soils acts as a restrictive subsurface layer perch water above it and provide a source of water through summer thaw across the regions ping et al 1992 the relative thicker and broader non frozen soil make it transformed from poorly drained soils in the winter to well drained soils in the summer and behaved a more baseflow support in the latter period woo and young 2006 this suggests that wetland characteristics associated with landscape attributes as well as geomorphic and hydrogeological conditions in a basin can potentially limit or promote hydrological services of wetlands fossey et al 2016 golden et al 2016 cowley et al 2018 the areal percentage of anthropogenic land cover farmland and settlements was greater in menlu 13 64 keluo 35 86 gan 14 39 and nenjiang 15 15 than in the other two sub watersheds fig 10 in terms of daily and monthly wsis the regulation of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow had obvious double peak characteristics in gan menlu and keluo figs 5 and 7 specifically wetlands had a stronger effect on baseflow and quckflow during spring and summer floods than in other periods for gan although wetlands had the strongest regulation on monthly seasonal and annual baseflows and quickflows in this sub watershed the variability of wsi decreased the baseflow and increased the quickflow to some extent this can be partially explained by the lowest ratio of wetland area 13 2 and greater anthropogenic disturbance in this sub watershed yang et al 2008 and martinez martinez et al 2014 reported that as wetland area increases the mitigation of streamflow by wetlands becomes larger keluo has the largest wetland coverage 23 4 and the lowest contributing area 33 82 but the strongest human disturbance this leads to a relatively low effect of wetlands on monthly quickflow and baseflow in june while they have a large effect before may and after july figs 5 and 7 this may attribute to larger area of water diversion from stream network for irrigation in the downstream keluo basin where larger area of dry farmland exist fig 1 the water diversion from stream network can impair low flow support services of wetlands in dry season to some extent comparing hydrological services of wetlands in two pristine sub watersheds shihuiyao and duobukuli anthropogenic activities mainly referring to farmland changed the intensification and temporal variation of the effect of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow as discussed by acreman and holden 2013 many wetland systems have undergone changes in hydrological function due to human intervention e g drainage which may alter the role of wetlands on downstream flood risk although paddy field dry farmland and settlements are mainly located at the downstream end of gan keluo and menlu fig 1c the primary regulation regime of wetlands has changed a lot compared with shihuiyao and duobukkuli especially during the 2013 flood event fig 9 because anthropogenic land is likely to result in a complex response in water availability and recycling in wetlands due to modification of evapotranspiration rates from changes in vegetation significant alteration of water movement within wetlands as a result of water table manipulations langan et al 2018 considering climate change and anthropogenic activities wetlands will be continuously transformed to farmland with a higher fragmentation wang et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the conversion of wetlands into other land use and subsequent degradation of wetland functions could further exacerbate current extreme hydrological events under changing climate conditions erwin 2009 thus protection and rehabilitation of damaged wetlands in the unrb has become a major subject of adaptation and may be highly beneficial for flood and drought management the cumulative impacts of wetlands on baseflow and quicflow were also different in this study as stream order increases moving from the headwater sub watershed shihuiyao to the middle sub watershed of the unrb kumotun and to the outlet of the entire basin nenjiang the effect of wetlands on monthly and seasonal baseflows and quickflows diminished at first but became stronger afterwards compared to kumotun and shihuiyao nenjiang had a weaker variability of wsis providing at first more support on baseflow and attenuation on quickflow as well as less reduction on baseflow and slight increase in quickflow in further downstream figs 3 5 7 and 8 these results corroborate those of lee et al 2018 and ahmed 2014 who demonstrated that wetlands can strongly influence downstream outlet flow by altering water transport mechanisms in upstream areas however the intensity of reduction in quickflow and increase in baseflow were not always enhanced with the increase of cumulative drainage area we also can find evidence from changes in attenuation and amplification effect of wetlands on quickflow and bsseflow during the 2013 flood events fig 9 this divergence may be attributed to decreasing ratios of wetlands and the increasing ratio of anthropogenic land cover from shihuiyao to kumotun and to nenjiang fig 10 moreover the effect of wetlands on floods downstream may be modified by the flood coming from tributaries and be overwhelmed by processes operating elsewhere in the basin acreman and holden 2013 nonetheless wetland types and spatial distribution fossey et al 2016 lee et al 2018 topographies cowley et al 2018 associated with farmland types e g paddy field and dry farmland and forest fragmentation tang et al 2012 wang et al 2015a b in the study area may also affect the hydrological services of wetlands hence there is a need for further research on examining how the level of service provisioning of wetlands is likely to change under different land management scenarios 4 3 implication limitation and further study simulation of the effect of wetlands on upstream streamflows have implication for understanding the spatial and temporal variations of hydrologic processes in upstream systems and protecting downstream ecosystems our simulation results further indicated that wetlands act to stabilize downstream flow fluctuations in response to quickflow and baseflow the hydrological services by wetlands could be more critical in the future since the frequency and intensity of hydrological extreme events are expected to increase in this region li et al 2016 chen and zhang 2017 in recent years multipurpose water resource management plans have been implemented to make the songhua river basin become china s future major grain production base and wetland reserve in the downstream region of the nenjiang river basin wu et al 2018 the hydrological services provided by wetlands in the upstream an indisputable nature based solution cohen shacham et al 2016 bridgewater 2018 can provide supportive solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation challenges therefore protection of wetlands becomes a valuable mitigation measure for curbing potential effects of climate variability on hydrological extremes in this region and for contributing to water resources management in the downstream region of the nenjiang river basin the limitation of this study should also be acknowledged first we separated baseflow and quickflow from simulated streamflows by hydrotel using a nonlinear reservoir algorithm namely wittenberg s algorithm regardless of the origin of water that is observed or simulated streamflow second we estimated evaporation from wetlands using a conceptual method that lacks of an explicit consideration of different potential evaporation between open water and vegetation within wetlands this could lead to either underestimation or overestimation of wetland evaporation because vegetation considerably contributes to water loss of wetlands krasnostein and oldham 2004 mohamed et al 2012 specifically wetland evaporation is site specific and a strong function of the biophysical factors linked to vegetation type and water supply mohamed et al 2012 uncertainty remains about the estimation of baseflow and quickflow due to difficulties in measuring baseflow it should be possible therefore to obtain baseflow and quickflow from hydrotel directly and further investigation although the model structure cannot be readily exploited to assess them directly but it would be possible secondly wetland water balance monitoring data e g soil moisture measurements wetland area evapotranspiration water table and local groundwater stage levels should be utilized to further validate our model as they become available additionally we did not clear out the reason to temporal alternative variability of amplification or attenuation effect of wetlands for instance what are the decisive factors for the amplification or attenuation effect of wetlands on baseflow and quickflow namely whether there exist reasonable threshold values involving wetland characteristics e g types area soil properties and capacity of water storage precipitation regime e g concentration intensity and duration and physical geography finally we presented that the flow regulation services of wetlands can be altered by anthropogenic land cover especially with respect to the effect on hydrological extremes however we only investigated how wetlands influenced baseflow and quickflow during the 2013 flood events hence it is unclear to what extent floods and hydrological droughts are attenuated or enhanced by wetlands of different types and sizes associated with anthropogenic disturbance 5 summary and conclusions this study used the physitel hydrotel distributed hydrological modelling platform to evaluate the effects of wetlands on quickflow and baseflow within the upper nenjiang river basin northeast china the modeling results indicated that wetlands strongly affect hydrological fluxes to control watershed hydrological processes at our study site specifically wetlands decrease hydrological fluxes by slightly increasing actual evapotranspiration and decreasing water yield in the study area in addition wetlands can attenuate quickflow remarkably but can also increase qucikflow slightly while supporting baseflow largely and reducing baseflow to some extent overall wetlands seem to regulate quickflow more than baseflow these wetland flow regulation services show significant multi temporal variation characteristics namely daily monthly seasonal and annual scales variation at the sub watershed and the basin scales our study also showed that wetlands influence both baseflow and quickflow more strongly during the summer than during the winter wetland characteristics i e wetland area and contributing area associated with land cover in a river basin can potentially limit or promote their flow regulation services resulting in different regulation patterns but the overall cumulative effect of wetlands on flood attenuation is enhanced with the increase of their drainage area anthropogenic activities and decreasing wetland area can alter the regulation services of wetlands which could undermine their effect on hydrological extremes to some extent based on these findings we conclude that wetlands exert significant effects on streamflows by considerably modifying mitigating or augmenting the temporal variability of quickflow and baseflow the hydrological services provided by wetlands in the upstream portion of a river basin can potentially provide a nature based solution for climate mitigation and adaptation challenges thus protection and restoration of upstream wetlands have become necessary and essential to maintain significant flow regulations and beneficial effect to water resources management downstream credit authorship contribution statement yanfeng wu conceptualization writing original draft
