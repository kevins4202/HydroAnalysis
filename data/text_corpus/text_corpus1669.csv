8345,study region the inner niger delta ind mali west africa is a vast floodplain with abundant natural resources that supports the livelihood of about two million people ecosystem services in the ind are strongly affected by flood dynamics study focus an accessible yet accurate flood extent estimation method is crucial for the management of natural resources in the ind the relationships between water levels and inundation extents are examined for both the rising and receding flood periods using the outputs of a 2d hydrodynamic model inundation extents derived from modis images were used to validate the result new hydrological insight for the region the relationship between water levels and flooded areas in the ind changes from year to year due to the amplitude of the incoming flood equations were developed to capture that dynamic relationship and estimate flood extent in real time from september to the end of flood using water levels at mopti the relationship is dependent on the maximum water level at mopti and maximum flooded area which was forecasted using streamflow and precipitation in the upper niger basin results show that in addition to forecasting the maximum inundation ahead of time the inundation predicted with the method shows improvement over the existing formulas by mahé et al 2011 zwart et al 2005 and mariko 2003 keywords inundation extent forecasting hydrodynamic model inner niger delta mali 1 introduction floodplains are dynamic systems that are periodically flooded creating distinctive habitats through the exchange of water sediment and organisms tockner and stanford 2002 opperman et al 2010 flood dynamics provide numerous advantages that help the development of aquatic ecosystems and benefit human communities rrp 2016 the inner niger delta ind in mali west africa is one of the largest floodplains in the world and is a vast natural resource that attracts many people to live in and around it zwarts et al 2005 the ind is a particular floodplain as it receives a huge amount of water in sahelian region through niger river which is responsible for the development of remarkable biodiversity for such a semi arid area recognized as a ramsar site by un and iucn methods for estimating the inundation area can roughly be divided into three types methods solely based on digital elevation models dems methods based on hydrodynamic model simulations and method based on remote sensing imagery of flooded areas chen et al 2019 methods based on dems are appropriate for small and still water bodies for which high resolution bathymetry is available they do not apply to water bodies with fast moving water or large lakes where the water surface cannot be assumed to be horizontal methods based on hydrodynamic simulations require the availability of a calibrated hydrodynamic model the development and operation of a hydrodynamic model require technical skills computational resources and real time or near real time access to key observations for this reason despite the availability of a few hydrodynamic models of the ind e g neal et al 2012 haque et al 2019 day to day decision making in the ind rely on observations and simple tools such as multivariate linear models for water level forecasting zwarts 2010 remote sensing is a widely used technique for inundation extent estimation bates 2012 bates et al 1997 it is instrumental in remote regions and developing countries domeneghetti et al 2019 where data collection is challenging for instance sakamoto et al 2007 used modis image to detect temporal changes of the annual flooding of the mekong river laos cambodia thailand uddin et al 2019 used sentinel 1 for flood mapping study of bangladesh anusha and bharathi 2019 used sentinel 1 for flood detection and mapping study of the river reach of rapti and ghaghara river in india several authors used remotely sensed inundation extents to build a relationship between water level and the area flooded such as ogilvie et al 2015 mahé et al 2013 2011 mahé et al 2009 zwarts et al 2005 mariko et al 2003 and mariko 2003 ogilvie et al 2015 used a total of 526 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images from july 2000 to december 2011 to derive a relationship between inundation and water level in mopti mali mahé et al 2011 used noaa avhrr images from 1990 to 2000 to map the flooded areas and link them to water heights at mopti s gauge station zwarts et al 2005 derived a correlation between flooded areas and akka s water stage level by analyzing 24 landsat images spread over several years mariko 2003 derived inundation extent using noaa avhrr images an inundation function a relationship between water levels and flooded areas was developed using the average water height at mopti and akka gauges however the use of remote sensing is subject to constraints such as unavailable or poor quality images unavailability of images at the moment of the maximum extension of flood the presence of clouds noisy images and spectral confusion between water and non water surfaces bates et al 1997 found that the extrapolation of satellite derived inundation extents to estimate the area of inundation during peak floods was problematic clement et al 2018 had the same problem on capturing the maximum extent and they stated that there is no method to accurately extrapolate the data to determine the timing and magnitude of the peak flood the same conclusion can be drawn about the empirical equations proposed by zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 to estimate the inundation extent from measured water levels in the ind while their equation that relates maximum water levels to maximum inundation works fairly well the ones relating water level to inundation extent for the whole duration of the floods were less accurate another major limitation in the existing relationship between water levels at a reference station and the inundation area is that these equations are not able to accurately describe hysteresis behavior mahé et al 2011 zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 stressed this matter in their studies but were not able to provide a solution to this problem due to an insufficient amount of data on inundation extent ogilvie et al 2015 was partially successful in capturing the hysteresis as they used 526 modis images of the area mahe et al 2009 described a special functioning of ind that the southern and northern part of the delta exhibit variable flood dynamics while the rate of change of inundation extent is same in the southern part with respect to water height at mopti however northern part shows greater capacity of inundation in lateral direction due to the connectivity of lakes and river during high stage of water this means that using a linear regression between water height at gauging stations and inundation extent has limitations as the linear function cannot describe the non linearity of the relationship between inundation extension and water level according to the location north or south of the delta to overcome the situation a 2d hydrodynamic model is setup using telemac 2d calibration and validation is done to simulate the inundation time series and then used to obtain an improved relationship between water levels and inundation extent in the ind several modis images were used to validate the results the main objectives of this paper were to develop a relationship between water levels at one reference station and predict the inundation extent in the ind that can a have year to year variations and b be used in real time simulated time series of water levels and inundation extents were generated using a two dimensional hydrodynamic model of the ind that was set up calibrated and validated for discharge water level and inundation extent the simulated time series of water levels and inundated extent were used to build a relationship between water levels and inundation area assuming the maximum water level and maximum flooded area are known finally stepwise regression was used to develop a linear relationship that forecasts maximum water levels and maximum inundation in the ind using streamflow and precipitation observed before september two months before the flood peak upstream of the ind 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the methodology the methodology adopted in this paper has three main parts 1 the development calibration and validation of a hydrodynamic model and the development of a relationship between simulated water levels at mopti and inundation extent in the ind conditioned on the knowledge of yearly maximum water levels h max and yearly maximum inundation extents i max 2 the development calibration and validation of a linear model that can forecast i max and h max given precipitation and streamflow measured on the upper niger river basin unb before the flood season 3 the combination of the relationships developed in points 1 and 2 to obtain a relationship between water levels at mopti and inundation extent in the ind that changes from year to year the inundation extent predicted by the new relationship is then compared to the predicted relationships developed by other studies and with the inundation extent obtained from modis satellite imagery an overview of the methodology is presented in fig 1 2 2 study area the study area is the inner niger delta ind in mali west africa the ind has relatively flat topography approximately 0 036 m km with a network of tributaries channels swamps and lakes providing vital habitats for fish agriculture and livestock and is home to many ethnic communities such as the fulani herders the bozo and somono and the marka bambara and sonrai in the literature the area of the inner delta varies from 36 000 km2 to 80 000 km2 liersch et al 2012 in our study the area spans from ke macina and djenne in the upstream reaches to korioume in the downstream reaches with an area of approximately 45 521 km2 we delineate the area in such a way that it encompasses all water bodies in the ind during high flood conditions the study area is shown in fig 2 2 3 development of a relationship between water levels and inundation extent 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model development the hydrodynamic model used in this study is similar to that of haque et al 2019 except that the modeled area was extended to match that of mariko 2003 zwarts et al 2005 mahé et al 2011 and ogilvie et al 2015 the modelling is done using telemac 2d hervouet 2007 a suite of finite element computer program that solves the shallow water equations over an unstructured grid using finite element method the modeled domain is shown in fig 3 the study uses elevation data from merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 merit dem is available at a resolution of three arc sec approximately 90 m and was derived from srtm nasa jpl 2013 and aw3d 30 m jaxa 2018 by removing multiple error components such as absolute bias stripe noise speckle noise and tree height bias yamazaki et al 2017 the bathymetry of niger and the bani river was approximated using hydraulic geometry equations proposed by leopold and maddock 1953 the procedure to derive the data can be found in haque et al 2019 the hydrodynamic model has a mesh with 347 324 nodes the smallest length of the elements is about 40 m and maximum length is about 834 m the time step was 120 s for all simulations the hydrodynamic model has eight open boundaries seven of which are inlets while one is an outlet fig 3 the inlet boundaries were fed with discharge time series data for each of the selected years the downstream boundary condition is the rating curve at korioume as in haque et al 2019 inflow at two of the inlet boundaries is the observed streamflow at ke macina and sofara inflows at the other boundaries were simulated with soil and water assessment tools swat and was used to provide flow at the inlet boundaries which were not gauged daily water level and discharge data for the period 1980 2016 were obtained from the mali hydrometric service direction nationale de l hydraulique dnh the climate data daily precipitation and temperature used for this model were obtained from the wfdei meteorological forcing data set watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim reanalysis watch water and global change provides a large number of data sets including metrological data used for hydrological or land surface models wfdei was derived using the same methodology as wfd watch forcing data applied to era interim data available from 1979 to 2012 weedon et al 2014 the model was developed for the upper niger basins unb calibration and validation were performed using streamflow from 14 hydrometric stations situated at the unb the calibration and validation performance can be found at haque et al 2019 and seidou 2019 the relative contribution of the inflow into the model from inlet 2 sofara inlet 5 inlet 6 and inlet 7 ke macina are estimated as 16 1 8 and 74 respectively inlets 1 3 and 4 have insignificant contributions 2 3 2 hydrodynamic model calibration and validation the 2001 2002 hydrological year was chosen for calibration of the hydrodynamic model while the 2008 2009 hydrological year was chosen for validation discharge and water levels at mopti akka and dire were compared using pearson s correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe s coefficient ns 2 3 3 performance assessment for inundation extent the performance of simulated inundation extents was evaluated with agreement fit measures under prediction measures and over prediction measures taylor 1977 and gallien et al 2014 and are given in the following equations agreement fit measures f a 1 f a e p e 0 e p e 0 where eo and ep are the observed and predicted flood extents respectively e p e 0 is the intersection between eo and ep e p e 0 is the union between eo and ep fa values of zero and unity correspond to no agreement and complete agreement respectively under prediction measures f u p 2 f u p e 0 e p e 0 e p e 0 f u p values of 0 and 1 correspond to no under prediction and complete under prediction respectively over prediction measures f o p 3 f o p e p e p e 0 e p e 0 where f o p values of 0 and 1 correspond to no over prediction and complete over prediction respectively once a satisfactory calibration was obtained the simulated inundation extent was validated using reference inundation extents derived from images table 4 captured by nasa s modis and landsat images two spectral indices were used to separate water pixels from non water pixels the indices are the modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 and the normalized difference moisture index ndmi wilson and sader 2002 mndwi and ndmi indexes are defined as follows 4 m n d w i g r e e n m i r g r e e n m i r 5 m d m i n i r m i r n i r m i r for modis images green nir and mir represent reflectance from band 4 545 nm 565 nm band 2 841 nm 876 nm and band 6 1628 nm 1652 nm respectively ogilvie et al 2015 used these indexes to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of floods across the ind from 2000 through 2011 we utilized values provided by ogilvie et al 2015 for the threshold value of ndmi and mndwi inundation extents were derived and then validated with the inundation extent previously obtained by zwarts et al 2005 the landsat images were the same as the ones used in zwarts et al 2005 2 3 4 simulation of water level and inundation extent time series simulations were carried out using a wide range of hydrological years that span from extremely dry years to extremely wet years the hydrological years selected to represent flooding from lowest to highest are 1984 1985 1990 1991 2002 2003 2001 2002 2008 2009 1994 1995 and span from 1980 2012 the peak discharge of the chosen years at mopti and dire is given in table 1 where peak discharge is presented chronologically from the lowest peak 1984 1985 to the highest peak 1994 1995 2 3 5 choosing a reference station for water levels in the ind mopti was chosen as the reference station in this paper the hysteresis phenomenon can be well described at this station previously the mopti gauging station was used to model annual floods in the ind mahé et al 2011 mariko 2003 ogilvie et al 2015 found a coherence between seasonal flood dynamics in the ind and the mopti flow regime while analyzing the behavior with satellite images 2 3 6 derivation of the relationship between water levels at the reference station and the inundation extent the method followed here is inspired by the dimensionless rating curve method introduced by mishra and seth 1996 and used in haque et al 2020 the time series of simulated inundation area and water level were transformed into their dimensionless form observed water levels for each year have been normalized using the following formula 6 h s c i h i h m i n h m a x h m i n where h s c is the normalized water level h is the observed water level h m i n is the minimum and h m a x is the maximum water level and i is the ith data of the respective year inundation for each year has been normalized using the following formula 7 i s c i i i i m i n i m a x i m i n where i s c is the normalized inundation i is the simulated inundation i m a x is the maximum inundation and i is the ith data of the respective year these normalized values can be used to obtain a time series of inundation extent with corresponding water levels by using the following equations 8 i i s c i i m a x i m i n i m i n 9 h h s c i h m a x h m i n h m i n where i and h are inundation and water level respectively 2 4 development of a forecasting model for maximum water levels and inundation extent before applying eqs 8 and 9 the yearly maximum water level and the maximum inundation extent must be known in this paper the maximum water level was forecasted using stepwise regression analysis using three types of predictors monthly discharge monthly maximum discharge and monthly average precipitation data at selected locations in the upper niger basin stepwise regression was used to screen the data sittichok et al 2014 gado djibo et al 2015 in each set of the predictors that closely match with the predictand then a linear model was established by regressing observed maximum water levels over the predictors selected after the screening 2 4 1 selection of the pools of potential predictors three types of potential predictors namely monthly average discharge monthly maximum discharge and monthly precipitation in the unb were chosen for the analysis monthly average discharge from january to september at kouroussa baro kankan koulikoro and ke macina for the period from 1990 to 2009 was used as the first pool of potential predictors maximum monthly discharge at the same stations and for the same years formed the second pool of predictors monthly average precipitation at each of the 32 sub basins of the swat model as shown in fig 4 formed the third pool of predictors only months between january and september from 1979 to 2009 were used for this analysis as floods in the ind region start in september these pools of predictors are denoted as 1 pool 1 q m s where m j a n f e b m a r s e p and s kouroussa baro kankan koulikoro kemacina 2 pool 2 q max m s where m j a n f e b m a r s e p and s kouroussa baro kankan koulikoro kemacina 3 pool 3 p c p m s u b where m j a n f e b m a r s e p and s u b 1 2 32 2 4 2 stepwise regression stepwise regression is a statistical procedure used to identify the best independent variables from several possible variables and provide the best model this approach is likely the best way to pick the correct predictors for the simulation wang et al 2009 in this study there are two main types of stepwise regression forward and backward selections forward stepwise regression starts with no independent variables then it adds variables one at a time and the new model is evaluated according to values with a specific criterion backward stepwise regression begins with all the independent variables in the model it then deletes one variable at a time using the same criteria as defined by the user in this paper the periods 1990 2001 and 2002 2009 were selected for the calibration and validation of pool 1 and pool 2 datasets respectively in pool 3 the periods 1979 1998 and 1999 2009 were chosen as the calibration and validation periods respectively it is to be noted here that we divided the total available data into two part for calibration and validation 60 of the available data is used for calibration and the other 40 of the data is utilized in the validation stepwise regression was applied to each of the three pools of predictors to get an equation for hmax the outputs of the three equations were then combined in one single linear equation and used in the forecasting model for determining hmax 2 5 performance evaluation the performance of the developed relationship between water level and inundation extent is compared to predictions using the formulas developed by zwarts et al 2005 mariko 2003 and mahé et al 2011 as described below zwarts et al 2005 developed the following formula 10 i 0 0005 x 3 0 215 x 2 28 807 x 194 36 r i s i n g p a r t 0 0002 x 3 0 0687 x 2 25 121 x 656 14 r e c e s s i o n p a r t where x is the water level gauge height cm at akka station for water level 511 cm and i is the inundation area in km2 the formula developed by mariko 2003 is presented below 11 i 234 07 e 0 0075 x r i s i n g p a r t 7523 ln x 32640 r e c e s s i o n p a r t w h e r e x is the average water level gauge height cm of mopti and akka station and i is the inundation area in km2 the equation developed by mahé et al 2011 is given below 12 i 225 45 e 0 0064 x where x is the water level gauge height cm at mopti station and i is the inundation area in km2 the predicted inundation extents were calculated using observed water levels in the delta and compared to inundation extents derived from modis images having a spatial resolution of 500 m a list of modis images used to validate the inundation curve is given in table 2 similarly to ogilvie et al 2015 we found that most images captured before september contained a significant fraction of clouds we have downloaded a series of modis images and only the images that have less noise were processed and presented in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrodynamic model calibration and validation the calibration and validation results are presented in the following sections 3 1 1 discharge and water levels the calibration and validation results of the model for discharge and water level are given in table 3 ns values are higher than 0 85 in all the simulations confirming there is good agreement between simulated and observed water levels and discharge although ns values were usually better during the calibration at mopti and akka ns values were higher at dire during validation for both discharge and water level 3 1 2 validation of the inundation extent simulated by the hydrodynamic model several days were selected for the calibration and validation of the inundation extent table 4 provides a short description of the images used in this study the inundation extent was evaluated using the percentage of agreement under prediction and over prediction measures as described in the previous section and presented in table 5 results show a good agreement between the simulated and observed inundation values with a range between 57 4 and 69 8 agreement for calibration and validation it is to be noted that the values of agreements found in this study are relatively low compared to previous studies where authors used high resolution topography e g bates and de roo 2000 horritt and bates 2001 but relatively high compared to the results from other data sparse areas such as amarnath et al 2015 who found 38 and sayama et al 2012 who found 61 for agreement visual representation of the observed and simulated inundation areas on 07 october 2008 are presented in fig 5 left and fig 5 middle a comparison of agreement overprediction and under prediction areas are shown in fig 5 right fig 5 show that disagreement between observed and simulated inundation extent mostly occurs in the northern part of the delta the discrepancies come from multiple reasons 1 the use of secondary source topographic data merit dem 2 the fact that the bathymetric data which was approximated using geometric relationships proposed by leopold and maddock 1953 3 the mesh size of the model in the northern part of the study area that is unable to capture all sand and channels dunes the existing mesh density is unsuitable for capturing the flood extent as the channel width in between the east west running dune is narrower than 300 m dickens et al 2018 which is lower than the smallest size of a mesh even if the mesh size was lower the lack of high resolution topography bathymetry will still be an issue 4 modis imagery was used to calibrate the model s inundation extent the fact that modis uses optical imagery and is low resolution 500 m also contributed to decrease the accuracy in the flood extent map 3 2 relationships between dimensionless water level and inundation during rising and receding waters the simulated inundation extents for years 1984 85 1990 91 1994 1995 2001 2002 2002 2003 2008 2009 and their corresponding water levels at mopti were processed to obtain dimensionless water levels and inundation values during rising and receding flood periods the two time series were normalized using eqs 6 and 7 two curves were fitted to represent the relationship between scaled water levels and scaled inundation extents one for the rising flood period and one for the receding period fig 6 table 6 while the fit is relatively good during the rising flood it degrades during the recession when the scaled water level is below 0 4 a possible reason is the error resulting from a dem inaccuracy which may have a proportionally greater influence on small floods the error is predominant in the northern part of the ind where complex channel networks along with east west running sand dunes affect the propagation and filling of reservoirs 3 3 forecasting the maximum water level at mopti the time series of predictors were split into a calibration period and a validation period the 1990 2001 and 2002 2009 periods were selected for the calibration and validation of pool 1 and pool 2 datasets in pool 3 the periods 1979 1998 and 1999 2009 were chosen for the calibration and validation periods respectively forward and backward stepwise regression was applied to the calibration period to determine the best set of predictors in each of the three pools the p value used to select a predictor was set to 0 03 while the p value used to drop a predictor was set to 0 1 table 7 shows the list of selected predictors for each pool the equations of the linear regression models lm obtained for each dataset pool are as follows pool 1 13 l m 1 h m a x f 264 0822 0 0005 q a u g k a n k a n 0 001223 q s e p k e m a c i n a pool 2 14 l m

p j u l 21 0 0027352 p c p a u g 13 the comparison between modeled from pools 1 3 and observed maximum water levels at mopti is shown in fig 7 the ns resp r2 values for the relationships obtained from pools 1 2 and 3 are 0 818 resp 0 8186 0 831 resp 0 8355 and 0 887 resp 0 8966 respectively during the calibration period versus 0 66 resp 0 8366 0 868 resp 0 919 and 0 493 resp 0 5212 during the validation period both ns and r2 values were high for both calibration and validation periods except for pool 3 during the validation period the outputs of the three linear models lm1 lm2 and lm3 were combined through multiple linear regression techniques to get eq 16 it is to be noted that keeping lm3 in the regression adds the need for precipitation data and can make the relationship complex for the user hence the linear models lm1 and lm2 are combined to get eq 17 the user can either choose eq 16 or eq 17 to estimate the maximum water level at mopti using the output of lm1 lm2 and lm3 16 h m a x f 48 4807 0 49133 l m 1 0 32663 l m 2 0 36391 l m 3 using the outputs of lm1 and lm2 17 h m a x f 18 2481 0 510579 l m 1 0 557875 l m 2 where h m a x f is the forecasted maximum water level at mopti in mign ign datum of institut géographique national a comparison between the observed and estimated maximum water level using eq 16 at mopti is shown in fig 8 high r2 and ns values during both calibration and validation imply the equation can be used for future applications the maximum inundation extent is needed to solve eq 8 a linear model representing the relationship between maximum simulated water level h m a x s at mopti and the maximum simulated inundation i m a x s is fitted using simulated time series the relationship is assumed to apply to observed maximum water level h m a x o and observed maximum inundation i m a x o although both the equations eq 16 and eq 17 can be used to calculate h m a x s here we used eq 16 the relationship between maximum water levels and maximum inundation is shown below 18 i m a x s 7376 862 h m a x s 1952780 f i t t e d i m a x o 7376 862 h m a x o 1952780 a s s u m e d once the maximum water level at mopti is known the maximum inundation value can be determined by using eq 18 using the hmax o of 2010 the maximum inundation from the model eq 18 is 17 359 km2 the modis image taken on 09 nov 01 nov 24 oct and 16 oct were analyzed and the highest inundation extent was found to be 16 850 on nov 01 2010 on the other hand ogilvie et al 2015 found the value as about 20 000 km2 there is a difference between our estimate and that of and ogilvie et al 2015 and this is due to the fact that the study area is a bit bigger for the latter case 3 4 validation of the inundation extent function the developed relationship between water levels at mopti and the inundation extent was validated using data from 2010 2011 and 2005 2006 the 2010 2011 hydrological year was a relatively wet year while 2005 2006 was a relatively dry year the maximum water level at mopti and the corresponding maximum inundation were forecasted using eqs 16 and 18 respectively eqs 8 and 9 were then applied to get the relationship between water level and inundation given maximum water level at mopti and maximum inundation the developed curve captures that dynamic relationship and estimate flood extent in real time from september to the end of the flood the predicted inundation extents were compared to the predictions using the equations proposed by mahé et al 2011 zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 and are shown in fig 9 results show that mariko 2003 and zwarts et al 2005 underestimate the inundation extent during the period of receding water upper half in the wet year 2010 2011 in recession phase in wet years zwarts et al 2005 seems to underestimate only at very low values while mariko 2003 overestimates the inundation in dry year 2005 2006 both zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 overestimate at recession phase the quantitative assessment of the validation results is given in table 8 the method developed in this paper is also closer to the reference inundation obtained from modis images in the rising and receding water period another advantage of the method proposed in this paper is that the maximum inundation extent is explicitly forecasted while it is unknown when one uses the formulas such as eq 10 and eq 11 derived by zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 respectively the results in table 8 shows that the method presented here performs better in all the cases except for mahé et al 2011 at rising phase of the 2010 2011 it is to be noted that rmse and ns values are not calculated during recession phase for mahé et al 2011 because their method did not estimate the inundation properly and could not reproduce the hysteresis during recession phase this paper presents a simple method to explicitly forecast the maximum flooded area with a reasonable accuracy using a readily available variable water level at mopti the knowledge of such relationship is practical in a way that it can be linked to the ecosystem productivity in the ind as described by welcomme 1986a b lae 1992a b and zwarts et al 2005 that the annual production of fish in ind is related to high flood the production of other resources such as rice and livestock also strongly linked to the highest flood surface under favorable flood dynamics the outcome of the present study can be used by decision makers to know how far a flood is likely to spread and decision makers can accordingly guide the upstream dam operations in order to release water and hence maximize production of the natural resources of the delta further study is recommended on the identification of the zones for rice and forage land based on flood depth and timing the authors would like to acknowledge the limitations of the study resulting from the use of 1 low resolution modis data for calibration and validation of inundation extent 2 the low resolution mesh at the northern part of the delta and 3 the use of secondary source elevation data from merit dem despite the limitations however the proposed approach addresses one drawback of water levels flood extent relationships that are specific to the rising or recession periods such as eq 10 and eq 11 derived by zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 a user of such formulas would not know when to switch from using the equation that represents the rising flood period to the equations that describe the receding period the dynamic nature of the developed water level flooded area relationship allows it to adapt to the hydraulicity of the year this is an improvement over published water level flooded area relationships that are static hence are less flexible finally the deployment and daily use of a full 2d hydrodynamic model has limited chances of success in mali an underdeveloped country because of the lack of human and technological resources a simple approach such as the one proposed in this paper is more accessible and hence more likely to have an impact on the livelihood of local populations 4 conclusions a time varying relationship between water levels at mopti station and inundation extent in the ind was developed in this paper simulated time series of water levels and inundation extents were first generated using a two dimensional hydrodynamic model of the ind that was set up calibrated and validated for discharge water level and inundation extent the simulated time series of water levels and inundated areas were used to build a relationship between water levels and inundation areas given the maximum water level and maximum flooded area finally stepwise regression was used to develop a non stationary relationship that can forecast maximum water levels and maximum inundation in the ind using observed streamflow and precipitation upstream of the ind results show that in addition to explicitly forecasting the maximum inundation extent ahead of time the inundation extent predicted with the new method shows improvement over the existing formulas by mahé et al 2011 zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 the main limitations of the study are 1 the use of low resolution modis data for calibration and validation of inundation extent 2 the low resolution mesh at the northern part of the delta and 3 the use of secondary source elevation data from merit dem the use of high resolution images such as sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 and high resolution improved topography can improve the result nevertheless this study can help provide valuable information to anticipate resource availability and optimize socio economic activities in the ind credit authorship contribution statement md mominul haque

8345,study region the inner niger delta ind mali west africa is a vast floodplain with abundant natural resources that supports the livelihood of about two million people ecosystem services in the ind are strongly affected by flood dynamics study focus an accessible yet accurate flood extent estimation method is crucial for the management of natural resources in the ind the relationships between water levels and inundation extents are examined for both the rising and receding flood periods using the outputs of a 2d hydrodynamic model inundation extents derived from modis images were used to validate the result new hydrological insight for the region the relationship between water levels and flooded areas in the ind changes from year to year due to the amplitude of the incoming flood equations were developed to capture that dynamic relationship and estimate flood extent in real time from september to the end of flood using water levels at mopti the relationship is dependent on the maximum water level at mopti and maximum flooded area which was forecasted using streamflow and precipitation in the upper niger basin results show that in addition to forecasting the maximum inundation ahead of time the inundation predicted with the method shows improvement over the existing formulas by mahé et al 2011 zwart et al 2005 and mariko 2003 keywords inundation extent forecasting hydrodynamic model inner niger delta mali 1 introduction floodplains are dynamic systems that are periodically flooded creating distinctive habitats through the exchange of water sediment and organisms tockner and stanford 2002 opperman et al 2010 flood dynamics provide numerous advantages that help the development of aquatic ecosystems and benefit human communities rrp 2016 the inner niger delta ind in mali west africa is one of the largest floodplains in the world and is a vast natural resource that attracts many people to live in and around it zwarts et al 2005 the ind is a particular floodplain as it receives a huge amount of water in sahelian region through niger river which is responsible for the development of remarkable biodiversity for such a semi arid area recognized as a ramsar site by un and iucn methods for estimating the inundation area can roughly be divided into three types methods solely based on digital elevation models dems methods based on hydrodynamic model simulations and method based on remote sensing imagery of flooded areas chen et al 2019 methods based on dems are appropriate for small and still water bodies for which high resolution bathymetry is available they do not apply to water bodies with fast moving water or large lakes where the water surface cannot be assumed to be horizontal methods based on hydrodynamic simulations require the availability of a calibrated hydrodynamic model the development and operation of a hydrodynamic model require technical skills computational resources and real time or near real time access to key observations for this reason despite the availability of a few hydrodynamic models of the ind e g neal et al 2012 haque et al 2019 day to day decision making in the ind rely on observations and simple tools such as multivariate linear models for water level forecasting zwarts 2010 remote sensing is a widely used technique for inundation extent estimation bates 2012 bates et al 1997 it is instrumental in remote regions and developing countries domeneghetti et al 2019 where data collection is challenging for instance sakamoto et al 2007 used modis image to detect temporal changes of the annual flooding of the mekong river laos cambodia thailand uddin et al 2019 used sentinel 1 for flood mapping study of bangladesh anusha and bharathi 2019 used sentinel 1 for flood detection and mapping study of the river reach of rapti and ghaghara river in india several authors used remotely sensed inundation extents to build a relationship between water level and the area flooded such as ogilvie et al 2015 mahé et al 2013 2011 mahé et al 2009 zwarts et al 2005 mariko et al 2003 and mariko 2003 ogilvie et al 2015 used a total of 526 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images from july 2000 to december 2011 to derive a relationship between inundation and water level in mopti mali mahé et al 2011 used noaa avhrr images from 1990 to 2000 to map the flooded areas and link them to water heights at mopti s gauge station zwarts et al 2005 derived a correlation between flooded areas and akka s water stage level by analyzing 24 landsat images spread over several years mariko 2003 derived inundation extent using noaa avhrr images an inundation function a relationship between water levels and flooded areas was developed using the average water height at mopti and akka gauges however the use of remote sensing is subject to constraints such as unavailable or poor quality images unavailability of images at the moment of the maximum extension of flood the presence of clouds noisy images and spectral confusion between water and non water surfaces bates et al 1997 found that the extrapolation of satellite derived inundation extents to estimate the area of inundation during peak floods was problematic clement et al 2018 had the same problem on capturing the maximum extent and they stated that there is no method to accurately extrapolate the data to determine the timing and magnitude of the peak flood the same conclusion can be drawn about the empirical equations proposed by zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 to estimate the inundation extent from measured water levels in the ind while their equation that relates maximum water levels to maximum inundation works fairly well the ones relating water level to inundation extent for the whole duration of the floods were less accurate another major limitation in the existing relationship between water levels at a reference station and the inundation area is that these equations are not able to accurately describe hysteresis behavior mahé et al 2011 zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 stressed this matter in their studies but were not able to provide a solution to this problem due to an insufficient amount of data on inundation extent ogilvie et al 2015 was partially successful in capturing the hysteresis as they used 526 modis images of the area mahe et al 2009 described a special functioning of ind that the southern and northern part of the delta exhibit variable flood dynamics while the rate of change of inundation extent is same in the southern part with respect to water height at mopti however northern part shows greater capacity of inundation in lateral direction due to the connectivity of lakes and river during high stage of water this means that using a linear regression between water height at gauging stations and inundation extent has limitations as the linear function cannot describe the non linearity of the relationship between inundation extension and water level according to the location north or south of the delta to overcome the situation a 2d hydrodynamic model is setup using telemac 2d calibration and validation is done to simulate the inundation time series and then used to obtain an improved relationship between water levels and inundation extent in the ind several modis images were used to validate the results the main objectives of this paper were to develop a relationship between water levels at one reference station and predict the inundation extent in the ind that can a have year to year variations and b be used in real time simulated time series of water levels and inundation extents were generated using a two dimensional hydrodynamic model of the ind that was set up calibrated and validated for discharge water level and inundation extent the simulated time series of water levels and inundated extent were used to build a relationship between water levels and inundation area assuming the maximum water level and maximum flooded area are known finally stepwise regression was used to develop a linear relationship that forecasts maximum water levels and maximum inundation in the ind using streamflow and precipitation observed before september two months before the flood peak upstream of the ind 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the methodology the methodology adopted in this paper has three main parts 1 the development calibration and validation of a hydrodynamic model and the development of a relationship between simulated water levels at mopti and inundation extent in the ind conditioned on the knowledge of yearly maximum water levels h max and yearly maximum inundation extents i max 2 the development calibration and validation of a linear model that can forecast i max and h max given precipitation and streamflow measured on the upper niger river basin unb before the flood season 3 the combination of the relationships developed in points 1 and 2 to obtain a relationship between water levels at mopti and inundation extent in the ind that changes from year to year the inundation extent predicted by the new relationship is then compared to the predicted relationships developed by other studies and with the inundation extent obtained from modis satellite imagery an overview of the methodology is presented in fig 1 2 2 study area the study area is the inner niger delta ind in mali west africa the ind has relatively flat topography approximately 0 036 m km with a network of tributaries channels swamps and lakes providing vital habitats for fish agriculture and livestock and is home to many ethnic communities such as the fulani herders the bozo and somono and the marka bambara and sonrai in the literature the area of the inner delta varies from 36 000 km2 to 80 000 km2 liersch et al 2012 in our study the area spans from ke macina and djenne in the upstream reaches to korioume in the downstream reaches with an area of approximately 45 521 km2 we delineate the area in such a way that it encompasses all water bodies in the ind during high flood conditions the study area is shown in fig 2 2 3 development of a relationship between water levels and inundation extent 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model development the hydrodynamic model used in this study is similar to that of haque et al 2019 except that the modeled area was extended to match that of mariko 2003 zwarts et al 2005 mahé et al 2011 and ogilvie et al 2015 the modelling is done using telemac 2d hervouet 2007 a suite of finite element computer program that solves the shallow water equations over an unstructured grid using finite element method the modeled domain is shown in fig 3 the study uses elevation data from merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 merit dem is available at a resolution of three arc sec approximately 90 m and was derived from srtm nasa jpl 2013 and aw3d 30 m jaxa 2018 by removing multiple error components such as absolute bias stripe noise speckle noise and tree height bias yamazaki et al 2017 the bathymetry of niger and the bani river was approximated using hydraulic geometry equations proposed by leopold and maddock 1953 the procedure to derive the data can be found in haque et al 2019 the hydrodynamic model has a mesh with 347 324 nodes the smallest length of the elements is about 40 m and maximum length is about 834 m the time step was 120 s for all simulations the hydrodynamic model has eight open boundaries seven of which are inlets while one is an outlet fig 3 the inlet boundaries were fed with discharge time series data for each of the selected years the downstream boundary condition is the rating curve at korioume as in haque et al 2019 inflow at two of the inlet boundaries is the observed streamflow at ke macina and sofara inflows at the other boundaries were simulated with soil and water assessment tools swat and was used to provide flow at the inlet boundaries which were not gauged daily water level and discharge data for the period 1980 2016 were obtained from the mali hydrometric service direction nationale de l hydraulique dnh the climate data daily precipitation and temperature used for this model were obtained from the wfdei meteorological forcing data set watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim reanalysis watch water and global change provides a large number of data sets including metrological data used for hydrological or land surface models wfdei was derived using the same methodology as wfd watch forcing data applied to era interim data available from 1979 to 2012 weedon et al 2014 the model was developed for the upper niger basins unb calibration and validation were performed using streamflow from 14 hydrometric stations situated at the unb the calibration and validation performance can be found at haque et al 2019 and seidou 2019 the relative contribution of the inflow into the model from inlet 2 sofara inlet 5 inlet 6 and inlet 7 ke macina are estimated as 16 1 8 and 74 respectively inlets 1 3 and 4 have insignificant contributions 2 3 2 hydrodynamic model calibration and validation the 2001 2002 hydrological year was chosen for calibration of the hydrodynamic model while the 2008 2009 hydrological year was chosen for validation discharge and water levels at mopti akka and dire were compared using pearson s correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe s coefficient ns 2 3 3 performance assessment for inundation extent the performance of simulated inundation extents was evaluated with agreement fit measures under prediction measures and over prediction measures taylor 1977 and gallien et al 2014 and are given in the following equations agreement fit measures f a 1 f a e p e 0 e p e 0 where eo and ep are the observed and predicted flood extents respectively e p e 0 is the intersection between eo and ep e p e 0 is the union between eo and ep fa values of zero and unity correspond to no agreement and complete agreement respectively under prediction measures f u p 2 f u p e 0 e p e 0 e p e 0 f u p values of 0 and 1 correspond to no under prediction and complete under prediction respectively over prediction measures f o p 3 f o p e p e p e 0 e p e 0 where f o p values of 0 and 1 correspond to no over prediction and complete over prediction respectively once a satisfactory calibration was obtained the simulated inundation extent was validated using reference inundation extents derived from images table 4 captured by nasa s modis and landsat images two spectral indices were used to separate water pixels from non water pixels the indices are the modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 and the normalized difference moisture index ndmi wilson and sader 2002 mndwi and ndmi indexes are defined as follows 4 m n d w i g r e e n m i r g r e e n m i r 5 m d m i n i r m i r n i r m i r for modis images green nir and mir represent reflectance from band 4 545 nm 565 nm band 2 841 nm 876 nm and band 6 1628 nm 1652 nm respectively ogilvie et al 2015 used these indexes to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of floods across the ind from 2000 through 2011 we utilized values provided by ogilvie et al 2015 for the threshold value of ndmi and mndwi inundation extents were derived and then validated with the inundation extent previously obtained by zwarts et al 2005 the landsat images were the same as the ones used in zwarts et al 2005 2 3 4 simulation of water level and inundation extent time series simulations were carried out using a wide range of hydrological years that span from extremely dry years to extremely wet years the hydrological years selected to represent flooding from lowest to highest are 1984 1985 1990 1991 2002 2003 2001 2002 2008 2009 1994 1995 and span from 1980 2012 the peak discharge of the chosen years at mopti and dire is given in table 1 where peak discharge is presented chronologically from the lowest peak 1984 1985 to the highest peak 1994 1995 2 3 5 choosing a reference station for water levels in the ind mopti was chosen as the reference station in this paper the hysteresis phenomenon can be well described at this station previously the mopti gauging station was used to model annual floods in the ind mahé et al 2011 mariko 2003 ogilvie et al 2015 found a coherence between seasonal flood dynamics in the ind and the mopti flow regime while analyzing the behavior with satellite images 2 3 6 derivation of the relationship between water levels at the reference station and the inundation extent the method followed here is inspired by the dimensionless rating curve method introduced by mishra and seth 1996 and used in haque et al 2020 the time series of simulated inundation area and water level were transformed into their dimensionless form observed water levels for each year have been normalized using the following formula 6 h s c i h i h m i n h m a x h m i n where h s c is the normalized water level h is the observed water level h m i n is the minimum and h m a x is the maximum water level and i is the ith data of the respective year inundation for each year has been normalized using the following formula 7 i s c i i i i m i n i m a x i m i n where i s c is the normalized inundation i is the simulated inundation i m a x is the maximum inundation and i is the ith data of the respective year these normalized values can be used to obtain a time series of inundation extent with corresponding water levels by using the following equations 8 i i s c i i m a x i m i n i m i n 9 h h s c i h m a x h m i n h m i n where i and h are inundation and water level respectively 2 4 development of a forecasting model for maximum water levels and inundation extent before applying eqs 8 and 9 the yearly maximum water level and the maximum inundation extent must be known in this paper the maximum water level was forecasted using stepwise regression analysis using three types of predictors monthly discharge monthly maximum discharge and monthly average precipitation data at selected locations in the upper niger basin stepwise regression was used to screen the data sittichok et al 2014 gado djibo et al 2015 in each set of the predictors that closely match with the predictand then a linear model was established by regressing observed maximum water levels over the predictors selected after the screening 2 4 1 selection of the pools of potential predictors three types of potential predictors namely monthly average discharge monthly maximum discharge and monthly precipitation in the unb were chosen for the analysis monthly average discharge from january to september at kouroussa baro kankan koulikoro and ke macina for the period from 1990 to 2009 was used as the first pool of potential predictors maximum monthly discharge at the same stations and for the same years formed the second pool of predictors monthly average precipitation at each of the 32 sub basins of the swat model as shown in fig 4 formed the third pool of predictors only months between january and september from 1979 to 2009 were used for this analysis as floods in the ind region start in september these pools of predictors are denoted as 1 pool 1 q m s where m j a n f e b m a r s e p and s kouroussa baro kankan koulikoro kemacina 2 pool 2 q max m s where m j a n f e b m a r s e p and s kouroussa baro kankan koulikoro kemacina 3 pool 3 p c p m s u b where m j a n f e b m a r s e p and s u b 1 2 32 2 4 2 stepwise regression stepwise regression is a statistical procedure used to identify the best independent variables from several possible variables and provide the best model this approach is likely the best way to pick the correct predictors for the simulation wang et al 2009 in this study there are two main types of stepwise regression forward and backward selections forward stepwise regression starts with no independent variables then it adds variables one at a time and the new model is evaluated according to values with a specific criterion backward stepwise regression begins with all the independent variables in the model it then deletes one variable at a time using the same criteria as defined by the user in this paper the periods 1990 2001 and 2002 2009 were selected for the calibration and validation of pool 1 and pool 2 datasets respectively in pool 3 the periods 1979 1998 and 1999 2009 were chosen as the calibration and validation periods respectively it is to be noted here that we divided the total available data into two part for calibration and validation 60 of the available data is used for calibration and the other 40 of the data is utilized in the validation stepwise regression was applied to each of the three pools of predictors to get an equation for hmax the outputs of the three equations were then combined in one single linear equation and used in the forecasting model for determining hmax 2 5 performance evaluation the performance of the developed relationship between water level and inundation extent is compared to predictions using the formulas developed by zwarts et al 2005 mariko 2003 and mahé et al 2011 as described below zwarts et al 2005 developed the following formula 10 i 0 0005 x 3 0 215 x 2 28 807 x 194 36 r i s i n g p a r t 0 0002 x 3 0 0687 x 2 25 121 x 656 14 r e c e s s i o n p a r t where x is the water level gauge height cm at akka station for water level 511 cm and i is the inundation area in km2 the formula developed by mariko 2003 is presented below 11 i 234 07 e 0 0075 x r i s i n g p a r t 7523 ln x 32640 r e c e s s i o n p a r t w h e r e x is the average water level gauge height cm of mopti and akka station and i is the inundation area in km2 the equation developed by mahé et al 2011 is given below 12 i 225 45 e 0 0064 x where x is the water level gauge height cm at mopti station and i is the inundation area in km2 the predicted inundation extents were calculated using observed water levels in the delta and compared to inundation extents derived from modis images having a spatial resolution of 500 m a list of modis images used to validate the inundation curve is given in table 2 similarly to ogilvie et al 2015 we found that most images captured before september contained a significant fraction of clouds we have downloaded a series of modis images and only the images that have less noise were processed and presented in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrodynamic model calibration and validation the calibration and validation results are presented in the following sections 3 1 1 discharge and water levels the calibration and validation results of the model for discharge and water level are given in table 3 ns values are higher than 0 85 in all the simulations confirming there is good agreement between simulated and observed water levels and discharge although ns values were usually better during the calibration at mopti and akka ns values were higher at dire during validation for both discharge and water level 3 1 2 validation of the inundation extent simulated by the hydrodynamic model several days were selected for the calibration and validation of the inundation extent table 4 provides a short description of the images used in this study the inundation extent was evaluated using the percentage of agreement under prediction and over prediction measures as described in the previous section and presented in table 5 results show a good agreement between the simulated and observed inundation values with a range between 57 4 and 69 8 agreement for calibration and validation it is to be noted that the values of agreements found in this study are relatively low compared to previous studies where authors used high resolution topography e g bates and de roo 2000 horritt and bates 2001 but relatively high compared to the results from other data sparse areas such as amarnath et al 2015 who found 38 and sayama et al 2012 who found 61 for agreement visual representation of the observed and simulated inundation areas on 07 october 2008 are presented in fig 5 left and fig 5 middle a comparison of agreement overprediction and under prediction areas are shown in fig 5 right fig 5 show that disagreement between observed and simulated inundation extent mostly occurs in the northern part of the delta the discrepancies come from multiple reasons 1 the use of secondary source topographic data merit dem 2 the fact that the bathymetric data which was approximated using geometric relationships proposed by leopold and maddock 1953 3 the mesh size of the model in the northern part of the study area that is unable to capture all sand and channels dunes the existing mesh density is unsuitable for capturing the flood extent as the channel width in between the east west running dune is narrower than 300 m dickens et al 2018 which is lower than the smallest size of a mesh even if the mesh size was lower the lack of high resolution topography bathymetry will still be an issue 4 modis imagery was used to calibrate the model s inundation extent the fact that modis uses optical imagery and is low resolution 500 m also contributed to decrease the accuracy in the flood extent map 3 2 relationships between dimensionless water level and inundation during rising and receding waters the simulated inundation extents for years 1984 85 1990 91 1994 1995 2001 2002 2002 2003 2008 2009 and their corresponding water levels at mopti were processed to obtain dimensionless water levels and inundation values during rising and receding flood periods the two time series were normalized using eqs 6 and 7 two curves were fitted to represent the relationship between scaled water levels and scaled inundation extents one for the rising flood period and one for the receding period fig 6 table 6 while the fit is relatively good during the rising flood it degrades during the recession when the scaled water level is below 0 4 a possible reason is the error resulting from a dem inaccuracy which may have a proportionally greater influence on small floods the error is predominant in the northern part of the ind where complex channel networks along with east west running sand dunes affect the propagation and filling of reservoirs 3 3 forecasting the maximum water level at mopti the time series of predictors were split into a calibration period and a validation period the 1990 2001 and 2002 2009 periods were selected for the calibration and validation of pool 1 and pool 2 datasets in pool 3 the periods 1979 1998 and 1999 2009 were chosen for the calibration and validation periods respectively forward and backward stepwise regression was applied to the calibration period to determine the best set of predictors in each of the three pools the p value used to select a predictor was set to 0 03 while the p value used to drop a predictor was set to 0 1 table 7 shows the list of selected predictors for each pool the equations of the linear regression models lm obtained for each dataset pool are as follows pool 1 13 l m 1 h m a x f 264 0822 0 0005 q a u g k a n k a n 0 001223 q s e p k e m a c i n a pool 2 14 l m

p j u l 21 0 0027352 p c p a u g 13 the comparison between modeled from pools 1 3 and observed maximum water levels at mopti is shown in fig 7 the ns resp r2 values for the relationships obtained from pools 1 2 and 3 are 0 818 resp 0 8186 0 831 resp 0 8355 and 0 887 resp 0 8966 respectively during the calibration period versus 0 66 resp 0 8366 0 868 resp 0 919 and 0 493 resp 0 5212 during the validation period both ns and r2 values were high for both calibration and validation periods except for pool 3 during the validation period the outputs of the three linear models lm1 lm2 and lm3 were combined through multiple linear regression techniques to get eq 16 it is to be noted that keeping lm3 in the regression adds the need for precipitation data and can make the relationship complex for the user hence the linear models lm1 and lm2 are combined to get eq 17 the user can either choose eq 16 or eq 17 to estimate the maximum water level at mopti using the output of lm1 lm2 and lm3 16 h m a x f 48 4807 0 49133 l m 1 0 32663 l m 2 0 36391 l m 3 using the outputs of lm1 and lm2 17 h m a x f 18 2481 0 510579 l m 1 0 557875 l m 2 where h m a x f is the forecasted maximum water level at mopti in mign ign datum of institut géographique national a comparison between the observed and estimated maximum water level using eq 16 at mopti is shown in fig 8 high r2 and ns values during both calibration and validation imply the equation can be used for future applications the maximum inundation extent is needed to solve eq 8 a linear model representing the relationship between maximum simulated water level h m a x s at mopti and the maximum simulated inundation i m a x s is fitted using simulated time series the relationship is assumed to apply to observed maximum water level h m a x o and observed maximum inundation i m a x o although both the equations eq 16 and eq 17 can be used to calculate h m a x s here we used eq 16 the relationship between maximum water levels and maximum inundation is shown below 18 i m a x s 7376 862 h m a x s 1952780 f i t t e d i m a x o 7376 862 h m a x o 1952780 a s s u m e d once the maximum water level at mopti is known the maximum inundation value can be determined by using eq 18 using the hmax o of 2010 the maximum inundation from the model eq 18 is 17 359 km2 the modis image taken on 09 nov 01 nov 24 oct and 16 oct were analyzed and the highest inundation extent was found to be 16 850 on nov 01 2010 on the other hand ogilvie et al 2015 found the value as about 20 000 km2 there is a difference between our estimate and that of and ogilvie et al 2015 and this is due to the fact that the study area is a bit bigger for the latter case 3 4 validation of the inundation extent function the developed relationship between water levels at mopti and the inundation extent was validated using data from 2010 2011 and 2005 2006 the 2010 2011 hydrological year was a relatively wet year while 2005 2006 was a relatively dry year the maximum water level at mopti and the corresponding maximum inundation were forecasted using eqs 16 and 18 respectively eqs 8 and 9 were then applied to get the relationship between water level and inundation given maximum water level at mopti and maximum inundation the developed curve captures that dynamic relationship and estimate flood extent in real time from september to the end of the flood the predicted inundation extents were compared to the predictions using the equations proposed by mahé et al 2011 zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 and are shown in fig 9 results show that mariko 2003 and zwarts et al 2005 underestimate the inundation extent during the period of receding water upper half in the wet year 2010 2011 in recession phase in wet years zwarts et al 2005 seems to underestimate only at very low values while mariko 2003 overestimates the inundation in dry year 2005 2006 both zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 overestimate at recession phase the quantitative assessment of the validation results is given in table 8 the method developed in this paper is also closer to the reference inundation obtained from modis images in the rising and receding water period another advantage of the method proposed in this paper is that the maximum inundation extent is explicitly forecasted while it is unknown when one uses the formulas such as eq 10 and eq 11 derived by zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 respectively the results in table 8 shows that the method presented here performs better in all the cases except for mahé et al 2011 at rising phase of the 2010 2011 it is to be noted that rmse and ns values are not calculated during recession phase for mahé et al 2011 because their method did not estimate the inundation properly and could not reproduce the hysteresis during recession phase this paper presents a simple method to explicitly forecast the maximum flooded area with a reasonable accuracy using a readily available variable water level at mopti the knowledge of such relationship is practical in a way that it can be linked to the ecosystem productivity in the ind as described by welcomme 1986a b lae 1992a b and zwarts et al 2005 that the annual production of fish in ind is related to high flood the production of other resources such as rice and livestock also strongly linked to the highest flood surface under favorable flood dynamics the outcome of the present study can be used by decision makers to know how far a flood is likely to spread and decision makers can accordingly guide the upstream dam operations in order to release water and hence maximize production of the natural resources of the delta further study is recommended on the identification of the zones for rice and forage land based on flood depth and timing the authors would like to acknowledge the limitations of the study resulting from the use of 1 low resolution modis data for calibration and validation of inundation extent 2 the low resolution mesh at the northern part of the delta and 3 the use of secondary source elevation data from merit dem despite the limitations however the proposed approach addresses one drawback of water levels flood extent relationships that are specific to the rising or recession periods such as eq 10 and eq 11 derived by zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 a user of such formulas would not know when to switch from using the equation that represents the rising flood period to the equations that describe the receding period the dynamic nature of the developed water level flooded area relationship allows it to adapt to the hydraulicity of the year this is an improvement over published water level flooded area relationships that are static hence are less flexible finally the deployment and daily use of a full 2d hydrodynamic model has limited chances of success in mali an underdeveloped country because of the lack of human and technological resources a simple approach such as the one proposed in this paper is more accessible and hence more likely to have an impact on the livelihood of local populations 4 conclusions a time varying relationship between water levels at mopti station and inundation extent in the ind was developed in this paper simulated time series of water levels and inundation extents were first generated using a two dimensional hydrodynamic model of the ind that was set up calibrated and validated for discharge water level and inundation extent the simulated time series of water levels and inundated areas were used to build a relationship between water levels and inundation areas given the maximum water level and maximum flooded area finally stepwise regression was used to develop a non stationary relationship that can forecast maximum water levels and maximum inundation in the ind using observed streamflow and precipitation upstream of the ind results show that in addition to explicitly forecasting the maximum inundation extent ahead of time the inundation extent predicted with the new method shows improvement over the existing formulas by mahé et al 2011 zwarts et al 2005 and mariko 2003 the main limitations of the study are 1 the use of low resolution modis data for calibration and validation of inundation extent 2 the low resolution mesh at the northern part of the delta and 3 the use of secondary source elevation data from merit dem the use of high resolution images such as sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 and high resolution improved topography can improve the result nevertheless this study can help provide valuable information to anticipate resource availability and optimize socio economic activities in the ind credit authorship contribution statement md mominul haque

8346,study region this study considers the khando river a tributary of koshi river in eastern nepal study focus to quantify the hazard and vulnerabilities across one of the frequently flooding catchments i e khando river we conducted flood hazard assessment for 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods we coupled flood hazard analysis with vulnerability analysis of the most dominant construction system along the river channel i e wattle and daub houses based on the measured inundation depths we created vulnerability and fragility functions the flood hazard maps damage mechanisms due to the 2017 flood and vulnerability as well as fragility curves are reported in this paper new hydrological insights for the region the flood hazard analysis highlighted that the 2017 flood was equivalent to 20 years return period flood flood hazard analysis shows that the variation in the maximum inundation depth is not so wide between 20 and 200 years return periods for the khando river catchment flood vulnerability analysis of residential houses along the riverbank highlighted that the wattle and daub construction system is highly vulnerable even for 20 years return period flood thus the floods equivalent to 50 100 and 200 years may have detrimental consequences in the future keywords flood hazard mapping flood vulnerability flood fragility function khando river residential building 1 introduction flood overflow of water beyond the river channel is one of the major natural hazards that causes enormous loss of lives and properties worldwide every year floods become more severe once they pass through built up areas and arable lands as in the case of 1993 flood in nepal 2008 koshi flood in eastern nepal government of nepal 2009 and the 2017 central nepal water flood gautam and dong 2018 several historical flood events show that the major losses are incurred across the river and rivulet channels for instance the 1993 floods across nepal 2002 central nepal flood 2008 koshi river flood 2008 western nepal flood 2012 seti river flood 2017 flood across nepal among others reflected that the major losses had occurred along the riverbanks the 1993 flood in nepal caused 1170 fatalities and damaged some 32 765 buildings government of nepal 2009 similarly the 2008 koshi flood displaced around 65 000 people in saptari and sunsari in eastern nepal government of nepal 2009 the 2017 flood in nepal destroyed 41 625 and damaged 150 510 houses leading to an overall loss of us 187 9 million government of nepal 2017 the post flood recovery needs assessment conducted after the 2017 flood events in nepal depicted that 53 3 of total recovery needs was required for housing sector only government of nepal 2017 the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm recorded the highest ever mean rainfall of 1800 mm substantially exceeding the average of 1200 mm in 2017 government of nepal 2017 a total of 7141 families were affected along with the total economic loss of us 7 8 million during 2015 and 2016 floods in nepal government of nepal 2020 most of the flood events worldwide have depicted that the impacts of floods on built environment would be disastrous see e g government of nepal 2009 guzzetti et al 2005 marchi et al 2010 cao et al 2016 santo et al 2016 tsakiris 2014 fuchs et al 2007 santos et al 2015 gautam and dong 2018 among others as losses are inevitable due to floods many researchers have considered flood hazard mapping as one of the most efficient tools for prevention to mitigation in recent decades many researchers have performed flood hazard mapping in various parts of the world as reported elsewhere see e g hagen et al 2010 di salvo et al 2018 nharo et al 2019 popa et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 ntajal et al 2017 among others for flood modeling hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system us army corps of engineers 2020 hec georas hydrologic engineering center geospatial river analysis system esri 2020 and gis geographical information system esri 2020 are extensively used by researchers see e g sarhadi et al 2012 ben khalfallah and saidi 2018 ezz 2018 miranda and ferreira 2019 santo et al 2016 among others generally basin scale flood hazard mapping is performed worldwide e g grimaldi et al 2013 bourenane et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 shadmehri toosi et al 2019 kazakis et al 2015 among others however limited works exist in literature for nepali river basins e g mishra and herath 2015 khanal et al 2007 flood damage to structures and lifelines and losses to lives and property prompt crucial planning in terms of flood hazard mapping and mitigation strategies the problem of floods in many urban and rural areas of nepal is still severe as floods would generally affect nepal in almost every monsoon most of the flood victims would be the people living in the flood plain areas as in the case of 2008 koshi flood and 2017 central nepal flood although flood damage is widespread and losses are enormous due attention is yet to be paid in terms of hazard vulnerability and risk studies across nepal gautam 2017a b presented a generic flood risk map for the southern part of nepal however the map is based on topographical features only so it may not be exhaustive to represent the flood scenarios this necessitates basin scale studies to assess the flood hazard which may be helpful in designing countermeasures and preparedness initiatives to downscale the losses the annual torrential precipitation talchabhadel et al 2018 high surface run off rate deforestation urban expansion and land use change lamichhane and shakya 2019a b could lead to frequent flooding events as the land use cover change dynamics seems rapidly changing even within a short time lamichhane and shakya 2019a b there is also a high risk of frequent and devastating flood events in nepal the flood events can neither be controlled completely nor the effects could be completely checked however the flood impacts can be minimized by structural and non structural mitigation measures for effective planning and understanding flood vulnerability analysis of structures and infrastructures is one of the rational approaches flood vulnerability analysis of the built environment is gaining attention in recent decades and many researchers are paying attention to develop flood vulnerability functions see e g fuchs et al 2019a b baradaranshoraka et al 2019 de risi et al 2019 among others the vulnerability as well as fragility functions depict the probability of occurrence of particular damage under the flood intensity level fragility and vulnerability functions are important tool for estimating flood effects prior to the flood as well as to prioritize response and recovery efforts after flood events considering the built environment to the best of authors knowledge vulnerability and fragility functions for buildings in nepal do not exist it is worthy to note that gautam and dong 2018 constructed depth damage curves for residential stone masonry buildings using the damage data after the 2017 flood similarly adhikari et al 2019 constructed flood and multi hazard fragility functions for highway bridges in nepal using a heuristic approach after the 2017 floods in eastern and central nepal flood damage to the structures and infrastructures and associated losses are more pronounced as frequent floods are inevitable in nepal in this paper we perform flood hazard mapping for khando river catchment in eastern nepal which observes frequent floods and attributed damages and losses are severe together with flood hazard maps for various intervals we present flood vulnerability analysis of wattle and daub dwellings which is the most dominant construction system across the riverbanks most of the historical flood damage reports show that the worst affected building type would be the wattle and daub construction npc 2017 thus we present the vulnerability and fragility functions for residential wattle and daub dwellings together with flood hazard maps for 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods in this study 2 material and methods 2 1 study area nepal is situated between longitude 80 4 e to 88 12 e and latitude 26 12 n to 30 27 n the elevation of the country varies from 60 m at jhapa in the south to 8848 m at the mt everest in the north within a short horizontal distance of 90 120 km the spatio temporal variation of precipitation is very high due to the variation in topography talchabhadel et al 2018 karki et al 2017 the precipitation variation ranges from less than 300 mm in dry rain shadow regions to more than 5000 mm in wet region in lumle of kaski district in western nepal department of hydrology and meteorology 2020 about 6000 rivers and rivulets are in nepal with a total length exceeding 45 000 km and with the total drainage area of 191 000 sq km khando river is a non perennial spring river that mainly passes through saptari district in eastern nepal and meets the koshi river fig 1 saptari district covers an area of 1363 km2 and has a population of 639 284 per the 2011 census central bureau of statistics nepal 2012 the total building population in saptari district was 121 064 in 2011 among them 62 465 buildings were wattle and daub houses central bureau of statistics nepal 2012 the catchment area of the khando river is 117 3 km2 and elevation ranges between 67 419 m from the average mean sea level per the long term climate data 1986 2015 recorded in the catchment the annual average rainfall is 1800 mm talchabhadel et al 2018 similarly annual maximum and minimum temperatures in the catchment are 33 7 c in may and 8 c in january based on the long term climate data 1981 2012 department of hydrology and meteorology 2020 the length of the river is 25 246 km khando river is one of the most notorious rivers in terms of flooding and associated damages as per the records of floods in recent decades see e g npc 2017 government of nepal 2009 the majority of the river stretch lies in the indo gangetic plain so the river is flat with an average bank height of 0 8 m moreover the river would be dry for most of the period except for the rainy season the river has a meandering channel however we did not observe significant channel shifting between 2015 and 2017 we have considered the width of the study area from 800 to 1000 m geologically khando river catchment is characterized by loose pebbles and cobbles being a river originated from the siwalik region khando river has also high sediment transport rate and the aggradation of the river channel is quite common the catchment has drainage density of 0 47 km km2 average permeability of 25 75 m day and the time of concentration of the catchment is 4 129 h based on the kirpich equation maidment 1992 after the siwalik region the flood plain area of the khando river increases due to significant reduction in river slope as shown in fig 1 the largest fraction of land use is associated with agriculture the northern part of the catchment mainly comprises the forest and shrubland however the southern part of the catchment comprises agricultural and barren areas the barren areas would be generally comprised by slums and squatter settlements as the entire catchment is not densely populated the land use map does not clearly depict the built up areas due to scattered settlements the northern part of the catchment is less populated than the southern part the southern part of the catchment comprises densely populated settlements even in the riverbanks as the settlements beside the riverbanks are usually slums and squatter settlements housing typology predominates the wattle and daub constructions with some brick masonry buildings every year thousands of people become homeless due to the flooding in the khando river and losses would be attributed to crops livestock and infrastructure damage as well 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 flood hazard mapping to assess the flood hazard across the khando river catchment we collected the topographical survey data and prepared digital elevation model dem for both left and right banks of khando river using kriging s interpolation tool as it is a fast and flexible method of creating dems pavlova 2017 furthermore we prepared 12 5 12 5 m resolution dem in arc gis by creating triangular irregular network tin from topographic survey data the topographic survey was conducted in 2015 using total station having the least count of 0 001 m for 30 km longitudinal chainage and 1000 m cross section that includes upstream and downstream of the damage location the accuracy of the created dem was confirmed with the freely available open street map in arc gis we collected srtm shuttle radar topography mission 30 m srtm digital elevation database 2020 dem and performed spatial analysis to depict the flow direction flow accumulation and watershed delineation both dem and spatial analysis were performed in arc gis 10 3 1 environment the processed raster was then subject to hec georas preprocessing we digitized and formulated tins for channels riverbanks flow path lines and cross section cutline rainfall data from a nearby meteorological station see fig 1 was collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology government of nepal rainfall data between 1972 2018 was employed for the analysis the daily rainfall range was between 42 245 5 mm day for the recorded period the annual wetness index for the catchment is 1600 mm talchabhadel et al 2018 we trialed several methods to estimate the flood discharge and adopted hydest2004 dhm approach department of hydrology and meteorology 2020 as it was exclusively derived and implemented for un gauged rivers in nepal hydest2004 dhm method is the modification of the wecs 1990 water and energy commission secretariat method department of hydrology and meteorology 2020 hydest2004 dhm method treats the entire country as a single hydrological region and performs regionalization for low flows long term flows and flood flows this method estimates discharges for 2 and 100 years return periods first and facilitates the discharge estimation for any other return period based on empirical formulas for further details see https www dhm gov np furthermore a comparison between several other approaches highlighted that hydest2004 dhm approach results in the highest discharge the outputs of hec georas preprocessing provided gis to ras import files thereafter one dimensional hydrodynamic models were created in hecras 5 0 7 for the flood frequency analysis of 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods firstly we analyzed observed rainfall data from the nearby meteorological station see fig 1 and found the daily maximum rainfall for the day on which flood event occurred august 13 2017 the recorded maximum daily rainfall was 207 5 mm which nearly coincides with 20 years return period thus we opted 20 years as one return interval together 50 100 and 200 as scenario return intervals for severer floods than that of 2017 the manning s n value flow data and boundary conditions were inputted in the imported gis2ras file and the hecras results were obtained to perform hecras analysis we inputted critical depth as the boundary condition and mixed flow regime the flow data obtained from hydest 2004 dhm method and geometry obtained from the dem created from survey data were also inputted the cross sections were created in hec georas at 200 m intervals for 1000 m width we adopted manning s roughness coefficient 0 035 for the river channel and 0 04 for the banks gautam and dulal 2013 as khando river is a tributary of koshi river basin thereafter we obtained the water surface profiles and checked the sufficiency of cross section coverage if the decision led to insufficient cross sections hec georas pre processing was repeated as shown in fig 2 in the case of enough cross section coverage the outputs were exported to gis from hecras and water surface tins were created in arc gis environment thereafter flood plain extent and depth grids were obtained and flood hazard maps for 20 50 100 and 200 years return period were prepared using arc gis the step by step procedures to obtain the flood hazard maps are shown in detail in fig 2 2 2 2 flood vulnerability of residential building to obtain flood vulnerability functions most of the researchers have used inundation depth as the intensity measure see e g fuchs et al 2019a b godfrey et al 2015 karagiorgos et al 2016 among others we also used inundation depth to derive fragility and vulnerability functions using the depth and damage data collected after the 2017 flood in eastern nepal we measured the depth of inundation and estimated the damage extent damage ratio for wattle and daub dwellings brick masonry reinforced concrete rc constructions in the affected areas of saptari district as masonry and rc building damage were limited the most extensively damaged construction system i e wattle and daub is incorporated in this study to delineate flood vulnerability to residential buildings the damage ratio was estimated as the fraction of total repair cost to the overall cost of new construction as the direct evaluation of the damage extent would be affected by biases such as erroneous and subjective judgments we first estimated the overall cost of construction interviewing the local people and flood victims and then assessed the damage to individual houses to obtain the damage ratio the damage ratio was assigned between 0 1 the damage ratio value 1 indicates the complete collapse of a building new construction required whereas the 0 value of damage ratio indicates the building remained unharmed due to the flood the depth of inundation was measured directly in situ by measuring tapes logit function was chosen to construct the vulnerability depth damage function fitting the depth and damage data it is worthy to note that several researchers have considered various statistical distributions to construct vulnerability fragility functions see e g shinozuka et al 2002 porter et al 2007 rossetto and elnashai 2005 gautam et al 2018 gautam 2017a b parisi and sabella 2017 among them weibull modified weibull linear second order polynomial logistic function third order polynomial among others are commonly practiced for further details see fuchs et al 2007 totschnig and fuchs 2013 among others based on the collected information fragility functions for discrete damage classes were also constructed using lognormal distribution in total we assessed 34 damaged wattle and daub houses and processed the data to construct vulnerability function and fragility functions most of the wattle and daub buildings would be swept away by the water current so it is very difficult to find many cases of damage across the main river channel as post flood damage data are rare most of the researchers previously derived vulnerability fragility functions using limited data sets for example godfrey et al 2015 used 24 quan luna et al 2011 used 13 totsching et al totschnig and fuchs 2013 used 67 azmeri and isa 2018 used 38 kang and kim 2016 used 25 and papathoma kohle et al papathoma köhle et al 2012 used 51 building damage data to construct vulnerability function as real flood damage data are valuable because of their exact representation the vulnerability fragility functions constructed using the real damage data would be more representative than the simulated ones thus many researchers are developing vulnerability functions even with limited datasets furthermore in the case of the availability of discrete damage data it would be imperative to construct fragility functions so that the probability of exceedance of various damage states would be discretely presented it is because the damageability function reflects just the damage or non damage scenario in a particular inundation depth to date most of the researchers have used lognormal distribution for the post disaster database e g porter et al 2007 gautam et al 2018 shinozuka et al 2002 among others we also fitted two parameter lognormal fragility functions for five damage classes minor major severe beyond repair and collapse the damage classes were determined based on the mean damage ratio that was assigned to each surveyed building the minor major severe beyond repair and collapse damage states correspond to damage ratios of 0 15 0 35 0 50 0 80 and 1 respectively for each intensity measure im level the probability of reaching or exceeding the particular damage state ds can be presented as a two parameter lognormal distribution function f x using the maximum likelihood approach the likelihood function for lognormal fragility can be expressed as 1 l i 1 n f x i y i 1 f x i 1 y i where f is the fragility function for the specific damage state a i is the measured depth of inundation m for the affected building i y i is 1 or 0 based on the damage status of the buildings exposed to a i and n is the total number of buildings the two parameter fragility function f x can be represented as f x ф ln x l n α β 2 where ф represents standardized normal distribution function and α and β are the median and dispersion parameters of the lognormal distribution the parameters α and β are estimated satisfying the following conditions 3 d ln l d α d l n l d β 0 3 results and discussions we conducted flood hazard analysis and flood vulnerability analysis of wattle and daub houses which is a dominant construction system along the khando riverbank in eastern nepal the results are reported in terms of flood hazard maps flood performance of residential buildings and flood vulnerability of wattle and daub buildings separately in the following sections 3 1 flood hazard mapping first we obtained discharges for 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods the instantaneous flood discharges were obtained as 408 534 660 and 754 m3 s for 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods fig 3 a shows that the maximum inundation depth for 200 years return period is 4 2 m most of the areas across the catchment depict the inundation depth between 0 5 2 5 m for 200 years return period fig 3a b c and d highlight that the inundation depth was less in the left bank of the river due to higher topographical relief than the right bank as shown in fig 3b the maximum inundation depth is 4 12 m for 100 years return period the maximum inundation depths for 50 and 20 years return periods were obtained as 4 and 3 85 m respectively the variation in the maximum inundation depth is not wide possibly because there is no significant elevation difference between the river channel and adjoining areas channel shifting and formation of artificial levees due to aggradation would act as the border between the river and agricultural land this peculiarity sometimes leads to high inundation depth even beyond the river channel channel shifting in the khando river occurs primarily due to the occurrence of loose soil and subsequent erosion fig 3a b c and d collectively delineate that with the decrement in inundation depth the larger fraction of the catchment would be less inundated this means when the maximum depth of inundation decreases more areas tend to be exposed to less than 0 5 m inundation 3 2 flood vulnerability of residential wattle and daub buildings 3 2 1 flood performance of residential buildings after the 2017 flood in central and eastern nepal we conducted field surveys in the affected areas mainly in sunsari and saptari districts in eastern nepal the survey was dedicated to assessing the damage mechanisms and damage levels in affected structures and infrastructures the major damage location was across the khando river in saptari district the most affected building form was the wattle and daub system similar observations were made also in sunsari district wattle and daub constructions are low cost folded bamboo constructions with thatched or galvanized iron gi roofing with bamboo or concrete post with marginal usually single reinforcement that would be available in the local market wattle and daub buildings are usually one to two storied constructions that usually do not have specific foundations rather bamboo or concrete pillars inserted on the ground serve as the foundation system the pillars would not be tied at the plinth level however they would be tied at the eaves level with folded bamboo sheets the wall system comprises the folded bamboo sheets or shrub shoots the wall skeleton would be then plastered with the clay usually mixed with cow dung the wall thickness would be uniform throughout the dwelling including the partition walls as shown in fig 4 a the concrete pillars of a wattle and daub house were washed away by the flood due to the lack of adequate stiffness of walls and pillars water current easily washed away the walls and pillars we did not observe any connection to tie up the structural system pillars and walls thus the effect of water current became more localized leading to the collapse of some parts of the house fig 4b shows a washed away wattle and daub house that was fixed again for temporary use it is worthy to note that the brittle damages in structural members were scarce however the poor connections and less depth of insertions on the ground fundamentally affected the performance of houses during flood fig 4c shows the remains of a wall of wattle and daub house made up of bamboo pillars as shown in fig 4c a thin sheet of walls could be observed which leads to negligible stiffness against the water current during flooding fig 4d displays a house with ejected and distorted concrete pillars together with some washed away wattle and daub walls we measured the depth of inundation between 2 170 cm in the affected areas the inundation depth of 2 cm had negligible to slight damage in houses however 170 cm depth of inundation led to complete collapse to beyond repair damage level nearby the east west highway in saptari district we observed a spectacular example of reinforced concrete rc building damage fig 5 a at the depth of inundation of 2 5 m the foundation of the building was washed away and the frame was also heavily damaged the building was under construction and we observed that the building was not code conforming due to lack of adequate ductile detailing the flooded water discharge got high velocity in a narrow channel passing through the foundation and heavy erosion occurred subsequently leading to the collapse the rc building fig 5b shows an example of a concrete pillar inserted into the piled up clay that serves as the plinth it is obvious that once eroded the pillars would distort or get washed away in fig 5c a mixed construction system could be observed that came into practice after the 2008 flood in the affected areas of saptari and sunsari districts the walls normal to the likely flood direction were made up of single wythed brick masonry to increase stiffness however the orthogonal walls were still constructed using wattle and daub system it is interesting to note that the first story of the house is constructed with brick and the second story was continued with wattle and daub system possibly due to the assumption that the flood may rise to the first story level only such construction systems are designated to be flood resilient similar resilient practices are also reported elsewhere see e g gautam et al 2016 fig 5d shows a vernacular form of a residential building in which the first story is a multi wythed brick masonry and the second story comprises timber construction the construction system in southern nepal is mostly governed by reinforced concrete brick masonry and wattle and daub notably the importance of wattle and daub is more than any other building form due to several reasons the first is that the wattle and daub construction is the most popular amongst low income to poor people who could not afford modern and expensive housing similarly wattle and daub is the most widely practiced in the slum areas and such areas generally occur in the river banks where land would be available free of cost thus flood impact on wattle and daub buildings would be more pronounced not only due to their inherent vulnerabilities but also due to their vast presence in the flood prone areas 3 2 2 flood vulnerability and fragility functions for wattle and daub dwellings based on the data collected during the field survey we constructed a vulnerability curve for the wattle and daub construction system the vulnerability curve considering the logit function was derived as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 inundation up to 20 cm depicts the damage ratio less than 10 inundation of 50 cm leads to 20 damage inundation of 1 m leads to 50 damage and inundation of 1 6 m results in 90 damage to wattle and daub dwellings notably slight to minor damages need scrutinized efforts to demarcate hence the lower inundation depths hardly contribute in construction of vulnerability curve which is often regarded as the depth damage curve obtaining discrete data points is challenging especially in the case of flood events because most of the heavily damaged and collapsed buildings would not show the actual impression of inundation depth however we assessed distinctly inundated and damage wattle and daub dwellings during the field survey the inundation scenario comparable to the 2017 flood was reflected by the 20 years return period flood the average inundation along the bank where the damage has occurred was 1 5 m similarly the average depth of inundation was also 1 5 m for the riverbank this is evident that the 20 years return period can cause significant damage to wattle and daub buildings thus to predict the probabilistic performance of wattle and daub constructions vulnerability and fragility curves derived in this study play a vital role both vulnerability and fragility curves could be used to get the probability of damage damage level exceedance for a particular inundation depth from any return period at higher return periods the inundation depth would be higher in general the expected performance level or damage level of wattle and daub construction system could be estimated from figs 6 and 7 we further processed the data to construct fragility functions for five damage classes among 34 damage cases 12 5 houses depicted minor damage 25 depicted major damage 18 75 depicted severe damage 25 depicted beyond repair damage and 18 75 depicted collapse damage state considering the mean damage ratio for each damage state lognormal distribution parameters were estimated however the quality of fragility functions was not satisfactory due to the limited database that resulted in intersecting curves thereafter we re assessed the quality of fragility functions considering the distribution of standard deviation per eqs 4 and 5 4 β i 1 n i 1 n β i 5 α i e 1 28 β β i ln α i herein β i and α i represent the adjusted lognormal standard deviation and median for particular damage state i after distributing the lognormal standard deviations obtained initially we adjusted the median parameter α the summary of corrected lognormal distribution parameters is presented in table 1 as all the preceding fragility curve intersected the following curve the redistribution of the lognormal standard deviation resulted in the same value for all five classes however significant variation in terms of median depth of inundation m was observed as shown in table 1 the parameters were then plotted to obtain the fragility functions for five damage states as shown in fig 7 fig 7 highlights that up to the inundation depth of 30 cm only minor damages are expected similarly initiation of collapse with the probability of exceedance less than 5 is expected after the inundation depth of 75 cm at a depth of 1 2 m the probabilities of exceedance of collapse beyond repair severe major and minor damage states are respectively 10 25 40 70 and 90 as 1 2 m depth of inundation is quite common during every monsoon in the southern plains of nepal it could be concluded that most of the wattle and daub houses would not be usable at this depth thus there is an urgent need for improvement in the wattle and daub housing construction system to assure flood resilience as the total cost of construction of wattle and daub houses ranges between us 50 500 low cost improvements are important because the owners cannot afford drastic improvements due to cost issues 4 conclusions flood hazard assessment is conducted for frequently flooding khando river catchment in eastern nepal using rainfall data of 47 years we estimated inundation depths for the catchment and prepared flood hazard maps for 20 50 100 and 200 years return period the results highlight that the maximum inundation depth does not vary significantly as highlighted by the range of 3 85 4 20 m for 20 and 200 years return periods respectively more than 95 of the study area is likely to observe inundation depth up to 1 5 m for all return periods considered in this study the outcomes of the flood hazard assessment are subject to flood vulnerability analysis of existing building types using the survey data forensic interpretations of the damaged structures are reported in this study we used the damage ratio and inundation depth to create vulnerability and fragility functions the vulnerability analysis of the wattle and daub construction concludes that the wattle and daub houses would observe damage even at low inundation depth up to 0 5 m meanwhile at a depth of 1 7 m most of the wattle and daub houses are expected to collapse fragility functions considering five damage grades are constructed in this study the flood hazard maps indicate that 1 5 m inundation would commonly occur hence it is obvious that the wattle and daub construction system would be frequently affected by the flood causing enormous losses of lives and properties the average measured inundation depth was nearly equal to the estimated inundation depth for 20 years return period flood which highlights that the 2017 event was equivalent to 20 years return period rainfall even at the inundation depth of 1 7 m more than 95 of the wattle and daub houses would collapse as reflected by the newly developed fragility functions similarly at a depth of inundation of 2 5 m even poorly engineered rc buildings would collapse the low rate of collapse and severe damage statistics is also attributed to a smaller number of buildings across the catchment all the hazard maps depict that more than 95 of areas would have inundation depth within 1 5 m this indicates that the settlements with predominant wattle and daub constructions across the riverbanks would be severely affected by floods of low return periods too the juxtaposition of fragility functions and flood hazard maps highlights that the wattle and daub constructions are highly vulnerable to even 20 years return period flood for the non perennial spring rivers flood events are quite frequent and loss of lives and properties is reported almost every year thus improvement of conventional wattle and daub system is urgent to save lives and properties in similar catchments the fragility functions developed in this study represent the wattle and daub constructions in the southern plains of nepal and may not represent the probability of damage occurrence for other environments such as the mountain torrents future studies may incorporate calibration of discharge estimation method with recorded discharge data to obtain more representative discharge values this may improve the flood mapping results in data scarce environments such as the khando river catchment similarly the vulnerability and fragility functions may be also improved using more damage data coverage of broad areas during survey would also improve the quality of fragility functions as a more discrete

8346,study region this study considers the khando river a tributary of koshi river in eastern nepal study focus to quantify the hazard and vulnerabilities across one of the frequently flooding catchments i e khando river we conducted flood hazard assessment for 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods we coupled flood hazard analysis with vulnerability analysis of the most dominant construction system along the river channel i e wattle and daub houses based on the measured inundation depths we created vulnerability and fragility functions the flood hazard maps damage mechanisms due to the 2017 flood and vulnerability as well as fragility curves are reported in this paper new hydrological insights for the region the flood hazard analysis highlighted that the 2017 flood was equivalent to 20 years return period flood flood hazard analysis shows that the variation in the maximum inundation depth is not so wide between 20 and 200 years return periods for the khando river catchment flood vulnerability analysis of residential houses along the riverbank highlighted that the wattle and daub construction system is highly vulnerable even for 20 years return period flood thus the floods equivalent to 50 100 and 200 years may have detrimental consequences in the future keywords flood hazard mapping flood vulnerability flood fragility function khando river residential building 1 introduction flood overflow of water beyond the river channel is one of the major natural hazards that causes enormous loss of lives and properties worldwide every year floods become more severe once they pass through built up areas and arable lands as in the case of 1993 flood in nepal 2008 koshi flood in eastern nepal government of nepal 2009 and the 2017 central nepal water flood gautam and dong 2018 several historical flood events show that the major losses are incurred across the river and rivulet channels for instance the 1993 floods across nepal 2002 central nepal flood 2008 koshi river flood 2008 western nepal flood 2012 seti river flood 2017 flood across nepal among others reflected that the major losses had occurred along the riverbanks the 1993 flood in nepal caused 1170 fatalities and damaged some 32 765 buildings government of nepal 2009 similarly the 2008 koshi flood displaced around 65 000 people in saptari and sunsari in eastern nepal government of nepal 2009 the 2017 flood in nepal destroyed 41 625 and damaged 150 510 houses leading to an overall loss of us 187 9 million government of nepal 2017 the post flood recovery needs assessment conducted after the 2017 flood events in nepal depicted that 53 3 of total recovery needs was required for housing sector only government of nepal 2017 the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm recorded the highest ever mean rainfall of 1800 mm substantially exceeding the average of 1200 mm in 2017 government of nepal 2017 a total of 7141 families were affected along with the total economic loss of us 7 8 million during 2015 and 2016 floods in nepal government of nepal 2020 most of the flood events worldwide have depicted that the impacts of floods on built environment would be disastrous see e g government of nepal 2009 guzzetti et al 2005 marchi et al 2010 cao et al 2016 santo et al 2016 tsakiris 2014 fuchs et al 2007 santos et al 2015 gautam and dong 2018 among others as losses are inevitable due to floods many researchers have considered flood hazard mapping as one of the most efficient tools for prevention to mitigation in recent decades many researchers have performed flood hazard mapping in various parts of the world as reported elsewhere see e g hagen et al 2010 di salvo et al 2018 nharo et al 2019 popa et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 ntajal et al 2017 among others for flood modeling hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system us army corps of engineers 2020 hec georas hydrologic engineering center geospatial river analysis system esri 2020 and gis geographical information system esri 2020 are extensively used by researchers see e g sarhadi et al 2012 ben khalfallah and saidi 2018 ezz 2018 miranda and ferreira 2019 santo et al 2016 among others generally basin scale flood hazard mapping is performed worldwide e g grimaldi et al 2013 bourenane et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 shadmehri toosi et al 2019 kazakis et al 2015 among others however limited works exist in literature for nepali river basins e g mishra and herath 2015 khanal et al 2007 flood damage to structures and lifelines and losses to lives and property prompt crucial planning in terms of flood hazard mapping and mitigation strategies the problem of floods in many urban and rural areas of nepal is still severe as floods would generally affect nepal in almost every monsoon most of the flood victims would be the people living in the flood plain areas as in the case of 2008 koshi flood and 2017 central nepal flood although flood damage is widespread and losses are enormous due attention is yet to be paid in terms of hazard vulnerability and risk studies across nepal gautam 2017a b presented a generic flood risk map for the southern part of nepal however the map is based on topographical features only so it may not be exhaustive to represent the flood scenarios this necessitates basin scale studies to assess the flood hazard which may be helpful in designing countermeasures and preparedness initiatives to downscale the losses the annual torrential precipitation talchabhadel et al 2018 high surface run off rate deforestation urban expansion and land use change lamichhane and shakya 2019a b could lead to frequent flooding events as the land use cover change dynamics seems rapidly changing even within a short time lamichhane and shakya 2019a b there is also a high risk of frequent and devastating flood events in nepal the flood events can neither be controlled completely nor the effects could be completely checked however the flood impacts can be minimized by structural and non structural mitigation measures for effective planning and understanding flood vulnerability analysis of structures and infrastructures is one of the rational approaches flood vulnerability analysis of the built environment is gaining attention in recent decades and many researchers are paying attention to develop flood vulnerability functions see e g fuchs et al 2019a b baradaranshoraka et al 2019 de risi et al 2019 among others the vulnerability as well as fragility functions depict the probability of occurrence of particular damage under the flood intensity level fragility and vulnerability functions are important tool for estimating flood effects prior to the flood as well as to prioritize response and recovery efforts after flood events considering the built environment to the best of authors knowledge vulnerability and fragility functions for buildings in nepal do not exist it is worthy to note that gautam and dong 2018 constructed depth damage curves for residential stone masonry buildings using the damage data after the 2017 flood similarly adhikari et al 2019 constructed flood and multi hazard fragility functions for highway bridges in nepal using a heuristic approach after the 2017 floods in eastern and central nepal flood damage to the structures and infrastructures and associated losses are more pronounced as frequent floods are inevitable in nepal in this paper we perform flood hazard mapping for khando river catchment in eastern nepal which observes frequent floods and attributed damages and losses are severe together with flood hazard maps for various intervals we present flood vulnerability analysis of wattle and daub dwellings which is the most dominant construction system across the riverbanks most of the historical flood damage reports show that the worst affected building type would be the wattle and daub construction npc 2017 thus we present the vulnerability and fragility functions for residential wattle and daub dwellings together with flood hazard maps for 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods in this study 2 material and methods 2 1 study area nepal is situated between longitude 80 4 e to 88 12 e and latitude 26 12 n to 30 27 n the elevation of the country varies from 60 m at jhapa in the south to 8848 m at the mt everest in the north within a short horizontal distance of 90 120 km the spatio temporal variation of precipitation is very high due to the variation in topography talchabhadel et al 2018 karki et al 2017 the precipitation variation ranges from less than 300 mm in dry rain shadow regions to more than 5000 mm in wet region in lumle of kaski district in western nepal department of hydrology and meteorology 2020 about 6000 rivers and rivulets are in nepal with a total length exceeding 45 000 km and with the total drainage area of 191 000 sq km khando river is a non perennial spring river that mainly passes through saptari district in eastern nepal and meets the koshi river fig 1 saptari district covers an area of 1363 km2 and has a population of 639 284 per the 2011 census central bureau of statistics nepal 2012 the total building population in saptari district was 121 064 in 2011 among them 62 465 buildings were wattle and daub houses central bureau of statistics nepal 2012 the catchment area of the khando river is 117 3 km2 and elevation ranges between 67 419 m from the average mean sea level per the long term climate data 1986 2015 recorded in the catchment the annual average rainfall is 1800 mm talchabhadel et al 2018 similarly annual maximum and minimum temperatures in the catchment are 33 7 c in may and 8 c in january based on the long term climate data 1981 2012 department of hydrology and meteorology 2020 the length of the river is 25 246 km khando river is one of the most notorious rivers in terms of flooding and associated damages as per the records of floods in recent decades see e g npc 2017 government of nepal 2009 the majority of the river stretch lies in the indo gangetic plain so the river is flat with an average bank height of 0 8 m moreover the river would be dry for most of the period except for the rainy season the river has a meandering channel however we did not observe significant channel shifting between 2015 and 2017 we have considered the width of the study area from 800 to 1000 m geologically khando river catchment is characterized by loose pebbles and cobbles being a river originated from the siwalik region khando river has also high sediment transport rate and the aggradation of the river channel is quite common the catchment has drainage density of 0 47 km km2 average permeability of 25 75 m day and the time of concentration of the catchment is 4 129 h based on the kirpich equation maidment 1992 after the siwalik region the flood plain area of the khando river increases due to significant reduction in river slope as shown in fig 1 the largest fraction of land use is associated with agriculture the northern part of the catchment mainly comprises the forest and shrubland however the southern part of the catchment comprises agricultural and barren areas the barren areas would be generally comprised by slums and squatter settlements as the entire catchment is not densely populated the land use map does not clearly depict the built up areas due to scattered settlements the northern part of the catchment is less populated than the southern part the southern part of the catchment comprises densely populated settlements even in the riverbanks as the settlements beside the riverbanks are usually slums and squatter settlements housing typology predominates the wattle and daub constructions with some brick masonry buildings every year thousands of people become homeless due to the flooding in the khando river and losses would be attributed to crops livestock and infrastructure damage as well 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 flood hazard mapping to assess the flood hazard across the khando river catchment we collected the topographical survey data and prepared digital elevation model dem for both left and right banks of khando river using kriging s interpolation tool as it is a fast and flexible method of creating dems pavlova 2017 furthermore we prepared 12 5 12 5 m resolution dem in arc gis by creating triangular irregular network tin from topographic survey data the topographic survey was conducted in 2015 using total station having the least count of 0 001 m for 30 km longitudinal chainage and 1000 m cross section that includes upstream and downstream of the damage location the accuracy of the created dem was confirmed with the freely available open street map in arc gis we collected srtm shuttle radar topography mission 30 m srtm digital elevation database 2020 dem and performed spatial analysis to depict the flow direction flow accumulation and watershed delineation both dem and spatial analysis were performed in arc gis 10 3 1 environment the processed raster was then subject to hec georas preprocessing we digitized and formulated tins for channels riverbanks flow path lines and cross section cutline rainfall data from a nearby meteorological station see fig 1 was collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology government of nepal rainfall data between 1972 2018 was employed for the analysis the daily rainfall range was between 42 245 5 mm day for the recorded period the annual wetness index for the catchment is 1600 mm talchabhadel et al 2018 we trialed several methods to estimate the flood discharge and adopted hydest2004 dhm approach department of hydrology and meteorology 2020 as it was exclusively derived and implemented for un gauged rivers in nepal hydest2004 dhm method is the modification of the wecs 1990 water and energy commission secretariat method department of hydrology and meteorology 2020 hydest2004 dhm method treats the entire country as a single hydrological region and performs regionalization for low flows long term flows and flood flows this method estimates discharges for 2 and 100 years return periods first and facilitates the discharge estimation for any other return period based on empirical formulas for further details see https www dhm gov np furthermore a comparison between several other approaches highlighted that hydest2004 dhm approach results in the highest discharge the outputs of hec georas preprocessing provided gis to ras import files thereafter one dimensional hydrodynamic models were created in hecras 5 0 7 for the flood frequency analysis of 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods firstly we analyzed observed rainfall data from the nearby meteorological station see fig 1 and found the daily maximum rainfall for the day on which flood event occurred august 13 2017 the recorded maximum daily rainfall was 207 5 mm which nearly coincides with 20 years return period thus we opted 20 years as one return interval together 50 100 and 200 as scenario return intervals for severer floods than that of 2017 the manning s n value flow data and boundary conditions were inputted in the imported gis2ras file and the hecras results were obtained to perform hecras analysis we inputted critical depth as the boundary condition and mixed flow regime the flow data obtained from hydest 2004 dhm method and geometry obtained from the dem created from survey data were also inputted the cross sections were created in hec georas at 200 m intervals for 1000 m width we adopted manning s roughness coefficient 0 035 for the river channel and 0 04 for the banks gautam and dulal 2013 as khando river is a tributary of koshi river basin thereafter we obtained the water surface profiles and checked the sufficiency of cross section coverage if the decision led to insufficient cross sections hec georas pre processing was repeated as shown in fig 2 in the case of enough cross section coverage the outputs were exported to gis from hecras and water surface tins were created in arc gis environment thereafter flood plain extent and depth grids were obtained and flood hazard maps for 20 50 100 and 200 years return period were prepared using arc gis the step by step procedures to obtain the flood hazard maps are shown in detail in fig 2 2 2 2 flood vulnerability of residential building to obtain flood vulnerability functions most of the researchers have used inundation depth as the intensity measure see e g fuchs et al 2019a b godfrey et al 2015 karagiorgos et al 2016 among others we also used inundation depth to derive fragility and vulnerability functions using the depth and damage data collected after the 2017 flood in eastern nepal we measured the depth of inundation and estimated the damage extent damage ratio for wattle and daub dwellings brick masonry reinforced concrete rc constructions in the affected areas of saptari district as masonry and rc building damage were limited the most extensively damaged construction system i e wattle and daub is incorporated in this study to delineate flood vulnerability to residential buildings the damage ratio was estimated as the fraction of total repair cost to the overall cost of new construction as the direct evaluation of the damage extent would be affected by biases such as erroneous and subjective judgments we first estimated the overall cost of construction interviewing the local people and flood victims and then assessed the damage to individual houses to obtain the damage ratio the damage ratio was assigned between 0 1 the damage ratio value 1 indicates the complete collapse of a building new construction required whereas the 0 value of damage ratio indicates the building remained unharmed due to the flood the depth of inundation was measured directly in situ by measuring tapes logit function was chosen to construct the vulnerability depth damage function fitting the depth and damage data it is worthy to note that several researchers have considered various statistical distributions to construct vulnerability fragility functions see e g shinozuka et al 2002 porter et al 2007 rossetto and elnashai 2005 gautam et al 2018 gautam 2017a b parisi and sabella 2017 among them weibull modified weibull linear second order polynomial logistic function third order polynomial among others are commonly practiced for further details see fuchs et al 2007 totschnig and fuchs 2013 among others based on the collected information fragility functions for discrete damage classes were also constructed using lognormal distribution in total we assessed 34 damaged wattle and daub houses and processed the data to construct vulnerability function and fragility functions most of the wattle and daub buildings would be swept away by the water current so it is very difficult to find many cases of damage across the main river channel as post flood damage data are rare most of the researchers previously derived vulnerability fragility functions using limited data sets for example godfrey et al 2015 used 24 quan luna et al 2011 used 13 totsching et al totschnig and fuchs 2013 used 67 azmeri and isa 2018 used 38 kang and kim 2016 used 25 and papathoma kohle et al papathoma köhle et al 2012 used 51 building damage data to construct vulnerability function as real flood damage data are valuable because of their exact representation the vulnerability fragility functions constructed using the real damage data would be more representative than the simulated ones thus many researchers are developing vulnerability functions even with limited datasets furthermore in the case of the availability of discrete damage data it would be imperative to construct fragility functions so that the probability of exceedance of various damage states would be discretely presented it is because the damageability function reflects just the damage or non damage scenario in a particular inundation depth to date most of the researchers have used lognormal distribution for the post disaster database e g porter et al 2007 gautam et al 2018 shinozuka et al 2002 among others we also fitted two parameter lognormal fragility functions for five damage classes minor major severe beyond repair and collapse the damage classes were determined based on the mean damage ratio that was assigned to each surveyed building the minor major severe beyond repair and collapse damage states correspond to damage ratios of 0 15 0 35 0 50 0 80 and 1 respectively for each intensity measure im level the probability of reaching or exceeding the particular damage state ds can be presented as a two parameter lognormal distribution function f x using the maximum likelihood approach the likelihood function for lognormal fragility can be expressed as 1 l i 1 n f x i y i 1 f x i 1 y i where f is the fragility function for the specific damage state a i is the measured depth of inundation m for the affected building i y i is 1 or 0 based on the damage status of the buildings exposed to a i and n is the total number of buildings the two parameter fragility function f x can be represented as f x ф ln x l n α β 2 where ф represents standardized normal distribution function and α and β are the median and dispersion parameters of the lognormal distribution the parameters α and β are estimated satisfying the following conditions 3 d ln l d α d l n l d β 0 3 results and discussions we conducted flood hazard analysis and flood vulnerability analysis of wattle and daub houses which is a dominant construction system along the khando riverbank in eastern nepal the results are reported in terms of flood hazard maps flood performance of residential buildings and flood vulnerability of wattle and daub buildings separately in the following sections 3 1 flood hazard mapping first we obtained discharges for 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods the instantaneous flood discharges were obtained as 408 534 660 and 754 m3 s for 20 50 100 and 200 years return periods fig 3 a shows that the maximum inundation depth for 200 years return period is 4 2 m most of the areas across the catchment depict the inundation depth between 0 5 2 5 m for 200 years return period fig 3a b c and d highlight that the inundation depth was less in the left bank of the river due to higher topographical relief than the right bank as shown in fig 3b the maximum inundation depth is 4 12 m for 100 years return period the maximum inundation depths for 50 and 20 years return periods were obtained as 4 and 3 85 m respectively the variation in the maximum inundation depth is not wide possibly because there is no significant elevation difference between the river channel and adjoining areas channel shifting and formation of artificial levees due to aggradation would act as the border between the river and agricultural land this peculiarity sometimes leads to high inundation depth even beyond the river channel channel shifting in the khando river occurs primarily due to the occurrence of loose soil and subsequent erosion fig 3a b c and d collectively delineate that with the decrement in inundation depth the larger fraction of the catchment would be less inundated this means when the maximum depth of inundation decreases more areas tend to be exposed to less than 0 5 m inundation 3 2 flood vulnerability of residential wattle and daub buildings 3 2 1 flood performance of residential buildings after the 2017 flood in central and eastern nepal we conducted field surveys in the affected areas mainly in sunsari and saptari districts in eastern nepal the survey was dedicated to assessing the damage mechanisms and damage levels in affected structures and infrastructures the major damage location was across the khando river in saptari district the most affected building form was the wattle and daub system similar observations were made also in sunsari district wattle and daub constructions are low cost folded bamboo constructions with thatched or galvanized iron gi roofing with bamboo or concrete post with marginal usually single reinforcement that would be available in the local market wattle and daub buildings are usually one to two storied constructions that usually do not have specific foundations rather bamboo or concrete pillars inserted on the ground serve as the foundation system the pillars would not be tied at the plinth level however they would be tied at the eaves level with folded bamboo sheets the wall system comprises the folded bamboo sheets or shrub shoots the wall skeleton would be then plastered with the clay usually mixed with cow dung the wall thickness would be uniform throughout the dwelling including the partition walls as shown in fig 4 a the concrete pillars of a wattle and daub house were washed away by the flood due to the lack of adequate stiffness of walls and pillars water current easily washed away the walls and pillars we did not observe any connection to tie up the structural system pillars and walls thus the effect of water current became more localized leading to the collapse of some parts of the house fig 4b shows a washed away wattle and daub house that was fixed again for temporary use it is worthy to note that the brittle damages in structural members were scarce however the poor connections and less depth of insertions on the ground fundamentally affected the performance of houses during flood fig 4c shows the remains of a wall of wattle and daub house made up of bamboo pillars as shown in fig 4c a thin sheet of walls could be observed which leads to negligible stiffness against the water current during flooding fig 4d displays a house with ejected and distorted concrete pillars together with some washed away wattle and daub walls we measured the depth of inundation between 2 170 cm in the affected areas the inundation depth of 2 cm had negligible to slight damage in houses however 170 cm depth of inundation led to complete collapse to beyond repair damage level nearby the east west highway in saptari district we observed a spectacular example of reinforced concrete rc building damage fig 5 a at the depth of inundation of 2 5 m the foundation of the building was washed away and the frame was also heavily damaged the building was under construction and we observed that the building was not code conforming due to lack of adequate ductile detailing the flooded water discharge got high velocity in a narrow channel passing through the foundation and heavy erosion occurred subsequently leading to the collapse the rc building fig 5b shows an example of a concrete pillar inserted into the piled up clay that serves as the plinth it is obvious that once eroded the pillars would distort or get washed away in fig 5c a mixed construction system could be observed that came into practice after the 2008 flood in the affected areas of saptari and sunsari districts the walls normal to the likely flood direction were made up of single wythed brick masonry to increase stiffness however the orthogonal walls were still constructed using wattle and daub system it is interesting to note that the first story of the house is constructed with brick and the second story was continued with wattle and daub system possibly due to the assumption that the flood may rise to the first story level only such construction systems are designated to be flood resilient similar resilient practices are also reported elsewhere see e g gautam et al 2016 fig 5d shows a vernacular form of a residential building in which the first story is a multi wythed brick masonry and the second story comprises timber construction the construction system in southern nepal is mostly governed by reinforced concrete brick masonry and wattle and daub notably the importance of wattle and daub is more than any other building form due to several reasons the first is that the wattle and daub construction is the most popular amongst low income to poor people who could not afford modern and expensive housing similarly wattle and daub is the most widely practiced in the slum areas and such areas generally occur in the river banks where land would be available free of cost thus flood impact on wattle and daub buildings would be more pronounced not only due to their inherent vulnerabilities but also due to their vast presence in the flood prone areas 3 2 2 flood vulnerability and fragility functions for wattle and daub dwellings based on the data collected during the field survey we constructed a vulnerability curve for the wattle and daub construction system the vulnerability curve considering the logit function was derived as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 inundation up to 20 cm depicts the damage ratio less than 10 inundation of 50 cm leads to 20 damage inundation of 1 m leads to 50 damage and inundation of 1 6 m results in 90 damage to wattle and daub dwellings notably slight to minor damages need scrutinized efforts to demarcate hence the lower inundation depths hardly contribute in construction of vulnerability curve which is often regarded as the depth damage curve obtaining discrete data points is challenging especially in the case of flood events because most of the heavily damaged and collapsed buildings would not show the actual impression of inundation depth however we assessed distinctly inundated and damage wattle and daub dwellings during the field survey the inundation scenario comparable to the 2017 flood was reflected by the 20 years return period flood the average inundation along the bank where the damage has occurred was 1 5 m similarly the average depth of inundation was also 1 5 m for the riverbank this is evident that the 20 years return period can cause significant damage to wattle and daub buildings thus to predict the probabilistic performance of wattle and daub constructions vulnerability and fragility curves derived in this study play a vital role both vulnerability and fragility curves could be used to get the probability of damage damage level exceedance for a particular inundation depth from any return period at higher return periods the inundation depth would be higher in general the expected performance level or damage level of wattle and daub construction system could be estimated from figs 6 and 7 we further processed the data to construct fragility functions for five damage classes among 34 damage cases 12 5 houses depicted minor damage 25 depicted major damage 18 75 depicted severe damage 25 depicted beyond repair damage and 18 75 depicted collapse damage state considering the mean damage ratio for each damage state lognormal distribution parameters were estimated however the quality of fragility functions was not satisfactory due to the limited database that resulted in intersecting curves thereafter we re assessed the quality of fragility functions considering the distribution of standard deviation per eqs 4 and 5 4 β i 1 n i 1 n β i 5 α i e 1 28 β β i ln α i herein β i and α i represent the adjusted lognormal standard deviation and median for particular damage state i after distributing the lognormal standard deviations obtained initially we adjusted the median parameter α the summary of corrected lognormal distribution parameters is presented in table 1 as all the preceding fragility curve intersected the following curve the redistribution of the lognormal standard deviation resulted in the same value for all five classes however significant variation in terms of median depth of inundation m was observed as shown in table 1 the parameters were then plotted to obtain the fragility functions for five damage states as shown in fig 7 fig 7 highlights that up to the inundation depth of 30 cm only minor damages are expected similarly initiation of collapse with the probability of exceedance less than 5 is expected after the inundation depth of 75 cm at a depth of 1 2 m the probabilities of exceedance of collapse beyond repair severe major and minor damage states are respectively 10 25 40 70 and 90 as 1 2 m depth of inundation is quite common during every monsoon in the southern plains of nepal it could be concluded that most of the wattle and daub houses would not be usable at this depth thus there is an urgent need for improvement in the wattle and daub housing construction system to assure flood resilience as the total cost of construction of wattle and daub houses ranges between us 50 500 low cost improvements are important because the owners cannot afford drastic improvements due to cost issues 4 conclusions flood hazard assessment is conducted for frequently flooding khando river catchment in eastern nepal using rainfall data of 47 years we estimated inundation depths for the catchment and prepared flood hazard maps for 20 50 100 and 200 years return period the results highlight that the maximum inundation depth does not vary significantly as highlighted by the range of 3 85 4 20 m for 20 and 200 years return periods respectively more than 95 of the study area is likely to observe inundation depth up to 1 5 m for all return periods considered in this study the outcomes of the flood hazard assessment are subject to flood vulnerability analysis of existing building types using the survey data forensic interpretations of the damaged structures are reported in this study we used the damage ratio and inundation depth to create vulnerability and fragility functions the vulnerability analysis of the wattle and daub construction concludes that the wattle and daub houses would observe damage even at low inundation depth up to 0 5 m meanwhile at a depth of 1 7 m most of the wattle and daub houses are expected to collapse fragility functions considering five damage grades are constructed in this study the flood hazard maps indicate that 1 5 m inundation would commonly occur hence it is obvious that the wattle and daub construction system would be frequently affected by the flood causing enormous losses of lives and properties the average measured inundation depth was nearly equal to the estimated inundation depth for 20 years return period flood which highlights that the 2017 event was equivalent to 20 years return period rainfall even at the inundation depth of 1 7 m more than 95 of the wattle and daub houses would collapse as reflected by the newly developed fragility functions similarly at a depth of inundation of 2 5 m even poorly engineered rc buildings would collapse the low rate of collapse and severe damage statistics is also attributed to a smaller number of buildings across the catchment all the hazard maps depict that more than 95 of areas would have inundation depth within 1 5 m this indicates that the settlements with predominant wattle and daub constructions across the riverbanks would be severely affected by floods of low return periods too the juxtaposition of fragility functions and flood hazard maps highlights that the wattle and daub constructions are highly vulnerable to even 20 years return period flood for the non perennial spring rivers flood events are quite frequent and loss of lives and properties is reported almost every year thus improvement of conventional wattle and daub system is urgent to save lives and properties in similar catchments the fragility functions developed in this study represent the wattle and daub constructions in the southern plains of nepal and may not represent the probability of damage occurrence for other environments such as the mountain torrents future studies may incorporate calibration of discharge estimation method with recorded discharge data to obtain more representative discharge values this may improve the flood mapping results in data scarce environments such as the khando river catchment similarly the vulnerability and fragility functions may be also improved using more damage data coverage of broad areas during survey would also improve the quality of fragility functions as a more discrete

land cover area under soybean production sb and n fertilizer application napp on variations in streamflow sf baseflow bf and n load in the des moines the iowa and the raccoon rivers new hydrological insights for the region ln sf and ln bf for all three rivers were influenced by the current year p1 and previous year p2 precipitations presence of p2 in the regression suggested a deficit or excess soil water that influenced fillable pore space causing decreased or increased river flows the ln n load for the raccoon river was also related to p1 and p2 but the ln n load for the des moines and the iowa rivers were related to p1 with p values of p2 slightly above α 0 05 for significance presence of p2 in ln n load regression reflected changes in both fillable porosity and residual soil n contributions of sb and napp in explaining variations in predictor variables were none to minimal we conclude that wet climate and not changes in sb or napp is the primary reason for recent higher n

expansion of the hypoxic zone in the northern gulf of mexico has been linked to increases in discharge of freshwater and nitrogen n from the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2002 forrest et al 2012 scavia et al 2017 these increases in turn have been attributed to the adoption of agricultural practices such as the installation of subsurface tile drainage and increased use of n fertilizers in the united states corn belt alexander and smith 1990 keeney and deluca 1993 lucey and goolsby 1993 broussard and turner 2009 the presence of hypoxic oxygen level 2 mg l conditions make gulf water inhabitable for aquatic organisms thus earning the name of dead zone in the northern gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2002 according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa the dead zone has varied from less than 500 km2 in 1988 to over 22 730 km2 in 2017 https www epa gov ms htf northern gulf mexico hypoxic zone the usepa has set a goal of reducing this hypoxic zone from a 5 year average of 15 000 km2 to 5000 km2 by 2035 studies by goolsby et al 1999 2001 on the mississippi atchafalaya river basin showed that watersheds in southern minnesota iowa illinois indiana and ohio were the main source of n to the gulf of mexico the mean annual no3 n flux from these watersheds to the gulf of mexico was 0 95 million metric tons from 1980 to 1996 goolsby et al 1999 2001 specifically the no3 n yield in three iowa rivers the raccoon river 26 1 kg n ha 1 yr 1 the iowa river 17 7 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and the des moines river 16 9 kg n ha 1 yr 1 were among the highest in the mississippi river basin goolsby et al 1999 2001 besides tile drainage and n fertilizer use other studies have linked land use land cover lulc changes to increases in n load nload in rivers of the mississippi river basin one such change is the adoption of soybean glycine max l merr in the landscape replacing small grains and native prairies it has been suggested that since soybean is planted later in the season compared to small grains and emergence of native prairie grasses this results in less evapotranspiration et in early spring thus causing higher baseflow bf schilling and libra 2003 zhang and schilling 2006 n concentrations schilling and lutz 2004 and nloads schilling and zhang 2004 the schilling and libra 2003 analysis covered eleven rivers in iowa whereas the schilling and lutz 2004 and schilling and zhang 2004 analysis covered n concentration data for the raccoon river the zhang and schilling 2006 study dealt with several rivers of the mississippi river basin with a special focus on the upper mississippi river at keokuk ia these authors attributed increased streamflow sf 51 and bf 66 from 1940 to 2000 mainly to adoption of soybean in the cropping system soybean addition in the cropping system has also been suggested to contribute additional n due to higher rates of soybean residue mineralization jones et al 2016 however the above mentioned studies have minimized or ignored the impact of changing climate on increased sf bf and nload in iowa rivers ryberg et al 2014 gupta et al 2016a in some studies the authors have also used percentage change to highlight the role of lulc over precipitation for example zhang and schilling 2006 suggested that slight change in precipitation 7 5 cannot be the reason for large changes in sf 51 and bf 66 however such comparisons are not appropriate because of the difference in the relative values of the denominators large for precipitation compared to small for sf and bf in percent calculations recently the national climate assessment has shown a 10 15 increase in annual precipitation in iowa from 1991 to 2012 relative to 1901 1960 melillo 2014 in some areas of iowa this increase in precipitation was 15 gupta et al 2015 showed a distinct increasing trend in 30 year normal precipitation 1920 1949 1950 1979 and 1980 2009 in various iowa watersheds considering a 10 15 increase in average precipitation in recent years it is not surprising that drain tile installation has increased in many parts of the upper midwest including iowa to mitigate excessive soil wetness for farming operations there have been some efforts in the literature to characterize climate impacts on nloads in various rivers of the upper midwest for example lucey and goolsby 1993 noted that in 17 years of records for the raccoon river higher nloads followed two less than normal precipitation years 1988 and 1989 this suggested that during dry years nitrate was accumulating in the soil due to both limited water and nutrient uptake by plants these authors suggested a four variable model that explained 70 of the variability in no3 n concentrations in the raccoon river among the explanatory variables the mean sf for the previous seven days explained 50 of the variability the other explanatory variables in the model were the soil moisture conditions and sine and cosine functions of time donner and scavia 2007 showed that previous november december plus march may precipitation amounts in the u s corn belt were a strong predictor of spring n flux in the mississippi river at st francisville louisiana gentry et al 2014 showed that the current year water yield accounted for 87 and 79 of the variability in annual no3 n yield in the embarrass and the kaskaskia rivers in illinois respectively addition of previous year s water and corn zea mays l yields along with the amount of fall applied n fertilizer in the regression explained 96 of the variability in annual no3 n yield in these rivers since water yield from a watershed is related to precipitation this shows that there must be some relationship between river nloads and precipitation in the watershed by comparing the discharge and nitrate concentrations between 2009 and 2012 davis et al 2014 showed that no3 n loading of clear creek iowa was highly dependent on inter annual antecedent moisture conditions because of the variation in previous year precipitation the authors suggested that antecedent soil moisture and subsurface hydrologic connectivity dictated the dominant hydrologic pathways for sf and n loading using the flow normalized no3 no2 n concentrations from 2000 to 2012 in 10 major rivers in iowa green et al 2014 showed that recent declining trends in n concentrations were related to both very high and very low sf as well as to long residence times in some basins years of high sf wet climate caused dilution as well as depletion of stored n whereas low sf dry climate years resulted in reduced n transport as well as increased n storage the authors postulated that decreasing trends in flow normalized n concentrations fn in central iowa basin rivers raccoon des moines iowa skunk little sioux rivers were likely due to smaller storage volume and shorter residence time 1 year in the des moines lobe landforms comparatively increasing trends in river fn outside the central iowa basin the maquoketa river and the wapsipinicon river were due to longer residence time 5 10 years trends in fn varied between 0 4 mg l 1 y 1 to 0 3 mg l 1 y 1 for various decades 1970 1980 1980 2000 and 2000 2012 recently loecke et al 2017 developed a weather whiplash index to characterize climate impacts on water quality in agricultural regions of the midwest united states their emphasis was on showing the effects of drought to flood transition on water quality degradation the authors implied that drought conditions resulted in highly n enriched soils which on subsequent heavy rains contributed to excessive n mobilization using the data for the iowa river at wapello ia these authors showed that drought conditions of 2012 resulted in a 118 increase in n flux and a 34 increase in flow weighted n concentration fwnc in 2013 the weather whiplash index was calculated as total precipitation from january to june of each year minus the total precipitation from july to december of the previous year divided by the total precipitation over the entire period the authors concluded that climate change will intensify this weather whiplash effects resulting in more frequent riverine n concentrations exceeding the usepa standard of 10 mg no3 n l 1 in comparing n losses from two small agricultural watersheds with similar soil types in minnesota and iowa kalkhoff et al 2016a b showed that n loss was primarily controlled by sf precipitation effect although the rate of increase in annual n loss was similar between the two watersheds n losses were greater from the iowa watershed south fork river than the minnesota watershed little cobb the authors attributed these differences to differences in total n inputs 134 kg n ha 1 in south fork river watershed compared to 121 kg n ha 1 in little cobb between the watersheds considering that the minnesota watershed is about 160 km north of the iowa watershed some of the differences in n losses may also be due to differences in temperature i e cooler temperature in minnesota resulting in less soil organic matter mineralization and thus less n losses analyzing data from 154 watersheds in the united states and europe howarth et al 2012 concluded that nitrogen flux to coastal marine areas was strongly related to net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs nani and climate n losses were 25 of the nani above the threshold of 10 7 kg n ha 1 y 1 as compared to 16 below the threshold however this threshold of nani is much lower than the n fertilizer recommended rates of 150 200 kg n ha 1 y 1 for corn in the midwest us sawyer et al 2006 kaiser et al 2018 from 1987 2007 hong et al 2011 reported nani values of 65 77 kg n ha 1 y 1 65 81 kg n ha 1 y 1 and 54 59 kg n ha 1 y 1 for the des moines raccoon and iowa rivers respectively howarth et al 2012 also showed that the fraction of nani exported in long term average riverine n flux was significantly related to temperature and precipitation but the explanatory power of these variables was weak comparatively a fraction of nani exported in rivers was highly correlated to sf but these authors questioned if the higher correlation was due to autocorrelation since sf was used to estimate riverine n flux using the annual total n flux qtn from 70 catchments in the continental united states over five years 1987 1992 1997 2002 and 2007 sinha and michalak 2016 showed that nani precipitation and land use explained 68 76 in ln qtn of its variability differences in qtn across the continental united states were primarily driven by n inputs whereas interannual variability and the occurrence of extremes in a given catchment were controlled by variation in precipitation recent studies by gupta et al 2015 2016a b 2018 showed that both annual sf and annual bf in rivers of minnesota and iowa are exponentially related to precipitation in the current year as well as with precipitation in the previous year s prior year s precipitation accounted for stored soil water and its effects on increased or decreased fillable soil pore space and in turn on increased or decreased percolation and overland flow losses gupta et al 2015 2016b 2018 further showed that recent increased sf and bf were mainly due to recent increases in precipitation and not due to land use changes such as the adoption of soybean over prairies and small grains as suggested in the literature schilling and lutz 2004 zhang and schilling 2006 gupta et al 2016a the iowa rivers analyzed by gupta et al 2016a 2018 included the raccoon river and the maquoketa river these studies thus raise the question how are recent increases in precipitation affecting river nload relative to changes in inorganic n fertilizer input napp and land cover the objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of changes in precipitation napp and land cover on annual nload and fwnc in three iowa rivers the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river since nload and fwnc are affected by variations in sf and bf we also report the effect of precipitation and land cover changes on variations in annual sf and bf in these rivers as sf is a major factor in nload calculations and has been shown to be primarily controlled by precipitation gupta et al 2015 2018 we hypothesized that variation in nload will also be controlled by variation in precipitation 2 methods 2 1 study rivers and associated watershed characteristics three rivers analyzed in this study and their gauge locations were the des moines river at the 2nd avenue bridge in des moines ia the iowa river at wapello ia and the raccoon river at van meter ia fig 1 the des moines and the raccoon rivers drain the north central region of iowa an area also known as the des moines lobe region this area was last glaciated 11 000 14 000 years before present and thus has the youngest and most productive soils in the state green et al 2014 the dominating soil associations in this region include the clarion nicollet webster canisteo clarion nicollet and canisteo nicollet clarion usda nrcs 2008 organic matter contents of nicollet webster and canisteo soils are generally in the range of 5 5 6 5 whereas organic matter content of clarion soil varies from 2 7 to 3 5 al kaisi et al 2012 the undulating surface leftover from last glaciation results in poor surficial drainage of the landscape furthermore tight packing of till particles resulting from the weight of glaciers also slows percolation of rain water through the soil leading to the development of a perched water table in the root zone to remediate this excessive soil wetness and provide soil conditions for optimal farming operations and crop growth most of the agricultural land in the des moines lobe is tile drained although the iowa river also originates in the des moines lobe region upper iowa river flows through the area known as iowan surface whereas the lower iowa river flows through the southern iowa drift plain prior 1991 green et al 2014 iowan surface is free of glacier surges but also has low relief with lands slightly inclined to gently rolling and long slopes prior 1991 the southern iowa drift plains are primarily composed of glacial drift similar to that of des moines lobe but of much older times prior 1991 most of the land surface is sloping towards natural drainage channels giving the look of a dendritic network the dominating soil associations in the iowa river watershed are the tama colo tama muscatine and tama killduff and tama shelby usda nrcs 2008 organic matter content of tama killduff and shelby soil series varies from 1 7 to 2 7 whereas the average organic matter content of the colo and the muscatine soil series is around 5 5 and 6 respectively al kaisi et al 2012 in summarizing the soil carbon distribution in iowa landscape al kaisi et al 2012 showed that the raccoon river and the des moines river flowed through soils with a high carbon index 38 43 whereas the iowa river flowed through soils with lower carbon index 22 37 these authors defined the carbon index as the depth 100 cm weighted carbon content of a soil relative to that of okoboji mucky silty clay loam a mineral soil with the highest soil organic carbon in iowa the des moines river is the longest 845 km river in iowa fig 1 the distance from source headwaters to the 2nd avenue bridge is approximately 542 km the mean slope of the watershed is 0 7 cm m 1 green et al 2014 the soils developed from the glacial till parent material are primarily clay loam in texture with mean clay and sand contents of 26 and 30 respectively green et al 2014 of the des moines river basin 78 of the area is under row crops of corn and soybean 18 5 is forest grasslands and wetlands and 2 5 is under urban use schilling and wolter 2009 data analysis covered the period from 1984 to 2014 during which the average annual precipitation equaled 814 mm table 1 the iowa river is 480 km long and is a primary tributary to the mississippi river fig 1 the mean slope of the landscape is 1 6 cm m 1 green et al 2014 of the iowa river basin 74 of the area is corn and soybean 9 3 is residential 6 2 is hay 5 7 is grass or prairie 3 3 is forest and 1 3 is others wieczorek and lamotte 2010 the soils in the watershed are partially developed from loess and partially from glacial till parent materials nrcs 2008 with mean clay and sand content of 26 and 23 respectively green et al 2014 data analysis covered the period from 1978 to 2013 during which the average annual precipitation equaled 892 mm table 1 the raccoon river also located in des moines lobe is 364 km long and is a tributary of the des moines river fig 1 the mean slope of the area is 1 5 cm m 1 green et al 2014 seventy six percent of the raccoon river basin is under row crops of corn and soybean 17 is grassland 4 is forest 2 is urban use and 1 is water schilling et al 2008 the soils in the watershed are primarily developed from the glacial till parent material with mean clay and sand contents of 27 each green et al 2014 data analysis covered the period from 1974 to 2011 during which the average annual precipitation equaled 819 mm table 1 the bf contributions in these rivers are both from drain tiles bank storage and surficial and bedrock aquifers the surficial aquifers include alluvium glacial till and loess materials with thickness that can vary from none in northeast iowa to over 180 m in west central iowa prior et al 2003 below the surficial aquifer lie the sedimentary bedrock aquifers of limestone dolomite and sandstone from as far back as the cretaceous and cambrian periods prior et al 2003 drain tile water includes precipitation that infiltrates as well as infiltration of runoff from adjacent uplands in depressions thompson 1984 schulmeyer and schnoebelen 1998 bank storage results when the river stage is higher than the water table and water infiltrates into the bank but returns as seepage when the river stage returns to normal similarly surficial and bedrock aquifers contribute to baseflow when the stream stage is lower than the water table much of the surficial material in the des moines river and the raccoon river basins is slowly permeable deep glacial tills comparatively in the iowa river basin surficial materials vary from loess in the northeast to glacial till in southwest because of karst landscape in northeast iowa there are likely more contributions from the sedimentary aquifers to baseflow in the iowa river than the des moines river and the raccoon river depending upon the model used for estimating annual fwnc green et al 2014 estimated no3 n residence time of 1 year for the des moines river and the raccoon river watersheds and 1 5 years for the iowa river watershed the baseflow index baseflow as a percent of streamflow for the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river over the study periods corresponded to 72 72 and 64 respectively the study periods for the three rivers are different mainly because the authors wanted to maximize the use of all available nload data since annual sf is primarily a water balance problem sf p et δs where sf bf stormflow p is precipitation and δs is change in soil storage and nloads are controlled by bf tile flow aquifer contributions differences in the study period among the three rivers will not affect the relative importance of explanatory variables affecting nloads 2 2 data sources annual and monthly sf and nload no3 no2 n data for the des moines river and the iowa river were taken from the united states geological survey usgs open file report aulenbach et al 2007 daily n concentrations for the raccoon river were acquired from the des moines water works jeff mitchell laboratory supervisor des moines river water works personal communication 2015 since n concentrations were measured in water samples at the des moines water works downstream of the van meter and walnut creek gauges fig 1 the daily flows at the des moines water works were estimated as the sum of the daily flows in the raccoon river at van meter plus the daily flows in the walnut creek these flow values were then used to calculate monthly and annual nloads daily and monthly sf data for the raccoon river at van meter and the walnut creek were taken from the usgs national water information system https waterdata usgs gov ia nwis current type flow annual precipitation data for all three watersheds were downloaded from the prism climate group website http www prism oregonstate edu iowa county n fertilizer use was acquired from the usgs s national water quality assessment program brakebill and gronberg 2017 whereas the county crop area statistics were downloaded from the national agricultural statistics service nass database http quickstats nass usda gov the above data were then weighted by various county areas in each watershed to estimate napp and crop area distributions by watersheds wolf 2017 the annual bf for all three rivers was calculated from the daily sf data https waterdata usgs gov ia nwis current type flow using the usgs part program rutledge 2007 however in the case of the raccoon river bf was based on the daily sf only at the van meter gauge site and does not include bf contributions from walnut creek considering that the walnut creek sf is about 5 of the raccoon river flow at van meter we assumed its contributions to bf would be relatively small annual fwnc for various rivers were calculated by dividing the annual n loads with corresponding stream flows 2 3 data analysis the procedures for assessment of precipitation lulc and napp change effects on variations in sf bf nload and fwnc for each river were similar to the approach used by gupta et al 2015 and 2018 briefly the procedure involved a backward stepwise regression of ln annual streamflow sfa ln annual baseflow bfa ln annual n load nloada or annual fwnc fwnca as the predictor variable and precipitation p and area under soybean production sb and napp as the explanatory variables we used the p values of explanatory variables in assessing their power to explain the variability in the predictor variables the lower the p value the higher was the explaining power of that variable annual data in this study refers to the calendar year before the regression analysis sf bf nload and fwnc were tested for normal distribution using the shapiro wilk test miller 1997 and in the case of sf bf and nload a natural logarithmic transformation was needed to transform the data to a normal distribution a finding similar to that of schilling and libra 2003 the fwnc in most cases did not require a natural logarithmic transformation to make the data a normal distribution and thus its regressions were run without any transformations the explanatory variables in the regression analysis included not only the precipitation in a given year p1 but also in the previous 1 2 years p2 p3 we only tested the inclusion of p2 and p3 in the regression because a previous study by gupta et al 2018 showed precipitations in the previous 3rd and 4th years were not significant in explaining the variation of sfa and bfa in minnesota and iowa rivers since previous studies in iowa had suggested the adoption of soybean affected both evapotranspiration schilling and libra 2003 and n mineralization jones et al 2016 we included the area under soybean production both in the current year sb1 as well as in the previous year sb2 as explanatory variables in the regression eq 1 1 p r e d i c t e d v a r i a b l e β 0 β 1 x p 1 β 2 x p 2 β 3 x p 3 β 4 x s b 1 β 5 x s b 2 ε where the predictor variable can be ln sfa ln bfa ln nloada or fwnca β0 to β5 are the regression coefficients and ε is the error term since n fertilizer use data were only available from 1987 2012 a narrow period compared to the period for nload data a separate set of regressions covering only this period was also run with napp as an additional explanatory variable eq 2 2 p r e d i c t e d v a r i a b l e β 0 β 1 x p 1 β 2 x p 2 β 3 x p 3 β 4 x s b 1 β 5 x s b 2 β 6 x n a p p ε backward stepwise regression analysis involved stepwise deletion of explanatory variables from the regression that did not meet the significant criteria of α 0 05 the p value of a given explanatory variable in the regression was taken from an analysis of variance anova tables generated during the regression analysis homogeneity of variances was checked by plotting the residuals versus the predicted values which showed that the residuals were uniformly distributed around the zero line durbin watson statistics were also run to check for the presence of autocorrelation prediction errors in the residuals from the regression the statistical analysis was done using the r statistical package r core team 2016 or the excel data analysis tool microsoft office 2009 the p1 sfa bfa nloada and fwnca data were also tested for temporal trends using the mann kendall test these trend analyses and estimation of the sen s slope were done using xlstat 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 processes contributing to variations in n loads from 1987 2012 napp varied from 55 8 96 5 kg n ha 1 for the des moines river 58 8 97 5 kg n ha 1 for the iowa river and 54 1 96 3 kg n ha 1 for the raccoon river watersheds fig 2 these n application rates are lower than the recommended n application rates for corn 150 200 kg n ha 1 because they are based on the total watershed area which includes the area under legume crops such as soybean as well as non agricultural areas where there is limited to no n applications mann kendall trend test showed an increasing trend in napp from 1987 to 2012 with corresponding sen s slope of 1 1 0 6 and 1 0 kg n ha 1 y 1 for the des moines river watershed the iowa river watershed and the raccoon river watershed respectively furthermore napp showed a strong positive correlation with the area under corn production r2 0 67 0 63 and 0 73 for the des moines the iowa and the raccoon river watersheds respectively indicating the increase in napp was likely from the increased area brought under corn production except for fwnca for the raccoon river the mann kendall test showed no significant temporal trends in p1 sfa bfa nloada or fwnca for any of the watersheds rivers over the study periods table s1 increasing trend in fwnca for the raccoon river sen s slope 0 08 mg l 1yr 1 p 0 05 table s1 was also barely within the cutoff limit of α 0 05 for significance the temporal distribution plots not shown also showed that for a similar amount of p1 in a given watershed the sfa or the bfa were not the same over the study period this is mainly because of the variations in 1 timing and amount of precipitation between years and 2 fillable soil pore space or soil stored water at the start of a given year resulting from variation in previous year s precipitation gupta et al 2018 similar to sfa and bfa nloada was also different for a given level of p1 in a watershed because of the differences in bf as well as residual soil n at the end of the previous year again an effect of the previous year s precipitation in the following discussion we use a subset of data from 1986 to 1993 table 2 to illustrate the processes contributing to temporal variation in sfa bfa and nloada in this subset of data it is unlikely that the length of tile drainage area under soybean production or n fertilizer application varied drastically from year to year thus the year to year variation in sfa bfa fwnca and nloada in this subset of data are largely from variability in precipitation between the years and not due to annual changes in tile length sb1 or napp the sfa bfa and nloada for all three rivers were the lowest in 1989 and highest in 1993 over the study periods table 2 lower sfa and bfa in 1989 were mainly due to less than average precipitation in 1989 as well as due to additional fillable soil pore space that was generated during two previous dry years 1987 1988 the additional fillable soil pore space helped retain a higher amount of the 1989 precipitation in soil thus lowering the sfa and bfa in 1989 since nitrate and nitrite are soluble and move with water through the soil less water losses from the landscape lower sf including bf in 1989 helped lower nloads in these rivers table 2 this is in spite of the fact that there was likely more n remaining in the soil at the start of 1989 because of less leaching and less plant uptake in previous dry years of 1987 and 1988 randall et al 1997 goolsby et al 1999 2001 subsequently in 1990 sfa and bfa were still less than what should have been for the corresponding above average precipitation in 1990 this was again due to above average fillable pore space available at the start of 1990 a result of 1987 1989 drier conditions this additional fillable soil pore space retained some of the precipitation water in 1990 thus reducing its sfa and bfa the generation of fillable soil pore space during below average precipitation years and its role in lowering sf and bf in the subsequent wet year has been documented by gupta et al 2015 2016b 2018 who concluded that sfa and bfa are affected by not only the p1 but also by p2 and in some cases by p3 in 1993 sfa and bfa were the highest not only because of the highest precipitation in that year but also due to less fillable soil pore space more soil stored water resulting from above average precipitations in 1991 and 1992 table 2 the effect of higher soil wetness is not only on increased overland flow but also on higher percolation losses through both drain tile and groundwater baseflow the higher baseflow resulting from high precipitation in 1993 as well as some additional n remaining in the soil from 1987 to 1989 dry years led to the highest nloads in the iowa river and the raccoon river and the second highest nload in the des moines river during the study periods table 2 randall et al 1997 documented similar findings of higher tile drain n losses in normal and wet years 1991 1993 following the dry years 1988 1990 in southcentral minnesota the effects of previous dry and wet years were also apparent in plots of sfa bfa and nloada versus p1 for the three rivers in this study figs 3 5 wet and dry year characterization in this discussion is relative to precipitation values between two consecutive years under discussion table s2 this characterization is only meant to highlight the underlying mechanism of available soil pore space and not to provide an algorithm for modeling in these graphs the best fit line represents an average sfa bfa and nloada contributions at a given level of p1 in case of sfa figs 3a 4 a 5 a some of the scatter around the line is from differences in timing of precipitation events and variation in et between years however some additional scatter further away from the line also includes the effect of soil wetness conditions fillable pore space resulting from previous year s precipitation for example the red data points in these graphs represent the upper limit of sfa whereas the dark blue data points represent the lower limit of the sfa the presence of these points as the lower and upper limits of sfa figs 3a 4 a 5 a are not due to changes in lulc soybean area or tile drainage or napp between the years but are mainly due to previous precipitation history p2 p3 affecting fillable soil porosity the red data points in figs 3a 4 a and 5 a correspond to years when the previous year was a wet year whereas the dark blue data points in these figures correspond to years when the previous year was a dry year table s2 there were two exceptions to these rules and they correspond to sfa for the des moines river in 2000 and the raccoon river in 2010 in the case of the des moines river precipitation in 1999 755 mm was about the same as that in 2000 752 mm and thus there was no clear evidence of the previous year 1999 being a dry year table s2 however both these precipitation values are on the drier end of the precipitation regime for this watershed fig 3a thus likely resulting in some presence of fillable pore space at the end of 1999 that reduced sfa in 2000 in the case of the raccoon river 2009 was a drier year 795 mm relative to 2010 1051 mm however precipitation in 2008 944 mm and 2007 985 mm was higher than that in 2009 and thus likely contributed some soil stored water to sfa in 2010 table s2 since bf is calculated from sf the previous year s precipitation effects also show up in bfa plots figs 3b 4 b 5 b with red data points corresponding to its upper limit and dark blue data points corresponding to its lower limit similarly since n losses from the landscape are controlled by bf tile drainage and groundwater flow the red and dark blue data points also reflect the upper and lower limits of nloada in these three rivers figs 3c 4 c 5 c slight shifts in the position of upper or lower limit nloada data points relative to sfa and bfa graphs then reflects the variations in precipitation as well as variation in n transformation that may be occurring between the years for example nloada for the des moines river in 2008 red data point at p1 805 mm is right on the line instead of the upper limit this shift occurred because there were substantial n losses in august 2007 due to above average precipitation 205 mm and consequently less n was available for leaching in 2008 the above results show that having drier conditions in the landscape at the start of the year dark blue data points will help lower sfa bfa and nloada comparatively the wet soil conditions at the start of the year red data points will lead to increased sfa bfa and nloada these findings are important considering suggestions have been made to hold water in uplands to mitigate the effects of recent increased precipitation on sf and nload baker et al 2012 unless the excess water is held in lined storage areas the above results suggest that holding water in uplands will change the water table and increase soil wetness thus resulting in more water percolation and higher n losses generally there was a weak correlation between the fwnca and p1 for all three rivers in this study figs 3d 4 d 5 d however fwnca of the iowa river was significantly related to p1 fig 4d there was also no difference in fwnca whether the previous year was a dry year or a wet year in the case of des moines river and the raccoon river fwnca values varied from 2 12 mg l 1 and 0 6 12 mg l 1 with a mean of 7 6 mg l 1 and 8 1 mg l 1 respectively comparatively fwnca for the iowa river varied between 3 and 10 mg l 1 and had a mean concentration of 6 8 mg l 1 slightly lower mean fwnca for the iowa river relative to the des moines and the raccoon rivers is surprising considering napp in these watersheds was nearly similar the mean 1987 2012 napp for the des moines the raccoon and the iowa rivers were 72 7 kg n ha 1 71 6 kg n ha 1 and 71 2 kg n ha 1 respectively slight differences in fwnca mentioned above may thus be related to some other n sources in these watersheds or just a random variation for the period 1987 2012 hong et al 2011 showed small differences in n contributions from atmospheric deposition 3 7 4 3 4 2 4 8 3 5 4 0 kg n ha 1 biological fixation 54 65 51 75 and 66 82 kg n ha 1 and manure n additions 13 17 18 20 and 20 22 kg n ha 1 figure s1 among the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river watersheds respectively another n source in these watersheds is the contribution from soil organic matter mineralization gentry et al 2009 showed that soil n mineralization could be a substantial contribution 42 49 of fertilizer n to n input fertilizer application of 184 kg n ha 1 in an illinois watershed since des moines lobe the des moines river and the raccoon river watersheds soils have higher organic matter content than the soils in iowan surface and southern iowa drift plain the iowa river watershed there could be higher contribution of soil organic matter mineralization in the des moines river and the raccoon river watersheds relative to the iowa river watershed another possibility could be more denitrification of groundwater n in the iowa river watershed due to higher residence time 1 5 years compared to the des moines river and the raccoon river watersheds 1 year green et al 2014 the data set in table 2 also highlight the pitfalls of using percent change in sfa or bfa relative to a percent change in p1 between any two years or two periods as an indication of lulc change impact on increased sfa or bfa zhang and schilling 2006 as an example p1 in the des moines river watershed between 1987 and 1992 changed by 19 727 mm vs 864 mm but there was a 143 110 mm vs 267 mm and a 135 78 mm vs 183 mm increase in sfa and bfa respectively table 2 the large differences in percent change for sfa or bfa relative to p1 between the above two years are not due to changes in lulc but is a result of large p1 727 mm or small sfa 110 mm bfa 78 mm values of the denominator in percent calculations the correct way to make change comparisons between these variables is to evaluate the changes in the depth of water between these variables in this example there was a 137 mm increase in precipitation between the two years which resulted in a 157 mm and a 105 mm increase in sfa and bfa respectively slightly higher 20 mm sfa relative to p1 could be due to previous year precipitation s or due to natural variations in the timing of precipitation events the area under soybean production in the des moines river watershed in 1987 and 1992 was similar 566 145 ha in 1987 vs 566 614 ha in 1992 3 2 relative ranking of explanatory variables to identify the relative ranking of precipitation p1 p2 p3 land use sb1 sb2 and napp as explanatory variables for describing the variation in ln sfa ln bfa and ln nloada of three iowa rivers we used the backward step wise regression statistical tests on sfa bfa and nloada data for all three rivers showed no violation of the independence of explanatory variables as well as no serial correlation in regression residuals durbin watson test based on the p values of significant explanatory variables the most important explanatory variables in explaining the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa were p1 followed by p2 for all three rivers during the study periods table 3 neither sb1 nor sb2 was a significant variable in explaining the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa for any of the rivers this lack of significance for the area under soybean production as an explanatory variable may be partly because the analysis periods were narrow table 1 and the temporal variation in the area under soybean production during these periods was minimal the absence of soybean area as a significant variable for ln sfa and ln bfa suggests that annual evapotranspiration differences from variation in crop cover as identified by schilling and libra 2003 and zhang and schilling 2006 were relatively small for any of the three watersheds analyzed in this study this is consistent with the observations of garcia y garcia and strock 2018 and baeumler et al 2019 who showed that annual et losses from corn soybean and prairie grasses were nearly similar furthermore some of the area under soybean production during the study periods likely came from area under small grains that have inherently lower consumptive use baeumler et al 2019 these authors also showed that et losses from recently burned prairies which occurred frequently in the pre change period were lower than the et losses from corn or soybean for the des moines river p1 and p2 explained 67 and 61 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively table 3 a comparison of r2 with and without the previous year s precipitation in the regression showed that the previous year s precipitation explained 9 of the variability in both ln sfa and ln bfa in terms of ln nloada for the des moines river only p1 was the significant variable and it explained 47 of its variability the p value of p2 p 0 06 in ln nloada regression was marginally over the cut off value of α 0 05 however as discussed above with respect to data in table 2 in some years p2 effects on sfa bfa and nloada lingered for several years an example of this observation was the effect of drier 1987 on sfa bfa and nloada in 1990 lower r2 values for ln nloada regression in table 3 reflects the variability in bfa and fwnca values as a result of variability in the amount and timing of precipitation between years in other words the same amount of precipitation does not occur on the same day every year this was apparent from higher adjusted r2 values in the monthly analyses results not reported here but available from the authors where the time interval is narrow and thus precipitation variability in a given month among various years is relatively small for the iowa river p1 and p2 explained 79 and 74 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively table 3 a comparison of r2 values with and without p2 in the regression suggested that the p2 explained 7 and 8 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively similar to the des moines river p1 was the only significant variable in explaining variability in ln nloada for the iowa river and it explained 70 of its variability however the p value of the p2 p 0 054 in ln nloada regression was only marginally above the cut off limit of α 0 05 for the raccoon river p1 and p2 explained 72 and 71 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively table 3 a comparison of r2 with and without p2 showed that p2 explained 12 and 16 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively besides the p1 and p2 sb2 was also significant in explaining the variability in ln nloada for this river table 3 a comparison of r2 with and without soybean area showed that sb2 explained 7 of the variability in ln nloada for the raccoon river an additional similar comparison of r2 showed that p2 explained 16 of the variability in ln nloada for the raccoon river again the lower adjusted r2 0 54 for the ln nloada is likely from the variability in bfa and fwnca values as a result of variability in the amount and timing of precipitation among the years in addition not all precipitation events contribute to sfa bfa and thus to nloada in terms of fwnca there was no significant relationship with p1 p2 sb1 and sb2 for the des moines river however there was a significant relationship between the fwnca of the iowa river and p1 table 3 there was also a significant relationship r2 0 32 between fwnca and p2 p3 and sb2 for the raccoon river but the p values corresponding to p2 p 0 05 and p3 p 0 03 were relatively large and close to the cutoff value of α 0 05 for significance the regression coefficients corresponding to the annual analysis for all three rivers are summarized in table s3 since napp data covered a different period than the nload data for the rivers another similar regression of ln nloada with napp as an additional explanatory variable was run eq 2 this analysis showed no effect of variations in napp on variations in ln nloada for any of the rivers the p values of napp before its deletion from the step wise regression were 0 07 0 48 and 0 14 above the cut off limit α 0 05 for significance for the des moines the iowa and the raccoon rivers respectively however the deletion of napp from the regression did not occur at the same step in all three rivers the lack of significance for napp in the regression is partially because of small variations in annual napp during the study periods fig 2 considering nitrate nitrite are soluble and mostly move with the percolating water through the soil tile aquifer bf to rivers the relationships between nloada and bfa were also evaluated for these three rivers linear plots showed nloada was significantly related to bfa with r2 values of 0 72 0 84 and 0 83 for the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river respectively since nloads are calculated using sf and bf is also calculated from sf there is a concern that there may be some cross correlation between these quantities to explore this further we evaluated relationships between changes in nloada to changes in percent contribution of bfa to total sfa between two consecutive years figure s2 similar to nloada versus bfa relationships these relationships also showed that an increase in percent contributions of bfa to total sfa increased the nloada in these three rivers the corresponding r2 values were 0 65 0 77 and 0 69 for the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river respectively although estimates of bf contributions from aquifers relative to drain tiles are not available one can use bfa versus p1 relationships figs 3b 4 b 5 b to estimate bfa contributions from alluvial and sedimentary aquifers in no precipitation year intercept value of the exponential functions p1 0 for the three rivers in this study these contributions equaled 5 9 mm 14 1 mm and 5 9 mm for the des moines river fig 3b the iowa river fig 4b and the raccoon river fig 5c respectively these values are consistent with more permeable landscape features karst in northeast iowa higher values for the iowa river and less permeable glacial till of the des moines lobe in southcentral iowa lower values for the des moines river and the raccoon river since alluvial and sedimentary aquifers near these rivers take in water at high river stages and then discharge it back to the rivers as bf it is likely that the bf contributions from aquifers will increase with an increase in precipitation in summary the above results and the regression analyses showed that the variation in ln sfa ln bfa and ln nloada was primarily controlled by variation in annual precipitation both in the given year p1 and the previous year p2 previous year precipitation effects were more in terms of fillable soil porosity higher values of p2 meant less fillable soil porosity more stored soil water and thus more sfa bfa and higher nloada the effects of variation in the area under soybean production sb1 sb2 and napp on ln sfa and ln bfa and ln nloada were marginal to absent this may be partially due to the narrowness of the study periods during which there was a lack of dramatic change in both the area under soybean production and the n application rates these findings thus suggest that recent increases in sfa bfa and nloada in these iowa rivers and likely in the mississippi river are primarily due to increases in annual precipitation and not due to lulc changes or increase in napp 1987 2012 napp analysis period this finding is consistent with sinha and michalak 2016 observations that inter annual variability and the occurrence of extremes in river nloads in the united states are predominantly controlled by precipitation whereas its spatial variability across the united states is primarily driven by n inputs in this study the fwnca varied within a narrow range for a given river system and there was a lack of or weak relationship between the fwnca and p1 because of the concerns that river waters do not meet the drinking water standard efforts have also been made to identify factors influencing fwnca one such effort was by green et al 2014 who used 10 different models to relate fwnca to streamflow in the current and previous years sfa sfpre and napp these authors tested these models on data from 10 different iowa rivers they used linear weighting schemes to characterize the previous five years discharge sfpre the testing of these models showed that fwnca was primarily related to sfa furthermore sfpre explained additional variability especially decreasing trends in fwnca in 6 rivers and napp explained variability in four rivers similar to our study napp was not significant in explaining variability in fwnca of the des moines river the iowa river or the raccoon river the authors concluded that variability in napp relative to variability in sf precipitation was likely too small to substantially change stream water quality however the present analysis in this study and those of green et al 2014 are in the context of current cropping systems with current n application rates as shown by lawlor et al 2008 and jaynes 2015 n application substantially over and above the agronomic n rates will increase fwnc as well as nloads from tile drained plots considering all three rivers had an exponential relationship for sfa bfa and nloada with p1 table 3 fig 3 we further explored if there was any commonality in these relationships among the three rivers since sfa and bfa are expressed on a unit area basis we also converted nloada to unit area basis n yielda nloada watershed area plots of sfa bfa n yielda and fwnca as a function of p1 for the combined data from three rivers the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river showed that there existed a single relationship of sfa bfa or n yielda as a function of p1 for all three rivers fig 6 a b c the single relationship of sfa as a function of p1 for all three iowa rivers fig 6a is very similar to the single relationship sfa vs p1 for seven other midwestern rivers analyzed by baeumler and gupta 2020 scatter of the data around the line in fig 6a is due to variations in timing and intensity of precipitation events relative to the crop growth stage as well as the differences in the previous year s precipitation wetness effect the single exponential relationship of sfa suggests a near similar et at a given precipitation level irrespective of the river basin this is expected considering that corn soybean is the dominating cropping system in these three watersheds and annual river flows are controlled by the water balance an observation similar to that of baeumler and gupta 2020 a further comparison of sfa curves in fig 6 with similar curves of baeumler and gupta 2020 for seven midwest watersheds showed an overlap results not shown again validating the above findings that river flows are controlled by water balance and not by presence or absence of tile drainage gupta et al 2016b 2018 to further test if the sfa bfa or n yielda versus p1 relationship improves when p2 p3 sb1 and sb2 are incorporated into the regression we again ran the backward stepwise regression analysis on the combined ln sfa ln bfa or ln n yielda data from three rivers the p values showed that ln sfa ln bfa and ln n yielda were generally a function of p1 and p2 table 4 the corresponding adjusted coefficient of determination r2 were 0 74 0 70 and 0 54 for ln sfa ln bfa and ln n yielda respectively the combined fwnca values for three watersheds were weakly related to p1 and p3 and only explained 11 of its variability fig 6d the regression coefficients for the combined annual analysis are given in table s3 relatively there were small differences in napp as well as in manure n addition among the three watersheds figs 2 and s1 potentially there were also some differences in the timing of fertilizer and manure n applications among these watersheds in spite of these differences in n use among watersheds there was a single relationship that represented n yielda for all three rivers thus again highlighting that nloada in these three iowa rivers were primarily controlled by precipitation and to a lesser extent due to differences in lulc change or soil and crop management practices although there was no explanatory variable that accounted for management practices such as timing of n applications in the regression analysis the variability in nloada within each watershed as well as among watersheds figs 3 5 likely included not only the variability in precipitation but also some effects of variable management practices including timing of n applications in the watersheds in other words not all farmers apply the same amount of n fertilizer or at the same time thus within the range of variable n management practices used in these watersheds the above analysis shows that the effects of these management practices on nloada will be likely small under current cropping systems this is consistent with the data on effects of n management practices on tile drain n losses from small plot studies in iowa jaynes et al 2001 lawlor et al 2008 jaynes 2015 minnesota randall et al 2003 randall and vetsch 2005 and illinois pittelkow et al 2017 in all these studies there were larger differences in n losses from tile drained plots between years precipitation effect than between the n rate timing of n applications or even the use of nitrification inhibitors in a corn soybean cropping systems in many years the differences between various n management practices rate and timing in these studies were not significant generally flow normalized n losses losses per unit area per unit volume of drained water over several different n treatments in these studies were within a narrow range 0 5 2 3 kg n ha 1 cm 1 for example in the jaynes et al 2015 study in iowa flow normalized n losses in corn soybean rotation for three fertilizer treatments over 4 years averaged standard deviation 1 02 0 32 kg n ha 1 cm 1 comparatively in the lawlor et al 2008 study in iowa covering five n fertilizer treatments over 15 years flow normalized n losses averaged at 1 2 0 54 kg n ha 1 cm 1 similarly flow normalized n losses in illinois for several n rates and management treatments over three years averaged at 1 08 0 4 kg n ha 1 cm 1 pittelkow et al 2017 in minnesota randall and vetsch 2005 reported flow normalized n losses of 1 07 0 3 kg n ha 1 cm 1 from corn soybean rotation with fall and spring n application with and without nitrapyrin in analyzing 1000 site years of tile drainage n loss data under corn soybean production including from studies mentioned above christianson and harmel 2015 concluded that current emphasis placed on timing of n fertilizer application fall vs spring in 4r strategy to improve water quality is inconsistent with a lack of significant differences in n losses from application timings or application methods these authors further noted that the rate of dissolved n losses increased with n application 200 kg n ha 1 under dry conditions and 175 kg n ha 1 under wet conditions the above regression analysis of river nloada as a function of a given year and previous year s precipitation supports this assertion in other words the variability in annual n losses under the current cropping systems in the upper midwest is more of a water problem increased precipitation than an n application problem excessive n application in a given year under the wet climate scenario two possibilities exist for a major reduction in river nloads in the upper midwest these include 1 a reduction in tile flow diverting more water in overland flow under current cropping systems of corn soybean or 2 through the adoption of high et crops that is supplied minimal n both with fertilizer manure and through organic matter mineralization no annual cultivation however both of these scenarios present their own challenges such as additional sediment and phosphorus losses in overland flow under the current cropping systems and the difficulty of finding high et crops requiring minimal fertilizer input that are still profitable to farmers this suggests that remediation of tile and or river waters may be the one viable option for drastically reducing nloads to the gulf of mexico under the current cropping systems tile water remediation strategies include edge of the field treatments such as passing water through bioreactors or saturated buffers both of these strategies require a residence time of 8 24 hrs which may be too long considering the faster rates at which water drains out of a tile especially during high nload periods in early spring christianson et al 2018 reported an estimated nload reduction of 13 48 in bio reactor settings in the upper midwest united states with lower reduction rates as one moves from south to north the river water remediation strategy includes passing the water through wetlands in river corridors considering that river water floodplain interactions have been reduced for both flood protection and navigation along the mississippi river and other smaller rivers stevens et al 1975 fremling 2005 it may be time to reconnect rivers to some floodplains knowing that there are increased river flows from wet climate and this would not affect the navigation increased river water floodplain interaction in turn would provide more residence time for denitrification of river water in wetland settings birgand et al 2007 mulholland et al 2008 james 2010 hansen et al 2016 kalkhoff et al 2016a b schilling et al 2018 thus reducing nloads to the gulf of mexico 4 conclusions regression analysis of nloada and fwnca of three major rivers in iowa the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river showed that increases in nloada were primarily from increases in sfa and particularly in its bfa component which in turn were the result of increased precipitation in the corresponding watersheds increased sfa and bfa were not only affected by the current year s precipitation but also by the precipitation in the previous year previous year precipitation effects were in terms of surplus or lack of fillable soil pore space δs term in the water balance equation which regulated overland flow infiltration and percolation processes thus affecting sfa bfa and nloada for all three rivers an increase in precipitation led to an exponential increase in sfa bfa and nloada this is expected considering that 1 sf and bf are controlled by infiltration and overland flow processes which are inherently exponential 2 n losses are mainly controlled by bf and 3 for a given cropping system or an et level proportion of annual water loss as sf increases with an increase in precipitation the effects of the current year area under soybean production were absent in annual analysis for all three rivers previous year area under soybean production was a significant explanatory variable for nloads in the raccoon river only thus suggesting that there may be some contribution of n mineralization from previous soybean residues in this watershed we conclude that wet climate and not land use changes is the primary cause for the recent increases in sfa bfa and nloada in these iowa rivers considering that there has been a 10 15 increase 50 100 mm in annual precipitation in recent years and this trend is forecast to continue usgcrp 2017 the above analysis suggests that sfa bfa and nloada will continue to increase as outlined by their corresponding exponential functions under the current cropping systems with agronomic n rates it appears that major reductions in river nloads to the gulf of mexico are only likely through water remediation strategies considering tile flow is too fast not enough residence time for denitrification in edge of the field remediation strategies we conclude that expanding floodplain interactions along the mississippi river and other smaller rivers may be a way to increase residence time for denitrification and thus help reduce river nloads to the gulf of mexico credit authorship contribution statement kari a wolf conceptualization formal analysis writing

8347,study region iowa a leading agricultural state in the united states is a major source of nitrogen n to the mississippi river study focus the study evaluated the impact of changes in precipitation land cover area under soybean production sb and n fertilizer application napp on variations in streamflow sf baseflow bf and n load in the des moines the iowa and the raccoon rivers new hydrological insights for the region ln sf and ln bf for all three rivers were influenced by the current year p1 and previous year p2 precipitations presence of p2 in the regression suggested a deficit or excess soil water that influenced fillable pore space causing decreased or increased river flows the ln n load for the raccoon river was also related to p1 and p2 but the ln n load for the des moines and the iowa rivers were related to p1 with p values of p2 slightly above α 0 05 for significance presence of p2 in ln n load regression reflected changes in both fillable porosity and residual soil n contributions of sb and napp in explaining variations in predictor variables were none to minimal we conclude that wet climate and not changes in sb or napp is the primary reason for recent higher n

expansion of the hypoxic zone in the northern gulf of mexico has been linked to increases in discharge of freshwater and nitrogen n from the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2002 forrest et al 2012 scavia et al 2017 these increases in turn have been attributed to the adoption of agricultural practices such as the installation of subsurface tile drainage and increased use of n fertilizers in the united states corn belt alexander and smith 1990 keeney and deluca 1993 lucey and goolsby 1993 broussard and turner 2009 the presence of hypoxic oxygen level 2 mg l conditions make gulf water inhabitable for aquatic organisms thus earning the name of dead zone in the northern gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2002 according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa the dead zone has varied from less than 500 km2 in 1988 to over 22 730 km2 in 2017 https www epa gov ms htf northern gulf mexico hypoxic zone the usepa has set a goal of reducing this hypoxic zone from a 5 year average of 15 000 km2 to 5000 km2 by 2035 studies by goolsby et al 1999 2001 on the mississippi atchafalaya river basin showed that watersheds in southern minnesota iowa illinois indiana and ohio were the main source of n to the gulf of mexico the mean annual no3 n flux from these watersheds to the gulf of mexico was 0 95 million metric tons from 1980 to 1996 goolsby et al 1999 2001 specifically the no3 n yield in three iowa rivers the raccoon river 26 1 kg n ha 1 yr 1 the iowa river 17 7 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and the des moines river 16 9 kg n ha 1 yr 1 were among the highest in the mississippi river basin goolsby et al 1999 2001 besides tile drainage and n fertilizer use other studies have linked land use land cover lulc changes to increases in n load nload in rivers of the mississippi river basin one such change is the adoption of soybean glycine max l merr in the landscape replacing small grains and native prairies it has been suggested that since soybean is planted later in the season compared to small grains and emergence of native prairie grasses this results in less evapotranspiration et in early spring thus causing higher baseflow bf schilling and libra 2003 zhang and schilling 2006 n concentrations schilling and lutz 2004 and nloads schilling and zhang 2004 the schilling and libra 2003 analysis covered eleven rivers in iowa whereas the schilling and lutz 2004 and schilling and zhang 2004 analysis covered n concentration data for the raccoon river the zhang and schilling 2006 study dealt with several rivers of the mississippi river basin with a special focus on the upper mississippi river at keokuk ia these authors attributed increased streamflow sf 51 and bf 66 from 1940 to 2000 mainly to adoption of soybean in the cropping system soybean addition in the cropping system has also been suggested to contribute additional n due to higher rates of soybean residue mineralization jones et al 2016 however the above mentioned studies have minimized or ignored the impact of changing climate on increased sf bf and nload in iowa rivers ryberg et al 2014 gupta et al 2016a in some studies the authors have also used percentage change to highlight the role of lulc over precipitation for example zhang and schilling 2006 suggested that slight change in precipitation 7 5 cannot be the reason for large changes in sf 51 and bf 66 however such comparisons are not appropriate because of the difference in the relative values of the denominators large for precipitation compared to small for sf and bf in percent calculations recently the national climate assessment has shown a 10 15 increase in annual precipitation in iowa from 1991 to 2012 relative to 1901 1960 melillo 2014 in some areas of iowa this increase in precipitation was 15 gupta et al 2015 showed a distinct increasing trend in 30 year normal precipitation 1920 1949 1950 1979 and 1980 2009 in various iowa watersheds considering a 10 15 increase in average precipitation in recent years it is not surprising that drain tile installation has increased in many parts of the upper midwest including iowa to mitigate excessive soil wetness for farming operations there have been some efforts in the literature to characterize climate impacts on nloads in various rivers of the upper midwest for example lucey and goolsby 1993 noted that in 17 years of records for the raccoon river higher nloads followed two less than normal precipitation years 1988 and 1989 this suggested that during dry years nitrate was accumulating in the soil due to both limited water and nutrient uptake by plants these authors suggested a four variable model that explained 70 of the variability in no3 n concentrations in the raccoon river among the explanatory variables the mean sf for the previous seven days explained 50 of the variability the other explanatory variables in the model were the soil moisture conditions and sine and cosine functions of time donner and scavia 2007 showed that previous november december plus march may precipitation amounts in the u s corn belt were a strong predictor of spring n flux in the mississippi river at st francisville louisiana gentry et al 2014 showed that the current year water yield accounted for 87 and 79 of the variability in annual no3 n yield in the embarrass and the kaskaskia rivers in illinois respectively addition of previous year s water and corn zea mays l yields along with the amount of fall applied n fertilizer in the regression explained 96 of the variability in annual no3 n yield in these rivers since water yield from a watershed is related to precipitation this shows that there must be some relationship between river nloads and precipitation in the watershed by comparing the discharge and nitrate concentrations between 2009 and 2012 davis et al 2014 showed that no3 n loading of clear creek iowa was highly dependent on inter annual antecedent moisture conditions because of the variation in previous year precipitation the authors suggested that antecedent soil moisture and subsurface hydrologic connectivity dictated the dominant hydrologic pathways for sf and n loading using the flow normalized no3 no2 n concentrations from 2000 to 2012 in 10 major rivers in iowa green et al 2014 showed that recent declining trends in n concentrations were related to both very high and very low sf as well as to long residence times in some basins years of high sf wet climate caused dilution as well as depletion of stored n whereas low sf dry climate years resulted in reduced n transport as well as increased n storage the authors postulated that decreasing trends in flow normalized n concentrations fn in central iowa basin rivers raccoon des moines iowa skunk little sioux rivers were likely due to smaller storage volume and shorter residence time 1 year in the des moines lobe landforms comparatively increasing trends in river fn outside the central iowa basin the maquoketa river and the wapsipinicon river were due to longer residence time 5 10 years trends in fn varied between 0 4 mg l 1 y 1 to 0 3 mg l 1 y 1 for various decades 1970 1980 1980 2000 and 2000 2012 recently loecke et al 2017 developed a weather whiplash index to characterize climate impacts on water quality in agricultural regions of the midwest united states their emphasis was on showing the effects of drought to flood transition on water quality degradation the authors implied that drought conditions resulted in highly n enriched soils which on subsequent heavy rains contributed to excessive n mobilization using the data for the iowa river at wapello ia these authors showed that drought conditions of 2012 resulted in a 118 increase in n flux and a 34 increase in flow weighted n concentration fwnc in 2013 the weather whiplash index was calculated as total precipitation from january to june of each year minus the total precipitation from july to december of the previous year divided by the total precipitation over the entire period the authors concluded that climate change will intensify this weather whiplash effects resulting in more frequent riverine n concentrations exceeding the usepa standard of 10 mg no3 n l 1 in comparing n losses from two small agricultural watersheds with similar soil types in minnesota and iowa kalkhoff et al 2016a b showed that n loss was primarily controlled by sf precipitation effect although the rate of increase in annual n loss was similar between the two watersheds n losses were greater from the iowa watershed south fork river than the minnesota watershed little cobb the authors attributed these differences to differences in total n inputs 134 kg n ha 1 in south fork river watershed compared to 121 kg n ha 1 in little cobb between the watersheds considering that the minnesota watershed is about 160 km north of the iowa watershed some of the differences in n losses may also be due to differences in temperature i e cooler temperature in minnesota resulting in less soil organic matter mineralization and thus less n losses analyzing data from 154 watersheds in the united states and europe howarth et al 2012 concluded that nitrogen flux to coastal marine areas was strongly related to net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs nani and climate n losses were 25 of the nani above the threshold of 10 7 kg n ha 1 y 1 as compared to 16 below the threshold however this threshold of nani is much lower than the n fertilizer recommended rates of 150 200 kg n ha 1 y 1 for corn in the midwest us sawyer et al 2006 kaiser et al 2018 from 1987 2007 hong et al 2011 reported nani values of 65 77 kg n ha 1 y 1 65 81 kg n ha 1 y 1 and 54 59 kg n ha 1 y 1 for the des moines raccoon and iowa rivers respectively howarth et al 2012 also showed that the fraction of nani exported in long term average riverine n flux was significantly related to temperature and precipitation but the explanatory power of these variables was weak comparatively a fraction of nani exported in rivers was highly correlated to sf but these authors questioned if the higher correlation was due to autocorrelation since sf was used to estimate riverine n flux using the annual total n flux qtn from 70 catchments in the continental united states over five years 1987 1992 1997 2002 and 2007 sinha and michalak 2016 showed that nani precipitation and land use explained 68 76 in ln qtn of its variability differences in qtn across the continental united states were primarily driven by n inputs whereas interannual variability and the occurrence of extremes in a given catchment were controlled by variation in precipitation recent studies by gupta et al 2015 2016a b 2018 showed that both annual sf and annual bf in rivers of minnesota and iowa are exponentially related to precipitation in the current year as well as with precipitation in the previous year s prior year s precipitation accounted for stored soil water and its effects on increased or decreased fillable soil pore space and in turn on increased or decreased percolation and overland flow losses gupta et al 2015 2016b 2018 further showed that recent increased sf and bf were mainly due to recent increases in precipitation and not due to land use changes such as the adoption of soybean over prairies and small grains as suggested in the literature schilling and lutz 2004 zhang and schilling 2006 gupta et al 2016a the iowa rivers analyzed by gupta et al 2016a 2018 included the raccoon river and the maquoketa river these studies thus raise the question how are recent increases in precipitation affecting river nload relative to changes in inorganic n fertilizer input napp and land cover the objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of changes in precipitation napp and land cover on annual nload and fwnc in three iowa rivers the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river since nload and fwnc are affected by variations in sf and bf we also report the effect of precipitation and land cover changes on variations in annual sf and bf in these rivers as sf is a major factor in nload calculations and has been shown to be primarily controlled by precipitation gupta et al 2015 2018 we hypothesized that variation in nload will also be controlled by variation in precipitation 2 methods 2 1 study rivers and associated watershed characteristics three rivers analyzed in this study and their gauge locations were the des moines river at the 2nd avenue bridge in des moines ia the iowa river at wapello ia and the raccoon river at van meter ia fig 1 the des moines and the raccoon rivers drain the north central region of iowa an area also known as the des moines lobe region this area was last glaciated 11 000 14 000 years before present and thus has the youngest and most productive soils in the state green et al 2014 the dominating soil associations in this region include the clarion nicollet webster canisteo clarion nicollet and canisteo nicollet clarion usda nrcs 2008 organic matter contents of nicollet webster and canisteo soils are generally in the range of 5 5 6 5 whereas organic matter content of clarion soil varies from 2 7 to 3 5 al kaisi et al 2012 the undulating surface leftover from last glaciation results in poor surficial drainage of the landscape furthermore tight packing of till particles resulting from the weight of glaciers also slows percolation of rain water through the soil leading to the development of a perched water table in the root zone to remediate this excessive soil wetness and provide soil conditions for optimal farming operations and crop growth most of the agricultural land in the des moines lobe is tile drained although the iowa river also originates in the des moines lobe region upper iowa river flows through the area known as iowan surface whereas the lower iowa river flows through the southern iowa drift plain prior 1991 green et al 2014 iowan surface is free of glacier surges but also has low relief with lands slightly inclined to gently rolling and long slopes prior 1991 the southern iowa drift plains are primarily composed of glacial drift similar to that of des moines lobe but of much older times prior 1991 most of the land surface is sloping towards natural drainage channels giving the look of a dendritic network the dominating soil associations in the iowa river watershed are the tama colo tama muscatine and tama killduff and tama shelby usda nrcs 2008 organic matter content of tama killduff and shelby soil series varies from 1 7 to 2 7 whereas the average organic matter content of the colo and the muscatine soil series is around 5 5 and 6 respectively al kaisi et al 2012 in summarizing the soil carbon distribution in iowa landscape al kaisi et al 2012 showed that the raccoon river and the des moines river flowed through soils with a high carbon index 38 43 whereas the iowa river flowed through soils with lower carbon index 22 37 these authors defined the carbon index as the depth 100 cm weighted carbon content of a soil relative to that of okoboji mucky silty clay loam a mineral soil with the highest soil organic carbon in iowa the des moines river is the longest 845 km river in iowa fig 1 the distance from source headwaters to the 2nd avenue bridge is approximately 542 km the mean slope of the watershed is 0 7 cm m 1 green et al 2014 the soils developed from the glacial till parent material are primarily clay loam in texture with mean clay and sand contents of 26 and 30 respectively green et al 2014 of the des moines river basin 78 of the area is under row crops of corn and soybean 18 5 is forest grasslands and wetlands and 2 5 is under urban use schilling and wolter 2009 data analysis covered the period from 1984 to 2014 during which the average annual precipitation equaled 814 mm table 1 the iowa river is 480 km long and is a primary tributary to the mississippi river fig 1 the mean slope of the landscape is 1 6 cm m 1 green et al 2014 of the iowa river basin 74 of the area is corn and soybean 9 3 is residential 6 2 is hay 5 7 is grass or prairie 3 3 is forest and 1 3 is others wieczorek and lamotte 2010 the soils in the watershed are partially developed from loess and partially from glacial till parent materials nrcs 2008 with mean clay and sand content of 26 and 23 respectively green et al 2014 data analysis covered the period from 1978 to 2013 during which the average annual precipitation equaled 892 mm table 1 the raccoon river also located in des moines lobe is 364 km long and is a tributary of the des moines river fig 1 the mean slope of the area is 1 5 cm m 1 green et al 2014 seventy six percent of the raccoon river basin is under row crops of corn and soybean 17 is grassland 4 is forest 2 is urban use and 1 is water schilling et al 2008 the soils in the watershed are primarily developed from the glacial till parent material with mean clay and sand contents of 27 each green et al 2014 data analysis covered the period from 1974 to 2011 during which the average annual precipitation equaled 819 mm table 1 the bf contributions in these rivers are both from drain tiles bank storage and surficial and bedrock aquifers the surficial aquifers include alluvium glacial till and loess materials with thickness that can vary from none in northeast iowa to over 180 m in west central iowa prior et al 2003 below the surficial aquifer lie the sedimentary bedrock aquifers of limestone dolomite and sandstone from as far back as the cretaceous and cambrian periods prior et al 2003 drain tile water includes precipitation that infiltrates as well as infiltration of runoff from adjacent uplands in depressions thompson 1984 schulmeyer and schnoebelen 1998 bank storage results when the river stage is higher than the water table and water infiltrates into the bank but returns as seepage when the river stage returns to normal similarly surficial and bedrock aquifers contribute to baseflow when the stream stage is lower than the water table much of the surficial material in the des moines river and the raccoon river basins is slowly permeable deep glacial tills comparatively in the iowa river basin surficial materials vary from loess in the northeast to glacial till in southwest because of karst landscape in northeast iowa there are likely more contributions from the sedimentary aquifers to baseflow in the iowa river than the des moines river and the raccoon river depending upon the model used for estimating annual fwnc green et al 2014 estimated no3 n residence time of 1 year for the des moines river and the raccoon river watersheds and 1 5 years for the iowa river watershed the baseflow index baseflow as a percent of streamflow for the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river over the study periods corresponded to 72 72 and 64 respectively the study periods for the three rivers are different mainly because the authors wanted to maximize the use of all available nload data since annual sf is primarily a water balance problem sf p et δs where sf bf stormflow p is precipitation and δs is change in soil storage and nloads are controlled by bf tile flow aquifer contributions differences in the study period among the three rivers will not affect the relative importance of explanatory variables affecting nloads 2 2 data sources annual and monthly sf and nload no3 no2 n data for the des moines river and the iowa river were taken from the united states geological survey usgs open file report aulenbach et al 2007 daily n concentrations for the raccoon river were acquired from the des moines water works jeff mitchell laboratory supervisor des moines river water works personal communication 2015 since n concentrations were measured in water samples at the des moines water works downstream of the van meter and walnut creek gauges fig 1 the daily flows at the des moines water works were estimated as the sum of the daily flows in the raccoon river at van meter plus the daily flows in the walnut creek these flow values were then used to calculate monthly and annual nloads daily and monthly sf data for the raccoon river at van meter and the walnut creek were taken from the usgs national water information system https waterdata usgs gov ia nwis current type flow annual precipitation data for all three watersheds were downloaded from the prism climate group website http www prism oregonstate edu iowa county n fertilizer use was acquired from the usgs s national water quality assessment program brakebill and gronberg 2017 whereas the county crop area statistics were downloaded from the national agricultural statistics service nass database http quickstats nass usda gov the above data were then weighted by various county areas in each watershed to estimate napp and crop area distributions by watersheds wolf 2017 the annual bf for all three rivers was calculated from the daily sf data https waterdata usgs gov ia nwis current type flow using the usgs part program rutledge 2007 however in the case of the raccoon river bf was based on the daily sf only at the van meter gauge site and does not include bf contributions from walnut creek considering that the walnut creek sf is about 5 of the raccoon river flow at van meter we assumed its contributions to bf would be relatively small annual fwnc for various rivers were calculated by dividing the annual n loads with corresponding stream flows 2 3 data analysis the procedures for assessment of precipitation lulc and napp change effects on variations in sf bf nload and fwnc for each river were similar to the approach used by gupta et al 2015 and 2018 briefly the procedure involved a backward stepwise regression of ln annual streamflow sfa ln annual baseflow bfa ln annual n load nloada or annual fwnc fwnca as the predictor variable and precipitation p and area under soybean production sb and napp as the explanatory variables we used the p values of explanatory variables in assessing their power to explain the variability in the predictor variables the lower the p value the higher was the explaining power of that variable annual data in this study refers to the calendar year before the regression analysis sf bf nload and fwnc were tested for normal distribution using the shapiro wilk test miller 1997 and in the case of sf bf and nload a natural logarithmic transformation was needed to transform the data to a normal distribution a finding similar to that of schilling and libra 2003 the fwnc in most cases did not require a natural logarithmic transformation to make the data a normal distribution and thus its regressions were run without any transformations the explanatory variables in the regression analysis included not only the precipitation in a given year p1 but also in the previous 1 2 years p2 p3 we only tested the inclusion of p2 and p3 in the regression because a previous study by gupta et al 2018 showed precipitations in the previous 3rd and 4th years were not significant in explaining the variation of sfa and bfa in minnesota and iowa rivers since previous studies in iowa had suggested the adoption of soybean affected both evapotranspiration schilling and libra 2003 and n mineralization jones et al 2016 we included the area under soybean production both in the current year sb1 as well as in the previous year sb2 as explanatory variables in the regression eq 1 1 p r e d i c t e d v a r i a b l e β 0 β 1 x p 1 β 2 x p 2 β 3 x p 3 β 4 x s b 1 β 5 x s b 2 ε where the predictor variable can be ln sfa ln bfa ln nloada or fwnca β0 to β5 are the regression coefficients and ε is the error term since n fertilizer use data were only available from 1987 2012 a narrow period compared to the period for nload data a separate set of regressions covering only this period was also run with napp as an additional explanatory variable eq 2 2 p r e d i c t e d v a r i a b l e β 0 β 1 x p 1 β 2 x p 2 β 3 x p 3 β 4 x s b 1 β 5 x s b 2 β 6 x n a p p ε backward stepwise regression analysis involved stepwise deletion of explanatory variables from the regression that did not meet the significant criteria of α 0 05 the p value of a given explanatory variable in the regression was taken from an analysis of variance anova tables generated during the regression analysis homogeneity of variances was checked by plotting the residuals versus the predicted values which showed that the residuals were uniformly distributed around the zero line durbin watson statistics were also run to check for the presence of autocorrelation prediction errors in the residuals from the regression the statistical analysis was done using the r statistical package r core team 2016 or the excel data analysis tool microsoft office 2009 the p1 sfa bfa nloada and fwnca data were also tested for temporal trends using the mann kendall test these trend analyses and estimation of the sen s slope were done using xlstat 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 processes contributing to variations in n loads from 1987 2012 napp varied from 55 8 96 5 kg n ha 1 for the des moines river 58 8 97 5 kg n ha 1 for the iowa river and 54 1 96 3 kg n ha 1 for the raccoon river watersheds fig 2 these n application rates are lower than the recommended n application rates for corn 150 200 kg n ha 1 because they are based on the total watershed area which includes the area under legume crops such as soybean as well as non agricultural areas where there is limited to no n applications mann kendall trend test showed an increasing trend in napp from 1987 to 2012 with corresponding sen s slope of 1 1 0 6 and 1 0 kg n ha 1 y 1 for the des moines river watershed the iowa river watershed and the raccoon river watershed respectively furthermore napp showed a strong positive correlation with the area under corn production r2 0 67 0 63 and 0 73 for the des moines the iowa and the raccoon river watersheds respectively indicating the increase in napp was likely from the increased area brought under corn production except for fwnca for the raccoon river the mann kendall test showed no significant temporal trends in p1 sfa bfa nloada or fwnca for any of the watersheds rivers over the study periods table s1 increasing trend in fwnca for the raccoon river sen s slope 0 08 mg l 1yr 1 p 0 05 table s1 was also barely within the cutoff limit of α 0 05 for significance the temporal distribution plots not shown also showed that for a similar amount of p1 in a given watershed the sfa or the bfa were not the same over the study period this is mainly because of the variations in 1 timing and amount of precipitation between years and 2 fillable soil pore space or soil stored water at the start of a given year resulting from variation in previous year s precipitation gupta et al 2018 similar to sfa and bfa nloada was also different for a given level of p1 in a watershed because of the differences in bf as well as residual soil n at the end of the previous year again an effect of the previous year s precipitation in the following discussion we use a subset of data from 1986 to 1993 table 2 to illustrate the processes contributing to temporal variation in sfa bfa and nloada in this subset of data it is unlikely that the length of tile drainage area under soybean production or n fertilizer application varied drastically from year to year thus the year to year variation in sfa bfa fwnca and nloada in this subset of data are largely from variability in precipitation between the years and not due to annual changes in tile length sb1 or napp the sfa bfa and nloada for all three rivers were the lowest in 1989 and highest in 1993 over the study periods table 2 lower sfa and bfa in 1989 were mainly due to less than average precipitation in 1989 as well as due to additional fillable soil pore space that was generated during two previous dry years 1987 1988 the additional fillable soil pore space helped retain a higher amount of the 1989 precipitation in soil thus lowering the sfa and bfa in 1989 since nitrate and nitrite are soluble and move with water through the soil less water losses from the landscape lower sf including bf in 1989 helped lower nloads in these rivers table 2 this is in spite of the fact that there was likely more n remaining in the soil at the start of 1989 because of less leaching and less plant uptake in previous dry years of 1987 and 1988 randall et al 1997 goolsby et al 1999 2001 subsequently in 1990 sfa and bfa were still less than what should have been for the corresponding above average precipitation in 1990 this was again due to above average fillable pore space available at the start of 1990 a result of 1987 1989 drier conditions this additional fillable soil pore space retained some of the precipitation water in 1990 thus reducing its sfa and bfa the generation of fillable soil pore space during below average precipitation years and its role in lowering sf and bf in the subsequent wet year has been documented by gupta et al 2015 2016b 2018 who concluded that sfa and bfa are affected by not only the p1 but also by p2 and in some cases by p3 in 1993 sfa and bfa were the highest not only because of the highest precipitation in that year but also due to less fillable soil pore space more soil stored water resulting from above average precipitations in 1991 and 1992 table 2 the effect of higher soil wetness is not only on increased overland flow but also on higher percolation losses through both drain tile and groundwater baseflow the higher baseflow resulting from high precipitation in 1993 as well as some additional n remaining in the soil from 1987 to 1989 dry years led to the highest nloads in the iowa river and the raccoon river and the second highest nload in the des moines river during the study periods table 2 randall et al 1997 documented similar findings of higher tile drain n losses in normal and wet years 1991 1993 following the dry years 1988 1990 in southcentral minnesota the effects of previous dry and wet years were also apparent in plots of sfa bfa and nloada versus p1 for the three rivers in this study figs 3 5 wet and dry year characterization in this discussion is relative to precipitation values between two consecutive years under discussion table s2 this characterization is only meant to highlight the underlying mechanism of available soil pore space and not to provide an algorithm for modeling in these graphs the best fit line represents an average sfa bfa and nloada contributions at a given level of p1 in case of sfa figs 3a 4 a 5 a some of the scatter around the line is from differences in timing of precipitation events and variation in et between years however some additional scatter further away from the line also includes the effect of soil wetness conditions fillable pore space resulting from previous year s precipitation for example the red data points in these graphs represent the upper limit of sfa whereas the dark blue data points represent the lower limit of the sfa the presence of these points as the lower and upper limits of sfa figs 3a 4 a 5 a are not due to changes in lulc soybean area or tile drainage or napp between the years but are mainly due to previous precipitation history p2 p3 affecting fillable soil porosity the red data points in figs 3a 4 a and 5 a correspond to years when the previous year was a wet year whereas the dark blue data points in these figures correspond to years when the previous year was a dry year table s2 there were two exceptions to these rules and they correspond to sfa for the des moines river in 2000 and the raccoon river in 2010 in the case of the des moines river precipitation in 1999 755 mm was about the same as that in 2000 752 mm and thus there was no clear evidence of the previous year 1999 being a dry year table s2 however both these precipitation values are on the drier end of the precipitation regime for this watershed fig 3a thus likely resulting in some presence of fillable pore space at the end of 1999 that reduced sfa in 2000 in the case of the raccoon river 2009 was a drier year 795 mm relative to 2010 1051 mm however precipitation in 2008 944 mm and 2007 985 mm was higher than that in 2009 and thus likely contributed some soil stored water to sfa in 2010 table s2 since bf is calculated from sf the previous year s precipitation effects also show up in bfa plots figs 3b 4 b 5 b with red data points corresponding to its upper limit and dark blue data points corresponding to its lower limit similarly since n losses from the landscape are controlled by bf tile drainage and groundwater flow the red and dark blue data points also reflect the upper and lower limits of nloada in these three rivers figs 3c 4 c 5 c slight shifts in the position of upper or lower limit nloada data points relative to sfa and bfa graphs then reflects the variations in precipitation as well as variation in n transformation that may be occurring between the years for example nloada for the des moines river in 2008 red data point at p1 805 mm is right on the line instead of the upper limit this shift occurred because there were substantial n losses in august 2007 due to above average precipitation 205 mm and consequently less n was available for leaching in 2008 the above results show that having drier conditions in the landscape at the start of the year dark blue data points will help lower sfa bfa and nloada comparatively the wet soil conditions at the start of the year red data points will lead to increased sfa bfa and nloada these findings are important considering suggestions have been made to hold water in uplands to mitigate the effects of recent increased precipitation on sf and nload baker et al 2012 unless the excess water is held in lined storage areas the above results suggest that holding water in uplands will change the water table and increase soil wetness thus resulting in more water percolation and higher n losses generally there was a weak correlation between the fwnca and p1 for all three rivers in this study figs 3d 4 d 5 d however fwnca of the iowa river was significantly related to p1 fig 4d there was also no difference in fwnca whether the previous year was a dry year or a wet year in the case of des moines river and the raccoon river fwnca values varied from 2 12 mg l 1 and 0 6 12 mg l 1 with a mean of 7 6 mg l 1 and 8 1 mg l 1 respectively comparatively fwnca for the iowa river varied between 3 and 10 mg l 1 and had a mean concentration of 6 8 mg l 1 slightly lower mean fwnca for the iowa river relative to the des moines and the raccoon rivers is surprising considering napp in these watersheds was nearly similar the mean 1987 2012 napp for the des moines the raccoon and the iowa rivers were 72 7 kg n ha 1 71 6 kg n ha 1 and 71 2 kg n ha 1 respectively slight differences in fwnca mentioned above may thus be related to some other n sources in these watersheds or just a random variation for the period 1987 2012 hong et al 2011 showed small differences in n contributions from atmospheric deposition 3 7 4 3 4 2 4 8 3 5 4 0 kg n ha 1 biological fixation 54 65 51 75 and 66 82 kg n ha 1 and manure n additions 13 17 18 20 and 20 22 kg n ha 1 figure s1 among the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river watersheds respectively another n source in these watersheds is the contribution from soil organic matter mineralization gentry et al 2009 showed that soil n mineralization could be a substantial contribution 42 49 of fertilizer n to n input fertilizer application of 184 kg n ha 1 in an illinois watershed since des moines lobe the des moines river and the raccoon river watersheds soils have higher organic matter content than the soils in iowan surface and southern iowa drift plain the iowa river watershed there could be higher contribution of soil organic matter mineralization in the des moines river and the raccoon river watersheds relative to the iowa river watershed another possibility could be more denitrification of groundwater n in the iowa river watershed due to higher residence time 1 5 years compared to the des moines river and the raccoon river watersheds 1 year green et al 2014 the data set in table 2 also highlight the pitfalls of using percent change in sfa or bfa relative to a percent change in p1 between any two years or two periods as an indication of lulc change impact on increased sfa or bfa zhang and schilling 2006 as an example p1 in the des moines river watershed between 1987 and 1992 changed by 19 727 mm vs 864 mm but there was a 143 110 mm vs 267 mm and a 135 78 mm vs 183 mm increase in sfa and bfa respectively table 2 the large differences in percent change for sfa or bfa relative to p1 between the above two years are not due to changes in lulc but is a result of large p1 727 mm or small sfa 110 mm bfa 78 mm values of the denominator in percent calculations the correct way to make change comparisons between these variables is to evaluate the changes in the depth of water between these variables in this example there was a 137 mm increase in precipitation between the two years which resulted in a 157 mm and a 105 mm increase in sfa and bfa respectively slightly higher 20 mm sfa relative to p1 could be due to previous year precipitation s or due to natural variations in the timing of precipitation events the area under soybean production in the des moines river watershed in 1987 and 1992 was similar 566 145 ha in 1987 vs 566 614 ha in 1992 3 2 relative ranking of explanatory variables to identify the relative ranking of precipitation p1 p2 p3 land use sb1 sb2 and napp as explanatory variables for describing the variation in ln sfa ln bfa and ln nloada of three iowa rivers we used the backward step wise regression statistical tests on sfa bfa and nloada data for all three rivers showed no violation of the independence of explanatory variables as well as no serial correlation in regression residuals durbin watson test based on the p values of significant explanatory variables the most important explanatory variables in explaining the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa were p1 followed by p2 for all three rivers during the study periods table 3 neither sb1 nor sb2 was a significant variable in explaining the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa for any of the rivers this lack of significance for the area under soybean production as an explanatory variable may be partly because the analysis periods were narrow table 1 and the temporal variation in the area under soybean production during these periods was minimal the absence of soybean area as a significant variable for ln sfa and ln bfa suggests that annual evapotranspiration differences from variation in crop cover as identified by schilling and libra 2003 and zhang and schilling 2006 were relatively small for any of the three watersheds analyzed in this study this is consistent with the observations of garcia y garcia and strock 2018 and baeumler et al 2019 who showed that annual et losses from corn soybean and prairie grasses were nearly similar furthermore some of the area under soybean production during the study periods likely came from area under small grains that have inherently lower consumptive use baeumler et al 2019 these authors also showed that et losses from recently burned prairies which occurred frequently in the pre change period were lower than the et losses from corn or soybean for the des moines river p1 and p2 explained 67 and 61 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively table 3 a comparison of r2 with and without the previous year s precipitation in the regression showed that the previous year s precipitation explained 9 of the variability in both ln sfa and ln bfa in terms of ln nloada for the des moines river only p1 was the significant variable and it explained 47 of its variability the p value of p2 p 0 06 in ln nloada regression was marginally over the cut off value of α 0 05 however as discussed above with respect to data in table 2 in some years p2 effects on sfa bfa and nloada lingered for several years an example of this observation was the effect of drier 1987 on sfa bfa and nloada in 1990 lower r2 values for ln nloada regression in table 3 reflects the variability in bfa and fwnca values as a result of variability in the amount and timing of precipitation between years in other words the same amount of precipitation does not occur on the same day every year this was apparent from higher adjusted r2 values in the monthly analyses results not reported here but available from the authors where the time interval is narrow and thus precipitation variability in a given month among various years is relatively small for the iowa river p1 and p2 explained 79 and 74 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively table 3 a comparison of r2 values with and without p2 in the regression suggested that the p2 explained 7 and 8 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively similar to the des moines river p1 was the only significant variable in explaining variability in ln nloada for the iowa river and it explained 70 of its variability however the p value of the p2 p 0 054 in ln nloada regression was only marginally above the cut off limit of α 0 05 for the raccoon river p1 and p2 explained 72 and 71 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively table 3 a comparison of r2 with and without p2 showed that p2 explained 12 and 16 of the variability in ln sfa and ln bfa respectively besides the p1 and p2 sb2 was also significant in explaining the variability in ln nloada for this river table 3 a comparison of r2 with and without soybean area showed that sb2 explained 7 of the variability in ln nloada for the raccoon river an additional similar comparison of r2 showed that p2 explained 16 of the variability in ln nloada for the raccoon river again the lower adjusted r2 0 54 for the ln nloada is likely from the variability in bfa and fwnca values as a result of variability in the amount and timing of precipitation among the years in addition not all precipitation events contribute to sfa bfa and thus to nloada in terms of fwnca there was no significant relationship with p1 p2 sb1 and sb2 for the des moines river however there was a significant relationship between the fwnca of the iowa river and p1 table 3 there was also a significant relationship r2 0 32 between fwnca and p2 p3 and sb2 for the raccoon river but the p values corresponding to p2 p 0 05 and p3 p 0 03 were relatively large and close to the cutoff value of α 0 05 for significance the regression coefficients corresponding to the annual analysis for all three rivers are summarized in table s3 since napp data covered a different period than the nload data for the rivers another similar regression of ln nloada with napp as an additional explanatory variable was run eq 2 this analysis showed no effect of variations in napp on variations in ln nloada for any of the rivers the p values of napp before its deletion from the step wise regression were 0 07 0 48 and 0 14 above the cut off limit α 0 05 for significance for the des moines the iowa and the raccoon rivers respectively however the deletion of napp from the regression did not occur at the same step in all three rivers the lack of significance for napp in the regression is partially because of small variations in annual napp during the study periods fig 2 considering nitrate nitrite are soluble and mostly move with the percolating water through the soil tile aquifer bf to rivers the relationships between nloada and bfa were also evaluated for these three rivers linear plots showed nloada was significantly related to bfa with r2 values of 0 72 0 84 and 0 83 for the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river respectively since nloads are calculated using sf and bf is also calculated from sf there is a concern that there may be some cross correlation between these quantities to explore this further we evaluated relationships between changes in nloada to changes in percent contribution of bfa to total sfa between two consecutive years figure s2 similar to nloada versus bfa relationships these relationships also showed that an increase in percent contributions of bfa to total sfa increased the nloada in these three rivers the corresponding r2 values were 0 65 0 77 and 0 69 for the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river respectively although estimates of bf contributions from aquifers relative to drain tiles are not available one can use bfa versus p1 relationships figs 3b 4 b 5 b to estimate bfa contributions from alluvial and sedimentary aquifers in no precipitation year intercept value of the exponential functions p1 0 for the three rivers in this study these contributions equaled 5 9 mm 14 1 mm and 5 9 mm for the des moines river fig 3b the iowa river fig 4b and the raccoon river fig 5c respectively these values are consistent with more permeable landscape features karst in northeast iowa higher values for the iowa river and less permeable glacial till of the des moines lobe in southcentral iowa lower values for the des moines river and the raccoon river since alluvial and sedimentary aquifers near these rivers take in water at high river stages and then discharge it back to the rivers as bf it is likely that the bf contributions from aquifers will increase with an increase in precipitation in summary the above results and the regression analyses showed that the variation in ln sfa ln bfa and ln nloada was primarily controlled by variation in annual precipitation both in the given year p1 and the previous year p2 previous year precipitation effects were more in terms of fillable soil porosity higher values of p2 meant less fillable soil porosity more stored soil water and thus more sfa bfa and higher nloada the effects of variation in the area under soybean production sb1 sb2 and napp on ln sfa and ln bfa and ln nloada were marginal to absent this may be partially due to the narrowness of the study periods during which there was a lack of dramatic change in both the area under soybean production and the n application rates these findings thus suggest that recent increases in sfa bfa and nloada in these iowa rivers and likely in the mississippi river are primarily due to increases in annual precipitation and not due to lulc changes or increase in napp 1987 2012 napp analysis period this finding is consistent with sinha and michalak 2016 observations that inter annual variability and the occurrence of extremes in river nloads in the united states are predominantly controlled by precipitation whereas its spatial variability across the united states is primarily driven by n inputs in this study the fwnca varied within a narrow range for a given river system and there was a lack of or weak relationship between the fwnca and p1 because of the concerns that river waters do not meet the drinking water standard efforts have also been made to identify factors influencing fwnca one such effort was by green et al 2014 who used 10 different models to relate fwnca to streamflow in the current and previous years sfa sfpre and napp these authors tested these models on data from 10 different iowa rivers they used linear weighting schemes to characterize the previous five years discharge sfpre the testing of these models showed that fwnca was primarily related to sfa furthermore sfpre explained additional variability especially decreasing trends in fwnca in 6 rivers and napp explained variability in four rivers similar to our study napp was not significant in explaining variability in fwnca of the des moines river the iowa river or the raccoon river the authors concluded that variability in napp relative to variability in sf precipitation was likely too small to substantially change stream water quality however the present analysis in this study and those of green et al 2014 are in the context of current cropping systems with current n application rates as shown by lawlor et al 2008 and jaynes 2015 n application substantially over and above the agronomic n rates will increase fwnc as well as nloads from tile drained plots considering all three rivers had an exponential relationship for sfa bfa and nloada with p1 table 3 fig 3 we further explored if there was any commonality in these relationships among the three rivers since sfa and bfa are expressed on a unit area basis we also converted nloada to unit area basis n yielda nloada watershed area plots of sfa bfa n yielda and fwnca as a function of p1 for the combined data from three rivers the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river showed that there existed a single relationship of sfa bfa or n yielda as a function of p1 for all three rivers fig 6 a b c the single relationship of sfa as a function of p1 for all three iowa rivers fig 6a is very similar to the single relationship sfa vs p1 for seven other midwestern rivers analyzed by baeumler and gupta 2020 scatter of the data around the line in fig 6a is due to variations in timing and intensity of precipitation events relative to the crop growth stage as well as the differences in the previous year s precipitation wetness effect the single exponential relationship of sfa suggests a near similar et at a given precipitation level irrespective of the river basin this is expected considering that corn soybean is the dominating cropping system in these three watersheds and annual river flows are controlled by the water balance an observation similar to that of baeumler and gupta 2020 a further comparison of sfa curves in fig 6 with similar curves of baeumler and gupta 2020 for seven midwest watersheds showed an overlap results not shown again validating the above findings that river flows are controlled by water balance and not by presence or absence of tile drainage gupta et al 2016b 2018 to further test if the sfa bfa or n yielda versus p1 relationship improves when p2 p3 sb1 and sb2 are incorporated into the regression we again ran the backward stepwise regression analysis on the combined ln sfa ln bfa or ln n yielda data from three rivers the p values showed that ln sfa ln bfa and ln n yielda were generally a function of p1 and p2 table 4 the corresponding adjusted coefficient of determination r2 were 0 74 0 70 and 0 54 for ln sfa ln bfa and ln n yielda respectively the combined fwnca values for three watersheds were weakly related to p1 and p3 and only explained 11 of its variability fig 6d the regression coefficients for the combined annual analysis are given in table s3 relatively there were small differences in napp as well as in manure n addition among the three watersheds figs 2 and s1 potentially there were also some differences in the timing of fertilizer and manure n applications among these watersheds in spite of these differences in n use among watersheds there was a single relationship that represented n yielda for all three rivers thus again highlighting that nloada in these three iowa rivers were primarily controlled by precipitation and to a lesser extent due to differences in lulc change or soil and crop management practices although there was no explanatory variable that accounted for management practices such as timing of n applications in the regression analysis the variability in nloada within each watershed as well as among watersheds figs 3 5 likely included not only the variability in precipitation but also some effects of variable management practices including timing of n applications in the watersheds in other words not all farmers apply the same amount of n fertilizer or at the same time thus within the range of variable n management practices used in these watersheds the above analysis shows that the effects of these management practices on nloada will be likely small under current cropping systems this is consistent with the data on effects of n management practices on tile drain n losses from small plot studies in iowa jaynes et al 2001 lawlor et al 2008 jaynes 2015 minnesota randall et al 2003 randall and vetsch 2005 and illinois pittelkow et al 2017 in all these studies there were larger differences in n losses from tile drained plots between years precipitation effect than between the n rate timing of n applications or even the use of nitrification inhibitors in a corn soybean cropping systems in many years the differences between various n management practices rate and timing in these studies were not significant generally flow normalized n losses losses per unit area per unit volume of drained water over several different n treatments in these studies were within a narrow range 0 5 2 3 kg n ha 1 cm 1 for example in the jaynes et al 2015 study in iowa flow normalized n losses in corn soybean rotation for three fertilizer treatments over 4 years averaged standard deviation 1 02 0 32 kg n ha 1 cm 1 comparatively in the lawlor et al 2008 study in iowa covering five n fertilizer treatments over 15 years flow normalized n losses averaged at 1 2 0 54 kg n ha 1 cm 1 similarly flow normalized n losses in illinois for several n rates and management treatments over three years averaged at 1 08 0 4 kg n ha 1 cm 1 pittelkow et al 2017 in minnesota randall and vetsch 2005 reported flow normalized n losses of 1 07 0 3 kg n ha 1 cm 1 from corn soybean rotation with fall and spring n application with and without nitrapyrin in analyzing 1000 site years of tile drainage n loss data under corn soybean production including from studies mentioned above christianson and harmel 2015 concluded that current emphasis placed on timing of n fertilizer application fall vs spring in 4r strategy to improve water quality is inconsistent with a lack of significant differences in n losses from application timings or application methods these authors further noted that the rate of dissolved n losses increased with n application 200 kg n ha 1 under dry conditions and 175 kg n ha 1 under wet conditions the above regression analysis of river nloada as a function of a given year and previous year s precipitation supports this assertion in other words the variability in annual n losses under the current cropping systems in the upper midwest is more of a water problem increased precipitation than an n application problem excessive n application in a given year under the wet climate scenario two possibilities exist for a major reduction in river nloads in the upper midwest these include 1 a reduction in tile flow diverting more water in overland flow under current cropping systems of corn soybean or 2 through the adoption of high et crops that is supplied minimal n both with fertilizer manure and through organic matter mineralization no annual cultivation however both of these scenarios present their own challenges such as additional sediment and phosphorus losses in overland flow under the current cropping systems and the difficulty of finding high et crops requiring minimal fertilizer input that are still profitable to farmers this suggests that remediation of tile and or river waters may be the one viable option for drastically reducing nloads to the gulf of mexico under the current cropping systems tile water remediation strategies include edge of the field treatments such as passing water through bioreactors or saturated buffers both of these strategies require a residence time of 8 24 hrs which may be too long considering the faster rates at which water drains out of a tile especially during high nload periods in early spring christianson et al 2018 reported an estimated nload reduction of 13 48 in bio reactor settings in the upper midwest united states with lower reduction rates as one moves from south to north the river water remediation strategy includes passing the water through wetlands in river corridors considering that river water floodplain interactions have been reduced for both flood protection and navigation along the mississippi river and other smaller rivers stevens et al 1975 fremling 2005 it may be time to reconnect rivers to some floodplains knowing that there are increased river flows from wet climate and this would not affect the navigation increased river water floodplain interaction in turn would provide more residence time for denitrification of river water in wetland settings birgand et al 2007 mulholland et al 2008 james 2010 hansen et al 2016 kalkhoff et al 2016a b schilling et al 2018 thus reducing nloads to the gulf of mexico 4 conclusions regression analysis of nloada and fwnca of three major rivers in iowa the des moines river the iowa river and the raccoon river showed that increases in nloada were primarily from increases in sfa and particularly in its bfa component which in turn were the result of increased precipitation in the corresponding watersheds increased sfa and bfa were not only affected by the current year s precipitation but also by the precipitation in the previous year previous year precipitation effects were in terms of surplus or lack of fillable soil pore space δs term in the water balance equation which regulated overland flow infiltration and percolation processes thus affecting sfa bfa and nloada for all three rivers an increase in precipitation led to an exponential increase in sfa bfa and nloada this is expected considering that 1 sf and bf are controlled by infiltration and overland flow processes which are inherently exponential 2 n losses are mainly controlled by bf and 3 for a given cropping system or an et level proportion of annual water loss as sf increases with an increase in precipitation the effects of the current year area under soybean production were absent in annual analysis for all three rivers previous year area under soybean production was a significant explanatory variable for nloads in the raccoon river only thus suggesting that there may be some contribution of n mineralization from previous soybean residues in this watershed we conclude that wet climate and not land use changes is the primary cause for the recent increases in sfa bfa and nloada in these iowa rivers considering that there has been a 10 15 increase 50 100 mm in annual precipitation in recent years and this trend is forecast to continue usgcrp 2017 the above analysis suggests that sfa bfa and nloada will continue to increase as outlined by their corresponding exponential functions under the current cropping systems with agronomic n rates it appears that major reductions in river nloads to the gulf of mexico are only likely through water remediation strategies considering tile flow is too fast not enough residence time for denitrification in edge of the field remediation strategies we conclude that expanding floodplain interactions along the mississippi river and other smaller rivers may be a way to increase residence time for denitrification and thus help reduce river nloads to the gulf of mexico credit authorship contribution statement kari a wolf conceptualization formal analysis writing

8348,study region the study site is located in the south western part of the ukraine in the area of the historical rock salt mining town solotvyno the former mining area is situated in close vicinity to the river tisza the main tributary of the danube river the largest river in europe study focus after uncontrolled flooding of several salt mines a one month advisory mission was launched by the european commission to estimate the impact of the abandoned salt mines containing large quantities of salt water on the environment as a consequence of the flooding dozens of sinkholes formed and sinkhole forming processes are ongoing with sinkhole diameters reaching 250 m as river contamination by the release of large quantities of saltwater would lead to an international disaster hydrogeological measurements were taken on site to study the system new hydrological insights of the region at the study site saturated hyper saline water as well as fresh surface and groundwater were encountered in close vicinity to each other electrical conductivity as a proxy for salinity and temperature were measured on site and water samples taken from surface ground and mine waters were analyzed for chemistry and stable isotopes providing new insights into groundwater flow dynamics a conceptual model shows the salt dome and potential flow paths from the mining area to the tisza river in the context of the mines and associated sinkholes potentially impacting the river water quality keywords salt mine collapse contamination sinkhole formation variable density flow tisza river 1 introduction solotvyno is a historical rock salt mining town situated above a salt dome structure in the south west of ukraine close to its border with romania a legacy of the salt mining there are at least nine abandoned salt mines of which the last two to operate were unexpectedly unintentionally flooded in 2010 flooding occurred due to mine collapse triggered by underground mining operations as a consequence huge surface collapses developed similar to the sinkholes in berezniki russia after flooding of the potash mining area in 2006 ashrafianfar et al 2011 an official request was presented to the european commission by the hungarian authorities as a consequence of elevated salt concentrations in the tisza river in 2008 olhgc 2009 the tisza river is the largest tributary of the danube which itself is the largest european river and of major ecological as well as economic importance for the several countries that border it sourced in the carpathian mountains around 400 km upstream of the solotvyno mining area the tisza river enters hungary at tiszabecs around 104 km downstream here chloride concentrations of 504 mg l were measured in 2008 this concentration exceeds the proposed surface water quality standard swqs of 200 mg l oecd 2008 thus alarming the hungarian authorities the hydrogeological situation and the impact of anthropogenic mining activities on the area was not previously well understood velasco et al 2017 performed ground deformation mapping and monitoring at solotvyno using insar technology the insar results served as an input for delimitating subsidence and landslide risk areas the hydrogeology and the potential impact of large quantities of saline waters from the mines on the tisza river however were not investigated onencan et al 2018 have developed a participatory gis risk mapping and citizen science approach for solotvyno salt mines their aim is the creation of an online joint decision making tool and map named isolovtyno by 2020 this study gives an overview of the hydrogeological situation and the potential impacts of the solotvyno mining area on the tisza river it is the result of a responsive field survey undertaken by the eucpt european civil protection team in collaboration with experts from the institute of geological sciences national academy of sciences of ukraine nasu these results may serve as a hydrogeological baseline study and feed into the previously mentioned online decision making tool 1 1 study area the town of solotvyno 47 57 0 e 23 52 0 n is situated between the tisza river and the magura mountains at an elevation of around 280 m above sea level the tisza river meanders around the solotvyno salt dome structure forming the border between ukraine to the north and romania to the south the magura mountains stretch from north west to south east and are located south of the river apshytsya this mountain chain acts as a natural barrier and recharge area with altitudes of up to 400 m fig 1 average monthly precipitation is lowest in march 42 mm and highest in june 101 mm with an average annual recharge of around 744 mm a the average temperature is lowest in january 3 5 c and highest in july 18 8 c with an annual average temperature of 8 8 c url i 2020 the town is supplied with fresh water from a pumping station which is located close to the most southern stretch of the river at the border with romania the meander of the river at this location is attributed to the uplift of the salt dome which led to a successive southward displacement of the tisza river in recent geological times the general surface and near surface runoff into the tisza river has changed significantly over the last hundred years influenced by the temporary drainage of mines and other mining works as shafts and pits shekhunova et al 2015 the largest lake in the area solotvyno lake sometimes referred to as lake 18 and mistakenly shown as lake kunigunda in several sources including google earth is located north west of the solotvyno mining area the top of the salt dome comes close to the surface i e only metres below ground surface at a number of locations with an outcrop exposed at lake kunigunda see fresh saltwater lakes in fig 1 a saturated saltwater lake streams swamps and lakes influence karstification and erosion processes in the area the smaller lakes e g lake kunigunda and ponds which generally show higher salinity values are situated south east of solotvyno lake these lakes are assumed to be the remnants of the historic sub surface mines no 1 to no 6 after abandonment the mine chambers collapsed and formed these lakes today lake kunigunda serves as a recreational area and was sampled during the mission anthropogenic modification of the area includes hand excavation of rock salt and redistribution of water from one sub lake divided by small dams into another lake presumably to maintain a specific water level for the tourists visiting this area the lakes are situated in the zone between the top of the salt dome and the adjacent bedrock contextually the salt mines are situated within the transcarpathian trough a north west to south east trending linear feature 150 km in length and 20 to 35 km in width formed by the collision zone of the eurasian and pannonian plates it is a neogene depression underlain by the heterogeneous paleozoic and mesozoic paleogene bases the depth of the foundation varies from 670 to 1400 m district of uzhgorod to around 2350 m below ground district of solotvyno glushko 1968 the trough is confined to the zone of deep faults of the carpathian extension that has been active for the last 3 million years it is filled with miocene holocene molasses represented by clay and sandy clay rocks which include tufogenic and evaporates i e rock salt strata the evaporites formed within restricted basins associated with a paratethys seaway that formed during the badenian around 14 ma ago bukowski et al 2007 the transcarpathian trough has formed in a zone where the continental crust is reduced to thicknesses of between 25 and 27 km and is characterized by significant horizontal and vertical heterogeneity and stratification starostenko et al 2013 a high heat flux up to 135 mw m² gordienko et al 2012 kutas 2014 active modern movements starostenko 2015 and seismicity it is crossed by both longitudinal and transverse fault systems the geological setting at solotvyno is displayed in fig 2 showing the proximity between the salt dome and the tisza river on the northern river bank quaternary alluvial sediments have been laid down by the tisza river during its progressive shift to the south in total nine different mines were operated in solotvyno of which mines no 1 to mine no 6 were older and of a smaller operational scale being operational until the 1930 s latest mine no 7 was active until 1970 its remains are located to the east of the solotvyno lake area i e towards the centre of the salt dome mine no 8 and mine no 9 are located on the southern and northern flanks of the dome respectively fig 1 and were both abandoned after flooding in 2010 mine chambers in mine no 7 and mine no 8 collapsed because they were excavated close to the surface with only 10 m 30 m of quaternary sediments above the uppermost chambers visible today at the flanks of the mine collapses a layer of a clay and salt mixture pallag daupley et al 2018 several decimeters in thickness had formed as a capping on top of the rock salt it is dissolution residue mixed with clay particles which are transported towards the salt dome by the natural shallow groundwater flow as a result of the reduced roof protection from above and in areas where the pallag is absent shallow groundwater could enter the mines after roof collapse resulting in huge surface features i e mine craters with diameters of around 250 m although mine no 7 had already collapsed in 1950 it continued to be worked from mine no 8 via a horizontal tunnel until it finally had to be abandoned in 1970 mine no 9 is situated in the northern part of the mining area and was worked to a greater depth of around 400 m below ground no collapses are visible at the surface that could be directly linked to the flooding of mine no 9 it is reported however that flooding of this mine occurred from the side as it was excavated too close to the adjacent bedrock once water bearing faults or discontinuities were struck water flow into the mine chamber could not be stopped leading to rapid salt dissolution mine no 8 as well as mine no 9 operated until around 2010 when flooding occurred in addition to the major collapses above the former mining area smaller sinkholes formed in a number of different areas above the salt dome these were predominantly in the area between mine no 7 mine no 8 and the black moor which is a lake or crater feature located at the upstream part of the study area i e at the eastern margin of the salt dome fig 1 fig 3 shows a conceptual model of the cross section from the magura mountains upstream via the salt dome area central to the tisza river downstream following the blue line in fig 1 sizes and objects are indicative and not to scale in this cross section the regional hydraulic gradient is broadly from east to west following the natural gradient and flow direction of the tisza river elevation drops steeply over the short stretch of around 2 km from the magura mountain ridge up to 400 m a s l to the salt dome area in central solotvyno 257 m to 295 m a s l a moderate surface gradient of about 30 m exists between the tisza river at about 252 m a s l and the central solotvyno mining area at about 282 m a s l over a distance of around 3 km in the downstream area several flow components are indicated these are potential linkages between salt water and the river tisza as well as flow from the ancient mine drainage systems upwelling of deep groundwater and enhanced flow in cracks faults or discontinuities in the bedrock the conceptual model is also informed by the understanding that the formation of saline water requires several years to decades to reach saturation this requires relatively long contact times of fresh water with the salt dome compared to fresh water brines are characterized by high densities e g 1 164 g cm³ or 22 nacl salt by weight at ambient temperatures lide 2004 this means that less dense fresh water is generally flowing above the rather immobile denser saltwater in greater depths this has allowed us to systematically consider the potential impacts of prevailing salt water on fresh ground and surface waters in the former solotvyno mining area maintenance of the stability of the mine workings is a primary objective aimed at securing ground stability for the inhabitants of solotvyno and minimizing the potential environmental impact on the tisza river this requires that they are protected from inputs of fresh water fresh water which may lead to salt dissolution can have several origins the specific sources identified by this study are 1 precipitation in the solotvyno mining area 2 shallow subsurface water flow from the magura mountains 3 hyporheic flow i e tisza river water which enters the alluvium at one point in time space and returns to the tisza river at another point in time space and 4 anthropogenic inputs such as leaking water services and agricultural irrigation another potential source of dissolution is the introduction of deep groundwater flow from the magura or carpathian mountains for these water sources to impact on the solotvyno mine area so called hydrological windows have to be present in order to allow a contact with the salt dome 1 2 methodology a hydrogeological survey of the solotvyno mining area including the tisza river and the magura mountains was conducted by the eucpt all potential sampling locations in the study area were visited e g different groundwater wells mine shafts and craters sinkholes lakes and rivers nevertheless some locations had to be neglected for sampling due to safety reasons e g different abandoned mine shafts for example whilst the black moor and crater of mine no 7 were entered by boat the steep and unstable walls of the mine no 8 crater precluded sampling in situ water quality parameters i e temperature electrical conductivity ec and ph were directly measured in the field whenever possible using either a handheld hanna instruments multi probe or a wtw lf 196 conductivity meter attached to a 50 m cable ec measurements were automatically corrected by the device for a standard temperature of 25 c the conductivity meter was also used to measure the water depth of lakes and craters at various locations by manually determining the point of resistance i e when the probe touched the ground max depth 50 m water levels were generally measured from ground surface the density of measurements was insufficient to generate a groundwater contour map however an historic groundwater map of the area was obtained from the mining archives which indicates a hydraulic gradient from east to west a clean sampling vessel was used to obtain water samples samples from the tisza river were taken as far from riverbanks as possible and at approximately 0 5 m depth all equipment was rinsed with the water to be sampled prior to each measurement and sampling a bailer attached to a 200 m cable was used for depth specific water sampling in the mine craters and mine shafts the bailer was lowered to the desired sampling depth when a slider was released activating a mechanism to capture the water at that depth inside the bailer in total 30 water samples were taken in 30 ml brown glass bottles these samples were sent to germany federal institute for geosciences and natural resources and analyzed in less than 10 days after sampling analyses included stable isotope composition 18o and 2h as well as major ions using cavity ring down spectroscopy crds and ion chromatography ic respectively table a1 in appendix a the correlation of ec with na and cl in fig 4 shows that halite dissolution is the dominant process determining ec at solotvyno thus ec values measured in the field will be taken as a proxy for halite dissolution in the following in addition to the hydrogeological survey measurements of chloride concentrations were obtained for several stations in hungary and ukraine from the respective authorities i e central direction for water and environment hungary and state ecological inspectorate of ukraine satellite images were used for surface observations and geological mapping was conducted in the field 2 results and discussion images of the mine craters overlying mine no 7 and mine no 8 are shown in fig 5 for the years 2012 and 2016 these craters have an approximate diameter of 250 m mine no 7 seems relatively stable as the diameter did not change significantly between 2012 and 2016 even though a rise in water level might give the impression of change at the first glance taking into account crater wall steepness a slow growth in both southern and north western directions can be noticed measurements of the 28 m deep crater lake above mine no 7 were conducted during this study and show salinity values resembling saturated brine i e ec of 250 ms cm fig 6 this collapse thus seems to be in equilibrium i e no further dissolution will take place as long as no other fresh water sources are present here at mine no 8 which collapsed in 2010 as a result of flooding an increase in crater volume can be observed from the satellite images the two larger craters show a connection in 2016 additionally a new crater appeared south west of the larger craters after 2012 yellow arrow in fig 5 reflecting the developing situation and potential for further collapses in this region daupley et al 2018 consequently health and safety dictated that the crater lake associated with mine no 8 should not be sampled mine shaft no 8 located approximately 70 m east of the collapses was sampled instead here the groundwater level was found to be 33 m below ground level the ec was around 50 60 ms cm in the upper 13 m showing a rapid increase to near saturation of around 240 ms cm over only a few metres fig 6 this increase in mineralization at around 40 m below ground roughly corresponds to the depth of the salt dome on its southern flank in the vicinity of mine no 8 thus the thickness of the unsaturated zone at shaft 8 mine no 8 roughly corresponds to that of the quaternary sediments above the water level of mine crater no 7 such high electrical conductivities of more than 10 ms cm are only found at the two locations a the mine crater of mine no 7 and b the mine shaft of mine no 8 the northern drainage system west of lake solotvyno coordinates provided in table a1 in appendix a shows moderate elevation in ec of 8180 μs cm proving that water from the mine is continually draining into the tisza river the main mining shaft of mine no 9 north of the salt dome was not accessible for safety reasons the so called skip shaft around 200 m farther north originally used for material transportation was sampled instead its depth is understood to be 525 m however only the lower 30 m penetrated the salt dome personal communication with former mining staff the groundwater level was found to be 2 m below the ground surface an ec signal of around 650 μs cm indicated fresh water in all measurements taken slight mineralization ec of 2180 μs cm and a strong red colour probably resulting from iron dissolution of the shaft construction was found only in the deepest sample taken at a depth of 198 m fig 7 temperature decreased from 15 c to a constant value of around 12 c within the first eight metres of the water column a sinkhole of approximately 7 m depth was reported to have collapsed on may 2nd 2016 hereafter 2 may 2016 sinkhole orange arrow in fig 5 this collapse represents the most recent event in the area at the time of this study the sinkhole is located between mine no 7 and mine no 9 and contains water with a depth of approximately 3 m with saline to hyper saline characteristics i e ec values between 49 and 116 ms cm see table 1 temperature seems to increase strongly from 19 1 c to 25 6 c within the first metre this is assumed however to be the result of a cold bailer when water sampling was started which was subsequently warmed up by the relatively warm water in the sinkhole another explanation would be the influence of dropping night temperatures as sampling was conducted in autumn which results in the cooling of the uppermost layer of the stagnant water in the sinkhole solotvyno lake largest lake north west of the salt dome has maintained a lower salinity than lake kunigunda smaller lake east of solotvyno lake over a period of tens of years according to interviews with locals this is also reflected in the measurements taken during this mission a maximum lake depth of 5 8 m was measured and a clear stratification in electrical conductivity as well as temperature was measured at all 10 monitoring locations which were evenly spaced over the lake area temperature measurements were highest at a depth of about 1 2 m below the surface while ec increased from saline 30 ms cm to hyper saline around 100 150 ms cm at the maximum depth fig 8 this is comparable with measurements taken by chonka et al 2013 who show a general increase of water density over depth however they also observed a substantial decrease in total mineralization between the years 1997 and 2001 their temperature profiles also show a comparable shape with maximum temperatures at a depth of between 1 m and 4 m depending on the time of the year when sampling was conducted prior to its drainage the black moor area east of the salt dome fig 2 comprised a mire from interviews with locals it is known that the water inside the black moor sinkhole which nowadays is more a lake suddenly drained literally overnight on two historical occasions a photograph dates one incident to 02 12 2005 source mine bureau in solotvyno personal communication as well as analysis of the margins of the black moor sinkhole further suggest that the whole area subsided more than 10 m this highly dynamic situation suggests a direct connection either to one of the mines or a karst chamber formed by dissolution as historical mine maps prove the black moor is not situated directly above one of the mine chambers however karst conduits are likely to have developed connecting the black moor sinkhole with one of the mines it is considered most likely that karst conduit connection was established between the black moor sinkhole and mine no 8 which was still active in 2005 and is much closer to the surface than mine no 9 in both mines excessive rates of dewatering might have redirected fresh water flow and led to additional dissolution of rock salt if one of the pillars of the mines had been weakened and eventually collapsed sudden drainage of the black moor sinkhole could be explained two measurement sites at the centre and the side east of black moor sinkhole were selected for ec and temperature as well as for depth specific sampling for chemical and isotopic analyses the side location maximum depth of 3 3 m showed a stable ec of around 1550 μs cm over the full depth of the sinkhole and indicative of mineralized fresh water fig 9 the same trend was observed at the central location however ec increased over depth and reached its maximum of 3110 μs cm at 8 3 m below water level temperature at the side of the black moor sinkhole was significantly lower in the upper three metres 11 9 c compared to the central location 17 9 c with increased depth the temperature decreased in the central location reaching its minimum of 10 0 c at a depth of 8 3 m as 12 c was found to be the mean groundwater temperature in this area at other locations sampled this might indicate active through flow conversely a lower temperature could also be explained by shading of the sides of the black moor sinkhole by vegetation as indicated by the isotopic analyses fig 10 samples for stable isotope analyses were taken from the locations described above and sent to the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources bgr laboratories for analyses the composition of stable isotopes varies between different waters due to processes leading to fractionation between relatively heavy 18o and 2h and light isotopes 16o and 1h these processes are various but include evaporation and depend on geographical as well as meteorological conditions e g distance to ocean elevation temperature evaporation etc a distinct signature of the stable isotope composition between the different end members i e shallow and deep groundwater precipitation and river water might thus be used to interpret mixing processes of different waters and determine their origin clark and fritz 1997 the analytical results have been plotted in relation to the vienna mean standard ocean water vsmow and the stable isotope compositions have been discriminated according to the specific sampling locations indicated by the different colours fig 10 mine water from the crater of mine no 7 and mine shaft no 8 red dots and circles respectively as well as water from mine shaft no 9 show a distinct evaporation effect where the red dots of the open water in the crater plots below the global and local meteoric water line gmwl and lmwl as solid and dashed lines respectively fresh water encountered over a depth of nearly 200 m in mine shaft no 9 shows a similar stable isotope signature as that of groundwater in the area black circles water sampled at the pumping station purple circle plots close to water taken from the tisza river purple dots indicating the use of bank filtration water and importance of this zone for public water supply in solotvyno this precious fresh water resource contributes drinking water supply not only at solotvyno but also further downstream in romania hungary and croatia the isotopic composition of the tisza river water on the one hand might be subject to evaporation but on the other hand clearly carries a lighter or more depleted isotope composition which is commonly encountered for groundwater the fact that most of the tisza river water originates in the high carpathian mountains might explain the depletion in heavy isotopes here further these values can be explained by the fact that the river was at base flow conditions during time of sampling in fall end of dry period thus mainly fed by discharging groundwater from the carpathians average values of tisza river water sampled at sylotvyno 10 36 in δ18o and 70 94 in δ2h are in good accordance with measurements taken in august and september 2007 by rank et al 2009 at tiszabecs at the border between the ukraine and hungary 10 19 in δ18o and 70 2 in δ2h they compared their data to a previous sampling campaign carried out in march 1988 and recognize a change from spring to autumn discharge of around 1 in δ18o which is less surprising when looking at the variability of stable isotopes in precipitation average monthly stable isotope data in precipitation were obtained from gnip global network for isotopes in precipitation url ii 2020 consisting of 35 values measured between 1980 and 1990 at lwiw ukraine approximately 200 km north of solotvyno the spread of this data supports that of the two samples taken during the two last days of the field campaign the only rainfall that occurred during the period of fieldwork in isolation these values cannot be used to define a reliable end member i e identifying specific isotopic composition of local groundwater recharge which would have helped to further understand the system the green dots in fig 10 represent water samples from the black moor at two locations centre and side the two samples taken at a depth of 4 5 m and 6 5 m central location are located at the gmwl lmwl δ18o of around u 9 2 in contrast green dots showing a more heavy isotope composition δ18o of around 7 were taken closer to the surface of the black moor sinkhole 1 5 m and 2 5 m at central and side location respectively the 2 may 2016 sinkhole exhibits a similar isotopic composition green circle these analyses again clearly show the influence of evaporation from the water surface which leads to fractionation this means that at the time of sampling water in the black moor can be assumed to have been stagnant exposing the upper levels to evaporation the stagnation is also reflected in the density stratification where water with a higher density lower temperature and higher ec see profiles of fig 9 underlies a layer of water with a lower density when interpreting isotopic signature tectonic disturbances must also be taken into account especially on the eastern part of the salt dome structure where sandstones are fractured pyritized and show high quartz content indicating proximity of the tectonic disturbances lines of tectonic disturbances can also be tracked in different parts of salt dome structure which are probably opened by the tisza drainage gallery shekhunova et al 2015 such features might lead to flow of for example deep confined groundwater bringing different isotopic end members into the system chemical analyses conducted at the bgr laboratories included cations anions and minor elements table a1 in appendix a fig 11 shows a piper diagram of different sampling groups due to the limited time during the mission hco3 was back calculated from the ion balance thus inaccuracies might be present however especially in samples with elevated nacl content hco3 as residuum was negligible 5 of total anions the piper diagram shows that the waters evolve from na cl to ca hco3 types from the centre of the salt dome to the river tisza the highest nacl contents were observed in samples from different depths of the crater of mine no 7 shaft of mine no 8 kunigunda lake and the recent 2 may 2016 sinkhole red circle in fig 11 the black moor water green in fig 11 classifies as na cl water type potentially indicating contact between the black moor water and the salt dome albeit with lower levels of mineralization broadly the waters appear to evolve from na cl types to hco3 types with the local hydraulic gradient across the salt dome i e assumed to be from north east to south west and driven by water originating from the magura mountains thus the chemical composition of the water from mine 9 orange in fig 11 shows values between the unaffected groundwater black in fig 11 and the mineralized waters the pumping station for public water supply was also sampled and the composition is very similar to that of the tisza water itself suggesting either dilution away from the centre of the salt dome or bank filtration precipitation with a low mineralization plots at the bottom in the piper diagram showing a significantly different signature unfortunately neither chemistry nor isotopes serve to differentiate between water originating locally in the magura mountains and the regional groundwater flow e g originating in the carpathians river quality data provided by the ukrainian and the hungarian authorities at the stations solotvyno and tyachiv as well as tiszabecs respectively are shown in fig 12 after seiu 2016 whilst data downstream of solotvyno show elevated salt loads especially prior to 2008 the station located at solotvyno does not show high chloride concentrations the low concentrations are explained by the fact that this monitoring station is situated slightly upstream of the mining area the data from downstream of solotvyno show that annual average concentrations of cl have steadily decreased since 2008 this is assumed to be the consequence of the cessation of mining operations and a much smaller input of active drainage into the tisza as a result of pumping alternatively the collapsed mine chambers e g of mine no 8 might not yet be completely filled with water and a saturation equilibrium might not be reached the health and safety limitations on monitoring meant that this could not be verified during the responsive visit if the latter hypothesis is right the hydraulic gradient might change once equilibrium is established with a potential to redirect overflow water towards the tisza cl concentrations that were measured during the mission in the tisza river ranged between 2 89 mg l upstream and 13 5 mg l downstream and did not show any anomalies during this period the slightly higher cl concentrations downstream correspond with an input from a northern drainage system cl concentration of 2354 mg l which continuously releases dissolved nacl from the solotvyno mining area into the tisza river so4 and no3 concentrations were low in the river water although no3 was moderately elevated between 14 2 and 30 5 mg l in a small tributary the drainage systems and one local water supply well table a1 in appendix a this is attributed to human activity e g agricultural fertilizers waste or sewage 3 conclusions field investigations in september and october 2016 have contributed to the conceptual understanding of the present hydrogeological situation at solotvyno the model presented in fig 3 was developed with a particular focus on the potential influences of natural and anthropogenic impacts on the tisza river water quality it shows several potential flow paths that could discharge saline water derived from contact with the salt dome towards the tisza river the black moor sinkhole was identified as one of the key drivers for dissolutional activity as a consequence of the north east to south west hydraulic gradient and a hydrological window that might facilitate contact between recharge water and the salt with the potential to cause further dissolution as it is likely to be in direct contact with underground cavities e g mine chambers chemical analyses i e a slightly elevated nacl signature suggest that some of the water in the black moor was formerly in contact with the salt dome albeit with the addition of large quantities of unsaturated waters if quickly drained this water might lead to additional dissolution of rock salt in the subsurface and to changes in pressure gradients resulting in a disturbance of the preliminary equilibrium as surface water input is generally small particularly during low groundwater levels the potential for contamination by water released from surface water courses e g creeks due to heavy rainfall or the tisza as a result of flooding is assumed to be small in the extreme case of high river stage combined with flooding of the former mining area salt load in the tisza river would be diluted by the quantity of discharge during such an event the same is the case for shallow groundwater flow through the alluvium additionally groundwater closer to the tisza river e g in the alluvium of the southern part of the salt dome measured in shaft no 8 was not completely salt saturated in the near surface compare fig 5 even though hyper saline waters are present in the main craters and at the lakes these waters are not likely to be discharged into the tisza as they are a protected by a thick layer of alluvium in the case of the craters b protected by a flood barrier in the case of the lakes and c generally protected by a layer of pallag residual clay in the rest of the former mining area the relatively impermeable pallag layer which is actively forming in some areas acts as a protective layer minimizing the potential for further dissolution of the surface of the salt at high river stages of the tisza river i e during flood events or due to seasonal changes pressure gradients in the alluvium of the solotvyno mine area might change this is the case for the flood plains of the tisza river possibly leading to a mobilization of saline water stored here especially after an extended dry period of several years where saltwater may accumulate the mobilization of saline water might lead to sudden saline input into the tisza river prior to a flooding event this potential scenario suggests the need for the installation of a monitoring system to a better understand the system through long term measurements and b to minimize reaction times for adequate control measures there is a small possibility that flow from the ancient mine drainage systems towards the tisza could be resumed with a potential to discharge larger quantities of salt water however for this situation to develop the pressure gradient would need to be modified by raising the head with additional water moreover it was observed that these drainage systems have not been maintained and are broken at different locations restricting flow in the tunnels and aqueducts the conceptual model shows that the surface of the salt dome is generally protected by a layer of pallag there are a number of scenarios that might lead to the disturbance of this layer e g the drilling of boreholes new constructions or the collapse of abandoned workings furthermore the process of dissolution might be enhanced by the presence of leachate derived from waste disposal as well as any renewed exploration for salt extraction that involves constructing new mine shafts therefore there is a requirement that these activities could be limited by careful planning and land management although upwelling of deep salt contaminated groundwater might occur via cracks faults or discontinuities in the bedrock during flooding and high groundwater conditions flow velocities are likely to be much smaller than those of overland or alluvial flow thus dilution would likely mask any impact furthermore no such inputs were detected from a longitudinal profile of ec along the 14 km stretch of the tisza gathered during the hydrogeological survey the findings indicate a requirement for ongoing monitoring of discharge and water quality of the river tisza both upstream and downstream of solotvyno as well as of existing wells drainage systems and creeks between the mining area and the river however care will be required in the design and installation of any new monitoring or investigation boreholes which otherwise might lead to undesired consequences with the possibility of forming new hydrological windows and potential flow paths leading to fresh water contact with the salt dome and consequential dissolution processes similarly all anthropogenic activity in the area should meet strict technical standards the flood protection dam is another source of vulnerability and the infrastructure associated with this hydraulic structure should be the subject of further research specifically the drainage galleries e g the remains of the tisza drainage gallery which protects the north eastern part of the salt dome structure from significant water inflow and need to be maintained in working order in conclusion the risk of salt pollution of the tisza river from the abandoned solotvyno mines is considered to be low at the time of the visit however given the proximity of such a large quantity of saline groundwater to the river a strong recommendation was to design and implement a monitoring programme a further recommendation was the extension of the protection zone around the mining area to both protect the civil population and reestablish a stable situation in the groundwater by minimizing potential surface water ingress and disturbance of the

8348,study region the study site is located in the south western part of the ukraine in the area of the historical rock salt mining town solotvyno the former mining area is situated in close vicinity to the river tisza the main tributary of the danube river the largest river in europe study focus after uncontrolled flooding of several salt mines a one month advisory mission was launched by the european commission to estimate the impact of the abandoned salt mines containing large quantities of salt water on the environment as a consequence of the flooding dozens of sinkholes formed and sinkhole forming processes are ongoing with sinkhole diameters reaching 250 m as river contamination by the release of large quantities of saltwater would lead to an international disaster hydrogeological measurements were taken on site to study the system new hydrological insights of the region at the study site saturated hyper saline water as well as fresh surface and groundwater were encountered in close vicinity to each other electrical conductivity as a proxy for salinity and temperature were measured on site and water samples taken from surface ground and mine waters were analyzed for chemistry and stable isotopes providing new insights into groundwater flow dynamics a conceptual model shows the salt dome and potential flow paths from the mining area to the tisza river

introduction solotvyno is a historical rock salt mining town situated above a salt dome structure in the south west of ukraine close to its border with romania a legacy of the salt mining there are at least nine abandoned salt mines of which the last two to operate were unexpectedly unintentionally flooded in 2010 flooding occurred due to mine collapse triggered by underground mining operations as a consequence huge surface collapses developed similar to the sinkholes in berezniki russia after flooding of the potash mining area in 2006 ashrafianfar et al 2011 an official request was presented to the european commission by the hungarian authorities as a consequence of elevated salt concentrations in the tisza river in 2008 olhgc 2009 the tisza river is the largest tributary of the danube which itself is the largest european river and of major ecological as well as economic importance for the several countries that border it sourced in the carpathian mountains around 400 km upstream of the solotvyno mining area the tisza river enters hungary at tiszabecs around 104 km downstream here chloride concentrations of 504 mg l were measured in 2008 this concentration exceeds the proposed surface water quality standard swqs of 200 mg l oecd 2008 thus alarming the hungarian authorities the hydrogeological situation and the impact of anthropogenic mining activities on the area was not previously well understood velasco et al 2017 performed ground deformation mapping and monitoring at solotvyno using insar technology the insar results served as an input for delimitating subsidence and landslide risk areas the hydrogeology and the potential impact of large quantities of saline waters from the mines on the tisza river however were not investigated onencan et al 2018 have developed a participatory gis risk mapping and citizen science approach for solotvyno salt mines their aim is the creation of an online joint decision making tool and map named isolovtyno by 2020 this study gives an overview of the hydrogeological situation and the potential impacts of the solotvyno mining area on the tisza river it is the result of a responsive field survey undertaken by the eucpt european civil protection team in collaboration with experts from the institute of geological sciences national academy of sciences of ukraine nasu these results may serve as a hydrogeological baseline study and feed into the previously mentioned online decision making tool 1 1 study area the town of solotvyno 47 57 0 e 23 52 0 n is situated between the tisza river and the magura mountains at an elevation of around 280 m above sea level the tisza river meanders around the solotvyno salt dome structure forming the border between ukraine to the north and romania to the south the magura mountains stretch from north west to south east and are located south of the river apshytsya this mountain chain acts as a natural barrier and recharge area with altitudes of up to 400 m fig 1 average monthly precipitation is lowest in march 42 mm and highest in june 101 mm with an average annual recharge of around 744 mm a the average temperature is lowest in january 3 5 c and highest in july 18 8 c with an annual average temperature of 8 8 c url i 2020 the town is supplied with fresh water from a pumping station which is located close to the most southern stretch of the river at the border with romania the meander of the river at this location is attributed to the uplift of the salt dome which led to a successive southward displacement of the tisza river in recent geological times the general surface and near surface runoff into the tisza river has changed significantly over the last hundred years influenced by the temporary drainage of mines and other mining works as shafts and pits shekhunova et al 2015 the largest lake in the area solotvyno lake sometimes referred to as lake 18 and mistakenly shown as lake kunigunda in several sources including google earth is located north west of the solotvyno mining area the top of the salt dome comes close to the surface i e only metres below ground surface at a number of locations with an outcrop exposed at lake kunigunda see fresh saltwater lakes in fig 1 a saturated saltwater lake streams swamps and lakes influence karstification and erosion processes in the area the smaller lakes e g lake kunigunda and ponds which generally show higher salinity values are situated south east of solotvyno lake these lakes are assumed to be the remnants of the historic sub surface mines no 1 to no 6 after abandonment the mine chambers collapsed and formed these lakes today lake kunigunda serves as a recreational area and was sampled during the mission anthropogenic modification of the area includes hand excavation of rock salt and redistribution of water from one sub lake divided by small dams into another lake presumably to maintain a specific water level for the tourists visiting this area the lakes are situated in the zone between the top of the salt dome and the adjacent bedrock contextually the salt mines are situated within the transcarpathian trough a north west to south east trending linear feature 150 km in length and 20 to 35 km in width formed by the collision zone of the eurasian and pannonian plates it is a neogene depression underlain by the heterogeneous paleozoic and mesozoic paleogene bases the depth of the foundation varies from 670 to 1400 m district of uzhgorod to around 2350 m below ground district of solotvyno glushko 1968 the trough is confined to the zone of deep faults of the carpathian extension that has been active for the last 3 million years it is filled with miocene holocene molasses represented by clay and sandy clay rocks which include tufogenic and evaporates i e rock salt strata the evaporites formed within restricted basins associated with a paratethys seaway that formed during the badenian around 14 ma ago bukowski et al 2007 the transcarpathian trough has formed in a zone where the continental crust is reduced to thicknesses of between 25 and 27 km and is characterized by significant horizontal and vertical heterogeneity and stratification starostenko et al 2013 a high heat flux up to 135 mw m² gordienko et al 2012 kutas 2014 active modern movements starostenko 2015 and seismicity it is crossed by both longitudinal and transverse fault systems the geological setting at solotvyno is displayed in fig 2 showing the proximity between the salt dome and the tisza river on the northern river bank quaternary alluvial sediments have been laid down by the tisza river during its progressive shift to the south in total nine different mines were operated in solotvyno of which mines no 1 to mine no 6 were older and of a smaller operational scale being operational until the 1930 s latest mine no 7 was active until 1970 its remains are located to the east of the solotvyno lake area i e towards the centre of the salt dome mine no 8 and mine no 9 are located on the southern and northern flanks of the dome respectively fig 1 and were both abandoned after flooding in 2010 mine chambers in mine no 7 and mine no 8 collapsed because they were excavated close to the surface with only 10 m 30 m of quaternary sediments above the uppermost chambers visible today at the flanks of the mine collapses a layer of a clay and salt mixture pallag daupley et al 2018 several decimeters in thickness had formed as a capping on top of the rock salt it is dissolution residue mixed with clay particles which are transported towards the salt dome by the natural shallow groundwater flow as a result of the reduced roof protection from above and in areas where the pallag is absent shallow groundwater could enter the mines after roof collapse resulting in huge surface features i e mine craters with diameters of around 250 m although mine no 7 had already collapsed in 1950 it continued to be worked from mine no 8 via a horizontal tunnel until it finally had to be abandoned in 1970 mine no 9 is situated in the northern part of the mining area and was worked to a greater depth of around 400 m below ground no collapses are visible at the surface that could be directly linked to the flooding of mine no 9 it is reported however that flooding of this mine occurred from the side as it was excavated too close to the adjacent bedrock once water bearing faults or discontinuities were struck water flow into the mine chamber could not be stopped leading to rapid salt dissolution mine no 8 as well as mine no 9 operated until around 2010 when flooding occurred in addition to the major collapses above the former mining area smaller sinkholes formed in a number of different areas above the salt dome these were predominantly in the area between mine no 7 mine no 8 and the black moor which is a lake or crater feature located at the upstream part of the study area i e at the eastern margin of the salt dome fig 1 fig 3 shows a conceptual model of the cross section from the magura mountains upstream via the salt dome area central to the tisza river downstream following the blue line in fig 1 sizes and objects are indicative and not to scale in this cross section the regional hydraulic gradient is broadly from east to west following the natural gradient and flow direction of the tisza river elevation drops steeply over the short stretch of around 2 km from the magura mountain ridge up to 400 m a s l to the salt dome area in central solotvyno 257 m to 295 m a s l a moderate surface gradient of about 30 m exists between the tisza river at about 252 m a s l and the central solotvyno mining area at about 282 m a s l over a distance of around 3 km in the downstream area several flow components are indicated these are potential linkages between salt water and the river tisza as well as flow from the ancient mine drainage systems upwelling of deep groundwater and enhanced flow in cracks faults or discontinuities in the bedrock the conceptual model is also informed by the understanding that the formation of saline water requires several years to decades to reach saturation this requires relatively long contact times of fresh water with the salt dome compared to fresh water brines are characterized by high densities e g 1 164 g cm³ or 22 nacl salt by weight at ambient temperatures lide 2004 this means that less dense fresh water is generally flowing above the rather immobile denser saltwater in greater depths this has allowed us to systematically consider the potential impacts of prevailing salt water on fresh ground and surface waters in the former solotvyno mining area maintenance of the stability of the mine workings is a primary objective aimed at securing ground stability for the inhabitants of solotvyno and minimizing the potential environmental impact on the tisza river this requires that they are protected from inputs of fresh water fresh water which may lead to salt dissolution can have several origins the specific sources identified by this study are 1 precipitation in the solotvyno mining area 2 shallow subsurface water flow from the magura mountains 3 hyporheic flow i e tisza river water which enters the alluvium at one point in time space and returns to the tisza river at another point in time space and 4 anthropogenic inputs such as leaking water services and agricultural irrigation another potential source of dissolution is the introduction of deep groundwater flow from the magura or carpathian mountains for these water sources to impact on the solotvyno mine area so called hydrological windows have to be present in order to allow a contact with the salt dome 1 2 methodology a hydrogeological survey of the solotvyno mining area including the tisza river and the magura mountains was conducted by the eucpt all potential sampling locations in the study area were visited e g different groundwater wells mine shafts and craters sinkholes lakes and rivers nevertheless some locations had to be neglected for sampling due to safety reasons e g different abandoned mine shafts for example whilst the black moor and crater of mine no 7 were entered by boat the steep and unstable walls of the mine no 8 crater precluded sampling in situ water quality parameters i e temperature electrical conductivity ec and ph were directly measured in the field whenever possible using either a handheld hanna instruments multi probe or a wtw lf 196 conductivity meter attached to a 50 m cable ec measurements were automatically corrected by the device for a standard temperature of 25 c the conductivity meter was also used to measure the water depth of lakes and craters at various locations by manually determining the point of resistance i e when the probe touched the ground max depth 50 m water levels were generally measured from ground surface the density of measurements was insufficient to generate a groundwater contour map however an historic groundwater map of the area was obtained from the mining archives which indicates a hydraulic gradient from east to west a clean sampling vessel was used to obtain water samples samples from the tisza river were taken as far from riverbanks as possible and at approximately 0 5 m depth all equipment was rinsed with the water to be sampled prior to each measurement and sampling a bailer attached to a 200 m cable was used for depth specific water sampling in the mine craters and mine shafts the bailer was lowered to the desired sampling depth when a slider was released activating a mechanism to capture the water at that depth inside the bailer in total 30 water samples were taken in 30 ml brown glass bottles these samples were sent to germany federal institute for geosciences and natural resources and analyzed in less than 10 days after sampling analyses included stable isotope composition 18o and 2h as well as major ions using cavity ring down spectroscopy crds and ion chromatography ic respectively table a1 in appendix a the correlation of ec with na and cl in fig 4 shows that halite dissolution is the dominant process determining ec at solotvyno thus ec values measured in the field will be taken as a proxy for halite dissolution in the following in addition to the hydrogeological survey measurements of chloride concentrations were obtained for several stations in hungary and ukraine from the respective authorities i e central direction for water and environment hungary and state ecological inspectorate of ukraine satellite images were used for surface observations and geological mapping was conducted in the field 2 results and discussion images of the mine craters overlying mine no 7 and mine no 8 are shown in fig 5 for the years 2012 and 2016 these craters have an approximate diameter of 250 m mine no 7 seems relatively stable as the diameter did not change significantly between 2012 and 2016 even though a rise in water level might give the impression of change at the first glance taking into account crater wall steepness a slow growth in both southern and north western directions can be noticed measurements of the 28 m deep crater lake above mine no 7 were conducted during this study and show salinity values resembling saturated brine i e ec of 250 ms cm fig 6 this collapse thus seems to be in equilibrium i e no further dissolution will take place as long as no other fresh water sources are present here at mine no 8 which collapsed in 2010 as a result of flooding an increase in crater volume can be observed from the satellite images the two larger craters show a connection in 2016 additionally a new crater appeared south west of the larger craters after 2012 yellow arrow in fig 5 reflecting the developing situation and potential for further collapses in this region daupley et al 2018 consequently health and safety dictated that the crater lake associated with mine no 8 should not be sampled mine shaft no 8 located approximately 70 m east of the collapses was sampled instead here the groundwater level was found to be 33 m below ground level the ec was around 50 60 ms cm in the upper 13 m showing a rapid increase to near saturation of around 240 ms cm over only a few metres fig 6 this increase in mineralization at around 40 m below ground roughly corresponds to the depth of the salt dome on its southern flank in the vicinity of mine no 8 thus the thickness of the unsaturated zone at shaft 8 mine no 8 roughly corresponds to that of the quaternary sediments above the water level of mine crater no 7 such high electrical conductivities of more than 10 ms cm are only found at the two locations a the mine crater of mine no 7 and b the mine shaft of mine no 8 the northern drainage system west of lake solotvyno coordinates provided in table a1 in appendix a shows moderate elevation in ec of 8180 μs cm proving that water from the mine is continually draining into the tisza river the main mining shaft of mine no 9 north of the salt dome was not accessible for safety reasons the so called skip shaft around 200 m farther north originally used for material transportation was sampled instead its depth is understood to be 525 m however only the lower 30 m penetrated the salt dome personal communication with former mining staff the groundwater level was found to be 2 m below the ground surface an ec signal of around 650 μs cm indicated fresh water in all measurements taken slight mineralization ec of 2180 μs cm and a strong red colour probably resulting from iron dissolution of the shaft construction was found only in the deepest sample taken at a depth of 198 m fig 7 temperature decreased from 15 c to a constant value of around 12 c within the first eight metres of the water column a sinkhole of approximately 7 m depth was reported to have collapsed on may 2nd 2016 hereafter 2 may 2016 sinkhole orange arrow in fig 5 this collapse represents the most recent event in the area at the time of this study the sinkhole is located between mine no 7 and mine no 9 and contains water with a depth of approximately 3 m with saline to hyper saline characteristics i e ec values between 49 and 116 ms cm see table 1 temperature seems to increase strongly from 19 1 c to 25 6 c within the first metre this is assumed however to be the result of a cold bailer when water sampling was started which was subsequently warmed up by the relatively warm water in the sinkhole another explanation would be the influence of dropping night temperatures as sampling was conducted in autumn which results in the cooling of the uppermost layer of the stagnant water in the sinkhole solotvyno lake largest lake north west of the salt dome has maintained a lower salinity than lake kunigunda smaller lake east of solotvyno lake over a period of tens of years according to interviews with locals this is also reflected in the measurements taken during this mission a maximum lake depth of 5 8 m was measured and a clear stratification in electrical conductivity as well as temperature was measured at all 10 monitoring locations which were evenly spaced over the lake area temperature measurements were highest at a depth of about 1 2 m below the surface while ec increased from saline 30 ms cm to hyper saline around 100 150 ms cm at the maximum depth fig 8 this is comparable with measurements taken by chonka et al 2013 who show a general increase of water density over depth however they also observed a substantial decrease in total mineralization between the years 1997 and 2001 their temperature profiles also show a comparable shape with maximum temperatures at a depth of between 1 m and 4 m depending on the time of the year when sampling was conducted prior to its drainage the black moor area east of the salt dome fig 2 comprised a mire from interviews with locals it is known that the water inside the black moor sinkhole which nowadays is more a lake suddenly drained literally overnight on two historical occasions a photograph dates one incident to 02 12 2005 source mine bureau in solotvyno personal communication as well as analysis of the margins of the black moor sinkhole further suggest that the whole area subsided more than 10 m this highly dynamic situation suggests a direct connection either to one of the mines or a karst chamber formed by dissolution as historical mine maps prove the black moor is not situated directly above one of the mine chambers however karst conduits are likely to have developed connecting the black moor sinkhole with one of the mines it is considered most likely that karst conduit connection was established between the black moor sinkhole and mine no 8 which was still active in 2005 and is much closer to the surface than mine no 9 in both mines excessive rates of dewatering might have redirected fresh water flow and led to additional dissolution of rock salt if one of the pillars of the mines had been weakened and eventually collapsed sudden drainage of the black moor sinkhole could be explained two measurement sites at the centre and the side east of black moor sinkhole were selected for ec and temperature as well as for depth specific sampling for chemical and isotopic analyses the side location maximum depth of 3 3 m showed a stable ec of around 1550 μs cm over the full depth of the sinkhole and indicative of mineralized fresh water fig 9 the same trend was observed at the central location however ec increased over depth and reached its maximum of 3110 μs cm at 8 3 m below water level temperature at the side of the black moor sinkhole was significantly lower in the upper three metres 11 9 c compared to the central location 17 9 c with increased depth the temperature decreased in the central location reaching its minimum of 10 0 c at a depth of 8 3 m as 12 c was found to be the mean groundwater temperature in this area at other locations sampled this might indicate active through flow conversely a lower temperature could also be explained by shading of the sides of the black moor sinkhole by vegetation as indicated by the isotopic analyses fig 10 samples for stable isotope analyses were taken from the locations described above and sent to the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources bgr laboratories for analyses the composition of stable isotopes varies between different waters due to processes leading to fractionation between relatively heavy 18o and 2h and light isotopes 16o and 1h these processes are various but include evaporation and depend on geographical as well as meteorological conditions e g distance to ocean elevation temperature evaporation etc a distinct signature of the stable isotope composition between the different end members i e shallow and deep groundwater precipitation and river water might thus be used to interpret mixing processes of different waters and determine their origin clark and fritz 1997 the analytical results have been plotted in relation to the vienna mean standard ocean water vsmow and the stable isotope compositions have been discriminated according to the specific sampling locations indicated by the different colours fig 10 mine water from the crater of mine no 7 and mine shaft no 8 red dots and circles respectively as well as water from mine shaft no 9 show a distinct evaporation effect where the red dots of the open water in the crater plots below the global and local meteoric water line gmwl and lmwl as solid and dashed lines respectively fresh water encountered over a depth of nearly 200 m in mine shaft no 9 shows a similar stable isotope signature as that of groundwater in the area black circles water sampled at the pumping station purple circle plots close to water taken from the tisza river purple dots indicating the use of bank filtration water and importance of this zone for public water supply in solotvyno this precious fresh water resource contributes drinking water supply not only at solotvyno but also further downstream in romania hungary and croatia the isotopic composition of the tisza river water on the one hand might be subject to evaporation but on the other hand clearly carries a lighter or more depleted isotope composition which is commonly encountered for groundwater the fact that most of the tisza river water originates in the high carpathian mountains might explain the depletion in heavy isotopes here further these values can be explained by the fact that the river was at base flow conditions during time of sampling in fall end of dry period thus mainly fed by discharging groundwater from the carpathians average values of tisza river water sampled at sylotvyno 10 36 in δ18o and 70 94 in δ2h are in good accordance with measurements taken in august and september 2007 by rank et al 2009 at tiszabecs at the border between the ukraine and hungary 10 19 in δ18o and 70 2 in δ2h they compared their data to a previous sampling campaign carried out in march 1988 and recognize a change from spring to autumn discharge of around 1 in δ18o which is less surprising when looking at the variability of stable isotopes in precipitation average monthly stable isotope data in precipitation were obtained from gnip global network for isotopes in precipitation url ii 2020 consisting of 35 values measured between 1980 and 1990 at lwiw ukraine approximately 200 km north of solotvyno the spread of this data supports that of the two samples taken during the two last days of the field campaign the only rainfall that occurred during the period of fieldwork in isolation these values cannot be used to define a reliable end member i e identifying specific isotopic composition of local groundwater recharge which would have helped to further understand the system the green dots in fig 10 represent water samples from the black moor at two locations centre and side the two samples taken at a depth of 4 5 m and 6 5 m central location are located at the gmwl lmwl δ18o of around u 9 2 in contrast green dots showing a more heavy isotope composition δ18o of around 7 were taken closer to the surface of the black moor sinkhole 1 5 m and 2 5 m at central and side location respectively the 2 may 2016 sinkhole exhibits a similar isotopic composition green circle these analyses again clearly show the influence of evaporation from the water surface which leads to fractionation this means that at the time of sampling water in the black moor can be assumed to have been stagnant exposing the upper levels to evaporation the stagnation is also reflected in the density stratification where water with a higher density lower temperature and higher ec see profiles of fig 9 underlies a layer of water with a lower density when interpreting isotopic signature tectonic disturbances must also be taken into account especially on the eastern part of the salt dome structure where sandstones are fractured pyritized and show high quartz content indicating proximity of the tectonic disturbances lines of tectonic disturbances can also be tracked in different parts of salt dome structure which are probably opened by the tisza drainage gallery shekhunova et al 2015 such features might lead to flow of for example deep confined groundwater bringing different isotopic end members into the system chemical analyses conducted at the bgr laboratories included cations anions and minor elements table a1 in appendix a fig 11 shows a piper diagram of different sampling groups due to the limited time during the mission hco3 was back calculated from the ion balance thus inaccuracies might be present however especially in samples with elevated nacl content hco3 as residuum was negligible 5 of total anions the piper diagram shows that the waters evolve from na cl to ca hco3 types from the centre of the salt dome to the river tisza the highest nacl contents were observed in samples from different depths of the crater of mine no 7 shaft of mine no 8 kunigunda lake and the recent 2 may 2016 sinkhole red circle in fig 11 the black moor water green in fig 11 classifies as na cl water type potentially indicating contact between the black moor water and the salt dome albeit with lower levels of mineralization broadly the waters appear to evolve from na cl types to hco3 types with the local hydraulic gradient across the salt dome i e assumed to be from north east to south west and driven by water originating from the magura mountains thus the chemical composition of the water from mine 9 orange in fig 11 shows values between the unaffected groundwater black in fig 11 and the mineralized waters the pumping station for public water supply was also sampled and the composition is very similar to that of the tisza water itself suggesting either dilution away from the centre of the salt dome or bank filtration precipitation with a low mineralization plots at the bottom in the piper diagram showing a significantly different signature unfortunately neither chemistry nor isotopes serve to differentiate between water originating locally in the magura mountains and the regional groundwater flow e g originating in the carpathians river quality data provided by the ukrainian and the hungarian authorities at the stations solotvyno and tyachiv as well as tiszabecs respectively are shown in fig 12 after seiu 2016 whilst data downstream of solotvyno show elevated salt loads especially prior to 2008 the station located at solotvyno does not show high chloride concentrations the low concentrations are explained by the fact that this monitoring station is situated slightly upstream of the mining area the data from downstream of solotvyno show that annual average concentrations of cl have steadily decreased since 2008 this is assumed to be the consequence of the cessation of mining operations and a much smaller input of active drainage into the tisza as a result of pumping alternatively the collapsed mine chambers e g of mine no 8 might not yet be completely filled with water and a saturation equilibrium might not be reached the health and safety limitations on monitoring meant that this could not be verified during the responsive visit if the latter hypothesis is right the hydraulic gradient might change once equilibrium is established with a potential to redirect overflow water towards the tisza cl concentrations that were measured during the mission in the tisza river ranged between 2 89 mg l upstream and 13 5 mg l downstream and did not show any anomalies during this period the slightly higher cl concentrations downstream correspond with an input from a northern drainage system cl concentration of 2354 mg l which continuously releases dissolved nacl from the solotvyno mining area into the tisza river so4 and no3 concentrations were low in the river water although no3 was moderately elevated between 14 2 and 30 5 mg l in a small tributary the drainage systems and one local water supply well table a1 in appendix a this is attributed to human activity e g agricultural fertilizers waste or sewage 3 conclusions field investigations in september and october 2016 have contributed to the conceptual understanding of the present hydrogeological situation at solotvyno the model presented in fig 3 was developed with a particular focus on the potential influences of natural and anthropogenic impacts on the tisza river water quality it shows several potential flow paths that could discharge saline water derived from contact with the salt dome towards the tisza river the black moor sinkhole was identified as one of the key drivers for dissolutional activity as a consequence of the north east to south west hydraulic gradient and a hydrological window that might facilitate contact between recharge water and the salt with the potential to cause further dissolution as it is likely to be in direct contact with underground cavities e g mine chambers chemical analyses i e a slightly elevated nacl signature suggest that some of the water in the black moor was formerly in contact with the salt dome albeit with the addition of large quantities of unsaturated waters if quickly drained this water might lead to additional dissolution of rock salt in the subsurface and to changes in pressure gradients resulting in a disturbance of the preliminary equilibrium as surface water input is generally small particularly during low groundwater levels the potential for contamination by water released from surface water courses e g creeks due to heavy rainfall or the tisza as a result of flooding is assumed to be small in the extreme case of high river stage combined with flooding of the former mining area salt load in the tisza river would be diluted by the quantity of discharge during such an event the same is the case for shallow groundwater flow through the alluvium additionally groundwater closer to the tisza river e g in the alluvium of the southern part of the salt dome measured in shaft no 8 was not completely salt saturated in the near surface compare fig 5 even though hyper saline waters are present in the main craters and at the lakes these waters are not likely to be discharged into the tisza as they are a protected by a thick layer of alluvium in the case of the craters b protected by a flood barrier in the case of the lakes and c generally protected by a layer of pallag residual clay in the rest of the former mining area the relatively impermeable pallag layer which is actively forming in some areas acts as a protective layer minimizing the potential for further dissolution of the surface of the salt at high river stages of the tisza river i e during flood events or due to seasonal changes pressure gradients in the alluvium of the solotvyno mine area might change this is the case for the flood plains of the tisza river possibly leading to a mobilization of saline water stored here especially after an extended dry period of several years where saltwater may accumulate the mobilization of saline water might lead to sudden saline input into the tisza river prior to a flooding event this potential scenario suggests the need for the installation of a monitoring system to a better understand the system through long term measurements and b to minimize reaction times for adequate control measures there is a small possibility that flow from the ancient mine drainage systems towards the tisza could be resumed with a potential to discharge larger quantities of salt water however for this situation to develop the pressure gradient would need to be modified by raising the head with additional water moreover it was observed that these drainage systems have not been maintained and are broken at different locations restricting flow in the tunnels and aqueducts the conceptual model shows that the surface of the salt dome is generally protected by a layer of pallag there are a number of scenarios that might lead to the disturbance of this layer e g the drilling of boreholes new constructions or the collapse of abandoned workings furthermore the process of dissolution might be enhanced by the presence of leachate derived from waste disposal as well as any renewed exploration for salt extraction that involves constructing new mine shafts therefore there is a requirement that these activities could be limited by careful planning and land management although upwelling of deep salt contaminated groundwater might occur via cracks faults or discontinuities in the bedrock during flooding and high groundwater conditions flow velocities are likely to be much smaller than those of overland or alluvial flow thus dilution would likely mask any impact furthermore no such inputs were detected from a longitudinal profile of ec along the 14 km stretch of the tisza gathered during the hydrogeological survey the findings indicate a requirement for ongoing monitoring of discharge and water quality of the river tisza both upstream and downstream of solotvyno as well as of existing wells drainage systems and creeks between the mining area and the river however care will be required in the design and installation of any new monitoring or investigation boreholes which otherwise might lead to undesired consequences with the possibility of forming new hydrological windows and potential flow paths leading to fresh water contact with the salt dome and consequential dissolution processes similarly all anthropogenic activity in the area should meet strict technical standards the flood protection dam is another source of vulnerability and the infrastructure associated with this hydraulic structure should be the subject of further research specifically the drainage galleries e g the remains of the tisza drainage gallery which protects the north eastern part of the salt dome structure from significant water inflow and need to be maintained in working order in conclusion the risk of salt pollution of the tisza river from the abandoned solotvyno mines is considered to be low at the time of the visit however given the proximity of such a large quantity of saline groundwater to the river a strong recommendation was to design and implement a monitoring programme a further recommendation was the extension of the protection zone around the mining area to both protect the civil population and reestablish a stable situation in the groundwater by minimizing potential surface water ingress and disturbance of the

from earth observation data can be found in courault et al 2005 allen et al 2007 kalma et al 2008 wang and dickinson 2012 and karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 nowadays global scale et products are becoming increasingly available further to global precipitation products recent studies have demonstrated the assimilation of potential evapotranspiration to improve the representation of soil moisture actual evapotranspiration and streamflow rajib et al 2018 with ongoing research there are prospects for these new era products to be beneficial for a wide range of hydrological applications typical et products whose et layers are open to access include mod16a2 running et al 2019 sebs v3 su 2002 and gleam v3 3b martens et al 2017 et products that are not yet facilitated by operational websites include cmrset guerschman et al 2009 ssebop senay et al 2013 alexi anderson et al 1997 and etmonitor hu and jia 2015 comparison studies between various global scale et products have been published earlier e g mccabe et al 2015 michel et al 2016 wang erlandsson et al 2016 poortinga et al 2017 ha et al 2017 da motta paca et al 2019 their general conclusions were that no et products were deemed the most appropriate for heterogeneous landscapes and catchments however as noted by lu et al 2009 variations amongst et products can lead to substantially differing estimations in annual runoff water storage and irrigation requirements necessitating the precautions required to select the most appropriate et product to be adopted for water resources management a key shortcoming of et products is their validation against flux tower data these datasets are not very accurate such that errors up to 20 are acceptable twine et al 2000 ramoelo et al 2014 advances in eddy covariance technology have led to more reliable results but for older systems caution is needed in using flux towers as ground truth instead given the availability of rainfall and streamflow records in thailand we were able to devise a methodology to validate global et products against the water balance which requires sub basin scale rainfall streamflow and terrestrial water storage change data this method has been adopted before in several studies such as simons et al 2016 who solved the water balance to evaluate et at son tay gauging station in vietnam catchment area 144 000 km2 which was compared to the estimates from mod16a2 ssebop sebs alexi and cmrset key limitations of this study pertain to the use of a single runoff station and the assumption that storage change over a ten year period was negligible nevertheless bulk et data cannot sufficiently determine water consumption at specific locations within catchments nor to describe the influence of land use on the et regime this demonstrates importance of capturing seasonal dynamics of et of which shall be explored in this study the objective of this study is to adopt the water balance framework to develop a validation procedure for seven global scale et products based on high quality hydrological data from 1 743 gauged rainfall stations and 172 streamflow stations across the country of which should help form a reliable basis the accuracy of monthly scale et assessments is assessed by exploring terrestrial water storage changes twsc throughout yearly cycles as this cannot be easily physically obtained the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace is used as a proxy for twsc through the inversion of the water balance framework the accuracy of each et product can be evaluated with respect to the grace based estimate this also provides the opportunity to test the performance of grace at simulating monthly storage changes lastly given the dependence of et occurrences on land cover and soil moisture conditions the et products are examined for their ability to provide realistic et estimates with accordance to its land use type to deduce the most suitable et product for facilitating water management 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the kingdom of thailand has a latitudinal extent of 5 37 n to 20 37 n and a longitudinal coverage of 97 22 e to 105 37 e the country has a total area of 514 050 km2 and comprises of 25 main river basins and 254 sub basins as displayed in fig 1 the topography of thailand comprises of the highest mountain ranges in the north and west forming the border with laos and myanmar respectively this region is the source of several major river basins including the ping wang yom nan sakae krang tha chin and pasak basins these river basins flow south and converge to the chao phraya basin which altogether has a total drainage area of 158 587 km2 or roughly a third of thailand s area the convergence of these tributaries form a large floodplain in central thailand the eastern part of thailand drains into the gulf of thailand south thailand consists of many mountainous rivers that flow directly to the sea in this study the country was divided into 5 regions north and central northeast east west and south the humid tropical climate of thailand is influenced by the southwestern and northeastern monsoons the southwestern monsoon is responsible for bringing moisture to the entire country between may and october the northeastern monsoon brings dry weather to mainland thailand between november and april however the monsoon provides southern thailand with extra rainfall as moisture is picked up in the gulf of thailand the average annual rainfall depth between 2003 and 2013 of the country is approximately 1 426 mm year whereas for southern thailand alone it is 2 132 mm year according to the koppen climate classification thailand has a tropical savanna climate aw with some coastal areas being classified as equatorial climate af the south essentially has a monsoon climate am 2 2 materials 2 2 1 gauge rainfall data p the thailand meteorological department tmd and royal irrigation department rid are responsible for measuring rainfall in thailand the tmd and rid individually operated 1150 and 582 gauged rainfall stations between 2003 and 2013 respectively other departments also operated 47 additional stations for their specific purposes this brings the total nation wide number of stations to 1779 rainfall data from 2003 to 2013 were checked for their accuracy using the double mass curve dmc method searcy and hardison 1960 subsequently 36 stations were eliminated and daily gridded rainfall datasets with 1 km spatial resolution were generated for the remaining 1743 stations using the inverse distance square ids method eg de silva et al 2007 daily rainfall was aggregated onto a monthly scale whereafter zonal statistics were applied to estimate areal averaged rainfall for the 172 sub basins the drainage area of each sub basin was carefully determined using the srtm 30 m model which is a digital elevation model from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm https www2 jpl nasa gov srtm 2 2 2 streamflow data q during the study period daily streamflow data was measured at the outlet of 195 sub basins by the rid similar to the method described in section 2 2 1 23 sub basins that contained incorrect streamflow data were eliminated and monthly datasets were aggregated for the remaining 172 sub basins to allow for water balance calculations to be performed the catchment areas of these sub basins vary from 25 to 108 566 km2 most of which are located in western northern and eastern thailand the central floodplain region contains no streamflow stations as runoff is unattainable 2 2 3 terrestrial water storage change twsc to complete the computation of evapotranspiration et see eq 1 through the water balance framework information on storage change δs is required in addition to rainfall p and streamflow q 1 e t w b p q δ s the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace was adopted to represent monthly δs in terms of the terrestrial water storage change twscgrace wahr et al 2004 the product already accounts for the distributed and unpredictable interaction between surface water soil moisture and groundwater complex reservoir operations and the gradual change of biomass weights all in all this alleviates the limited accessibility of physically obtaining δs across all sub basins furthermore the physical nature of monsoonal climate dictates the magnitude of δs is significant at monthly time scales as opposed to over the annual scale at which seasonal fluctuations cancel out the storage change twscgrace over a given time period is computed by taking the difference of the monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa rodell and famiglietti 1999 between time steps ti δt and ti billah et al 2015 see eq 2 2 t w s c g r a c e δ t t w s a t i δ t t w s a t i following the end of the grace mission in october 2017 the gravity recovery and climate experiment follow on grace fo was launched in may 2018 this product provides spherical harmonic solutions of twsa on one degree grids swenson and wahr 2006 these twsa datasets have been processed at i the center for space research of the university of texas csr ii the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and iii the geoforschungszentrum gfz as suggested by sakumura et al 2014 the mean value from each dataset was determined to minimise uncertainties the value of grace data has been demonstrated in many hydrological studies e g rodell and famiglietti 2002 long et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 in july 2018 grace fo rl06 was released and it provides mascon solutions at 0 5 degree resolution this gridded mascon product is processed by the jpl and is available from https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata tellus l3 mascon rl06 coastal resolution improvement cri filters are applied to coastal mascons of which provides better separation between land and ocean signals cooley and landerer 2019 further provided that the mascon based solution provides greater resolution for smaller spatial regions the mascon solution of grace fo rl06 was preferred over the spherical harmonic based solution 2 2 4 evapotranspiration et products seven global et products were chosen to be validated against the water balance and land use classifications these include the atmosphere land exchange inverse model alexi developed by the united states department of agriculture usda the csiro modis reflectance based scaling et model cmrset the etmonitor model from the chinese academy of sciences the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 3b the gap filled mod16a2 v6 from nasa s modis adaptive processing system modaps and others the surface energy balance system sebs v3 of the university of twente and the simplified surface energy balance model ssebop developed by the united states geological survey usgs et data is available for the 2003 2013 period for all 172 sub basins however etmonitor only has data available from 2008 since it is a relatively new et product a summary of major characteristics for each dataset is provided in table 1 comparisons between annual et values are based on thai hydrological years which begins on april 1st all et products are based on the principles of the surface energy balance which partitions the net radiation rn gained by the surface into three components as shown in eq 3 3 r n g h λ e where g is the soil heat flux h is the sensible heat flux and λe is the latent heat flux the entire discussion on et modelling relates to the partitioning between h and λe of which is the key differentiator amongst the seven et models either h needs to be solved explicitly followed by λe as a rest term or soil moisture information should be used to assess λe directly without solving h alexi sebs ssebop and etmonitor use thermal infrared data to estimate λe and et all models use in addition visible and near infrared spectral data the cmrset approach depends strongly on shortwave infrared data over against that gleam and etmonitor retrieve soil moisture from microwave data and have a data assimilation scheme to incorporate moisture measurements into a soil water balance model mod16a2 uses atmospheric moisture as a surrogate for soil moisture this is a nice solution for periods with persistent cloud cover that affects the performance of thermal based energy balance solutions hence the spectral data used in the 7 et models is similar for vegetation indices but differ mutually otherwise to solve the partitioning between h and λe all models are based on a reference et0 with absolute values mm d 1 to describe day to day variability the penman monteith formulation partitions h and λe by circumventing the need for surface temperature data penman 1948 monteith 1965 four models mod16a2 etmonitor sebs and ssebop include a certain form of the penman monteith equation ssebop uses the fao standard version for reference et0 allen et al 1998 while mod16a2 and sebs use a specific solution for the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances to represent forests mod16a2 or cold and wet surfaces sebs etmonitor is based on a more advanced two layer penman monteith equation shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the three remaining models alexi gleam and cmrset are based on the priestley taylor equation for reference et0 which is a simplified solution of the penman monteith equation valid for saturated land surfaces priestley and taylor 1972 there is one distinct difference alexi uses priestley and taylor for potential crop transpiration while gleam and cmrset use it for reference et0 another major difference in the 7 et models is that gleam and etmonitor use a vertical soil water balance approach to compute daily soil moisture hence every method has its own merits and it is very interesting how these models perform in thailand beyond their safety zone where they are developed and calibrated the theoretical background of the seven et products is presented in the supplementary materials 2 2 5 land use the land use in thailand can be classified into eight classes including forest irrigated agriculture rainfed agriculture aquaculture urban water body wetland and others forestlands which comprises 35 32 of the total land area have greater abilities at retaining incoming precipitation due to deeper root zone and thus higher soil moisture storage resulting in greater occurrences of et compared to other land uses sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 around 3 44 million ha and 23 12 million ha of agricultural areas are irrigated and rainfed of which respectively account 7 62 and 44 08 of the total land area respectively 2 2 6 isodata unsupervised classification iterative self organising data analysis technique isodata is an unsupervised classification method which iteratively clusters pixels into the nearest cluster after initially arbitrarily assigning the means of each cluster each pixel is assigned to the cluster with the minimum distance to its mean tou and gonzalez 1974 based on the standard deviations of each cluster those with dissimilarities greater than the defined thresholds are split or are otherwise merged the mean of each cluster is recalculated to redefine cluster statistics this process is iterated until the clusters are sufficiently stable i e changes to cluster mean and spread are below the defined thresholds since the average separability values between clusters increases with the number of specified classes the set of clusters which provide the highest minimum separability values was considered to be optimal for developing the output cluster images in this study isodata was used to classify monthly average etrs values into different clusters based on similarities in et signatures the scheme can be hypothesized to cluster pixels based on commonness of physical conditions land use leaf area index soil type soil moisture and water management measures this extra information was inferred to provide an extra qualitative validation against the land use classes classified by the land development department ldd the selected image and its clusters will be used to assist et gradient map analysis richards 1986 3 methodology 3 1 assessing the accuracy of et products on the annual scale by using annual rainfall p streamflow q and storage change twscgrace datasets the bulk etwb rate for each sub basin was determined using the water balance equation as shown in eq 1 annual etwb values and etrs estimates were compared by aggregating the pixels covering each sub basin the et product with the highest agreement to etwb was determined 3 2 assessing the accuracy of et products on the monthly scale as opposed to modelling δs on an annual time scale there is lower confidence on monthly time scales for the reasons outlined in section 2 2 3 thus to assess the accuracies of these products on a monthly time scale the resultant etrs values are input into an inverted version of the water balance to provide an estimate of storage change as shown in eq 4 4 δset p q etrs the seven resulting δset datasets were compared to storage changes as derived from grace i e twscgrace to deduce the most plausible et product standard correlation indicators including slope r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse were adopted 3 3 correlation between etrs estimates and land use classifications to provide additional creditability to certain products etrs data is parsed against land use data since 87 02 of thailand is covered by forest irrigated crops and rainfed agriculture the isodata algorithm was used to classify monthly etrs values into these three predominant land use classes confusion matrices were used to compute the degree of correctness of classifying etrs pixels to the supposed land use class by dividing the sum of the diagonal elements by the total number of pixels as shown in eq 5 the overall accuracies were further assessed by cohen s kappa coefficient k as expressed in eq 6 congalton 1991 5 d e g r e e o f c o r r e c t n e s s 100 i 1 r x i i n 6 k a p p a c o e f f i c i e n t n i 1 r x i i i 1 r x i x i n 2 i 1 r x i x i where xii is the total number of pixels in row i column i n is the total number of pixels r is the number of rows columns xi and x i are the total rows and columns respectively 4 results 4 1 accuracy of et products on the annual scale the correlation of annual et estimates from each product etrs to etwb has been displayed in fig 2 as through a scatterplot each data point represents the annual et averages for each sub basin to demonstrate the impact of sub basin size on et occurrence each point was multiplied by its corresponding watershed area etmonitor gleam v3 3b and mod16a2 displayed near perfect correlation to etwb requiring 0 2 and 2 of bias correction to conserve the water balance respectively moreover each product showed r2 and nse indicators of 0 97 or above these products have not been calibrated by ground measurements in thailand before which makes these results rather encouraging cmrset and alexi required bias correction of 7 8 despite the other two indicators yielding similar results to the best performing products conversely sebs v3 and ssebop produced large over predictions thus requiring corrections of 12 and 32 respectively while the physics of these latter models seem more rigorous the performance under practical conditions shows that other aspects impact the reliability of et predictions in an operational context 4 2 accuracy of et products on the monthly scale to deduce the et product that most plausibly mimics monthly storage change dynamics fig 3 compares monthly δset and twscgrace estimates for 32 example sub basins which represent an entire range of sub basins from 100 km2 to 110 000 km2 in size certain δset products yielded temporal trends with more similarity in magnitude and graduality of changes than others confirming the hypothesis that each et product has its own cyclic behaviour further fig 4 shows scatterplots between monthly δset and twscgrace from 2008 to 2012 across 172 sub basins to our surprise all products demonstrated relatively strong adequacies at capturing temporal variations of storage changes nse 0 51 cmrset and mod16a2 were the top performing products nse 0 70 r2 0 67 despite having large systematic biases which can be easily adjusted these results are indicative of the capabilities of grace to represent monthly storage changes in catchments of various sizes based on the criteria of showing highest nse values gleam v3 3b 0 69 and etmonitor 0 67 were selected alongside cmrset and mod16a2 to undergo further analysis despite posting similar results a significant factor that differentiates these best performing products is their spatial resolutions possessing fine spatial resolutions of 0 5 km and 1 km mod16a2 and etmonitor respectively provide much greater detail over cmrset 5 km and gleam v3 3b 25 km thus creating more variability at the temporal scale and thus better expressing the bulk behaviour of composite terrain this additionally limits their usage is key hydrological applications such as water accounting irrigation management as well as drought detection 4 3 correlations between etrs estimates and land use classifications given that cmrset mod16a2 gleam v3 3b and etmonitor most accurately captured monthly et dynamics in thailand the isodata scheme was implemented on these four products to deduce the one which most correctly classifies the land use type of each pixel with respect to the ldd classifications the classification of etrs pixels into four clusters provided the highest minimum separability values and was therefore considered to be optimal for producing the output cluster images the four clusters appear to be in the order of decreasing average et values it could be easily deduced that the two lower clusters are well watered and water stressed croplands respectively thus in accordance to fig 5 clusters 3 and 4 represent irrigated and rainfed agricultural areas respectively in contrast clusters 1 and 2 have the highest et values and can thus be classed as forestlands and perineal vegetation however for eastern and southern thailand the high et occurrences can be attributed to the greater annual rainfall over other regions as shown in fig 6 b therefore the four cluster classification was replaced with a three cluster classification through merging clusters 1 and 2 into the forest perineal land use i e cluster 1 as shown in fig 6c f the confusion matrices have been presented in table 2 while the kappa coefficient κ and degree of correctness doc are displayed in table 3 with respect to the ldd land use classification fig 6a the greatest agreement was demonstrated with the spatial variation of mod16a2 κ 0 52 d o c 70 55 followed by cmrset 0 34 and 63 97 gleam v3 3b 0 23 and 45 40 and etmonitor 0 15 and 45 97 assuming that land use is a dominant constraint for the occurrence of et the strong performance of mod16a2 in this test concludes that the product is the most suitable product amongst the seven applicants 5 conclusion seven global et products computed from spectral remote sensing measurements have been tested and evaluated by an independent and international science team none of the products have been developed for thailand so this is a real independent check for humid tropics with forests rainfed and irrigated crops the et products were compared to bulk et which was calculated from the residual of basin rainfall changes in terrestrial water storage and streamflow at the outlet of 172 sub basins the results showed all et products to strongly resemble annual water balances nse 0 88 it is quite impressive to witness these levels of accuracy with minimum bias correction for some of the products in addition monthly storage change were rather adequately captured by all et products nse 0 51 this also indicates the robustness of the grace satellite product for capturing seasonally induced dynamics of storage changes however considering their relative performances and spatial resolutions four of the seven products cmrset mod16a2 gleam v3 3b and etmonitor were deemed to be meritable to be further examined by assessing the ability to provide et estimates consistent to the soil moisture conditions and thus land use classes mod16a2 was able to classify etrs pixels into either forest perineal irrigated and rainfed agricultural areas with most correspondence to the ldd land use classifications in other comparison studies mod16a2 was usually not ranked as the best trambauer et al 2013 hu et al 2015 but the scientific facts for the good agreement for the environmental conditions in thailand cannot be disregarded apparently the tropical savanna climate aw amended by the equatorial climate af in the coast and monsoon climate am in the southern region are suitable for mod16a2 fortunately the open data access provides great opportunities for this most promising product to be utilised for various applications in thailand including in the fields of hydrology agronomy and irrigation processes 6 discussions this ground breaking study significantly improves on previous water balance studies owing to our access to high quality daily rainfall and runoff measurements in addition this study has demonstrated the competence of the grace satellite mission in capturing the seasonal dynamics of terrestrial water storage moreover the comparison to established land use classifications provides the ultimate hurdle for testing the ability to provide realistic et estimates therefore this validation procedure that we have devised should provide a general yet vigorous test that could be adopted beyond our area of study on another note future research should focus on investigating the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture which directly impact on et fluxes however field measurements of soil moisture in large river basins is near impossible necessitating the exploration of potential indirect remote sensing techniques credit authorship contribution statement nutchanart sriwongsitanon conceptualization methodology writing

area of 514 050 km2 and comprises of 25 main river basins and 254 sub basins as displayed in fig 1 the topography of thailand comprises of the highest mountain ranges in the north and west forming the border with laos and myanmar respectively this region is the source of several major river basins including the ping wang yom nan sakae krang tha chin and pasak basins these river basins flow south and converge to the chao phraya basin which altogether has a total drainage area of 158 587 km2 or roughly a third of thailand s area the convergence of these tributaries form a large floodplain in central thailand the eastern part of thailand drains into the gulf of thailand south thailand consists of many mountainous rivers that flow directly to the sea in this study the country was divided into 5 regions north and central northeast east west and south the humid tropical climate of thailand is influenced by the southwestern and northeastern monsoons the southwestern monsoon is responsible for bringing moisture to the entire country between may and october the northeastern monsoon brings dry weather to mainland thailand between november and april however the monsoon provides southern thailand with extra rainfall as moisture is picked up in the gulf of thailand the average annual rainfall depth between 2003 and 2013 of the country is approximately 1 426 mm year whereas for

area of each sub basin was carefully determined using the srtm 30 m model which is a digital elevation model from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm https www2 jpl nasa gov srtm 2 2 2 streamflow data q during the study period daily streamflow data was measured at the outlet of 195 sub basins by the rid similar to the method described in section 2 2 1 23 sub basins that contained incorrect streamflow data were eliminated and monthly datasets were aggregated for the remaining 172 sub basins to allow for water balance calculations to be performed the catchment areas of these sub basins vary from 25 to 108 566 km2 most of which are located in western northern and eastern thailand the central floodplain region contains no streamflow stations as runoff is unattainable 2 2 3 terrestrial water storage change twsc to complete the computation of evapotranspiration et see eq 1 through the water balance framework information on storage change δs is required in addition to rainfall p and streamflow q 1 e t w b p q δ s the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace was adopted to represent monthly δs in terms of the terrestrial water storage change twscgrace wahr et al 2004 the product already accounts for the distributed and unpredictable interaction between surface water soil moisture and groundwater complex reservoir operations and the gradual change of biomass weights all in all this alleviates the limited accessibility of physically obtaining δs across all sub basins furthermore the physical nature of monsoonal climate dictates the magnitude of δs is significant at monthly time scales as opposed to over the annual scale at which seasonal fluctuations cancel out the storage change twscgrace over a given time period is computed by taking the difference of the monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa rodell and famiglietti 1999 between time steps ti δt and ti billah et al 2015 see eq 2 2 t w s c g r a c e δ t t w s a t i δ t t w s a t i following the end of the grace mission in october 2017 the gravity recovery and climate experiment follow on grace fo was launched in may 2018 this product provides spherical harmonic solutions of twsa on one degree grids swenson and wahr 2006 these twsa datasets have been processed at i the center for space research of the university of texas csr ii the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and iii the geoforschungszentrum gfz as suggested by sakumura et al 2014 the mean value from each dataset was determined to minimise uncertainties the value of grace data has been demonstrated in many hydrological studies e g rodell and famiglietti 2002 long et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 in july 2018 grace fo rl06 was released and it provides mascon solutions at 0 5 degree resolution this gridded mascon product is processed by the jpl and is available from https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata tellus l3 mascon rl06 coastal resolution improvement cri filters are applied to coastal mascons of which provides better separation between land and ocean signals cooley and landerer 2019 further provided that the mascon based solution provides greater resolution for smaller spatial regions the mascon solution of grace fo rl06 was preferred over the spherical harmonic based solution 2 2 4 evapotranspiration et products seven global et products were chosen to be validated against the water balance and land use classifications these include the atmosphere land exchange inverse model alexi developed by the united states department of agriculture usda the csiro modis reflectance based scaling et model cmrset the etmonitor model from the chinese academy of sciences the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 3b the gap filled mod16a2 v6 from nasa s modis adaptive processing system modaps and others the surface energy balance system sebs v3 of the university of twente and the simplified surface energy balance model ssebop developed by the united states geological survey usgs et data is available for the 2003 2013 period for all 172 sub basins however etmonitor only has data available from 2008 since it is a relatively new et product a summary of major characteristics for each dataset is provided in table 1 comparisons between annual et values are based on thai hydrological years which begins on april 1st all et products are based on the principles of the surface energy balance which partitions the net radiation rn gained by the surface into three components as shown in eq 3 3 r n g h λ e where g is the soil heat flux h is the sensible heat flux and λe is the latent heat flux the entire discussion on et modelling relates to the partitioning between h and λe of which is the key differentiator amongst the seven et models either h needs to be solved explicitly followed by λe as a rest term or soil moisture information should be used to assess λe directly without solving h alexi sebs ssebop and etmonitor use thermal infrared data to estimate λe and et all models use in addition visible and near infrared spectral data the cmrset approach depends strongly on shortwave infrared data over against that gleam and etmonitor retrieve soil moisture from microwave data and have a data assimilation scheme to incorporate moisture measurements into a soil water balance model mod16a2 uses atmospheric moisture as a surrogate for soil moisture this is a nice solution for periods with persistent cloud cover that affects the performance of thermal based energy balance solutions hence the spectral data used in the 7 et models is similar for vegetation indices but differ mutually otherwise to solve the partitioning between h and λe all models are based on a reference et0 with absolute values mm d 1 to describe day to day variability the penman monteith formulation partitions h and λe by circumventing the need for surface temperature data penman 1948 monteith 1965 four models mod16a2 etmonitor sebs and ssebop include a certain form of the penman monteith equation ssebop uses the fao standard version for reference et0 allen et al 1998 while mod16a2 and sebs use a specific solution for the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances to represent forests mod16a2 or cold and wet surfaces sebs etmonitor is based on a more advanced two layer penman monteith equation shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the three remaining models alexi gleam and cmrset are based on the priestley taylor equation for reference et0 which is a simplified solution of the penman monteith equation valid for saturated land surfaces priestley and taylor 1972 there is one distinct difference alexi uses priestley and taylor for potential crop transpiration while gleam and cmrset use it for reference et0 another major difference in the 7 et models is that gleam and etmonitor use a vertical soil water balance approach to compute daily soil moisture hence every method has its own merits and it is very interesting how these models perform in thailand beyond their safety zone where they are developed and calibrated the theoretical background of the seven et products is presented in the supplementary materials 2 2 5 land use the land use in thailand can be classified into eight classes including forest irrigated agriculture rainfed agriculture aquaculture urban water body wetland and others forestlands which comprises 35 32 of the total land area have greater abilities at retaining incoming precipitation due to deeper root zone and thus higher soil moisture storage resulting in greater occurrences of et compared to other land uses sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 around 3 44 million ha and 23 12 million ha of agricultural areas are irrigated and rainfed of which respectively account 7 62 and 44 08 of the total land area respectively 2 2 6 isodata unsupervised classification iterative self organising data analysis technique isodata is an unsupervised classification method which iteratively clusters pixels into the nearest cluster after initially arbitrarily assigning the means of each cluster each pixel is assigned to the cluster with the minimum distance to its mean tou and gonzalez 1974 based on the standard deviations of each cluster those with dissimilarities greater than the defined thresholds are split or are otherwise merged the mean of each cluster is recalculated to redefine cluster statistics this process is iterated until the clusters are sufficiently stable i e changes to cluster mean and spread are below the defined thresholds since the average separability values between clusters increases with the number of specified classes the set of clusters which provide the highest minimum separability values was considered to be optimal for developing the output cluster images in this study isodata was used to classify monthly average etrs values into different clusters based on similarities in et signatures the scheme can be hypothesized to cluster pixels based on commonness of physical conditions land use leaf area index soil type soil moisture and water management measures this extra information was inferred to provide an extra qualitative validation against the land use classes classified by the land development department ldd the selected image and its clusters will be used to assist et gradient map analysis richards 1986 3 methodology 3 1 assessing the accuracy of et products on the annual scale by using annual rainfall p streamflow q and storage change twscgrace datasets the bulk etwb rate for each sub basin was determined using the water balance equation as shown in eq 1 annual etwb values and etrs estimates were compared by aggregating the pixels covering each sub basin the et product with the highest agreement to etwb was determined 3 2 assessing the accuracy of et products on the monthly scale as opposed to modelling δs on an annual time scale there is lower confidence on monthly time scales for the reasons outlined in section 2 2 3 thus to assess the accuracies of these products on a monthly time scale the resultant etrs values are input into an inverted version of the water balance to provide an estimate of storage change as shown in eq 4 4 δset p q etrs the seven resulting δset datasets were compared to storage changes as derived from grace i e twscgrace to deduce the most plausible et product standard correlation indicators including slope r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse were adopted 3 3 correlation between etrs estimates and land use classifications to provide additional creditability to certain products etrs data is parsed against land use data since 87 02 of thailand is covered by forest irrigated crops and rainfed agriculture the isodata algorithm was used to classify monthly etrs values into these three predominant land use classes confusion matrices were used to compute the degree of correctness of classifying etrs pixels to the supposed land use class by dividing the sum of the diagonal elements by the total number of pixels as shown in eq 5 the overall accuracies were further assessed by cohen s kappa coefficient k as expressed in eq 6 congalton 1991 5 d e g r e e o f c o r r e c t n e s s 100 i 1 r x i i n 6 k a p p a c o e f f i c i e n t n i 1 r x i i i 1 r x i x i n 2 i 1 r x i x i where xii is the total number of pixels in row i column i n is the total number of pixels r is the number of rows columns xi and x i are the total rows and columns respectively 4 results 4 1 accuracy of et products on the annual scale the correlation of annual et estimates from each product etrs to etwb has been displayed in fig 2 as through a scatterplot each data point represents the annual et averages for each sub basin to demonstrate the impact of sub basin size on et occurrence each point was multiplied by its corresponding watershed area etmonitor gleam v3 3b and mod16a2 displayed near perfect correlation to etwb requiring 0 2 and 2 of bias correction to conserve the water balance respectively moreover each product showed r2 and nse indicators of 0 97 or above these products have not been calibrated by ground measurements in thailand before which makes these results rather encouraging cmrset and alexi required bias correction of 7 8 despite the other two indicators yielding similar results to the best performing products conversely sebs v3 and ssebop produced large over predictions thus requiring corrections of 12 and 32 respectively while the physics of these latter models seem more rigorous the performance under practical conditions shows that other aspects impact the reliability of et predictions in an operational context 4 2 accuracy of et products on the monthly scale to deduce the et product that most plausibly mimics monthly storage change dynamics fig 3 compares monthly δset and twscgrace estimates for 32 example sub basins which represent an entire range of sub basins from 100 km2 to 110 000 km2 in size certain δset products yielded temporal trends with more similarity in magnitude and graduality of changes than others confirming the hypothesis that each et product has its own cyclic behaviour further fig 4 shows scatterplots between monthly δset and twscgrace from 2008 to 2012 across 172 sub basins to our surprise all products demonstrated relatively strong adequacies at capturing temporal variations of storage changes nse 0 51 cmrset and mod16a2 were the top performing products nse 0 70 r2 0 67 despite having large systematic biases which can be easily adjusted these results are indicative of the capabilities of grace to represent monthly storage changes in catchments of various sizes based on the criteria of showing highest nse values gleam v3 3b 0 69 and etmonitor 0 67 were selected alongside cmrset and mod16a2 to undergo further analysis despite posting similar results a significant factor that differentiates these best performing products is their spatial resolutions possessing fine spatial resolutions of 0 5 km and 1 km mod16a2 and etmonitor respectively provide much greater detail over cmrset 5 km and gleam v3 3b 25 km thus creating more variability at the temporal scale and thus better expressing the bulk behaviour of composite terrain this additionally limits their usage is key hydrological applications such as water accounting irrigation management as well as drought detection 4 3 correlations between etrs estimates and land use classifications given that cmrset mod16a2 gleam v3 3b and etmonitor most accurately captured monthly et dynamics in thailand the isodata scheme was implemented on these four products to deduce the one which most correctly classifies the land use type of each pixel with respect to the ldd classifications the classification of etrs pixels into four clusters provided the highest minimum separability values and was therefore considered to be optimal for producing the output cluster images the four clusters appear to be in the order of decreasing average et values it could be easily deduced that the two lower clusters are well watered and water stressed croplands respectively thus in accordance to fig 5 clusters 3 and 4 represent irrigated and rainfed agricultural areas respectively in contrast clusters 1 and 2 have the highest et values and can thus be classed as forestlands and perineal vegetation however for eastern and southern thailand the high et occurrences can be attributed to the greater annual rainfall over other regions as shown in fig 6 b therefore the four cluster classification was replaced with a three cluster classification through merging clusters 1 and 2 into the forest perineal land use i e cluster 1 as shown in fig 6c f the confusion matrices have been presented in table 2 while the kappa coefficient κ and degree of correctness doc are displayed in table 3 with respect to the ldd land use classification fig 6a the greatest agreement was demonstrated with the spatial variation of mod16a2 κ 0 52 d o c 70 55 followed by cmrset 0 34 and 63 97 gleam v3 3b 0 23 and 45 40 and etmonitor 0 15 and 45 97 assuming that land use is a dominant constraint for the occurrence of et the strong performance of mod16a2 in this test concludes that the product is the most suitable product amongst the seven applicants 5 conclusion seven global et products computed from spectral remote sensing measurements have been tested and evaluated by an independent and international science team none of the products have been developed for thailand so this is a real independent check for humid tropics with forests rainfed and irrigated crops the et products were compared to bulk et which was calculated from the residual of basin rainfall changes in terrestrial water storage and streamflow at the outlet of 172 sub basins the results showed all et products to strongly resemble annual water balances nse 0 88 it is quite impressive to witness these levels of accuracy with minimum bias correction for some of the products in addition monthly storage change were rather adequately captured by all et products nse 0 51 this also indicates the robustness of the grace satellite product for capturing seasonally induced dynamics of storage changes however considering their relative performances and spatial resolutions four of the seven products cmrset mod16a2 gleam v3 3b and etmonitor were deemed to be meritable to be further examined by assessing the ability to provide et estimates consistent to the soil moisture conditions and thus land use classes mod16a2 was able to classify etrs pixels into either forest perineal irrigated and rainfed agricultural areas with most correspondence to the ldd land use classifications in other comparison studies mod16a2 was usually not ranked as the best trambauer et al 2013 hu et al 2015 but the scientific facts for the good agreement for the environmental conditions in thailand cannot be disregarded apparently the tropical savanna climate aw amended by the equatorial climate af in the coast and monsoon climate am in the southern region are suitable for mod16a2 fortunately the open data access provides great opportunities for this most promising product to be utilised for various applications in thailand including in the fields of hydrology agronomy and irrigation processes 6 discussions this ground breaking study significantly improves on previous water balance studies owing to our access to high quality daily rainfall and runoff measurements in addition this study has demonstrated the competence of the grace satellite mission in capturing the seasonal dynamics of terrestrial water storage moreover the comparison to established land use classifications provides the ultimate hurdle for testing the ability to provide realistic et estimates therefore this validation procedure that we have devised should provide a general yet vigorous test that could be adopted beyond our area of study on another note future research should focus on investigating the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture which directly impact on et fluxes however field measurements of soil moisture in large river basins is near impossible necessitating the exploration of potential indirect remote sensing techniques credit authorship contribution statement nutchanart sriwongsitanon conceptualization methodology writing
