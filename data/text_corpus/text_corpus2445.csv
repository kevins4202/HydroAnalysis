south west monsoon the average annual rainfall is 1 100 mm ramna msw landfill site is selected for study which is non engineered without lined and there is no establishment for the collection of leachate this site is located at approximately 2 64 km in the west of the river ganga and is surrounded by agricultural fields and residential area the villagers had frequently complained against dumping of waste in the site and demanded its immediate closure yet there is no proper action taken by municipal and district authorities to mitigate its impact on the surrounding environment especially air and water quality municipal solid wastes management and handling rules 2000 moef 2000 states that the landfill site should be away from residence clusters but opposing to the rule the dumping sites are very near approx 500 m to the ramana village and surrounded by others villages including ramna dafi and seer the open wells and bore wells are the main source of water supply for drinking and other purposes in the ramna village geology of the study area is mainly alluvium which is most vulnerable for leaching the open landfill site is getting thousands of tons of solid wastes without proper segregation and pre treatment since 2012 mishra et al 2018b the study area is located near to the drainage passages of the river ganga it is a flood prone area therefore it is used to be covered by a carpet of fresh silt clay and loam during the rainy season the elevation of the study area is about 76 m above the mean sea level and characterized by plane surface topography janardhana raju et al 2011 fig 1 2 2 sampling and analysis methods sampling sites are located in between n 25 14 38 3 latitudes and e 83 00 15 longitudes of ramna village the distance between the landfill site and sampling wells ranges from 480 to 790 m the leachate samples were collected randomly from leachate pond near the ramna open landfill site after the rainy season in october and november month of 2014 groundwater samples were collected in 500 ml properly washed and clean plastic bottles randomly from open wells and handpumps during pre and post monsoon period of 2014 and instantly transported it to the laboratory and stored at 4 c all the samples were analysed for significant physico chemical parameters according to internationally accepted procedures and standard methods clesceri 1998 temperature ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solid tds and dissolved oxygen do of groundwater samples and leachate samples were determined by multi parameter

80 c until the solution becomes transparent vázquez carranzo and awwa 2012 na k and ca were determined by flame photometer po4 3 and no3 were determined by the colorimetric method with the help of spectrophotometer systronics 2 3 calculation of leachate pollution index lpi of landfill leachate to calculate the leachate pollutant potential of landfill sites leachate pollution index equation lpi was used which is developed by kumar and alappat kumar and alappat 2005a 1 l p i i 1 m w i p i w i where wi is the weight factor for the ith pollutant variable pi is the sub index score of the ith pollutant variable and n is the number of known concentrations of leachate contaminant variables 2 4 calculation of water quality index wqi of landfill leachate water quality index was determined by using a weight arithmetic method which is well known to identify the status of the water resource chakraborty and kumar 2016 for the wqi calculation firstly a weight wi was assigned to each parameter on the basis of their significance to the complete groundwater quality the weight factor wi of the parameter is determined by dividing the individual weight of each parameter by the sum of all parameter weight 2 wi w i i 1 n w i w represents the relative weight while w i denotes the weight of each parameter n is the total number of the parameter finally water quality index wqi was calculated by the following formula 8 wqi i 1 n s i i x w i where si i is the sub index value of the ith parameter and which calculated by sub index curve developed by ramesh and his colleagues in 2010 by giving rating value between 0 to 100 based on its desirable and acceptable limits prescribed by bis 2012 and who 2008 as per the water quality index values the water quality classified into six classes ramesh et al 2010 tables 1 and 7 location 2 5 simulation of groundwater modeling the combination of darcy s law and continuity equation explain the flow of groundwater in the non

and discussions results of leachate samples analysis and groundwater water samples analysis were discussed with statistically and spatially around the landfill site using spss and gis software 3 1 physico chemical characteristics of leachate samples table 2 shows the results of physico chemical analysis of leachate samples l1 and l2 the observed temperature range of 24 9 0c 27 0 c is favourable for microbial activity in the process of leachate formation and other chemical and biological reactions sulemana et al 2015 ph value of leachate samples was found in the range of 8 3 9 3 the alkaline characteristic of leachate specifies the degraded landfill site singh et al 2016 kjeldsen et al 2002 ec 5 65 ms cm tds 2825 mg l chloride 1420 mg l no3 72 mg l and mg 275 mg l values were found the maximum in l2 leachate sample as compared to l1 leachate sample which is shown in table 2 high conductivity value in the leachate greatly impacts the groundwater flow inside the soil strata which facilitate the leaching of pollutants to contaminates the aquifer system sormunen et al 2008 hardness 800 mg l alkalinity 2200 mg l bod 1344 mg l cod 8386 mg l ca 360 mg l na 875 mg l k 1337 mg l and po4 3 42 3 mg l content were found maximum in l1 leachate sample high bod and cod value indicates a strong leachate characteristic which can affect the leachate treatment process raghab et al 2013 el fadel et al 2003 it is obvious from table 2 that 2 12 mg l of cr 0 026 mg l of cu and 2 80 mg l of fe were detected in l2 leachate sample while 1 42 mg l 0 64 mg l and 8 01 mg l were detected in l1 leachate sample respectively cr content in leachate indicates the presence of wood preservatives and paint products in the dumped solid waste vázquez carranzo and awwa 2012 high level of fe 8 01 mg l in the leachate sample indicates that iron and steel constituents are also present in solid waste nagarajan et al 2012 the dark brown colour of the leachate reveals the oxidation of ferrous to ferric form and the formation of ferric hydroxide colloid chu et al 1994 reduction of these heavy metals is more common into more soluble species hence the concentration of these heavy metals increases under favourable conditions near to a landfill site and may lead to serious toxicity to surrounding subsurface aquifer kale et al 2010 thus results are showing the presence of organic and inorganic toxic materials in leachate table 2 3 2 calculation of leachate pollution index leachate pollution index lpi of the landfill site was estimated which is shown in table 3 lpi of ramna landfill site is observed high i e 15 62 this high lpi value indicated that leachate generated from landfill site is not stabilized and mature and are still undergoing decomposition and thus have high risks to cross contaminate the groundwater of surrounding areas central pollution control board 2007 naveen et al 2016 heavy metals pollutants persist a long time in leachate so its low concentration in leachate directly alters the cumulative pollution rating w i p i liu et al 2015 it may be one of the reasons for the high value of lpi in open landfill sites the high value of lpi represents a hazardous nature of landfill and has the capability to pollute surrounding groundwater mishra et al 2018a 3 3 physico chemical characteristics of groundwater around the landfill the explanatory statistics of the analysed water quality parameters during pre and post monsoon are shown in table 4 the temperature of the seventeen groundwater samples was found in the range of 27 c 33 9 c with a mean value of 31 1 c in pre monsoon while 21 1 c 23 6 c with an average value of 22 2 c in post monsoon this range of temperature impacts on the reaction of most inorganic constituents and chemical contaminants that may affect the quality of the water the ph of the groundwater samples in the study area was fluctuated from 6 4 to 7 3 with an average value of 6 9 in pre monsoon from 6 4 to 8 1 with an average of 7 67 in post monsoon ec was varied from 0 41 to 2 01 ms cm with mean value of 1 32 ms cm in pre monsoon from 0 6 to 2 84 ms cm with mean value of 1 49 ms cm in post monsoon it is possibly due to the presence of high ionic species from the anthropogenic source zereg et al 2018 the tds was ranged from 230 to 1505 mg l with a mean value of 723 mg l in pre monsoon from 313 to 1704 mg l with a mean value of 1006 in post monsoon mean value of tds was found much more than who and bis standard 500 mg l in both pre and post monsoon the no3 value was observed 9 20 142 6 mg l with a mean value of 55 77 mg l in pre monsoon and 17 110 mg l with an average value of 68 29 in post monsoon high no3 content in groundwater interconnected with different sources such as leaching of organic and inorganic fertilizers from the agricultural field by permeation and percolation of leachate with rainwater irrigation water and animal waste raju et al 2009 the alkalinity was ranged from 233 to 715 with an average value of 441 in pre monsoon from 66 to 126 mg l with an average of 86 71 mg l in post monsoon mg ca and k ions were observed within the acceptable limit of drinking water standard in both pre and post monsoon bis 2012 the average value 416 35 mg l of hardness was found above the who and bis standard in post monsoon the average value of chloride was found 130 mg l in pre monsoon and 156 92 mg l in post monsoon which is within the range of who and bis standard 250 mg l the cod content in groundwater samples varied from minimum 17 mg l to maximum 181 mg l with a mean value of 67 88 mg l in pre monsoon while minimum 14 mg l to maximum 107 mg l with a mean value of 57 mg l in post monsoon as shown in table 4 the mean value of bod was found very low in both pre 3 11 mg l and post monsoon 1 57 mg l period the observed average value of iron was found above the acceptable limit 0 3 mg l in both pre 0 20 mg l and post 1 06 mg l monsoon of the samples it may be due to the leaching of iron containing solid waste from the landfill sites the presence of iron above the permissible limit 1 0 mg l in groundwater is responsible for its taste and appearance which makes the water aesthetically unpleasant and safe for drinking purpose raju 2013 average concentration of po4 3 was observed below the permissible limit 5 mg l in all the seventeen water samples in pre monsoon but significantly increased value was observed in post monsoon which may be due to degradation of food garden waste fertilizer from the surrounding field and another form of waste liberate nutrients wastes cordell et al 2009 such as po4 3 from landfill site which might contaminate the groundwater fluoride was varied from 0 1 to 1 1 mg l in pre monsoon and from 0 1 to 0 7 mg l in post monsoon low concentration of fluoride is indicating the lithogenic origin and causing less impact on groundwater quality chen et al 2019 3 4 statistical analysis of groundwater quality around the landfill table 5 represents the percent of the variance initial eigen value and cumulative percent of the total variance of groundwater data obtained in pre and post monsoon it is inferred that the first six components together account for 84 18 in pre monsoon and 84 56 in post monsoon of the total variance in which the first component accounts for 28 98 of the total variance in pre monsoon and 29 66 in post monsoon showing strong positive loading between conductivity and tds table 6 shows the total variance explained data of pre and post monsoon period that showing the first component characterized by the strong loading of ph ec tds chloride alkalinity bod cod and na the high loading factor of conductivity is due to the active participation of dissolved ions in the groundwater quality strong loading between these components also indicates leaching of solid waste effluent from the open landfill site kumar and alappat 2005b the second component explains 18 666 in pre monsoon and 18 341 in post monsoon characterized by ca and na strong loading the third component is 12 998 in pre monsoon and12 511 in post monsoon of the total variance it shows strong loading of fe phosphate and do the fourth component exhibits 8 296 in pre monsoon and 9 251 in post monsoon of the total variance showing strong loading of nitrate ion which may be due to leached fertilizer from agriculture field area srivastava and ramanathan 2008 the fifth component explains 7 691 in pre monsoon and 7 873 in post monsoon the sixth component explains 7 544 in pre monsoon and 6 915 in post monsoon 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis cluster analysis is a useful statistical analysis for the analysis of groundwater quality data with an outlook to group the similar pollution sources srivastava et al 2012 the output result of cluster analysis has shown as a dendrogram figs 2 and 3 the horizontal axis indicates the relative similarity of different cluster groups lesser distance corresponds to a greater similarity between samples shankar and paliy 2016 there were three distinct clusters of the samples as shown in figs 2 and 3 obtained for both pre and post monsoon data cluster 3 represents the samples that are highly contaminated under the influence of msw open landfill site cluster 2 represents the samples having moderate pollution level and cluster 1 represents low pollution level with no influence of msw open landfill site 3 6 spatial distribution of observed pollutants in groundwater around the landfill zonation map of high values observed pollutants ec tds no3 fe and po4 3 were prepared by setting the value below and above the acceptable limit of groundwater quality in arc gis bis 2012 the zonation maps of the spatial distribution of this pollutant are showing in figs 4 8 respectively the spatial distribution map of ec and tds are showing the most of the area is contaminated during the post monsoon period mishra et al 2018b no3 concentration was observed above the acceptable limit in the almost whole study area during post monsoon vertical profile of soil is more vulnerable for no3 saturation which results in leaching from the landfill site to the groundwater huan et al 2016 in pre monsoon period the po4 3 value observed below the acceptable limit in almost whole study area but in post monsoon area comes under above the acceptable limit of drinking water standard 5 mg l that indicate the large anthropogenic impact of po4 3 generating sources like surrounding agricultural practices organic waste from municipal solid waste kumar et al 2007 high iron content in the study area may be due to redox reactions and ion exchange process that favoured the iron contamination from the solid waste into the groundwater manahan 2017 it was clearly observed that during the post monsoon period the tds no3 po4 3 and iron concentration increased very fast near to the landfill site as compare to the pre monsoon period these pollutants were also observed high in leachate characteristic results thus the spatial distribution of pollutants shown in the map clearly marked that above acceptable limit area is very close to the landfill site would be one of the reasons for groundwater pollution mishra et al 2018c 3 7 assessment of water quality index wqi the results of all groundwater analysis were used for wqi evaluation further the world health standards who 2008 and the bureau of indian standards 2012 were utilized for wqi calculations as shown in table 5 13 the calculated wqi values range from 89 42 to 99 37 in the pre monsoon and 88 25 to 99 62 in the post monsoon during pre monsoon eight water samples w1 w3 w4 w6 h1 h7 h8 and h9 are classified as excellent water and seven samples w5 w7 h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 are classified as good water while only one sample w2 comes under fair water quality in post monsoon five water samples w1 w4 w7 h1 h2 comes under excellent water quality four samples w2 w6 h5 and h6 are showing good water quality and six samples w3 h3 h4 h7 h8 and h9 are showing fair water quality results of wqi showed that in pre monsoon 50 of groundwater samples are excellent that encountered desirable level 43 75 are good and 6 25 are fair water quality for drinking purpose during post monsoon the quality of water is significantly changed that is 37 5 are excellent 25 are good and 37 5 are fair it may be due to a rise in groundwater table during post monsoon therefore water may be contaminated easily in comparison to the deep groundwater table of pre monsoon see table 8 the wells and hand pumps samples which are very close to dumping site within 600 m showing the highest concentration of tds hardness alkalinity nitrate cod iron and chromium in post monsoon these parameters also observed with high value in msw leachate samples it may be possibilities that msw leachate percolate during monsoon periods and contaminates the nearest observation wells in table 9 as the distance from the dumping site increases the concentration of some observed parameter likes tds hardness nitrate alkalinity and cod decreases 3 8 the output of groundwater flow modeling groundwater flow modeling is significant for conceptualizing the hydrogeological processes and forecasting the leachate pollutants this is also helpful for the leachate treatment or for the discharge of leachate to the surrounding environment farquhar 1989 therefore simulation of the model is done for one year by giving input value to the flow setting database of the software the direction of the groundwater flow of the simulated model shown in fig 9 which indicates that the groundwater is flowing from higher heads water table to lower heads towards ganga river in the study area the maximum velocity of groundwater flow is calculated to be 5 7 10 7 m s fig 10 the studied area having distinct flow patterns from west plain to east riverside following the topographical elevation mainly changes in hydraulic gradient responsible for such flow pattern therefore an increase in the hydraulic head during the post monsoon period may be responsible for the downward and outward flow of groundwater anilkumar et al 2015 it may be the cause of groundwater contamination towards riverside the results of wqi evaluation also reveals that most of the study area is fair in post monsoon and groundwater flow modeling of the study also shows the direction of groundwater flow towards the fair water quality therefore this finding may play an important role in protecting the fair water quality to become threatened water in the future perspective 3 9 calibration graph most of the observed point comes under 95 interval as shows in calibration graphs fig 11 a 95 confidence interval allows the user to visualize a range of calculated values for each observed value with 95 confidence tutorial gms 10 1 2016 it means the simulated result will be acceptable for this observed value according to sensitivity analysis it was observed that model results were influenced by hydraulic conductivity specific storage and specific yield of layers the correlation coefficient r2 was equal to 0 714 for the calculated and observed head this represented a good agreement between measured and simulated values 4 conclusions based on the findings from the present study it is concluded that the groundwater quality is deteriorated gradually around the ramna landfill of varanasi city due to leaching of landfill leachate and not safe for drinking purpose as most of the physico chemical parameter values exceed the permissible limit of drinking water standard prescribed by who bis factor analysis signifies positive loading of most of the pollutant which shows msw impact on groundwater quality the significant spatial variation in tds no3 fe and po4 3 during pre and post monsoon indicated anthropogenic impacts on groundwater quality results of wqi showed that groundwater is gradually changed from good to fair water quality which is very near to landfill site that can be threatened in the near future as groundwater flow direction was also found towards this this study could be very helpful in protecting the groundwater from good water quality to become threatened water around the open msw landfill site in a future perspective the modeling approach can be used to execute assessments of the long term emissions of the pollutant from msw leachates and might be helpful in groundwater protection 5 funding information one of the authors sachin mishra acknowledged the indian institute of technology for providing financial support

calculated by the following formula 8 wqi i 1 n s i i x w i where si i is the sub index value of the ith parameter and which calculated by sub index curve developed by ramesh and his colleagues in 2010 by giving rating value between 0 to 100 based on its desirable and acceptable limits prescribed by bis 2012 and who 2008 as per the water quality index values the water quality classified into six classes ramesh et al 2010 tables 1 and 7 location 2 5 simulation of groundwater modeling the combination of darcy s law and continuity equation explain the flow of groundwater in the non

and discussions results of leachate samples analysis and groundwater water samples analysis were discussed with statistically and spatially around the landfill site using spss and gis software 3 1 physico chemical characteristics of leachate samples table 2 shows the results of physico chemical analysis of leachate samples l1 and l2 the observed temperature range of 24 9 0c 27 0 c is favourable for microbial activity in the process of leachate formation and other chemical and biological reactions sulemana et al 2015 ph value of leachate samples was found in the range of 8 3 9 3 the alkaline characteristic of leachate specifies the degraded landfill site singh et al 2016 kjeldsen et al 2002 ec 5 65 ms cm tds 2825 mg l chloride 1420 mg l no3 72 mg l and mg 275 mg l values were found the maximum in l2 leachate sample as compared to l1 leachate sample which is shown in table 2 high conductivity value in the leachate greatly impacts the groundwater flow inside the soil strata which facilitate the leaching of pollutants to contaminates the aquifer system sormunen et al 2008 hardness 800 mg l alkalinity 2200 mg l bod 1344 mg l cod 8386 mg l ca 360 mg l na 875 mg l k 1337 mg l and po4 3 42 3 mg l content were found maximum in l1 leachate sample high bod and cod value indicates a strong leachate characteristic which can affect the leachate treatment process raghab et al 2013 el fadel et al 2003 it is obvious from table 2 that 2 12 mg l of cr 0 026 mg l of cu and 2 80 mg l of fe were detected in l2 leachate sample while 1 42 mg l 0 64 mg l and 8 01 mg l were detected in l1 leachate sample respectively cr content in leachate indicates the presence of wood preservatives and paint products in the dumped solid waste vázquez carranzo and awwa 2012 high level of fe 8 01 mg l in the leachate sample indicates that iron and steel constituents are also present in solid waste nagarajan et al 2012 the dark brown colour of the leachate reveals the oxidation of ferrous to ferric form and the formation of ferric hydroxide colloid chu et al 1994 reduction of these heavy metals is more common into more soluble species hence the concentration of these heavy metals increases under favourable conditions near to a landfill site and may lead to serious toxicity to surrounding subsurface aquifer kale et al 2010 thus results are showing the presence of organic and inorganic toxic materials in leachate table 2 3 2 calculation of leachate pollution index leachate pollution index lpi of the landfill site was estimated which is shown in table 3 lpi of ramna landfill site is observed high i e 15 62 this high lpi value indicated that leachate generated from landfill site is not stabilized and mature and are still undergoing decomposition and thus have high risks to cross contaminate the groundwater of surrounding areas central pollution control board 2007 naveen et al 2016 heavy metals pollutants persist a long time in leachate so its low concentration in leachate directly alters the cumulative pollution rating w i p i liu et al 2015 it may be one of the reasons for the high value of lpi in open landfill sites the high value of lpi represents a hazardous nature of landfill and has the capability to pollute surrounding groundwater mishra et al 2018a 3 3 physico chemical characteristics of groundwater around the landfill the explanatory statistics of the analysed water quality parameters during pre and post monsoon are shown in table 4 the temperature of the seventeen groundwater samples was found in the range of 27 c 33 9 c with a mean value of 31 1 c in pre monsoon while 21 1 c 23 6 c with an average value of 22 2 c in post monsoon this range of temperature impacts on the reaction of most inorganic constituents and chemical contaminants that may affect the quality of the water the ph of the groundwater samples in the study area was fluctuated from 6 4 to 7 3 with an average value of 6 9 in pre monsoon from 6 4 to 8 1 with an average of 7 67 in post monsoon ec was varied from 0 41 to 2 01 ms cm with mean value of 1 32 ms cm in pre monsoon from 0 6 to 2 84 ms cm with mean value of 1 49 ms cm in post monsoon it is possibly due to the presence of high ionic species from the anthropogenic source zereg et al 2018 the tds was ranged from 230 to 1505 mg l with a mean value of 723 mg l in pre monsoon from 313 to 1704 mg l with a mean value of 1006 in post monsoon mean value of tds was found much more than who and bis standard 500 mg l in both pre and post monsoon the no3 value was observed 9 20 142 6 mg l with a mean value of 55 77 mg l in pre monsoon and 17 110 mg l with an average value of 68 29 in post monsoon high no3 content in groundwater interconnected with different sources such as leaching of organic and inorganic fertilizers from the agricultural field by permeation and percolation of leachate with rainwater irrigation water and animal waste raju et al 2009 the alkalinity was ranged from 233 to 715 with an average value of 441 in pre monsoon from 66 to 126 mg l with an average of 86 71 mg l in post monsoon mg ca and k ions were observed within the acceptable limit of drinking water standard in both pre and post monsoon bis 2012 the average value 416 35 mg l of hardness was found above the who and bis standard in post monsoon the average value of chloride was found 130 mg l in pre monsoon and 156 92 mg l in post monsoon which is within the range of who and bis standard 250 mg l the cod content in groundwater samples varied from minimum 17 mg l to maximum 181 mg l with a mean value of 67 88 mg l in pre monsoon while minimum 14 mg l to maximum 107 mg l with a mean value of 57 mg l in post monsoon as shown in table 4 the mean value of bod was found very low in both pre 3 11 mg l and post monsoon 1 57 mg l period the observed average value of iron was found above the acceptable limit 0 3 mg l in both pre 0 20 mg l and post 1 06 mg l monsoon of the samples it may be due to the leaching of iron containing solid waste from the landfill sites the presence of iron above the permissible limit 1 0 mg l in groundwater is responsible for its taste and appearance which makes the water aesthetically unpleasant and safe for drinking purpose raju 2013 average concentration of po4 3 was observed below the permissible limit 5 mg l in all the seventeen water samples in pre monsoon but significantly increased value was observed in post monsoon which may be due to degradation of food garden waste fertilizer from the surrounding field and another form of waste liberate nutrients wastes cordell et al 2009 such as po4 3 from landfill site which might contaminate the groundwater fluoride was varied from 0 1 to 1 1 mg l in pre monsoon and from 0 1 to 0 7 mg l in post monsoon low concentration of fluoride is indicating the lithogenic origin and causing less impact on groundwater quality chen et al 2019 3 4 statistical analysis of groundwater quality around the landfill table 5 represents the percent of the variance initial eigen value and cumulative percent of the total variance of groundwater data obtained in pre and post monsoon it is inferred that the first six components together account for 84 18 in pre monsoon and 84 56 in post monsoon of the total variance in which the first component accounts for 28 98 of the total variance in pre monsoon and 29 66 in post monsoon showing strong positive loading between conductivity and tds table 6 shows the total variance explained data of pre and post monsoon period that showing the first component characterized by the strong loading of ph ec tds chloride alkalinity bod cod and na the high loading factor of conductivity is due to the active participation of dissolved ions in the groundwater quality strong loading between these components also indicates leaching of solid waste effluent from the open landfill site kumar and alappat 2005b the second component explains 18 666 in pre monsoon and 18 341 in post monsoon characterized by ca and na strong loading the third component is 12 998 in pre monsoon and12 511 in post monsoon of the total variance it shows strong loading of fe phosphate and do the fourth component exhibits 8 296 in pre monsoon and 9 251 in post monsoon of the total variance showing strong loading of nitrate ion which may be due to leached fertilizer from agriculture field area srivastava and ramanathan 2008 the fifth component explains 7 691 in pre monsoon and 7 873 in post monsoon the sixth component explains 7 544 in pre monsoon and 6 915 in post monsoon 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis cluster analysis is a useful statistical analysis for the analysis of groundwater quality data with an outlook to group the similar pollution sources srivastava et al 2012 the output result of cluster analysis has shown as a dendrogram figs 2 and 3 the horizontal axis indicates the relative similarity of different cluster groups lesser distance corresponds to a greater similarity between samples shankar and paliy 2016 there were three distinct clusters of the samples as shown in figs 2 and 3 obtained for both pre and post monsoon data cluster 3 represents the samples that are highly contaminated under the influence of msw open landfill site cluster 2 represents the samples having moderate pollution level and cluster 1 represents low pollution level with no influence of msw open landfill site 3 6 spatial distribution of observed pollutants in groundwater around the landfill zonation map of high values observed pollutants ec tds no3 fe and po4 3 were prepared by setting the value below and above the acceptable limit of groundwater quality in arc gis bis 2012 the zonation maps of the spatial distribution of this pollutant are showing in figs 4 8 respectively the spatial distribution map of ec and tds are showing the most of the area is contaminated during the post monsoon period mishra et al 2018b no3 concentration was observed above the acceptable limit in the almost whole study area during post monsoon vertical profile of soil is more vulnerable for no3 saturation which results in leaching from the landfill site to the groundwater huan et al 2016 in pre monsoon period the po4 3 value observed below the acceptable limit in almost whole study area but in post monsoon area comes under above the acceptable limit of drinking water standard 5 mg l that indicate the large anthropogenic impact of po4 3 generating sources like surrounding agricultural practices organic waste from municipal solid waste kumar et al 2007 high iron content in the study area may be due to redox reactions and ion exchange process that favoured the iron contamination from the solid waste into the groundwater manahan 2017 it was clearly observed that during the post monsoon period the tds no3 po4 3 and iron concentration increased very fast near to the landfill site as compare to the pre monsoon period these pollutants were also observed high in leachate characteristic results thus the spatial distribution of pollutants shown in the map clearly marked that above acceptable limit area is very close to the landfill site would be one of the reasons for groundwater pollution mishra et al 2018c 3 7 assessment of water quality index wqi the results of all groundwater analysis were used for wqi evaluation further the world health standards who 2008 and the bureau of indian standards 2012 were utilized for wqi calculations as shown in table 5 13 the calculated wqi values range from 89 42 to 99 37 in the pre monsoon and 88 25 to 99 62 in the post monsoon during pre monsoon eight water samples w1 w3 w4 w6 h1 h7 h8 and h9 are classified as excellent water and seven samples w5 w7 h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 are classified as good water while only one sample w2 comes under fair water quality in post monsoon five water samples w1 w4 w7 h1 h2 comes under excellent water quality four samples w2 w6 h5 and h6 are showing good water quality and six samples w3 h3 h4 h7 h8 and h9 are showing fair water quality results of wqi showed that in pre monsoon 50 of groundwater samples are excellent that encountered desirable level 43 75 are good and 6 25 are fair water quality for drinking purpose during post monsoon the quality of water is significantly changed that is 37 5 are excellent 25 are good and 37 5 are fair it may be due to a rise in groundwater table during post monsoon therefore water may be contaminated easily in comparison to the deep groundwater table of pre monsoon see table 8 the wells and hand pumps samples which are very close to dumping site within 600 m showing the highest concentration of tds hardness alkalinity nitrate cod iron and chromium in post monsoon these parameters also observed with high value in msw leachate samples it may be possibilities that msw leachate percolate during monsoon periods and contaminates the nearest observation wells in table 9 as the distance from the dumping site increases the concentration of some observed parameter likes tds hardness nitrate alkalinity and cod decreases 3 8 the output of groundwater flow modeling groundwater flow modeling is significant for conceptualizing the hydrogeological processes and forecasting the leachate pollutants this is also helpful for the leachate treatment or for the discharge of leachate to the surrounding environment farquhar 1989 therefore simulation of the model is done for one year by giving input value to the flow setting database of the software the direction of the groundwater flow of the simulated model shown in fig 9 which indicates that the groundwater is flowing from higher heads water table to lower heads towards ganga river in the study area the maximum velocity of groundwater flow is calculated to be 5 7 10 7 m s fig 10 the studied area having distinct flow patterns from west plain to east riverside following the topographical elevation mainly changes in hydraulic gradient responsible for such flow pattern therefore an increase in the hydraulic head during the post monsoon period may be responsible for the downward and outward flow of groundwater anilkumar et al 2015 it may be the cause of groundwater contamination towards riverside the results of wqi evaluation also reveals that most of the study area is fair in post monsoon and groundwater flow modeling of the study also shows the direction of groundwater flow towards the fair water quality therefore this finding may play an important role in protecting the fair water quality to become threatened water in the future perspective 3 9 calibration graph most of the observed point comes under 95 interval as shows in calibration graphs fig 11 a 95 confidence interval allows the user to visualize a range of calculated values for each observed value with 95 confidence tutorial gms 10 1 2016 it means the simulated result will be acceptable for this observed value according to sensitivity analysis it was observed that model results were influenced by hydraulic conductivity specific storage and specific yield of layers the correlation coefficient r2 was equal to 0 714 for the calculated and observed head this represented a good agreement between measured and simulated values 4 conclusions based on the findings from the present study it is concluded that the groundwater quality is deteriorated gradually around the ramna landfill of varanasi city due to leaching of landfill leachate and not safe for drinking purpose as most of the physico chemical parameter values exceed the permissible limit of drinking water standard prescribed by who bis factor analysis signifies positive loading of most of the pollutant which shows msw impact on groundwater quality the significant spatial variation in tds no3 fe and po4 3 during pre and post monsoon indicated anthropogenic impacts on groundwater quality results of wqi showed that groundwater is gradually changed from good to fair water quality which is very near to landfill site that can be threatened in the near future as groundwater flow direction was also found towards this this study could be very helpful in protecting the groundwater from good water quality to become threatened water around the open msw landfill site in a future perspective the modeling approach can be used to execute assessments of the long term emissions of the pollutant from msw leachates and might be helpful in groundwater protection 5 funding information one of the authors sachin mishra acknowledged the indian institute of technology for providing financial support

12226,groundwater quality investigation has been carried out from a sub urban area of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india to find out the controlling processes of groundwater chemistry spatially leading to groundwater contamination the groundwater quality is characterized by fresh to brackish and hard types with ca2 na mg2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 facies according to the pollution index of groundwater pig most of the study area 70 comes under the insignificant pollution zone and the rest 30 under the low pollution zone the chemical variables from the hierarchical cluster analysis hca demonstrate three distinct clusters which measure tds in cluster i hco 3 and th in cluster ii and cl na ca2 so 4 2 mg2 no 3 k and ph in cluster iii representing the salinity carbonate hardness and pollution processes respectively groundwater samples from the hca are categorized into three groups which show less moderately and highly mineralized groundwater qualities in group i ii and iii respectively depending upon the geogenic processes and the anthropogenic activities the groundwater samples of group iii influenced by low pollution activity which support the low pollution zone of pig establish the fact that the controlling processes of groundwater chemistry lead to groundwater contamination spatially the present study helps taking the strategic management measures at specific sites for sustainable development of groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater geochemistry controlling processes spatial distribution groundwater contamination sustainable development sub urban area 1 introduction analysis of water quality is one of the most fundamental aspects of groundwater studies while the knowledge of geochemical processes that control the water chemistry is needed for groundwater management now a day s contamination of groundwater resources is a matter of serious concern subba rao et al 2019 evaluation of groundwater quality is thus an essential aspect in understanding the role of rock water interactions and or impacts of anthropogenic influences on the groundwater system li et al 2016a subba rao et al 2017 gorgij et al 2019 groundwater resource is a prime source of drinking water in the world as it is generally good quality difficult to contaminate and available throughout the year li and qian 2018a b however with the rapid development of urban economy the gap between the water supply and its demand is widening day by day about 75 of the world s total population faces tremendous water scarcity while 660 million lack access to safe potable water mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 including india chaudhuri and roy 2017 in many regions of the world shortage of water and contamination of groundwater seriously restrict the economic development zhang et al 2014 li et al 2015 as contaminants and ions contained in soils dissolve thorough the recharge water and they reach finally the groundwater body causing the decline in groundwater quality subba rao 2012 2014 2017 2018 geochemistry of groundwater can be affected by natural processes including chemical reactions between water and soil and surface water groundwater interactions as well as man made activities li 2016 li et al 2016a b 2017a b subba rao et al 2002 2017 2019 su et al 2019 due to importance of groundwater in daily domestic irrigational and industrial sectors there have been many studies carried out worldwide in the topic of groundwater quality and its influencing factors to provide scientific basis for wise decision making subba rao et al 2002 2018 2019 studied the chemistry of groundwater using bivariate diagrams and statistical analysis in different parts of andhra pradesh and telangana india and observed that the soil rock water interactions rock weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation play an important role in controlling the groundwater chemistry subba rao 2008 2014 evaluated the compositional relations to examine the hydrogeochemical processes operating for development of salinity in the groundwater in parts of guntur and visakhapatnam districts andhra pradesh india using multivariate statistical analysis and found that the mineral dissolution and ion exchange and precipitation of caco3 are the dominant chemical processes regulating the chemical composition of groundwater qian and li 2011 studied the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in yinchuan plain china using statistical and geostatistical methods and observed the geological and hydrogeological conditions chemical composition of recharge water soluble salt content of soils water rock interactions and evaporation of water as the governing factors of groundwater chemistry adimalla and li 2018 and adimalla and wu 2019 explained the causes of deterioration of groundwater quality due to influences of geogenic sources and urbanization from parts of telangana india he and wu 2019 and he et al 2019 conducted a study on relationships of groundwater quality and associated health risks with land use land cover patterns in a loess area and water protection for sustainable and healthy living in shanxi china li and wu 2019a b discussed the water contamination soil pollution air pollution geological hazard risk assessment and drinking water quality tian and wu 2019 observed the rock weathering and water rock interactions as the main processes regulating the groundwater quality in northwest china therefore the variation of groundwater quality depends upon many factors such as water soil rock interactions and anthropogenic sources and the evaluation of such hydrogeochemical processes is essential for protection and management of groundwater resources for sustainable development of society in india most population is dependent on groundwater resource as the only source of much clean drinking water supply than surface water however the continuous discharge of wastewaters from domestic sewage use of chemical fertilizers and industrial sector has badly impact on groundwater sustainability therefore the sustainable management of groundwater resources is a burning challenge for the 21st century as it ensures livelihood security across the world mitra 2015 after converting the surrounding villages belonging to mostly agricultural fields of urban areas into their expansion for residential commercial and industrial uses in many regions of the developing countries without prior examination of groundwater quality people suffer a lot from the water born diseases niranjan babu et al 1997 wu and sun 2016 li and qian 2018a generally the examining the groundwater quality is essential before any developmental activities in the proposed areas however such practice inadequate in many developing countries including india which causes health disorders niranjan babu et al 1997 the surrounding villages of the rapidly growing visakhapatnam urban area are no exception from this therefore the goal of the present study is to quantify the groundwater pollution zones and also to identify the spatial distribution of controlling processes of groundwater chemistry in one of the sub urban areas of visakhapatnam region andhra pradesh india using pollution index of groundwater pig and hierarchical cluster analysis hca for implementation of remedial measures at specific site for sustainable development of groundwater resources 1 1 study area the study area lying in between latitudes 17 40 17 45 n and longitudes 83 5 83 10 e is located in southwestern part of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india fig 1 which covers an area of about 80 km2 it experiences a semi arid climate with a temperature varying from 17 c in winter december to february to 39 c in summer march to may annual rainfall is about 1000 mm southwest monsoon june september contributes 61 to the total rainfall the drainage pattern shows sub dendritic pattern characterized by ephemeral nature fig 2 1 2 geology the present study area is characterized by undulating topography sloping towards the southeastern part fig 3 the area is underlain by precambrian khondalites garnet ferrous sillimanite gneisses with charnockites pyroxene granulites pegmatites and quartzites occurring as intrusive bodies the rocks consist of quartz feldspar pyroxene sillimanite biotite apatite and opaque minerals of medium to coarse grained texture the general foliation trend of the rocks is ne sw with a dip of 70 80 se 1 3 hydrogeology groundwater occurs in two zones one is at weathered zone 1 16 m which is under the unconfined conditions and second one is at fractured zone 12 60 m which is under the semi confined conditions the depth to groundwater table is from less than 4 to more than 12 m below ground level following the topography the direction of groundwater flow is from northwest upstream to southeast downstream due to contour elevation varying from 100 to 20 m amsl fig 3 the yield of wells varies from 25 to 100 m3 day in the weathered zone and from 120 to 600 m3 day in the fractured zone cgwb 2013 1 4 environmental constraints most of the lands before converting them into urban expansion for various purposes residential commercial and industrial belong to the agricultural fields applications of uncontrolled chemical fertilizers for higher crop yields are not uncommon dumping of domestic wastes is very common phenomenon 2 methodology 2 1 collection of groundwater samples and their chemical analysis groundwater samples from 30 locations were collected in half liter plastic containers from the present study area during february 2013 fig 1 the containers were soaked in 1 1 hcl for 24 h and were rinsed with distilled water followed by deionized water before collection of groundwater samples all wells were pumped for 5 10 min to avoid the influence of stagnant water then the groundwater samples were labeled stored and transported to the laboratory for chemical analysis the groundwater samples collected from the present study area were analyzed for ph total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as caco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k bicarbonate hco 3 chloride cl sulphate so 4 2 and nitrate no 3 following the standard water quality methods suggested by american public health association apha 2012 the chemical parameters are expressed in milligrams per liter mg l ionic balance error between the total concentrations of cations ca2 mg2 na and k and the total concentrations of anions hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 expressed in milliequivalents per liter meq l were observed for each groundwater sample which is within the acceptable limit of 5 domenico and schwartz 1998 2 2 pollution index of groundwater pig for quantification of pollution activity caused by geogenic and anthropogenic sources pollution index of groundwater pig was used in the present study as proposed by subba rao 2012 the status of relative influence of individual chemical parameters such as ph tds ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 on overall groundwater quality was presented in table 1 in this method there were five steps involved to compute the pig in first step the relative weight rw from 1 to 5 was assigned for each chemical parameter depending upon its relative impact on human beings minimum weight 1 was given to k and maximum weight 5 to ph tds so 4 2 and no 3 in second step the weight parameter wp was computed for each chemical parameter to assess its relative share on overall chemical groundwater quality eq 1 in third step the status of concentration sc was determined by dividing the concentration c of each chemical parameter of each groundwater sample by its respective drinking water quality standard limit ds eq 2 in fourth step overall groundwater quality ow was computed by multiplying wp with sc eq 3 in last step pollution index of groundwater pig was calculated by adding all values of ow σow eq 4 to get a clear picture on impact of pollution on the groundwater system 1 w p r w r w 2 s c c d s 3 o w w p s c 4 p i g σ o w 2 3 hierarchical cluster analysis hca hierarchical cluster analysis hca was adopted here which is the most powerful grouping mechanism to classify the samples genetically li et al 2013 subba rao et al 2013 wu et al 2014 2019 following the statistica version 6 1 the samples of the resulting clusters or groups are similar to each other but distinct from the others in hca a complete linkage is used to determine the distance between the clusters or groups by the greatest distance between any two objects in the different clusters or groups the euclidean distance is selected between the samples as it is a geometric distance in a multi dimensional space a graphical representation of the hierarchical clustering or grouping along with the corresponding distance to achieve a linkage is called dendrogram the clusters and groups identified from the hca are used for a more comprehensive interpretation of the chemical data in terms of 11 chemical variables ph tds th ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 and 30 groundwater samples respectively the hca of chemical variables gives information on geochemical processes controlling the groundwater chemistry while the group analysis of groundwater sampling sites provide the information where the geochemical processes cause the variation of groundwater contamination 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical composition of groundwater summary of the chemical composition of groundwater is presented in table 2 the value of ph ranges from 6 5 to 8 7 and its average is 7 91 which indicates an alkaline condition of groundwater it is within its safe limit of 6 5 8 5 except in sample 27 which has ph 8 7 prescribed for drinking purpose fig 4 a bis 2012 the tds is in between 200 and 1365 mg l with an average of 796 33 mg l in 77 of the groundwater samples the tds is higher than its desirable limit of 500 mg l fig 4b which causes the gastrointestinal irritation bis 2012 the th ranges from 115 to 805 mg l being an average of 403 33 mg l which exceeds its threshold limit of 300 mg l prescribed for drinking water in 80 of

limit of 75 mg l recommended for drinking water bis 2012 in about 57 of the total groundwater samples fig 4d the concentration of mg2 is in between 8 and 128 mg l and its average is 40 53 mg l which exceeds its safe limit of 30 mg l in about 67 of the total groundwater samples fig 4e the value of na is in the range of 5 9 271 mg l being an average of 100 50 mg l which is more than its highest desirable limit of 200 mg l recommended for drinking water in about 17 of the total water samples fig 4f it causes high blood pressure bis 2012 the k is in between 0 2 and 26 mg l with an average of 5

in 50 of the groundwater samples than its recommended limit of 300 mg l for drinking purpose fig 5b bis 2012 the cl content ranges from 30 to 290 mg l being an average of 125 mg l in about 3 of the total groundwater samples fig 5c the cl content is more than its safe limit of 250 mg l for drinking water which causes salty taste bis 2012 the concentration of so 4 2 is observed to be 2 91 mg l and its average is 37 86 mg l which is below its threshold limit of 200 mg l prescribed for drinking water in all groundwater samples fig 5d bis 2012 the concentration of no 3 is in between 1 3 and 84 7

facies it is noted as a whole that the 83 33 of the groundwater samples have the hco 3 as the dominant ion while the remaining groundwater samples 16 67 show the cl as the abundant ion table 3 the dominance of hco 3 shows a freshwater environment which classifies the area as a recharge zone while the abundance of cl reflects a brackish water environment which classifies the area as a discharge zone subba rao 2007 the distribution of hco 3 and cl ions indicates that originally the area should have the similar source of ions under the influence of similar hydrogeological environmental conditions but is subsequently modified by the results of enrichment of ions depending upon the availability of anthropogenic sources such as domestic wastes irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers as a result the na and mg2 become dominant ions among the cations in 33 34 and 20 of the total groundwater samples while the so 4 2 and no 3 are the third abundant ions among the anions in 93 34 and 6 66 of the total groundwater samples the presence of na mg2 cl so 4 2 and no 3 in the groundwater is an indication of anthropogenic pollution todd 1980 hem 1991 subba rao 2007 2012 2018 3 3 quantification of groundwater contamination in assessing the quantification of groundwater contamination pig the relative contribution of chemical variables from each groundwater sample is taken into consideration if the overall chemical groundwater quality ow exceeds 0 1 it accounts for 10 of the total value of 1 0 of the pig thus it provides the information on impact of pollution on the aquifer system subba rao 2012 as per the classification of pig it is classified as an insignificant pollution if it is below 1 0 low pollution if it is from 1 0 to 1 5 moderate pollution if it varies from 1 5 to 2 0 high pollution if it is in between 2 0 and 2 5 very high pollution if it is more than 2 5 the values of pig vary from 0 339 to 1 374 with an average of 0 845 table 4 according to the classification of pig 70 of the total groundwater samples 1 6 to 10 12 to 14 16 to 19 22 24 to 28 and 30 show pig less than 1 0 0 679 which come under the insignificant pollution zone and the rest 30 of the groundwater samples 2 4 5 11 15 20 21 23 and 29 have the pig more than 1 0 1 232 which fall under the category of low pollution zone table 5 and fig 6 the groundwater samples influenced by low pollution are observed from the northern 15 southern 4 and 5 northeastern 20 and 21 northwestern 11 southeastern 2 and 23 and southwestern 29 parts fig 7 a as shown in table 5 and fig 6 the average values of ph 0 133 and tds 0 157 have the ow more than 0 1 in the insignificant pollution zone while those of th 0 087 ca2 0 071 mg2 0 056 na 0 032 k 0 006 hco 3 0 067 cl 0 041 so 4 2 0 016 and no 3 0 028 show the ow less than 0 1 on the other hand the average values of ph 0 138 tds 0 313 th 0 142 and hco 3 0 147 have the ow higher than 0 1 in the low pollution zone fig 7 further the average values of ow of ca2 0 077 mg2 0 100 na 0 097 k 0 023 cl 0 076 so 4 2 0 028 and no 3 0 089 are 1 08 1 79 3 03 3 83 1 85 1 75 and 3 18 times higher than that of insignificant pollution zone respectively thus the excess amount of these chemical parameters in the low pollution zone may be considered due to influence of anthropogenic sources on the aquifer system 3 4 hierarchical cluster analysis of chemical variables the results of hierarchical cluster analysis hca of chemical variables ph tds th ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 are illustrated in dendrogram fig 8 and presented in table 6 an imaginary horizontal line is drawn across the dendrogram at a linkage distance of 1 000 which shows three distinct clusters i to iii cluster 1 measures tds cluster ii represents hco 3 and th and cluster iii signifies cl na ca2 so 4 2 mg2 no 3 k and ph fig 8 and table 6 these clusters suggest that there are three distinct sets of influences that affect the groundwater samples subba rao et al 2013 li et al 2018a b they are salinity carbonate hardness and pollution processes respectively to characterize these three clusters the cluster 1 is considered as a result of total dissolution of all ions which gives information on degree of quality of groundwater the concentration of tds varies from 200 to 1365 mg l with an average of 796 33 mg l table 2 reflecting a wide variation in geochemical processes prevailing in the present study area therefore the cluster i is considered as salinity controlled cluster the cluster ii can be attributed to a single factor due to influence of natural processes of weathering of calcium and magnesium minerals present in the country rocks and dissolution of soil co2 in the groundwater system the th is a combination of ca2 and mg2 ions while the hco 3 is a result of soil co2 by decay of organic matter and root respiration which in turn combines with recharge water to form hco 3 eqs 5 and 6 the higher concentration of hco 3 in 83 33 of the total groundwater samples table 3 infers a dominance of mineral dissolution stumm and morgan 1996 subba rao 2002 2018 the average concentrations of th and hco 3 are 403 33 mg l and 354 33 mg l respectively table 2 since the average concentration of hco 3 354 33 mg l is 2 83 times higher than that of cl 125 mg l in the groundwater the th comes under the carbonate hardness category piper 1944 subba rao et al 2012a thus the cluster ii is considered as carbonate hardness controlled cluster 5 co 2 g h 2 o l h 2 co 3 aq 6 h 2 co 3 aq h aq hco aq the cluster iii is expected due to influences of both the geogenic processes weathering and dissolution of minerals ion exchange between ca2 and na and evaporation in terms of precipitation of caco3 and anthropogenic sources domestic wastes irrigation return flow and chemical fertilizers on the groundwater system as a result the groundwater is characterized by cl na ca2 so 4 2 mg2 no 3 k and ph which show their average values of 125 mg l 100 50 mg l 91 20 mg l 37 86 mg l 40 53 mg l 16 38 mg l 5 25 mg l and 7 91 respectively table 2 generally the concentration of no 3 does not exceed 10 mg l in fresh water environment cushing et al 1973 subba rao et al 2012b subba rao 2017 since the average concentration of no 3 16 38 mg l is 1 64 times higher than its natural limit 10 mg l in the present study area table 2 the excess amount of no 3 in the groundwater could be expected due to influence of anthropogenic source therefore the cluster iii is considered as pollution controlled cluster 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis of groundwater samples the computed results of hca of groundwater samples are presented in dendrogram fig 9 an imaginary horizontal line is drawn across the dendrogram at a linkage distance of 600 which reveals three distinct groups i to iii the corresponding groundwater sampling points are listed in table 7 about 23 of the groundwater samples 1 6 8 9 10 13 and 22 come under the group i 50 of the groundwater samples 3 7 12 14 16 to 19 21 24 to 28 and 30 come under the group ii and 27 of the groundwater samples 2 4 5 11 15 20 23 and 29 come under the group iii fig 7b the average concentrations of each group are shown in table 8 each group has a distinct groundwater quality which has also been reported by subba rao et al 2013 and wu et al 2019 in their studies carried out in a river basin area of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india and loess area of china for instance the average value of ph is 6 94 in groups i table 8 and fig 10 which is an indicator of neutral water quality that is changing chemically the average value of tds in this group is 357 14 mg l which is a characteristic feature of freshwater type tds 1000 mg l subba rao 2017 resulting mainly from the water rock interactions subba rao 2017 li et al 2018a the average value of th is 240 mg l which comes under the hard water type th 180 300 mg l subba rao 2017 calcium is the dominant ion 57 14 mg l among the cations ca2 mg2 na and k which is followed by mg2 22 86 mg l na 19 19 mg l and k 1 39 mg l whereas the hco 3 is the abundant ion 193 44 mg l among the anions hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 which is followed by cl 47 14 mg l so 4 2 14 86 mg l and no 3 4 03 mg l so the group i is characterized by ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 facies the dominance of ca2 hco 3 facies indicates the occurrence of fresh water environment in the present study area piper 1944 subba rao 2017 thus the occurrence of groundwater in group i is considered as a natural chemical quality of groundwater for evaluating the various sources in the other groups in group ii the average value of ph is 8 26 table 8 and fig 10 which is in alkaline condition the average tds content is 757 33 mg l which also comes under the fresh water type tds 1000 mg l subba rao 2017 the average concentration of th is 390 mg l which belongs to very hard water type 300 mg l subba rao 2017 on the other hand the concentration of tds is more than two times 2 12 while that of th increases to more than one time 1 63 compared to those of tds and th in group i according to the concentrations of chemical parameters table 8 the groundwater quality in group ii is characterized by ca2 na mg2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 facies further the concentrations of na no 3 k cl so 4 2 ca2 hco 3 and mg2 are 4 63 3 40 3 26 2 77 2 61 1 69 1 63 and 1 59 times higher than those of group i since the concentration of no 3 13 70 mg l is more than its natural occurrence of 10 mg l in the present study area it indicates the influence of anthropogenic source on the aquifer chemistry cushing et al 1973 subba rao et al 2012b subba rao 2017 therefore the excess concentrations of various ions along the no 3 content in group ii compared with those of group i obviously indicate the water rock interaction as the dominant controlling process and the anthropogenic origin as an additional source on the groundwater body the average values of ph tds and th in group iii are 8 09 1253 75 mg l and 571 25 mg l respectively table 8 and fig 10 which come under the alkaline ph 7 brackish tds 1000 mg l and very hard water th 300 mg l types subba rao 2017 whereas the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 are 111 64 193 43 10 601 67 182 50 56 25 and 32 24 mg l respectively table 8 therefore the chemical groundwater quality of group iii is characterized by na ca2 mg2 k hco cl so 4 2 no 3 facies the dominance of na and hco 3 ions indicates the prevailing processes of mineral weathering and dissolution in the present study area stallard and edmond 1983 stumm and morgan 1996 subba rao 2002 2008 2017 further the average concentrations of na no 3 k cl so 4 2 hco 3 mg2 and ca2 are 10 08 8 00 7 19 3 87 3 79 3 11 2 80 and 1 94 times higher than those of group i respectively these differences in the concentrations of various chemical parameters could be due to influence of pollution activity caused by anthropogenic irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers and domestic wastes sources on the existing groundwater quality of the geogenic origin water rock interactions associated with mineral weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation moreover the concentration of no 3 32 24 mg l is more than 3 times 3 22 to its natural occurrence 10 mg l in the groundwater which clearly supports the influence of man made activities on the aquifer system however its concentration is below its desirable limit of 45 mg l prescribed for drinking purpose which indicates that the pollution activity is still in the initial stage as a result it also supports the low pollution zone observed from the pig analysis it is further significant to note that the groundwater samples 2 4 5 11 15 20 23 and 29 of group iii influenced by low pollution activity are also well agreed with the groundwater samples 2 4 5 11 15 20 21 23 and 29 observed from the low pollution zone of pig fig 7b thus this established fact indicates that the controlling processes of geochemistry of groundwater lead to contamination of groundwater 3 6 sources of chemical parameters almost all chemical parameters except ph increase gradually from group i to group iii table 8 since the present study area is characterized by undulating topography fig 3 the groundwater sampling points of group i to group iii are observed from the entire study area fig 7b irrespective of topography fig 7b so the natural controlling processes of the chemistry of groundwater are not properly observed from the present study area following the flow path fig 2 therefore the possible geochemical processes responsible for variation of groundwater chemistry are discussed below generally the country rocks are the main sources of ca2 mg2 na and k ions while the anthropogenic activities are the prime sources of cl so 4 2 and no 3 ions todd 1980 hem 1991 subba rao and surya rao 2010 li et al 2016a subba rao 2017 subba rao et al 2017 the country rocks khondalites of the precambrian age of the present study area consist of feldspar plagioclase and potassium varieties and ferromagnesium minerals garnet biotite sillaminite and pyroxenes the weathering and dissolution of minerals in the presence of carbonic acid h2co3 contribute to the cations ca2 mg2 na and k and hco 3 eq 7 however the ions mg2 na and k are also a result of anthropogenic sources domestic wastes leakage of septic tanks irrigation practice and chemical fertilizers as also reported in india marghade et al 2015 subba rao et al 2017 and china li et al 2016a whereas the ions na and cl also contribute to the groundwater system due to presence of clay products by sluggish drainage conditions hem 1991 subba rao 2017 2018 7 na mg 2 ca 2 k silicates s h 2 co 3 aq hco aq na aq mg 2 aq ca 2 aq k aq h 4 sio 4 aq clays s the concentration of ca2 57 14 mg l is more than that of na 19 19 mg l in group i but they are in opposite trend in group iii i e ca2 shows 111 mg l and na shows 193 43 mg l table 8 this is expected due to a result of ion exchange process subba rao 2002 2008 2017 further the higher concentration of na 193 43 mg l in group iii reflects a rock weathering and or dissolution of soil salts stored by the influence of evaporation stallard and edmond 1983 subba rao 2002 subba rao et al 2017 while the lower concentration of k 1 39 10 mg l is because of its fixation on clays hem 1991 the gradual increasing concentrations of mg2 22 86 64 mg l k 1 39 10 mg l cl 47 14 182 50 mg l so 4 2 14 86 56 25 mg l and no 3 4 03 32 24 mg l from group i to group iii indicate the influences of domestic waste waters irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers on the aquifer system barzegar et al 2016 li et al 2016a subba rao et al 2002 2017 3 7 groundwater management since the concentrations of tds th ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl and no 3 exceed their drinking water quality standard limits of 500 300 75 30 200 12 300 250 and 45 mg l in 77 80 57 67 17 13 50 3 and 13 of the total groundwater samples respectively figs 4 and 5 they cause health disorders bis 2012 they need the suitable management strategies to promote the sustainable groundwater supply since the present study evaluates the spatial distribution of groundwater contamination caused by influences of geogenic and anthropogenic sources it can be possible to identify the specific locations where the contamination of groundwater occurs fig 7b for taking the remedial measures in view of this the conjunctive utilization of both surface water and groundwater resources through the rainwater harvesting techniques desalination and recycling and reuse of wastewater are an effective management tools to promote the continues groundwater supply further it is also necessary to create a public awareness on protection and management of groundwater studies thorough the media television radio print media and internet for their success thus these strategic measures help to decision makers for sustainable development and management of groundwater resources 4 conclusions the following conclusions were arrived after observing the results of spatial distribution of controlling processes of groundwater chemistry leading to groundwater contamination using pollution index of groundwater pig and hierarchical cluster analysis hca from one of the sub urban areas of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india the chemical quality of groundwater is characterized by alkaline fresh to brackish and hard categories it shows ca2 na mg2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 facies according to the pig 70 of the total groundwater samples come under the insignificant pollution zone pig 1 0 and the rest 30 under the low pollution zone pig 1 0 to 1 5 due to gradual influences of anthropogenic sources on the groundwater system from the hca the chemical variables show three distinct clusters cluster i signifies tds cluster ii measures hco 3 and th and cluster iii shows cl na ca2 so 4 2 mg2 no 3 k and ph which represent the salinity carbonate hardness and pollution processes respectively groundwater samples show three groups from the hca in which group i represents low mineralized groundwater quality group ii shows moderately mineralized groundwater quality and group iii has highly mineralized groundwater quality depending upon the availability sources the processes of mineral weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation appear as the controlling factors over the groundwater chemistry spatial distribution of groundwater sampling points of the groups give information on the processes that causes the groundwater contamination at a specific site through the impact of origin of geogenic and anthropogenic sources the groundwater samples of group iii influenced by low pollution activity further supporting the groundwater samples of the low pollution zone of pig establish the fact that the controlling processes of geochemistry of groundwater lead to contamination of groundwater the present study suggests the strategic management measures to civic authorities for taking them at appropriate locations for sustainable development of groundwater resources acknowledgements the authors

12226,groundwater quality investigation has been carried out from a sub urban area of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india to find out the controlling processes of groundwater chemistry spatially leading to groundwater contamination the groundwater quality is characterized by fresh to brackish and hard types with ca2 na mg2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 facies according to the pollution index of groundwater pig most of the study area 70 comes under the insignificant pollution zone and the rest 30 under the low pollution zone the chemical variables from the hierarchical cluster analysis hca demonstrate three distinct clusters which measure tds in cluster i hco 3 and th in cluster ii and cl na ca2 so 4 2 mg2 no 3 k and ph in cluster iii representing the salinity carbonate hardness and pollution processes respectively groundwater samples from the hca are categorized into three groups which show less moderately and highly mineralized groundwater qualities in group i ii and iii respectively depending upon the geogenic processes and the anthropogenic activities the groundwater samples of group iii influenced by low pollution activity which support the low pollution zone of pig establish the fact that the controlling processes of groundwater chemistry lead to groundwater contamination spatially the present study helps taking the strategic management measures at specific sites for sustainable development of groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater geochemistry controlling processes spatial distribution groundwater contamination sustainable development sub urban area 1 introduction analysis of water quality is one of the most fundamental aspects of groundwater studies while the knowledge of geochemical processes that control the water chemistry is needed for groundwater management now a day s contamination of groundwater resources is a matter of serious concern subba rao et al 2019 evaluation of groundwater quality is thus an essential aspect in understanding the role of rock water interactions and or impacts of anthropogenic influences on the groundwater system li et al 2016a subba rao et al 2017 gorgij et al 2019 groundwater resource is a prime source of drinking water in the world as it is generally good quality difficult to contaminate and available throughout the year li and qian 2018a b however with the rapid development of urban economy the gap between the water supply and its demand is widening day by day about 75 of the world s total population faces tremendous water scarcity while 660 million lack access to safe potable water mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 including india chaudhuri and roy 2017 in many regions of the world shortage of water and contamination of groundwater seriously restrict the economic development zhang et al 2014 li et al 2015 as contaminants and ions contained in soils dissolve thorough the recharge water and they reach finally the groundwater body causing the decline in groundwater quality subba rao 2012 2014 2017 2018 geochemistry of groundwater can be affected by natural processes including chemical reactions between water and soil and surface water groundwater interactions as well as man made activities li 2016 li et al 2016a b 2017a b subba rao et al 2002 2017 2019 su et al 2019 due to importance of groundwater in daily domestic irrigational and industrial sectors there have been many studies carried out worldwide in the topic of groundwater quality and its influencing factors to provide scientific basis for wise decision making subba rao et al 2002 2018 2019 studied the chemistry of groundwater using bivariate diagrams and statistical analysis in different parts of andhra pradesh and telangana india and observed that the soil rock water interactions rock weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation play an important role in controlling the groundwater chemistry subba rao 2008 2014 evaluated the compositional relations to examine the hydrogeochemical processes operating for development of salinity in the groundwater in parts of guntur and visakhapatnam districts andhra pradesh india using multivariate statistical analysis and found that the mineral dissolution and ion exchange and precipitation of caco3 are the dominant chemical processes regulating the chemical composition of groundwater qian and li 2011 studied the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in yinchuan plain china using statistical and geostatistical methods and observed the geological and hydrogeological conditions chemical composition of recharge water soluble salt content of soils water rock interactions and evaporation of water as the governing factors of groundwater chemistry adimalla and li 2018 and adimalla and wu 2019 explained the causes of deterioration of groundwater quality due to influences of geogenic sources and urbanization from parts of telangana india he and wu 2019 and he et al 2019 conducted a study on relationships of groundwater quality and associated health risks with land use land cover patterns in a loess area and water protection for sustainable and healthy living in shanxi china li and wu 2019a b discussed the water contamination soil pollution air pollution geological hazard risk assessment and drinking water quality tian and wu 2019 observed the rock weathering and water rock interactions as the main processes regulating the groundwater quality in northwest china therefore the variation of groundwater quality depends upon many factors such as water soil rock interactions and anthropogenic sources and the evaluation of such hydrogeochemical processes is essential for protection and management of groundwater resources for sustainable development of society in india most population is dependent on groundwater resource as the only source of much clean drinking water supply than surface water however the continuous discharge of wastewaters from domestic sewage use of chemical fertilizers and industrial sector has badly impact on groundwater sustainability therefore the sustainable management of groundwater resources is a burning challenge for the 21st century as it ensures livelihood security across the world mitra 2015 after converting the surrounding villages belonging to mostly agricultural fields of urban areas into their expansion for residential commercial and industrial uses in many regions of the developing countries without prior examination of groundwater quality people suffer a lot from the water born diseases niranjan babu et al 1997 wu and sun 2016 li and qian 2018a generally the examining the groundwater quality is essential before any developmental activities in the proposed areas however such practice inadequate in many developing countries including india which causes health disorders niranjan babu et al 1997 the surrounding villages of the rapidly growing visakhapatnam urban area are no exception from this therefore the goal of the present study is to quantify the groundwater pollution zones and also to identify the spatial distribution of controlling processes of groundwater chemistry in one of the sub urban areas of visakhapatnam region andhra pradesh india using pollution index of groundwater pig and hierarchical cluster analysis hca for implementation of remedial measures at specific site for sustainable development of groundwater resources 1 1 study area the study area lying in between latitudes 17 40 17 45 n and longitudes 83 5 83 10 e is located in southwestern part of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india fig 1 which covers an area of about 80 km2 it experiences a semi arid climate with a temperature varying from 17 c in winter december to february to 39 c in summer march to may annual rainfall is about 1000 mm southwest monsoon june september contributes 61 to the total rainfall the drainage pattern shows sub dendritic pattern characterized by ephemeral nature fig 2 1 2 geology the present study area is characterized by undulating topography sloping towards the southeastern part fig 3 the area is underlain by precambrian khondalites garnet ferrous sillimanite gneisses with charnockites pyroxene granulites pegmatites and quartzites occurring as intrusive bodies the rocks consist of quartz feldspar pyroxene sillimanite biotite apatite and opaque minerals of medium to coarse grained texture the general foliation trend of the rocks is ne sw with a dip of 70 80 se 1 3 hydrogeology groundwater occurs in two zones one is at weathered zone 1 16 m which is under the unconfined conditions and second one is at fractured zone 12 60 m which is under the semi confined conditions the depth to groundwater table is from less than 4 to more than 12 m below ground level following the topography the direction of groundwater flow is from northwest upstream to southeast downstream due to contour elevation varying from 100 to 20 m amsl fig 3 the yield of wells varies from 25 to 100 m3 day in the weathered zone and from 120 to 600 m3 day in the fractured zone cgwb 2013 1 4 environmental constraints most of the lands before converting them into urban expansion for various purposes residential commercial and industrial belong to the agricultural fields applications of uncontrolled chemical fertilizers for higher crop yields are not uncommon dumping of domestic wastes is very common phenomenon 2 methodology 2 1 collection of groundwater samples and their chemical analysis groundwater samples from 30 locations were collected in half liter plastic containers from the present study area during february 2013 fig 1 the containers were soaked in 1 1 hcl for 24 h and were rinsed with distilled water followed by deionized water before collection of groundwater samples all wells were pumped for 5 10 min to avoid the influence of stagnant water then the groundwater samples were labeled stored and transported to the laboratory for chemical analysis the groundwater samples collected from the present study area were analyzed for ph total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as caco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k bicarbonate hco 3 chloride cl sulphate so 4 2 and nitrate no 3 following the standard water quality methods suggested by american public health association apha 2012 the chemical parameters are expressed in milligrams per liter mg l ionic balance error between the total concentrations of cations ca2 mg2 na and k and the total concentrations of anions hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 expressed in milliequivalents per liter meq l were observed for each groundwater sample which is within the acceptable limit of 5 domenico and schwartz 1998 2 2 pollution index of groundwater pig for quantification of pollution activity caused by geogenic and anthropogenic sources pollution index of groundwater pig was used in the present study as proposed by subba rao 2012 the status of relative influence of individual chemical parameters such as ph tds ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 on overall groundwater quality was presented in table 1 in this method there were five steps involved to compute the pig in first step the relative weight rw from 1 to 5 was assigned for each chemical parameter depending upon its relative impact on human beings minimum weight 1 was given to k and maximum weight 5 to ph tds so 4 2 and no 3 in second step the weight parameter wp was computed for each chemical parameter to assess its relative share on overall chemical groundwater quality eq 1 in third step the status of concentration sc was determined by dividing the concentration c of each chemical parameter of each groundwater sample by its respective drinking water quality standard limit ds eq 2 in fourth step overall groundwater quality ow was computed by multiplying wp with sc eq 3 in last step pollution index of groundwater pig was calculated by adding all values of ow σow eq 4 to get a clear picture on impact of pollution on the groundwater system 1 w p r w r w 2 s c c d s 3 o w w p s c 4 p i g σ o w 2 3 hierarchical cluster analysis hca hierarchical cluster analysis hca was adopted here which is the most powerful grouping mechanism to classify the samples genetically li et al 2013 subba rao et al 2013 wu et al 2014 2019 following the statistica version 6 1 the samples of the resulting clusters or groups are similar to each other but distinct from the others in hca a complete linkage is used to determine the distance between the clusters or groups by the greatest distance between any two objects in the different clusters or groups the euclidean distance is selected between the samples as it is a geometric distance in a multi dimensional space a graphical representation of the hierarchical clustering or grouping along with the corresponding distance to achieve a linkage is called dendrogram the clusters and groups identified from the hca are used for a more comprehensive interpretation of the chemical data in terms of 11 chemical variables ph tds th ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 and 30 groundwater samples respectively the hca of chemical variables gives information on geochemical processes controlling the groundwater chemistry while the group analysis of groundwater sampling sites provide the information where the geochemical processes cause the variation of groundwater contamination 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical composition of groundwater summary of the chemical composition of groundwater is presented in table 2 the value of ph ranges from 6 5 to 8 7 and its average is 7 91 which indicates an alkaline condition of groundwater it is within its safe limit of 6 5 8 5 except in sample 27 which has ph 8 7 prescribed for drinking purpose fig 4 a bis 2012 the tds is in between 200 and 1365 mg l with an average of 796 33 mg l in 77 of the groundwater samples the tds is higher than its desirable limit of 500 mg l fig 4b which causes the gastrointestinal irritation bis 2012 the th ranges from 115 to 805 mg l being an average of 403 33 mg l which exceeds its threshold limit of 300 mg l prescribed for drinking water in 80 of the total groundwater samples fig 4c which develop scale on well structures bis 2012 the ca2 content varies from 32 to 168 mg l with an average of 91 20 mg l table 2 which is more than its desirable limit of 75 mg l recommended for drinking water bis 2012 in about 57 of the total groundwater samples fig 4d the concentration of mg2 is in between 8 and 128 mg l and its average is 40 53 mg l which exceeds its safe limit of 30 mg l in about 67 of the total groundwater samples fig 4e the value of na is in the range of 5 9 271 mg l being an average of 100 50 mg l which is more than its highest desirable limit of 200 mg l recommended for drinking water in about 17 of the total water samples fig 4f it causes high blood pressure bis 2012 the k is in between 0 2 and 26 mg l with an average of 5 25 mg l the safe limit of k 12 mg l exceeds in about 13 of the groundwater samples fig 5 a bis 2012 the concentration of hco 3 is from 110 to 790 mg l with an average of 354 33 mg l table 2 it exceeds in 50 of the groundwater samples than its recommended limit of 300 mg l for drinking purpose fig 5b bis 2012 the cl content ranges from 30 to 290 mg l being an average of 125 mg l in about 3 of the total groundwater samples fig 5c the cl content is more than its safe limit of 250 mg l for drinking water which causes salty taste bis 2012 the concentration of so 4 2 is observed to be 2 91 mg l and its average is 37 86 mg l which is below its threshold limit of 200 mg l prescribed for drinking water in all groundwater samples fig 5d bis 2012 the concentration of no 3 is in between 1 3 and 84 7 mg l with an average of 16 38 mg l which is more than its desirable limit of 45 mg l in about 13 of the groundwater samples fig 5e which causes blue baby disease bis 2012 3 2 hydrogeochemical facies the quality of groundwater is characterized by 11 hydrogeochemical facies table 3 which explain the distribution and genesis of principal groundwater types along the flow paths subba rao et al 2012a b majority of the groundwater samples 60 10 show a ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 23 33 b ca2 na mg2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 20 and c na ca2 mg2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 16 68 facies the rest of the groundwater samples 39 90 are represented by d mg2 ca2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 10 which is followed by e mg2 ca2 na k cl hco 3 so 4 2 no 3 6 67 f na ca2 mg2 k cl hco 3 so 4 2 no 3 6 67 g ca2 mg2 na k cl hco 3 so 4 2 no 3 3 33 h mg2 na ca2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 3 33 i na ca2 mg2 k hco 3 cl no 3 so 4 2 3 33 j na ca2 mg2 k hco 3 cl no 3 so 4 2 3 33 and k na mg2 ca2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 3 33 facies it is noted as a whole that the 83 33 of the groundwater samples have the hco 3 as the dominant ion while the remaining groundwater samples 16 67 show the cl as the abundant ion table 3 the dominance of hco 3 shows a freshwater environment which classifies the area as a recharge zone while the abundance of cl reflects a brackish water environment which classifies the area as a discharge zone subba rao 2007 the distribution of hco 3 and cl ions indicates that originally the area should have the similar source of ions under the influence of similar hydrogeological environmental conditions but is subsequently modified by the results of enrichment of ions depending upon the availability of anthropogenic sources such as domestic wastes irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers as a result the na and mg2 become dominant ions among the cations in 33 34 and 20 of the total groundwater samples while the so 4 2 and no 3 are the third abundant ions among the anions in 93 34 and 6 66 of the total groundwater samples the presence of na mg2 cl so 4 2 and no 3 in the groundwater is an indication of anthropogenic pollution todd 1980 hem 1991 subba rao 2007 2012 2018 3 3 quantification of groundwater contamination in assessing the quantification of groundwater contamination pig the relative contribution of chemical variables from each groundwater sample is taken into consideration if the overall chemical groundwater quality ow exceeds 0 1 it accounts for 10 of the total value of 1 0 of the pig thus it provides the information on impact of pollution on the aquifer system subba rao 2012 as per the classification of pig it is classified as an insignificant pollution if it is below 1 0 low pollution if it is from 1 0 to 1 5 moderate pollution if it varies from 1 5 to 2 0 high pollution if it is in between 2 0 and 2 5 very high pollution if it is more than 2 5 the values of pig vary from 0 339 to 1 374 with an average of 0 845 table 4 according to the classification of pig 70 of the total groundwater samples 1 6 to 10 12 to 14 16 to 19 22 24 to 28 and 30 show pig less than 1 0 0 679 which come under the insignificant pollution zone and the rest 30 of the groundwater samples 2 4 5 11 15 20 21 23 and 29 have the pig more than 1 0 1 232 which fall under the category of low pollution zone table 5 and fig 6 the groundwater samples influenced by low pollution are observed from the northern 15 southern 4 and 5 northeastern 20 and 21 northwestern 11 southeastern 2 and 23 and southwestern 29 parts fig 7 a as shown in table 5 and fig 6 the average values of ph 0 133 and tds 0 157 have the ow more than 0 1 in the insignificant pollution zone while those of th 0 087 ca2 0 071 mg2 0 056 na 0 032 k 0 006 hco 3 0 067 cl 0 041 so 4 2 0 016 and no 3 0 028 show the ow less than 0 1 on the other hand the average values of ph 0 138 tds 0 313 th 0 142 and hco 3 0 147 have the ow higher than 0 1 in the low pollution zone fig 7 further the average values of ow of ca2 0 077 mg2 0 100 na 0 097 k 0 023 cl 0 076 so 4 2 0 028 and no 3 0 089 are 1 08 1 79 3 03 3 83 1 85 1 75 and 3 18 times higher than that of insignificant pollution zone respectively thus the excess amount of these chemical parameters in the low pollution zone may be considered due to influence of anthropogenic sources on the aquifer system 3 4 hierarchical cluster analysis of chemical variables the results of hierarchical cluster analysis hca of chemical variables ph tds th ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 are illustrated in dendrogram fig 8 and presented in table 6 an imaginary horizontal line is drawn across the dendrogram at a linkage distance of 1 000 which shows three distinct clusters i to iii cluster 1 measures tds cluster ii represents hco 3 and th and cluster iii signifies cl na ca2 so 4 2 mg2 no 3 k and ph fig 8 and table 6 these clusters suggest that there are three distinct sets of influences that affect the groundwater samples subba rao et al 2013 li et al 2018a b they are salinity carbonate hardness and pollution processes respectively to characterize these three clusters the cluster 1 is considered as a result of total dissolution of all ions which gives information on degree of quality of groundwater the concentration of tds varies from 200 to 1365 mg l with an average of 796 33 mg l table 2 reflecting a wide variation in geochemical processes prevailing in the present study area therefore the cluster i is considered as salinity controlled cluster the cluster ii can be attributed to a single factor due to influence of natural processes of weathering of calcium and magnesium minerals present in the country rocks and dissolution of soil co2 in the groundwater system the th is a combination of ca2 and mg2 ions while the hco 3 is a result of soil co2 by decay of organic matter and root respiration which in turn combines with recharge water to form hco 3 eqs 5 and 6 the higher concentration of hco 3 in 83 33 of the total groundwater samples table 3 infers a dominance of mineral dissolution stumm and morgan 1996 subba rao 2002 2018 the average concentrations of th and hco 3 are 403 33 mg l and 354 33 mg l respectively table 2 since the average concentration of hco 3 354 33 mg l is 2 83 times higher than that of cl 125 mg l in the groundwater the th comes under the carbonate hardness category piper 1944 subba rao et al 2012a thus the cluster ii is considered as carbonate hardness controlled cluster 5 co 2 g h 2 o l h 2 co 3 aq 6 h 2 co 3 aq h aq hco aq the cluster iii is expected due to influences of both the geogenic processes weathering and dissolution of minerals ion exchange between ca2 and na and evaporation in terms of precipitation of caco3 and anthropogenic sources domestic wastes irrigation return flow and chemical fertilizers on the groundwater system as a result the groundwater is characterized by cl na ca2 so 4 2 mg2 no 3 k and ph which show their average values of 125 mg l 100 50 mg l 91 20 mg l 37 86 mg l 40 53 mg l 16 38 mg l 5 25 mg l and 7 91 respectively table 2 generally the concentration of no 3 does not exceed 10 mg l in fresh water environment cushing et al 1973 subba rao et al 2012b subba rao 2017 since the average concentration of no 3 16 38 mg l is 1 64 times higher than its natural limit 10 mg l in the present study area table 2 the excess amount of no 3 in the groundwater could be expected due to influence of anthropogenic source therefore the cluster iii is considered as pollution controlled cluster 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis of groundwater samples the computed results of hca of groundwater samples are presented in dendrogram fig 9 an imaginary horizontal line is drawn across the dendrogram at a linkage distance of 600 which reveals three distinct groups i to iii the corresponding groundwater sampling points are listed in table 7 about 23 of the groundwater samples 1 6 8 9 10 13 and 22 come under the group i 50 of the groundwater samples 3 7 12 14 16 to 19 21 24 to 28 and 30 come under the group ii and 27 of the groundwater samples 2 4 5 11 15 20 23 and 29 come under the group iii fig 7b the average concentrations of each group are shown in table 8 each group has a distinct groundwater quality which has also been reported by subba rao et al 2013 and wu et al 2019 in their studies carried out in a river basin area of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india and loess area of china for instance the average value of ph is 6 94 in groups i table 8 and fig 10 which is an indicator of neutral water quality that is changing chemically the average value of tds in this group is 357 14 mg l which is a characteristic feature of freshwater type tds 1000 mg l subba rao 2017 resulting mainly from the water rock interactions subba rao 2017 li et al 2018a the average value of th is 240 mg l which comes under the hard water type th 180 300 mg l subba rao 2017 calcium is the dominant ion 57 14 mg l among the cations ca2 mg2 na and k which is followed by mg2 22 86 mg l na 19 19 mg l and k 1 39 mg l whereas the hco 3 is the abundant ion 193 44 mg l among the anions hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 which is followed by cl 47 14 mg l so 4 2 14 86 mg l and no 3 4 03 mg l so the group i is characterized by ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 facies the dominance of ca2 hco 3 facies indicates the occurrence of fresh water environment in the present study area piper 1944 subba rao 2017 thus the occurrence of groundwater in group i is considered as a natural chemical quality of groundwater for evaluating the various sources in the other groups in group ii the average value of ph is 8 26 table 8 and fig 10 which is in alkaline condition the average tds content is 757 33 mg l which also comes under the fresh water type tds 1000 mg l subba rao 2017 the average concentration of th is 390 mg l which belongs to very hard water type 300 mg l subba rao 2017 on the other hand the concentration of tds is more than two times 2 12 while that of th increases to more than one time 1 63 compared to those of tds and th in group i according to the concentrations of chemical parameters table 8 the groundwater quality in group ii is characterized by ca2 na mg2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 facies further the concentrations of na no 3 k cl so 4 2 ca2 hco 3 and mg2 are 4 63 3 40 3 26 2 77 2 61 1 69 1 63 and 1 59 times higher than those of group i since the concentration of no 3 13 70 mg l is more than its natural occurrence of 10 mg l in the present study area it indicates the influence of anthropogenic source on the aquifer chemistry cushing et al 1973 subba rao et al 2012b subba rao 2017 therefore the excess concentrations of various ions along the no 3 content in group ii compared with those of group i obviously indicate the water rock interaction as the dominant controlling process and the anthropogenic origin as an additional source on the groundwater body the average values of ph tds and th in group iii are 8 09 1253 75 mg l and 571 25 mg l respectively table 8 and fig 10 which come under the alkaline ph 7 brackish tds 1000 mg l and very hard water th 300 mg l types subba rao 2017 whereas the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl so 4 2 and no 3 are 111 64 193 43 10 601 67 182 50 56 25 and 32 24 mg l respectively table 8 therefore the chemical groundwater quality of group iii is characterized by na ca2 mg2 k hco cl so 4 2 no 3 facies the dominance of na and hco 3 ions indicates the prevailing processes of mineral weathering and dissolution in the present study area stallard and edmond 1983 stumm and morgan 1996 subba rao 2002 2008 2017 further the average concentrations of na no 3 k cl so 4 2 hco 3 mg2 and ca2 are 10 08 8 00 7 19 3 87 3 79 3 11 2 80 and 1 94 times higher than those of group i respectively these differences in the concentrations of various chemical parameters could be due to influence of pollution activity caused by anthropogenic irrigation return flows chemical fertilizers and domestic wastes sources on the existing groundwater quality of the geogenic origin water rock interactions associated with mineral weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation moreover the concentration of no 3 32 24 mg l is more than 3 times 3 22 to its natural occurrence 10 mg l in the groundwater which clearly supports the influence of man made activities on the aquifer system however its concentration is below its desirable limit of 45 mg l prescribed for drinking purpose which indicates that the pollution activity is still in the initial stage as a result it also supports the low pollution zone observed from the pig analysis it is further significant to note that the groundwater samples 2 4 5 11 15 20 23 and 29 of group iii influenced by low pollution activity are also well agreed with the groundwater samples 2 4 5 11 15 20 21 23 and 29 observed from the low pollution zone of pig fig 7b thus this established fact indicates that the controlling processes of geochemistry of groundwater lead to contamination of groundwater 3 6 sources of chemical parameters almost all chemical parameters except ph increase gradually from group i to group iii table 8 since the present study area is characterized by undulating topography fig 3 the groundwater sampling points of group i to group iii are observed from the entire study area fig 7b irrespective of topography fig 7b so the natural controlling processes of the chemistry of groundwater are not properly observed from the present study area following the flow path fig 2 therefore the possible geochemical processes responsible for variation of groundwater chemistry are discussed below generally the country rocks are the main sources of ca2 mg2 na and k ions while the anthropogenic activities are the prime sources of cl so 4 2 and no 3 ions todd 1980 hem 1991 subba rao and surya rao 2010 li et al 2016a subba rao 2017 subba rao et al 2017 the country rocks khondalites of the precambrian age of the present study area consist of feldspar plagioclase and potassium varieties and ferromagnesium minerals garnet biotite sillaminite and pyroxenes the weathering and dissolution of minerals in the presence of carbonic acid h2co3 contribute to the cations ca2 mg2 na and k and hco 3 eq 7 however the ions mg2 na and k are also a result of anthropogenic sources domestic wastes leakage of septic tanks irrigation practice and chemical fertilizers as also reported in india marghade et al 2015 subba rao et al 2017 and china li et al 2016a whereas the ions na and cl also contribute to the groundwater system due to presence of clay products by sluggish drainage conditions hem 1991 subba rao 2017 2018 7 na mg 2 ca 2 k silicates s h 2 co 3 aq hco aq na aq mg 2 aq ca 2 aq k aq h 4 sio 4 aq clays s the concentration of ca2 57 14 mg l is more than that of na 19 19 mg l in group i but they are in opposite trend in group iii i e ca2 shows 111 mg l and na shows 193 43 mg l table 8 this is expected due to a result of ion exchange process subba rao 2002 2008 2017 further the higher concentration of na 193 43 mg l in group iii reflects a rock weathering and or dissolution of soil salts stored by the influence of evaporation stallard and edmond 1983 subba rao 2002 subba rao et al 2017 while the lower concentration of k 1 39 10 mg l is because of its fixation on clays hem 1991 the gradual increasing concentrations of mg2 22 86 64 mg l k 1 39 10 mg l cl 47 14 182 50 mg l so 4 2 14 86 56 25 mg l and no 3 4 03 32 24 mg l from group i to group iii indicate the influences of domestic waste waters irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers on the aquifer system barzegar et al 2016 li et al 2016a subba rao et al 2002 2017 3 7 groundwater management since the concentrations of tds th ca2 mg2 na k hco 3 cl and no 3 exceed their drinking water quality standard limits of 500 300 75 30 200 12 300 250 and 45 mg l in 77 80 57 67 17 13 50 3 and 13 of the total groundwater samples respectively figs 4 and 5 they cause health disorders bis 2012 they need the suitable management strategies to promote the sustainable groundwater supply since the present study evaluates the spatial distribution of groundwater contamination caused by influences of geogenic and anthropogenic sources it can be possible to identify the specific locations where the contamination of groundwater occurs fig 7b for taking the remedial measures in view of this the conjunctive utilization of both surface water and groundwater resources through the rainwater harvesting techniques desalination and recycling and reuse of wastewater are an effective management tools to promote the continues groundwater supply further it is also necessary to create a public awareness on protection and management of groundwater studies thorough the media television radio print media and internet for their success thus these strategic measures help to decision makers for sustainable development and management of groundwater resources 4 conclusions the following conclusions were arrived after observing the results of spatial distribution of controlling processes of groundwater chemistry leading to groundwater contamination using pollution index of groundwater pig and hierarchical cluster analysis hca from one of the sub urban areas of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india the chemical quality of groundwater is characterized by alkaline fresh to brackish and hard categories it shows ca2 na mg2 k hco 3 cl so 4 2 no 3 facies according to the pig 70 of the total groundwater samples come under the insignificant pollution zone pig 1 0 and the rest 30 under the low pollution zone pig 1 0 to 1 5 due to gradual influences of anthropogenic sources on the groundwater system from the hca the chemical variables show three distinct clusters cluster i signifies tds cluster ii measures hco 3 and th and cluster iii shows cl na ca2 so 4 2 mg2 no 3 k and ph which represent the salinity carbonate hardness and pollution processes respectively groundwater samples show three groups from the hca in which group i represents low mineralized groundwater quality group ii shows moderately mineralized groundwater quality and group iii has highly mineralized groundwater quality depending upon the availability sources the processes of mineral weathering and dissolution ion exchange and evaporation appear as the controlling factors over the groundwater chemistry spatial distribution of groundwater sampling points of the groups give information on the processes that causes the groundwater contamination at a specific site through the impact of origin of geogenic and anthropogenic sources the groundwater samples of group iii influenced by low pollution activity further supporting the groundwater samples of the low pollution zone of pig establish the fact that the controlling processes of geochemistry of groundwater lead to contamination of groundwater the present study suggests the strategic management measures to civic authorities for taking them at appropriate locations for sustainable development of groundwater resources acknowledgements the authors

12227,this study aims to delineate groundwater potential zones using an integrated approach of remote sensing geographical information system gis and analytical hierarchy process ahp method in dumka district jharkhand india multiple data as lithology lineament density geomorphology slope soil rainfall drainage density and land use land cover were considered for delineating the groundwater potential zones spatially distributed maps thematic layers of all the aforementioned parameters were created using remotely sensed as well as ground data in a gis environment these thematic layers were assigned suitable weights on the saaty s scale according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence in the study area the assigned weights of the thematic layers and their features were then normalized by using the ahp technique ultimately all thematic layers were integrated by a weighted linear combination method in a gis environment to produce a groundwater potential zones map the delineated groundwater potential zones in the study area were categorized as very good good moderate and poor respectively the results showed that area along the mayurakshi river rajmahal pipra lathipahar phitkoria jhajhapur etc which is approximately 11 404 96 km2 of the total study area was delineated as an area having very good potential for groundwater the good zone delineated encompassed approximately 38 1 389 61 km2 of the study area and was found in the pediment pediplain complex zone the moderate zones encompassed approximately 44 1 602 07 km2 of the area the poor zones encompassed approximately 7 260 58 km2 of the area which included raneshwar asanbani chichro sarni and certain parts of musna the groundwater potential zone map was compared with the actual discharge data from various wells within the study area and was found reasonable overall this study provides a convenient approach of delineating the potential of groundwater availability which ultimately will aid in better planning and managing of groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential zones ahp gis dumka district 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most

dumka district is located in the north eastern part of the jharkhand state which lies between north latitude 23 47 20 and 24 38 57 and east longitude 86 28 25 and 86 42 16 it is bounded by godda and banka district to the north pakur to the east west bengal to the south and jamtara and deoghar to the west it covers a total geographical area of 3 716 02 km2 and elevation varies from 27 to 491 m above mean sea level amsl the district is mainly drained by the brahmani the baslo the mayurakshi and their tributaries these rivers are ephemeral in nature and most of these are structurally controlled the district is highly dissected with rivers of varying magnitude most of the tributaries carry the drainage to the western part of the district which finally meets the bhagirathi river below murshidabad west bengal all the tributaries have rapid surface runoff and surface flow hence most of the rivers dries up during summer however there is sub surface flow for a considerable part of the year which indicates the affluent nature of the rivers cgwb 2013 climatologically the study area falls under a humid subtropical climate with warm wet summers and mild winters the average annual rainfall of the district is 1 391 mm whereas july is the month which receives the highest rainfall december and january are the coldest while may and june are the hottest months during winter the mercury drops to 4 c and during summer it shoots up to 46 c the dumka district has a predominantly undulating terrain with hard rocks under the ground the entire district has upland topography with high ridges running from north to south and valleys bounded by mountains and rivers there are several hill ranges like rajmahal hill ramgarh hill and lagwa hill with several small hillocks the average elevation of the hill ranges between 150 and 300 m amsl geologically the area has gneiss basaltic trap and sedimentary beds schist and boulder beds are found in some places rajmahal trap is the major rock type in the district the other geological formations of the district are alluvium laterite and gondwana sandy loam to clay loam are the dominant soil type in the district due to topographical features the study area lacks inadequate water resources as most of the surface and groundwater flows outside the district during peak summer wells and tube wells become dry according to the cgwb report of september 2013 generally dug wells in the study area are of 2 m diameter and 8 15 m deep depending on the thickness of the weathered zone tapping the shallow groundwater in the weathered zone and an uppermost slice of the basement a large number of dug wells used for drinking water are under private ownership pre and post monsoon depth to water level during the year 2012 was recorded as between 4 45 and 12 3 m below ground level mbgl and 2 to 5 mbgl cgwb 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 preparation of thematic layers for the assessment of groundwater potential zones eight different thematic layers such as lithology geomorphology lineament density slope soil rainfall drainage density and lulc were generated using remote sensing and conventional existing data with the help of erdas imagine and arcgis software the geomorphological features and lineaments were identified using landsat 8 30 m resolution imagery which was downloaded from the earth explorer u s geological survey website www earthexplorer usgs gov the false color composite fcc image was visually interpreted with image interpretation keys such as shape size tone texture pattern and association for identifying the geomorphological landforms and lineaments the landsat 8 oli data was used to prepare lulc map using maximum likelihood classification algorithm and the ground verification was performed using 490 ground control points indian remote sensing satellite cartosat 1 digital elevation model dem data 30 m resolution was downloaded from bhuvan portal of nrsc isro www bhuvan nrsc gov in and used to generate slope and drainage pattern of the study area drainage pattern was extracted using arcswat and lineament density and drainage density maps were prepared using the line density tool in arcgis soil map was acquired in vector format from the digital soil map of the world site https worldmap harvard edu the lithology map was digitized and prepared using the geological map obtained from the geological survey of india the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm rainfall data was used to estimate the average total annual rainfall based on 12 years 2001 2012 data of 18 point locations to create rainfall distribution map by inverse distance weighted idw spatial interpolation technique in arcgis this technique uses the spatial correlation of variables and predicts the values of variables at unobserved locations based on those of observed locations singh et al 2013b this method has potential if there are enough sample points with a suitable dispersion in local scale levels the main factor affecting the accuracy of inverse distance interpolator is the value of the power parameter p burrough and mcdonnell 1998 in addition the size of the neighborhood and the number of neighbors are also relevant to the accuracy of the results all the thematic layers were prepared and converted into raster format and were projected to utm projection zone 45 datum wgs 84 with 30 m spatial resolution the overall methodology adopted in the present study is depicted in fig 2 3 2 assignments of weight and weights normalization using ahp assignment of weight of each class is the most important in integrated analysis as the output is largely dependent on the assignment of appropriate weight muralitharan and palanivel 2015 several methods have been adopted for calculating weight in order to delineate groundwater potential zone such as index models frequency ratio fr certainty factor cf weights of evidence woe fuzzy logic multi influencing factor mif etc among these techniques analytical hierarchy process ahp is becoming a pioneer technique in groundwater prediction modeling which may provide rapid precise and cost effective results an ahp technique can be described as a pair wise matrix analytical method which is used to calculate the geometric mean and normalized weight of an individual parameter chowdhury et al 2009 jha et al 2010 kaliraj et al 2014 it generates relative ratio scales of paired comparison saaty 1990 in the present study ahp method was used and this method was developed by saaty 1980 1990 it is used as a decision solving method to finalize the weights assigned to different thematic layers and their respective features first steps involved in the ahp technique is used to breakdown the problem into a hierarchy by defining objective and identifying criteria and sub criteria according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence muralitharan and palanivel 2015 the advantage of hierarchy is that it allows us to focus judgment on each of several properties separately which are essential for making a strong decision saaty 1990 paired comparisons were made to compare all factors against each other in a matrix format which is useful in deriving measurement a standard saaty s 1 9 scale was used to determine the relative importance values for all themes and their respective features where value 1 denotes equal importance between the two themes and the value 9 denotes the extreme importance of one theme compared to other saaty 1980 asshown in table 1 the following steps were used to compute the final weights of all the thematic layers muralitharan and palanivel 2015 1 adding the values in each column of the pair wise matrix using the formula table 3 1 l j i j 1 n c i j where l j the total values in each column of the pair wise matrix and c i j the number assigned to each criteria at ith row and jth column 2 divide each element in the matrix by its column total to generate a normalized pair wise matrix table 4 2 x i j c i j l j where x i j the value at ith row and jth column in the normalized pair wise matrix 3 divide the sum of the normalized row of the matrix by the number of criteria used n to generate standard weights using the following formula 3 w i x i j n where w i standard weight 3 2 1 consistency analysis for calculating the consistency vector multiply the pair wise comparison matrix values and normalized pair wise matrix values of thematic layers accordingly using matrix multiplication muralitharan and palanivel 2015 4 for calculating the consistency vector values following formula was used 4 λ c i j x i j where λ consistency vector 5 consistency index ci as deviation or degree of consistency was calculated using the following formula 5 c i λ n n 1 where ci consistency index n number of criteria used 6 consistency ratio cr was calculated using the following formula 6 c r c i r i where ri random inconsistency randomized index of saaty 1980 if the value of consistency ratio is less than or equal to 0 1 the inconsistency is acceptable otherwise we need to revise the subjective judgment saaty 1990 random inconsistency values for n number of criteria muralitharan and palanivel 2015 are shown in table 2 where n number of criteria used and ri random inconsistency 3 3 assessment of groundwater potential zones the groundwater potential index gwpi is a dimensionless quantity which helps in delineation of groundwater potential zones in an area kumar and krishna 2018 the weighted linear combination method was applied to identify groundwater potential zones the weight of the thematic layers were multiplied by the weights of features in each thematic layer and added the products of all the attributes and obtained the total scores ts muralitharan and palanivel 2015 using the following formula 7 t s w r where ts total score w and r are the weights of the thematic layers and the weights of the features in thematic layers respectively ahp generates an overall ranking of the solutions using the comparison matrix among the alternatives and the information on the ranking of the criteria the alternative with the highest value is considered to be the first choice muralitharan and palanivel 2015 3 4 validation of groundwater potential zone the groundwater potential zone map was delineated in the present study and verified using the available well discharge data of 18 dug wells the dug well data was collected from central ground water board ranchi the well s discharge points were overlaid on the final groundwater prospect map to check the accuracy of the present work in the various groundwater prospective zones 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrologic thematic layers the occurrence and movement of groundwater depends on various factors such as geological structure topography slope precipitation soil secondary porosity drainage pattern lulc hydrological conditions of a region and the inter relationships among these factors pradhan 2009 oh et al 2011 singh et al 2011b acharya 2017 in the study eight influencing factors such as lithology li lineament density ld geomorphology ge slope sl rainfall rf soil so drainage density dd and lulc have been identified in order to delineate groundwater potential zones of the study area 4 1 1 lithology the lithology is one of the significant factor for the detection of groundwater prospective zones it directly influences both the porosity and permeability of aquifer rocks rahmati et al 2015 however some authors neglect this factor once they use the lineament and drainage characters as a function of primary and secondary porosity muralitharan and palanivel 2015 moreover others incorporate the lithology factor due to its strong influence on water percolation mukherjee et al 2012 singh et al 2013a lithology map was digitized and prepared using the geology map obtained from the geological survey of india the area mainly covered by eight types of lithological units namely basalt schist granite gneiss granulite sandstone boulder beds and laterite rocks fig 3 the gneiss is dominant 2 766 91 km2 73 6 followed by basalt 320 19 km2 8 5 and granulite 284 1 km2 7 5 other classes of lithology are laterite sandstone boulder beds schist and granite which occupied areas 204 54 5 4 109 28 3 30 77 0 8 29 81 0 7 and 15 4 0 4 km2 respectively rank has been assigned to different features based on the available porosity sedimentary rocks such as sandstone typically have much higher porosity hence have higher groundwater prospect granulite rock is hard rock and has compact structure hence given the lowest rank rocks have classified based on available porosity as sandstone boulder beds laterite basalt schist gneiss granite and granulite where sandstone represents high porosity whereas rocks like granite and granulite represent very less to nil porosity weights assigned to various thematic layers and derivation of the normalized weights using ahp techniques are shown in tables 3 and 4 consistency analysis 1 0 37 2 0 18 3 0 12 4 0 1 5 0 07 6 0 06 7 0 05 8 0 05 2 95 0 5 0 44 1 0 22 2 0 12 3 0 07 4 0 05 5 0 04 6 0 04 7 0 03 1 74 0 33 0 4 0 5 0 27 1 0 13 2 0 07

22 here the value of consistency vector λ is calculated as 7 82 further using equation 5 and 6 consistency ratio was calculated as 0 01 and found acceptable 4 1 2 lineament and lineament density lineament features such as joints fractures and faults are hydro geologically very important as it acts as a conduit for groundwater movement which results in increased porosity and therefore serves as a groundwater prospect zone obi reddy et al 2000 mukherjee et al 2012 the occurrence and movement of groundwater in hard rock terrain are mainly controlled by secondary porosity i e the presence of lineaments and fractures bagyaraj et al 2013 kumar and krishna 2018 areas around the lineaments and their intersection point are considered to be favorable sites for groundwater storage due to high infiltration rate gupta and srivastava 2010 mukherjee et al 2012 the lineament density ld is a measurable quantity derived from the lineament map in satellite imagery lineaments are interpreted using interpretation key which was identified mainly based on their linear nature the presence of moisture alignment of vegetation alignment of ponds straight stream segments and the linearity of soil tone the lineament orientation of the study area is predominantly along ne sw and nw se directions which are represented by a rose diagram fig 5 harinarayana et al 2000 found that the normalized transmissivity near the lineaments is high and excellent relationship exists between higher fracture densities and higher well yields therefore areas having higher lineament density have more impact on groundwater prospect zones the map was then classified into five classes viz very high high medium low and very low varies from 0 to 0 88 km km2 fig 4 the final weights of the lineament density feature are shown in table 5 4 1 3 geomorphology geomorphological studies together with hydrogeology and structures lineaments had proven to be very effective to locate groundwater potential zones bahuguna et al 2003 jagadeeswara rao et al 2004 muralitharan and palanivel 2015 geomorphology of an area reflects various landforms and structural features which plays an important role in assessing the groundwater potential and prospect as it controls the subsurface movement of groundwater kumar et al 2008 prasad et al 2008 machiwal et al 2011 muralitharan and palanivel 2015 kumar and krishna 2018 various geomorphic features of the study area were identified using landsat 8 satellite imagery the geomorphological feature in the study area could be categorized into six units namely river water bodies denudational origin pediment pediplain complex denudational origin moderate dissected hills and valleys denudational origin low dissected hills and valleys inselberg and structural origin moderate dissected hills and valleys fig 6 the spatial extent of the surface water bodies river is 104 km2 covering 2 76 of the study area which act as recharge zone enhancing the groundwater potential in the region the study area is dominated by denudational origin pediment pediplain complex which covers an area of 3 232 km2 85 9 denudational origin with pediment pediplain complex comprises gently undulating plains covered with weathered material that are favorable for groundwater recharge denudational origin with low dissected hills and valleys 28 km2 5 9 mainly comprises of hard rocks which act as runoff zone hence characterized as moderate denudational origins with moderate dissected hills 162 km2 4 3 are characterized by highly sloping topography and high surface runoff and categorized as a poor zone structural origins with moderate dissected hills 223 km2 5 9 are constituted by massive sandstones basalt and laterite this feature has poor to nil groundwater prospect because most of rain water which falls over them flows down slope as runoff the final weight of geomorphological features are shown in table 5 4 1 4 slope the slope is also a crucial parameter for the occurrence and recharging conditions of groundwater in a particular area bagyaraj et al 2013 slope gradient steepness directly influences the infiltration of rainfall hence an indicator for the suitability for groundwater prospect steeper slope areas generate less recharge because of high surface runoff providing insufficient time to infiltrate the surface and recharge the saturated zone magesh et al 2012 gumma and pavelic 2013 selvam et al 2015 ghosh et al 2016 the steeper slope generates rapid runoff and increase erosion rate with small potential recharge magesh et al 2012 the slope is one of the factor that controls infiltration of surface water into subsurface hence an indicator of groundwater prospect in the area with mild gentle slope the surface runoff is slow hence allowing more time for rainwater to percolate whereas area with steep slope facilitates high runoff hence allowing less time for rainwater to percolate hence comparatively less infiltration prasad et al 2008 magesh et al 2012 ghosh et al 2016 based on cartosat 1 dem data slope has been categorized into five classes as very low 0 4 low 4 10 moderate 10 20 high 20 40 and very high 40 shown in fig 7 most of the study area falls under slope category of 0 4 therefore the maximum area has a favorable slope for water retention the ranks were assigned to different slope classes using the scale of 1 9 higher rank was assigned to lower percentage of slope classes due to the flat terrain that allow more groundwater retention while lesser rank was assigned to steeper slopes because of more run off and less infiltration nag and ghosh 2013 kumar and krishna 2018 the final weights of the slope features are shown in table 5 4 1 5 soil soil texture play an important role in groundwater recharge and surface run off groundwater recharge depends upon the soil types the rate of infiltration percolation and permeability jasrotia et al 2016 the study area mainly comprises of three types of soil namely sandy loam sandy clay loam and clay loam which covers the area as 1 814 48 23 366 9 73 and 1 581 42 km2 respectively ranks have been subjective to each soil unit after taking into account the types of soil and their infiltration rate sandy loam soil has a higher infiltration rate hence it has given the highest rank while clay loam soil has a least infiltration rate assigned to low priority fig 8 the final weights of the soil classes are shown in table 5 4 1 6 rainfall rainfall has a major contribution to recharge groundwater storage it determines the amount of water that would be available to infiltrate into the groundwater storage system more rainfall on any particular area means higher possibilities of recharge machiwal et al 2011 the rainfall availability was considered as a major source of recharge magesh et al 2012 shekhar and pandey 2015 in this study 12 years trmm monthly rainfall data were used to prepare a rainfall map of the study area fig 9 the estimates of average total annual rainfall based on 18 point locations were used to create rainfall map using inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method in arcgis the final weights of the rainfall are shown in table 5 4 1 7 drainage density drainage density is one of the most important indicator of hydrogeological features because it controls the underlying lithology it is defined as the closeness of the spacing of stream channels and is considered as an inverse function of permeability jaiswal et al 2003 agarwal and garg 2016 it is a measurement of the total length of the streams channels per unit area drainage pattern reflects the characteristic of surface as well as a subsurface formation prasad et al 2008 more the drainage density higher would be the runoff and lesser the drainage density higher is the probability of recharge or potential groundwater zone prasad et al 2008 the drainage density of the study area varied from 0 to 2 5 km km2 further it has been divided into five classes viz very low low moderate high and very high fig 10 4 1 8 land use land cover lulc lulc is an important factor of groundwater recharge shaban et al 2006 kaliraj et al 2014 ghosh et al 2016 accurate and reliable information about the present and future lulc will help in management of resoruces singh et al 2014 singh et al 2015 singh et al 2018b it includes the type of soil deposits the distribution of residential areas and vegetation cover yeh et al 2009 shaban et al 2006 have concluded that vegetation cover benefits groundwater recharge in many ways including biological decomposition of the roots that provides a pathway for water to percolate into the surface by loosening up the rock and soil they also concluded that the vegetation prevents direct evaporation of water from the soil and the roots of a plant prevent water loss by absorbing water lulc of the study area is agriculture forest water bodies built up area sandy area scrubland and rocky area fig 11 water bodies were given the highest ranking over other lulc features because of their continuous recharge to ground srivastava and bhattacharya 2006 followed by sandy areas and agricultural lands which are good for groundwater recharge mallick et al 2015 rocky areas have poor groundwater potential owing to high runoff and thus less recharge capacity the overall accuracy and overall kappa statistics of the classified map is 93 33 and 0 91 respectively the distributions of lulc classes are shown in fig 12 4 2 assessment of groundwater potential zones after computing the final normal weights of all the thematic layers and their individual features all the thematic layers were converted into raster format and added with one another using raster calculator in arcgis software in order to delineate groundwater potential zone the total score obtained for the groundwater potential zone fig 13 was classified into four zones very good 37 27 good 27 23 moderate 23 19 and poor 19 8 the groundwater potential map was further processed by applying the majority filter in arcgis to avoid minimize pixel speckling the result showed that area along the mayurakshi river has very good groundwater potential zones which cover about 11 405 km2 of the total study area it includes area namely rajmahal pipra lathipahar phitkoria jhajhapur etc the good zone covers 38 1 389 61 km2 of the area found in the pediment pediplain complex zone moderate zone covers about 44 1 602 07 km2 of the area the poor zone covers about 7 261 km2 of the area which includes raneshwar asanbani chichro sarni and some part of musna 4 3 validation of groundwater potential zones the delineated groundwater potential map was finally verified using the available measured discharges of 18 dug wells fig 13 obtained from the central ground water board cgwb ranchi the verification of the groundwater potential map with the well s discharge data reveals that two of the three very high discharge wells 48 81 m³ hr exist in the very good zone whereas one very high discharge wells exist in the good zones high discharge 33 48 m³ hr wells are falls in good zones i e two of four and other two falls in moderate zones the majority of the medium discharge 21 33 m³ hr and low discharge 1 21 m³ hr wells i e 3 of 4 medium discharge and three of seven low discharge wells fall in the moderate zone the two low discharge 1 21 m³ hr wells exist in the poor zone thus the mean discharge of the wells falling in the very good good moderate and poor zones are 73 75 34 2 28 8 and 1 2 m³ h respectively further a linear relationship was found between the well s discharge data and the total score obtained from the groundwater potential map for the respective wells hence the map produced by the ahp method exhibited satisfactory result in predicting the groundwater potential in the dumka districts jharkhand state india the results obtained in this study showed that the applied methods can be used to identify groundwater potential zone also the method can be used for cost effective selection of suitable well sites efficient planning of scarce groundwater exploitation and to ensure sustainable groundwater resource development 5 conclusion the increasing demand of fresh water is major concerns hence delineation of new groundwater potential zones using cost effective manner is required to meet the demands of fresh water many researchers have been conducting various methods to evaluate and predict groundwater distribution for land use planning and water resource management groundwater is an important source of water supply in dumka district which comes from dug wells and bore wells most of the agricultural lands are dependent on irrigation from groundwater due to geographical structure the area lacks inadequate water resource as most of the surface and groundwater goes outside the district and also due to overexploitation of groundwater in the region during the peak summer wells and tube wells go dry due to shallow aquifer integrated approach of geospatial techniques and ahp method has been used in delineation of groundwater potential zone in dumka district jharkhand india the final groundwater prospect map was classified into four zones as very good good moderate and poor zone the result showed that 11 of the total study area falls under very good groundwater prospect zone 38 of the area under good zone and moderate zone covers 44 of the total area areas with poor prospects constitute 7 of the total area the results obtained from this model were validated with well yield discharge data and found a very good correlation with a high coefficient of determination i e r2 0 76 indicates the successful application of remote sensing gis and ahp techniques the current study revealed that the groundwater condition in the areas including raneshwar asanbani chichro sarni and some part of musna is poor hence these areas should be concentrated for groundwater management and developing activities also in the area the number of water harvesting structure should be established to preserve surplus runoff the present model used in the study has some uncertainty since some part of the very good potential zones lie on granulite rocks which comprise of hard and compact structure moreover it may be due to the presence of high structures such as faults and fractures the overall results demonstrated that the geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and gis and the ahp technique potentially provide an excellent platform for studying the groundwater resource potential zones in hard rock terrains such as dumka district of jharkhand state and useful to make suitable groundwater exploration plans for different purposes the integrated map could be useful for various developmental activities likes sustainable developments of groundwater in the study area as well as identification of priority areas for implementation of water conservation

12227,this study aims to delineate groundwater potential zones using an integrated approach of remote sensing geographical information system gis and analytical hierarchy process ahp method in dumka district jharkhand india multiple data as lithology lineament density geomorphology slope soil rainfall drainage density and land use land cover were considered for delineating the groundwater potential zones spatially distributed maps thematic layers of all the aforementioned parameters were created using remotely sensed as well as ground data in a gis environment these thematic layers were assigned suitable weights on the saaty s scale according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence in the study area the assigned weights of the thematic layers and their features were then normalized by using the ahp technique ultimately all thematic layers were integrated by a weighted linear combination method in a gis environment to produce a groundwater potential zones map the delineated groundwater potential zones in the study area were categorized as very good good moderate and poor respectively the results showed that area along the mayurakshi river rajmahal pipra lathipahar phitkoria jhajhapur etc which is approximately 11 404 96 km2 of the total study area was delineated as an area having very good potential for groundwater the good zone delineated encompassed approximately 38 1 389 61 km2 of the study area and was found in the pediment pediplain complex zone the moderate zones encompassed approximately 44 1 602 07 km2 of the area the poor zones encompassed approximately 7 260 58 km2 of the area which included raneshwar asanbani chichro sarni and certain parts of musna the groundwater potential zone map was compared with the actual discharge data from various wells within the study area and was found reasonable overall this study provides a convenient approach of delineating the potential of groundwater availability which ultimately will aid in better planning and managing of groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential zones ahp gis dumka district 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most

fourth of the households in the country india do not have access to potable water at their premises therefore it has become essential to identify new groundwater potential zones in cost effective way to cater the need of fresh water demand and also develop proper methods for groundwater management delineation of new of the groundwater potential recharge zones will help to conserve this valuable

delineate and map the groundwater potential zones using integrated approach the study will help in sustainable water resource development planning and management 2 study area the study area fig 1 dumka district is located in the north eastern part of the jharkhand state which lies between north latitude 23 47 20 and 24 38 57 and east longitude 86 28 25 and 86 42 16 it is bounded by godda and banka district to the north pakur to the east west bengal to the south and jamtara and deoghar to the west it covers a total geographical area of 3 716 02 km2 and elevation varies from 27 to 491 m above mean sea level amsl the district is mainly drained by the brahmani the baslo the mayurakshi and their tributaries these rivers are ephemeral in nature and most of these are structurally controlled the district is highly dissected with rivers of varying magnitude most of the tributaries carry the drainage to the western part of the district which finally meets the bhagirathi river below murshidabad west bengal all the tributaries have rapid surface runoff and surface flow hence most of the rivers dries up during summer however there is sub surface flow for a considerable part of the year which indicates the affluent nature of the rivers cgwb 2013 climatologically the study area falls under a humid subtropical climate with warm wet summers and mild winters the average annual rainfall of the district is 1 391 mm whereas july is the month which receives the highest rainfall december and january are the coldest while may and june are the hottest months during winter the mercury drops to 4 c and during summer it shoots up to 46 c the dumka district has a predominantly undulating terrain with hard rocks under the ground the entire district has upland topography with high ridges running from north to south and valleys bounded by mountains and rivers there are several hill ranges like rajmahal hill ramgarh hill and lagwa hill with several small hillocks the average elevation of the hill ranges between 150 and 300 m amsl geologically the area has gneiss basaltic trap and sedimentary beds schist and boulder beds are found in some places rajmahal trap is the major rock type in the district the other geological formations of the district are alluvium laterite and gondwana sandy loam to clay loam are the dominant soil type in the district due to topographical features the study area lacks inadequate water resources as most of the surface and groundwater flows outside the district during peak summer wells and tube wells become dry according to the cgwb report of september 2013 generally dug wells in the study area are of 2 m diameter and 8 15 m deep depending on the thickness of the weathered zone tapping the shallow groundwater in the weathered zone and an uppermost slice of the basement a large number of dug wells used for drinking water are under private ownership pre and post monsoon depth to water level during the year 2012 was recorded as between 4 45 and 12 3 m below ground level mbgl and 2 to 5 mbgl cgwb 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 preparation of thematic layers for the assessment of groundwater potential zones eight different thematic layers such as lithology geomorphology lineament density slope soil rainfall drainage density and lulc were generated using remote sensing and conventional existing data with the help of erdas imagine and arcgis software the geomorphological features and lineaments were identified using landsat 8 30 m resolution imagery which was downloaded from the earth explorer u s geological survey website www earthexplorer usgs gov the false color composite fcc image was visually interpreted with image interpretation keys such as shape size tone texture pattern and association for identifying the geomorphological landforms and lineaments the landsat 8 oli data was used to prepare lulc map using maximum likelihood classification algorithm and the ground verification was performed using 490 ground control points indian remote sensing satellite cartosat 1 digital elevation model dem data 30 m resolution was downloaded from bhuvan portal of nrsc isro www bhuvan nrsc gov in and used to generate slope and drainage pattern of the study area drainage pattern was extracted using arcswat and lineament density and drainage density maps were prepared using the line density tool in arcgis soil map was acquired in vector format from the digital soil map of the world site https worldmap harvard edu the lithology map was digitized and prepared using the geological map obtained from the geological survey of india the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm rainfall data was used to estimate the average total annual rainfall based on 12 years 2001 2012 data of 18 point locations to create rainfall distribution map by inverse distance weighted idw spatial interpolation technique in arcgis this technique uses the spatial correlation of variables and predicts the values of variables at unobserved locations based on those of observed locations singh et al 2013b this method has potential if there are enough sample points with a suitable dispersion in local scale levels the main factor affecting the accuracy of inverse distance interpolator is the value of the power parameter p burrough and mcdonnell 1998 in addition the size of the neighborhood and the number of neighbors are also relevant to the accuracy of the results all the thematic layers were prepared and converted into raster format and were projected to utm projection zone 45 datum wgs 84 with 30 m spatial resolution the overall methodology adopted in the present study is depicted in fig 2 3 2 assignments of weight and weights normalization using ahp assignment of weight of each class is the most important in integrated analysis as the output is largely dependent on the assignment of appropriate weight muralitharan and palanivel 2015 several methods have been adopted for calculating weight in order to delineate groundwater potential zone such as index models frequency ratio fr certainty factor cf weights of evidence woe fuzzy logic multi influencing factor mif etc among these techniques analytical hierarchy process ahp is becoming a pioneer technique in groundwater prediction modeling which may provide rapid precise and cost effective results an ahp technique can be described as a pair wise matrix analytical method which is used to calculate the geometric mean and normalized weight of an individual parameter chowdhury et al 2009 jha et al 2010 kaliraj et al 2014 it generates relative ratio scales of paired comparison saaty 1990 in the present study ahp method was used and this method was developed by saaty 1980 1990 it is used as a decision solving method to finalize the weights assigned to different thematic layers and their respective features first steps involved in the ahp technique is used to breakdown the problem into a hierarchy by defining objective and identifying criteria and sub criteria according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence muralitharan and palanivel 2015 the advantage of hierarchy is that it allows us to focus judgment on each of several properties separately which are essential for making a strong decision saaty 1990 paired comparisons were made to compare all factors against each other in a matrix format which is useful in deriving measurement a standard saaty s 1 9 scale was used to determine the relative importance values for all themes and their respective features where value 1 denotes equal importance between the two themes and the value 9 denotes the extreme importance of one theme compared to other saaty 1980 asshown in table 1 the following steps were used to compute the final weights of all the thematic layers muralitharan and palanivel 2015 1 adding the values in each column of the pair wise matrix using the formula table 3 1 l j i j 1 n c i j where l j the total values in each column of the pair wise matrix and c i j the number assigned to each criteria at ith row and jth column 2 divide each element in the matrix by its column total to generate a normalized pair wise matrix table 4 2 x i j c i j l j where x i j the value at ith row and jth column in the normalized pair wise matrix 3 divide the sum of the normalized row of the matrix by the number of criteria used n to generate standard weights using the following formula 3 w i x i j n where w i standard weight 3 2 1 consistency analysis for calculating the consistency vector multiply the pair wise comparison matrix values and normalized pair wise matrix values of thematic layers accordingly using matrix multiplication muralitharan and palanivel 2015 4 for calculating the consistency vector values following formula was used 4 λ c i j x i j where λ consistency vector 5 consistency index ci as deviation or degree of consistency was calculated using the following formula 5 c i λ n n 1 where ci consistency index n number of criteria used 6 consistency ratio cr was calculated using the following formula 6 c r c i r i where ri random inconsistency randomized index of saaty 1980 if the value of consistency ratio is less than or equal to 0 1 the inconsistency is acceptable otherwise we need to revise the subjective judgment saaty 1990 random inconsistency values for n number of criteria muralitharan and palanivel 2015 are shown in table 2 where n number of criteria used and ri random inconsistency 3 3 assessment of groundwater potential zones the groundwater potential index gwpi is a dimensionless quantity which helps in delineation of groundwater potential zones in an area kumar and krishna 2018 the weighted linear combination method was applied to identify groundwater potential zones the weight of the thematic layers were multiplied by the weights of features in each thematic layer and added the products of all the attributes and obtained the total scores ts muralitharan and palanivel 2015 using the following formula 7 t s w r where ts total score w and r are the weights of the thematic layers and the weights of the features in thematic layers respectively ahp generates an overall ranking of the solutions using the comparison matrix among the alternatives and the information on the ranking of the criteria the alternative with the highest value is considered to be the first choice muralitharan and palanivel 2015 3 4 validation of groundwater potential zone the groundwater potential zone map was delineated in the present study and verified using the available well discharge data of 18 dug wells the dug well data was collected from central ground water board ranchi the well s discharge points were overlaid on the final groundwater prospect map to check the accuracy of the present work in the various groundwater prospective zones 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrologic thematic layers the occurrence and movement of groundwater depends on various factors such as geological structure topography slope precipitation soil secondary porosity drainage pattern lulc hydrological conditions of a region and the inter relationships among these factors pradhan 2009 oh et al 2011 singh et al 2011b acharya 2017 in the study eight influencing factors such as lithology li lineament density ld geomorphology ge slope sl rainfall rf soil so drainage density dd and lulc have been identified in order to delineate groundwater potential zones of the study area 4 1 1 lithology the lithology is one of the significant factor for the detection of groundwater prospective zones it directly influences both the porosity and permeability of aquifer rocks rahmati et al 2015 however some authors neglect this factor once they use the lineament and drainage characters as a function of primary and secondary porosity muralitharan and palanivel 2015 moreover others incorporate the lithology factor due to its strong influence on water percolation mukherjee et al 2012 singh et al 2013a lithology map was digitized and prepared using the geology map obtained from the geological survey of india the area mainly covered by eight types of lithological units namely basalt schist granite gneiss granulite sandstone boulder beds and laterite rocks fig 3 the gneiss is dominant 2 766 91 km2 73 6 followed by basalt 320 19 km2 8 5 and granulite 284 1 km2 7 5 other classes of lithology are laterite sandstone boulder beds schist and granite which occupied areas 204 54 5 4 109 28 3 30 77 0 8 29 81 0 7 and 15 4 0 4 km2 respectively rank has been assigned to different features based on the available porosity sedimentary rocks such as sandstone typically have much higher porosity hence have higher groundwater prospect granulite rock is hard rock and has compact structure hence given the lowest rank rocks have classified based on available porosity as sandstone boulder beds laterite basalt schist gneiss granite and granulite where sandstone represents high porosity whereas rocks like granite and granulite represent very less to nil porosity weights assigned to various thematic layers and derivation of the normalized weights using ahp techniques are shown in tables 3 and 4 consistency analysis 1 0 37 2 0 18 3 0 12 4 0 1 5 0 07 6 0 06 7 0 05 8 0 05 2 95 0 5 0 44 1 0 22 2 0 12 3 0 07 4 0 05 5 0 04 6 0 04 7 0 03 1 74 0 33 0 4 0 5 0 27 1 0 13 2 0 07

22 here the value of consistency vector λ is calculated as 7 82 further using equation 5 and 6 consistency ratio was calculated as 0 01 and found acceptable 4 1 2 lineament and lineament density lineament features such as joints fractures and faults are hydro geologically very important as it acts as a conduit for groundwater movement which results in increased porosity and therefore serves as a groundwater prospect zone obi reddy et al 2000 mukherjee et al 2012 the occurrence and movement of groundwater in hard rock terrain are mainly controlled by secondary porosity i e the presence of lineaments and fractures bagyaraj et al 2013 kumar and krishna 2018 areas around the lineaments and their intersection point are considered to be favorable sites for groundwater storage due to high infiltration rate gupta and srivastava 2010 mukherjee et al 2012 the lineament density ld is a measurable quantity derived from the lineament map in satellite imagery lineaments are interpreted using interpretation key which was identified mainly based on their linear nature the presence of moisture alignment of vegetation alignment of ponds straight stream segments and the linearity of soil tone the lineament orientation of the study area is predominantly along ne sw and nw se directions which are represented by a rose diagram fig 5 harinarayana et al 2000 found that the normalized transmissivity near the lineaments is high and excellent relationship exists between higher fracture densities and higher well yields therefore areas having higher lineament density have more impact on groundwater prospect zones the map was then classified into five classes viz very high high medium low and very low varies from 0 to 0 88 km km2 fig 4 the final weights of the lineament density feature are shown in table 5 4 1 3 geomorphology geomorphological studies together with hydrogeology and structures lineaments had proven to be very effective to locate groundwater potential zones bahuguna et al 2003 jagadeeswara rao et al 2004 muralitharan and palanivel 2015 geomorphology of an area reflects various landforms and structural features which plays an important role in assessing the groundwater potential and prospect as it controls the subsurface movement of groundwater kumar et al 2008 prasad et al 2008 machiwal et al 2011 muralitharan and palanivel 2015 kumar and krishna 2018 various geomorphic features of the study area were identified using landsat 8 satellite imagery the geomorphological feature in the study area could be categorized into six units namely river water bodies denudational origin pediment pediplain complex denudational origin moderate dissected hills and valleys denudational origin low dissected hills and valleys inselberg and structural origin moderate dissected hills and valleys fig 6 the spatial extent of the surface water bodies river is 104 km2 covering 2 76 of the study area which act as recharge zone enhancing the groundwater potential in the region the study area is dominated by denudational origin pediment pediplain complex which covers an area of 3 232 km2 85 9 denudational origin with pediment pediplain complex comprises gently undulating plains covered with weathered material that are favorable for groundwater recharge denudational origin with low dissected hills and valleys 28 km2 5 9 mainly comprises of hard rocks which act as runoff zone hence characterized as moderate denudational origins with moderate dissected hills 162 km2 4 3 are characterized by highly sloping topography and high surface runoff and categorized as a poor zone structural origins with moderate dissected hills 223 km2 5 9 are constituted by massive sandstones basalt and laterite this feature has poor to nil groundwater prospect because most of rain water which falls over them flows down slope as runoff the final weight of geomorphological features are shown in table 5 4 1 4 slope the slope is also a crucial parameter for the occurrence and recharging conditions of groundwater in a particular area bagyaraj et al 2013 slope gradient steepness directly influences the infiltration of rainfall hence an indicator for the suitability for groundwater prospect steeper slope areas generate less recharge because of high surface runoff providing insufficient time to infiltrate the surface and recharge the saturated zone magesh et al 2012 gumma and pavelic 2013 selvam et al 2015 ghosh et al 2016 the steeper slope generates rapid runoff and increase erosion rate with small potential recharge magesh et al 2012 the slope is one of the factor that controls infiltration of surface water into subsurface hence an indicator of groundwater prospect in the area with mild gentle slope the surface runoff is slow hence allowing more time for rainwater to percolate whereas area with steep slope facilitates high runoff hence allowing less time for rainwater to percolate hence comparatively less infiltration prasad et al 2008 magesh et al 2012 ghosh et al 2016 based on cartosat 1 dem data slope has been categorized into five classes as very low 0 4 low 4 10 moderate 10 20 high 20 40 and very high 40 shown in fig 7 most of the study area falls under slope category of 0 4 therefore the maximum area has a favorable slope for water retention the ranks were assigned to different slope classes using the scale of 1 9 higher rank was assigned to lower percentage of slope classes due to the flat terrain that allow more groundwater retention while lesser rank was assigned to steeper slopes because of more run off and less infiltration nag and ghosh 2013 kumar and krishna 2018 the final weights of the slope features are shown in table 5 4 1 5 soil soil texture play an important role in groundwater recharge and surface run off groundwater recharge depends upon the soil types the rate of infiltration percolation and permeability jasrotia et al 2016 the study area mainly comprises of three types of soil namely sandy loam sandy clay loam and clay loam which covers the area as 1 814 48 23 366 9 73 and 1 581 42 km2 respectively ranks have been subjective to each soil unit after taking into account the types of soil and their infiltration rate sandy loam soil has a higher infiltration rate hence it has given the highest rank while clay loam soil has a least infiltration rate assigned to low priority fig 8 the final weights of the soil classes are shown in table 5 4 1 6 rainfall rainfall has a major contribution to recharge groundwater storage it determines the amount of water that would be available to infiltrate into the groundwater storage system more rainfall on any particular area means higher possibilities of recharge machiwal et al 2011 the rainfall availability was considered as a major source of recharge magesh et al 2012 shekhar and pandey 2015 in this study 12 years trmm monthly rainfall data were used to prepare a rainfall map of the study area fig 9 the estimates of average total annual rainfall based on 18 point locations were used to create rainfall map using inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method in arcgis the final weights of the rainfall are shown in table 5 4 1 7 drainage density drainage density is one of the most important indicator of hydrogeological features because it controls the underlying lithology it is defined as the closeness of the spacing of stream channels and is considered as an inverse function of permeability jaiswal et al 2003 agarwal and garg 2016 it is a measurement of the total length of the streams channels per unit area drainage pattern reflects the characteristic of surface as well as a subsurface formation prasad et al 2008 more the drainage density higher would be the runoff and lesser the drainage density higher is the probability of recharge or potential groundwater zone prasad et al 2008 the drainage density of the study area varied from 0 to 2 5 km km2 further it has been divided into five classes viz very low low moderate high and very high fig 10 4 1 8 land use land cover lulc lulc is an important factor of groundwater recharge shaban et al 2006 kaliraj et al 2014 ghosh et al 2016 accurate and reliable information about the present and future lulc will help in management of resoruces singh et al 2014 singh et al 2015 singh et al 2018b it includes the type of soil deposits the distribution of residential areas and vegetation cover yeh et al 2009 shaban et al 2006 have concluded that vegetation cover benefits groundwater recharge in many ways including biological decomposition of the roots that provides a pathway for water to percolate into the surface by loosening up the rock and soil they also concluded that the vegetation prevents direct evaporation of water from the soil and the roots of a plant prevent water loss by absorbing water lulc of the study area is agriculture forest water bodies built up area sandy area scrubland and rocky area fig 11 water bodies were given the highest ranking over other lulc features because of their continuous recharge to ground srivastava and bhattacharya 2006 followed by sandy areas and agricultural lands which are good for groundwater recharge mallick et al 2015 rocky areas have poor groundwater potential owing to high runoff and thus less recharge capacity the overall accuracy and overall kappa statistics of the classified map is 93 33 and 0 91 respectively the distributions of lulc classes are shown in fig 12 4 2 assessment of groundwater potential zones after computing the final normal weights of all the thematic layers and their individual features all the thematic layers were converted into raster format and added with one another using raster calculator in arcgis software in order to delineate groundwater potential zone the total score obtained for the groundwater potential zone fig 13 was classified into four zones very good 37 27 good 27 23 moderate 23 19 and poor 19 8 the groundwater potential map was further processed by applying the majority filter in arcgis to avoid minimize pixel speckling the result showed that area along the mayurakshi river has very good groundwater potential zones which cover about 11 405 km2 of the total study area it includes area namely rajmahal pipra lathipahar phitkoria jhajhapur etc the good zone covers 38 1 389 61 km2 of the area found in the pediment pediplain complex zone moderate zone covers about 44 1 602 07 km2 of the area the poor zone covers about 7 261 km2 of the area which includes raneshwar asanbani chichro sarni and some part of musna 4 3 validation of groundwater potential zones the delineated groundwater potential map was finally verified using the available measured discharges of 18 dug wells fig 13 obtained from the central ground water board cgwb ranchi the verification of the groundwater potential map with the well s discharge data reveals that two of the three very high discharge wells 48 81 m³ hr exist in the very good zone whereas one very high discharge wells exist in the good zones high discharge 33 48 m³ hr wells are falls in good zones i e two of four and other two falls in moderate zones the majority of the medium discharge 21 33 m³ hr and low discharge 1 21 m³ hr wells i e 3 of 4 medium discharge and three of seven low discharge wells fall in the moderate zone the two low discharge 1 21 m³ hr wells exist in the poor zone thus the mean discharge of the wells falling in the very good good moderate and poor zones are 73 75 34 2 28 8 and 1 2 m³ h respectively further a linear relationship was found between the well s discharge data and the total score obtained from the groundwater potential map for the respective wells hence the map produced by the ahp method exhibited satisfactory result in predicting the groundwater potential in the dumka districts jharkhand state india the results obtained in this study showed that the applied methods can be used to identify groundwater potential zone also the method can be used for cost effective selection of suitable well sites efficient planning of scarce groundwater exploitation and to ensure sustainable groundwater resource development 5 conclusion the increasing demand of fresh water is major concerns hence delineation of new groundwater potential zones using cost effective manner is required to meet the demands of fresh water many researchers have been conducting various methods to evaluate and predict groundwater distribution for land use planning and water resource management groundwater is an important source of water supply in dumka district which comes from dug wells and bore wells most of the agricultural lands are dependent on irrigation from groundwater due to geographical structure the area lacks inadequate water resource as most of the surface and groundwater goes outside the district and also due to overexploitation of groundwater in the region during the peak summer wells and tube wells go dry due to shallow aquifer integrated approach of geospatial techniques and ahp method has been used in delineation of groundwater potential zone in dumka district jharkhand india the final groundwater prospect map was classified into four zones as very good good moderate and poor zone the result showed that 11 of the total study area falls under very good groundwater prospect zone 38 of the area under good zone and moderate zone covers 44 of the total area areas with poor prospects constitute 7 of the total area the results obtained from this model were validated with well yield discharge data and found a very good correlation with a high coefficient of determination i e r2 0 76 indicates the successful application of remote sensing gis and ahp techniques the current study revealed that the groundwater condition in the areas including raneshwar asanbani chichro sarni and some part of musna is poor hence these areas should be concentrated for groundwater management and developing activities also in the area the number of water harvesting structure should be established to preserve surplus runoff the present model used in the study has some uncertainty since some part of the very good potential zones lie on granulite rocks which comprise of hard and compact structure moreover it may be due to the presence of high structures such as faults and fractures the overall results demonstrated that the geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and gis and the ahp technique potentially provide an excellent platform for studying the groundwater resource potential zones in hard rock terrains such as dumka district of jharkhand state and useful to make suitable groundwater exploration plans for different purposes the integrated map could be useful for various developmental activities likes sustainable developments of groundwater in the study area as well as identification of priority areas for implementation of water conservation

12228,sustainable urban development has been one of the main concerns for policy makers and increasing rate of population and urbanization have resulted in several socio environmental impacts on people hence water resources management in cities as one of the most vital strategies has become more complicated and challenging in this study the impact of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater level fluctuations was assessed using remote sensing data from different satellites and missions data of water storage mass precipitation evapotranspiration temperature land cover etc was extracted and processed by employing different programming languages and mapping tools atlanta metro area in georgia usa was selected as the case study location and the potential impacts of urban development in this city on groundwater resources were studied the results suggest that from 2001 to 2013 limited urban development has happened in atlanta while this urbanization rate was more intense during previous decades and is predicted to be increased by 2050 therefore although other land cover types may be more correlated results of correlating groundwater level with urban land cover is inconclusive for atlanta metro area nonetheless since relationship between urbanization and gw level variations is undeniable novel methodology of this study can be employed for other fast growing cities especially in china and india graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainable development urbanization groundwater remote sensing atlanta grace 1 introduction urbanization growth is increasing rapidly in several regions of the world and causing numerous socio environmental problems kalhor and mahdisoltani 2015 rapid population growth in cities has stimulated new strategies for water saving and reusing approaches carlson et al 2011 in fact advances in science and technology during the last 2 centuries have led to significant increases in the world s population and have resulted in an accelerating population density in urban areas hayashi et al 2009 during recent decades urbanization and land cover change have become increasingly crucial and controversial concerns in political social and academic discussions haase 2009 moreover several environmental impacts mostly associated with urban areas have been reported by agencies and researchers during past decades it has been shown that urbanization growth and urban development play a major role in several environmental issues namely surface water contamination and groundwater depletion chen et al 2011 by increasing global population and the need for fresh water the importance of groundwater resources has been increased rapidly in other words most of the world s fresh water is stored in ice sheets ice caps glaciers icebergs and generally in polar regions and a small percentage of that is stored as groundwater in aquifers in fact only 3 of total water on the earth is considered as fresh water resources and roughly 30 of that is accessible as groundwater kalhor et al 2019 kalhor 2017 hence the relatively easy access to these fresh water resources has caused impacts on environmental processes such as the water balance in quantitative terms moreover in urban areas with more impervious land covers the runoff caused by precipitation cannot infiltrate into the ground to recharge the groundwater and remains as surface runoff the impact of urbanization on groundwater supply includes changes in impervious land cover sources of groundwater recharge surface water runoff evapotranspiration and municipal water demand in fact the increase in urbanization causes less infiltration which reduces the groundwater recharge and storage mishra et al 2014 however an additional recharge to the groundwater balance can be considered due to leakage from water distributions systems sewer lines detention ponds and storm drains over irrigation of lawns gardens and parks artificial recharge decreased evapotranspiration and finally infiltration through impervious land cover simultaneously the increase in impervious cover that accompanies urban sprawl and migration to suburb areas causes reduction in evapotranspiration and increases storm runoff mishra et al 2014 sharp 2010 several researchers have studied the impact of urbanization on groundwater quality and quantity using experimental or numerical methods to increase the awareness regarding the problems urbanization can cause for hydrological and hydrogeological systems foster 2001 foster 1990 this impact has been studied for many different regions of the world minnig et al 2018 wakode et al 2018 studies have been conducted regarding the effect of urbanization on hydrological regimes and also potential flood risk by considering several cities as case studies according to research results of ahmad et al 2008 a wide range of impacts from decreasing river discharge groundwater level decline increase in salinity and shrinkage of the wetlands were reported in fact it was reported that in the case study location in india urbanization has led to excessive water withdrawal and the groundwater depletion the excessive water turns into sewage and flows toward low lying areas causing water logging contamination and siltation of the local drainage systems ahmad et al 2008 furthermore some researchers have focused on urbanization impacts on groundwater and surface water quality in particular asadi et al 2007 subramani et al 2012 as an example khazaei et al conducted research on groundwater quality reduction due to urban development based on their study an increase in nitrate concentration to a level similar to domestic sewage a general increase in phosphorus in the urban areas and an increase in chloride concentration and contamination of the groundwater by fecal coliforms were observed due to urbanization in zahedan aquifer southeastern part of iran khazaei et al 2004 additionally research works have been conducted in order to investigate the effect of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater using remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis tools using these methods the changes in groundwater level and groundwater location and flow direction can also be investigated in addition to numerous applications of remote sensing in hydrological studies abdalla 2012 al bakri and al jahmany 2013 al bakri et al 2013 chaudhary et al 1996 edet et al 1998 lalbiakmawia 2015 mukherjee 2008 saraf and choudhury 1998 schmugge et al 2002 sener et al 2004 solomon and quiel 2006 by applying rs and gis based methods for describing the possible effects of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater and surface water kavitha and swedandra chose dindigul town as a case study and reported that groundwater pollution was increased due to intense population growth kavitha and swedandra 2011 other cities were also considered as case study location such as hyderabad in india venkateswarlu et al 2014 erbil in iraq hameed et al 2015 raipur in india madhuri et al 2012 zhujiang delta of southern china weng 2001 paochiao watershed in taiwan lin et al 2008 ajmer in india jat et al 2008 jat et al 2009 son watershed in india jaiswal et al 2003 moreover a number of studies about relationship between urbanization and groundwater and also about exploring potential groundwater zones have been carried out in india using an indian satellite named irs asadi et al 2007 madhuri et al 2012 singh et al 2014 it should be noted that for studying the changes in land cover data most of the researchers have used landsat data in their research work due to its relatively high temporal and spatial resolution and the availability of its data since couple of decades ago in current study using a remote sensing and gis based approach the possible impacts of urbanization and urban development on groundwater level fluctuation was investigated for atlanta city and its suburbs the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission data along with other satellite data were used in this study grace data has been used by researchers for observing total mass of the earth or water for specified grids worldwide landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 wahr et al 2006 according to a united nations un study united nations 2014 urban development and population growth rates are accelerating mostly in asia and africa rather than northern america australia and most of the europe as it is shown in fig 1 in a united nations un study in 2014 the 10 largest urban agglomerations are mostly located in asia most importantly cities like new delhi beijing shanghai and mumbai have had and will have accelerating population growth rate from 1990 to 2030 additionally fig 2 depicts the world s urban growth rate for each continent or large region as it appears in this figure asia and after that africa have the largest growth rates for megacities large cities and medium size cities the urban growth rate for large cities and medium sized cities is also relatively high for northern america and latin america in current study a growing city in northern america was chosen as case study location rather than a city in asia or africa mainly due to lack of accessible hydrological and meteorological data in asia and africa and also lack of relevant study works in northern america first by correlating rs based results and actual field results we wanted to verify that assessing gw level fluctuation using rs and satellite data is accurate enough second we wanted to present a novel methodology and approach for evaluating possible correlation between urban development which includes population growth and increased water usage and also increased impervious land covers and gw level variations this methodology can be applied for other cities especially in asia that have had accelerating urban growth rate during last 2 decades this is because satellite data is accessible for all regions around the world and the results of data processing from rs data can be directly used for future assessment however further verification and validation of results based on field data upon availability is always recommended since grace data deals with mass of water data for regions or grid cells that are fully or partially within water bodies or are in proximity of water bodies does not lead to accurate assessments therefore as a limitation for grace data it is recommended to choose study locations that are completely surrounded by land since most of the populated cities and also cities that are experiencing extensive urban development in the us are located in coastal areas or proximity of ocean or large lakes for example new york los angeles san diego chicago san francisco philadelphia houston etc options for choosing case study city within the us was limited after evaluating the options atlanta city was chosen because of its significant urban development rate compared to other similar cities in the us and also because very limited research studies related to groundwater issues and urban development were conducted for this city 2 methodology 2 1 case study location the case study city for this research is atlanta city and its suburbs atlanta metropolitan area in georgia usa this city is located in southeastern part of the us and has developed intensely during last decades the atlanta georgia metropolitan region is defined here to include several urban counties with a spatial extent of roughly 1 degree 1 degree during past decades atlanta georgia has developed to be considered as one of the largest commercial and industrial urban areas of the southeastern united states and one of the fastest growing cities in the country high rate of population growth is highly associated with this noticeable growth of the urban extent this has led to tremendous land cover changes in forested and agricultural lands adjacent to the city and urban areas moreover it has caused high rate of urban transformation in rural areas hu and lo 2007 moreover urbanization growth in this city has caused some impacts on hydrological systems in the past decades peters 2001 peters and rose 2001 rose and peters 2001 fig 3 shows land cover change in this region since 1973 until 1999 this figure can help the viewers to compare the urban development in the region using the extracted data from modis satellite since 2001 for a long period of time to observe the trend of urbanization in addition yang and lo 2003 defined 3 scenarios for future trend of urban development in this region these scenarios represent different growth strategies that can be adopted by planners and policy makers the first scenario simulated the continued growth trend if the urban sprawl is allowed to continue the second scenario shows the growth trend if future road and transportation development and environmental conservation are considered the third scenario simulated the development trend when the growth rate is reduced and the growth pattern is changed fig 4 represents the future of atlanta region urban growth based on 3 scenarios defined by yang and lo 2003 2 2 satellite data for observing the relationship between urbanization and groundwater level several parameters were considered in this study the satellite data for land cover change is informative for observing the urban land expansion also by considering the data of grace which determines the total mass of the earth or water in an area in addition to the precipitation and evapotranspiration data the approximate trend of groundwater level fluctuation can be observed in this project a 14 year data set from 2002 until 2015 was chosen to be studied however for some mission data which was used in this research the data for all these 14 years was not available for understanding the land cover change in atlanta metropolitan area annual data of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor was used according to nasa website https modis gsfc nasa gov about design php this sensor is located aboard the terra and aqua platforms offering a view the earth s surface every 1 2 days the modis sensor collects data within 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelengths from 0 4 μm to 14 4 μm and provides us with imagery at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir for two bands 500 m resolution for 5 bands and the remaining 29 bands at 1 km the modis land cover type product mcd12q1 version 051 provides data characterizing five global land cover classification systems in addition it provides a land cover type assessment and quality control information for this study land cover types description type 5 classification was chosen and based on the description of this type in usgs website different land cover types were distinguished using color indicator in arcmap this satellite provides data of land cover types in a relatively high spatial resolution 500 m sin grid and 1 year temporal resolution and also in hdf format table 1 represents land cover classes of type 5 classification according to usgs website as it is shown in table 1 urban and built up areas have a value of 9 thus for each year the number of pixels with value of 9 were counted in arcmap it should be noted that for the case study location atlanta metro half of the city was covered by 1 tile and another half was covered by anther tile therefore for describing the land cover change for whole area and with enough accuracy the data for both tiles was used and merged together moreover as the dimension of each tile is large approximately 10 degrees by 10 degrees in southeastern us a smaller area of interest was cut from the larger layer after merging 2 layers together in arcmap software for sticking merging 2 tiles layers together in arcgis mosaic to new raster sub tool from arc toolbox was used this sub tool is located in data management tools raster raster dataset tools furthermore for selecting our desired region from this large layer each merged layer was cut using spatial analysist tool map algebra raster calculator after zooming to the atlanta metropolitan area each layer was multiplied by 1 and in environments section in processing extent the extent was chosen as same as display hence all layers for each year have same dimensions in addition the data of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission was used to estimate the changes in total water storage in an area the spatial resolution of this level 3 data is 1 degree by 1 degree and has temporal resolution of approximately 1 month on average the first and last dates of this data are april 15 2000 and december 22 2013 respectively grace has an orbit of 500 km and circles earth 15 times per day it was launched in 2002 and can measures distance between two satellites to 10 μm over a distance of 220 km changes in distance over time provides acceleration which can be used to estimate local gravity grace is able to provide gravity estimates to 1 mgal or 0 00001 m s2 chen 2018 using the data of grace mission data products from 3 sources jet propulsion laboratory jpl university of texas center for space research csr and german research center for geosciences gfz were downloaded and processed moreover by running an r code the data for the cell in which atlanta city is located and its neighbor cells 9 cells in total was extracted it should be noted that the data of grace mission is based on 3 sources and should be multiplied by a scaling factor furthermore by using a matlab code the modified values after considering scaling factor the leakage error el and measurement error em were calculated based on the downloaded data for 9 cells by using 2 methods arithmetic means and co variance mean finally the total errors or regional errors or e based on these 2 methods were determined landerer and swenson 2012 1 e e m 2 e l 2 where mean measurement m and leakage l errors are based on co variance function ci j using distance between cells 2 e z i 1 n j 1 n w i w j c z i j where 3 c z i j σ z i σ z j e x p d i j 2 2 d z 0 2 where

for observing the trends in precipitation during the years 2002 2015 data of tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm mission was used trmm precipitation data has a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees and daily temporal resolution according to nasa website https pmm nasa gov trmm trmm instruments frequency wavelengths of visible infrared scanner are 0 63 1 6 3 75 10 8 12 μm and for precipitation radar is 13 8 ghz horizontal polarization moreover ground resolution and swath width of visible infrared scanner and precipitation radar are 2 1 km and 4 3 km at nadir and 720 km and 220 km respectively the trmm orbit is circular non sun synchronous at an altitude of 350 km and an inclination of 35 degrees to the equator it is worth mentioning that the trmm data was extracted for 64 cells 2 2 in the region the center of atlanta city is located in the boundary of 2 of the central cells thus the precipitation data for atlanta city was considered as the mean value of these 2 cells it is worth mentioning that trmm data was downloaded for each month in bin format using wget command in giovanni website trmm tmpa and other sources monthly rainfall product trmm product 3b43 version 7 data record of this product is available since 1998 using an r code the daily precipitation data was extracted in text file for an 8 8 grid 2 2 in total with atlanta city in its center although downloaded data is for a 2 2 grid because the airs and grace data for surface temperature and water storage respectively has 1 spatial resolution only 16 cells 1 1 of trmm data with atlanta city in its center was considered to be studied the monthly precipitation data of this data source is in mm unit furthermore data of atmospheric infrared sounder airs which is one of six instruments flying on board nasa s aqua satellite was used for following the trend of surface temperature during these years according to nasa website https airs jpl nasa gov index html airs is a high spectral resolution spectrometer with 2378 bands in the thermal infrared 3 7 15 4 μm and 4 bands in the visible 0 4 1 0 μm the vis nir sensor assembly shares the scan mirror with the spectrometer so that each ir footprint is overlaid with a grid of visible detector pixels in four wavelength channels the four channels provide spectral coverage from 0 4 μm to 1 0 μm some other information of aqua satellite are as follows orbit type sun synchronous polar orbit orbit altitude 705 km period 98 88 min orbits per day 14 5 overpasses 2 per day daytime ascending pass south pole to north pole at 1 30 p m local time nighttime descending pass north pole to south pole occurs at 1 30 a m local time daily coverage more than 95 of earth s surface swath width 1650 km 1025 mi the airs data was obtained from giovanni website in netcdf format surface temperature daytime ascending airx3stm v006 and surface temperature nighttime descending airx3stm v006 products this data is available for the year 2002 until current and has a dataset title of aqua airs level 3 monthly standard physical retrieval airs amsu version 006 using a matlab code the global data of airs was processed and the data for our desired cells were extracted this data has monthly temporal resolution and 1 1 spatial resolution hence to make a comparison with grace data which has the same spatial resolution the data of 9 cells the cell including atlanta city and its neighbor cells was considered this data has surface temperature for day time and night time and is in kalvin unit thus the surface temperature values were converted to celsius unit by subtracting 273 15 from each of them additionally the data of the global land data assimilation system gldas model gldas noah land surface model l4 monthly 0 25 0 25 degree v2 0 was used for evapotranspiration et values in each cell with spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and monthly temporal resolution starting january 2002 until december 2015 with unit of kg m 2s 1 this data was obtained from giovanni website in netcdf format and was processed and extracted for the case study location area using a matlab code the details of this matlab script are presented in appendix section the monthly data of gldas model is available from 1948 to 2012 it should be noted that to ensure accuracy of grace data field measurements of gw level for 2 stations north of atlanta city the only stations for gw level data in atlanta metro area were extracted and compared with grace data it was observed that all three gw level data sources have maximum and minimum peaks within the same time frame however the value of peaks and the slope of change are different this firstly shows that the trend of grace data correlates with field measurements and secondly demonstrates that how grace data can represent regional gw level fluctuations more accurately in other words for example in atlanta metro area and its suburbs we were able to get access to field measurements data of only 2 stations located in north of atlanta usgs 335517084164001 11ff04 and usgs 335612084312902 09ff18 while gw level might change differently in other parts therefore grace can give us a greater insight into overall gw level variations in regional studies which is extremely helpful for research works that are related to regional changes or studies that opt to estimate overall trend of a parameter over a long period of time this simplified approach for regional studies helps policy makers to do their assessments toward sustainable development easier 3 result and discussion after analyzing the data extracted from satellites mentioned in the materials and methods section an evaluation based on the trends of the parameters involved in this study was carried out table 2 represents the values of land cover classes for the years 2001 2013 except for 2003 due to its unavailability table for values of land cover was removed because the numbers are already being shown in following figure the table was redundant fig 5 represents the graph of number of pixels with different land cover classes based on table 2 data since 2001 until 2013 the values for 2013 was interpolated based on values of 2002 and 2004 as it is shown in fig 5 land cover data for class 4 deciduous broadleaf trees has some intense fluctuations land cover class 1 evergreen needleleaf trees experiences and increase until 2011 also land cover class 10 snow has a very small value and has not changed during these years this means snow fall and snow cover in this region is not noticeable surprisingly although all land cover classes experience some fluctuations during these years urban and developed areas do not experience any increase or decrease and has a low changing value for all the years this can indicate the fact that maybe for studying urbanization and urban development a wider period of time e g 30 years or more should be studied additionally it seems like there is an anomaly in value of class 4 for the year 2011 since the area of tree land cover is less likely to suddenly drop and rise again within a year therefore authors are assuming a value close to the value of years 2010 and 2012 for the year 2011 approximately 10 000 cells figs 6 and 7 illustrates the cells which were selected and global data was extracted for them in this study a 9 cell grid with 1 1 resolution was used for grace and airs data and also a 64 cell grid with 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution was used for trmm and gldas data the location of atlanta city is included in these figures in addition to latitude and longitude of corners for observing the changes in total water storage the data of grace mission was used fig 8 illustrates the water storage change from 3 resources which were mentioned in materials and methods section in addition to the line of grace data only for the cell in the center as it appears in fig 8 the values for central cell are relatively equal to the average of all cells except for some dates e g in 2005 2006 and 2011 overall the fluctuations seem natural however some average decrease in 2004 2006 and in 2010 can be observed and in contrast there is a peak in 2008 table 2 represents the errors of calculation in measurements based on 2 methods for grace data fig 9 shows a screen capture of land cover and water storage change data from modis and grace datasets for year 2003 in atlanta area furthermore fig 10 depicts the daily and monthly precipitation for atlanta metropolitan area in secondary axis based on trmm data from 2002 until 2015 atlanta city is the average value of cells 45 and 55 atlanta metropolitan area is the average value of cells 34 66 and 2 degree grid region is the average value of all cells in the 64 grid network as it is shown in fig 10 the precipitation in the 3 mentioned regions can be different however to make a comparison to grace data the precipitation for atlanta metropolitan area can be analyzed in addition fig 11 demonstrates monthly surface temperature values for the 1 1 cell in which atlanta metropolitan area is located and its neighbor cells as it is shown in fig 11 surface temperature data changes normally and does not have very intense fluctuations as it appears in this figure the average surface temperature in daytime has a range of 25 to 28 and 11 to 13 except for the year 2002 that the data for all the months was not available furthermore fig 12 shows the evapotranspiration et values from 2002 to 2010 atlanta city is the average value of cells 45 and 55 atlanta metropolitan area is the average value of cells 34 66 and 2 degree grid region is the average value of all cells in the 64 grid network the unit of et in this model is kg m 2s 1 which can be converted to mm month as kg m 2s 1 kg m 3 m s to go from m s to mm month the number should be multiplied by 86 400 1000 30 but to take out density measured in kg m 3 it should be divided by 1000 hence 1 kg m 2s 1 is equal to 1 mm s and consequently 2 592 000 mm month the numbers in this unit is shown in the right side if the et trend figure as it is depicted in fig 12 the trend in et is the same as surface temperature and does not have intense fluctuations each year s et values follow a similar pattern and overall it can be implied that the values of et have not changed during these years moreover this figure indicates the fact that in atlanta city the amounts of et are lower than other 2 grid scales this is also true about the values of atlanta metropolitan area compared to the 2 degree grid region fig 10 may explain the increase in grace data for the year 2010 due to some intense rainfalls however the precipitation at the end of 2004 does not match with the grace data which is questionable because the trend in surface temperature and evapotranspiration does not have fluctuations and et cannot affect the water that penetrates into the ground for a specific year for better understanding the changes in different parameters during the years of study a multivariate statistics analysis was carried out by including all involving parameters fig 13 represents the trend of involved parameters net precipitation and total water storage change for atlanta metropolitan area a grid with approximately 1 1 dimension it should be noted that based on the values of et for each month net precipitation was calculated by subtracting et from precipitation moreover fig 14 depicts seasonal trends of fig 13 for water storage change the average of each 3 months of each season were measured and for net precipitation total precipitation of each season was considered it should be noted that the data of et was not available for years 2011 2015 hence due to the similar trend in et change for each year the values of et for the year 2010 was considered for years 2011 2015 in order to measure the net precipitation as it appears in figs 13 and 14 there is a relationship between net precipitation and total water storage change after each net precipitation peak an increase in total water storage change can be observed nonetheless the water storage change in 2008 and 2010 is slightly unusual compared to other years in the year 2008 there is a large value for water storage change compared to relatively small amount of net precipitation and also in 2010 after a peak in net precipitation of 2009 the total water storage change does not increase very much also as it appears in fig 5 there is a decline in number of cells with class of water in the year 2008 which verifies the net precipitation trend in this year however the increase in water storage change in this year is still questionable additionally by comparing figs 13 and 14 with fig 5 a it can be observed that during years 2002 2006 when land cover changes are not changing dramatically and have a smooth trend with minimal slope changes in water level and net precipitation shown on figs 13 and 14 are more correlated and explainable but for the following years which we see intense fluctuations in land cover changes other than urban there are some extreme values and also strange relationships between net precipitation and water storage change although the level of uncertainty for this assessment similar to other relevant studies is high we are able to discuss some possible correlations between the behavior of precipitation and water storage and the trend of land cover change as an example for jan 2007 jan 2008 period fig 5 shows a max peak for class 4 deciduous broadleaf trees and min peak for class 6 grass for the same period of time fig 14 does not show a drop in water storage change although net precipitation has a low value this can be possibly due to the ability of grasslands to absorb and hold the water in contrast to tree lands where leaves intensify the evapotranspiration rate and consequently result in lowering gw recharge another example for the mentioned logic is for year 2011 in fig 5 a where class 6 grass has another max peak for the same time period in fig 14 it can be seen that although net precipitation has relatively a low value but water storage change is rising for this year although class 1 evergreen needleleaf trees also has a high value compared to other years due to lack of leaves it does not impact evapotranspiration that much as mentioned before level of uncertainty for these kinds of studies is high due to existence of many parameters that can impact the accuracy of assessment in each case study location nonetheless we tried to find out whether a correlation between land cover change especially urban areas and groundwater level variation can be asserted using a simplified approach which can be used for almost all locations worldwide the results of this study indicated that direct relationship between urbanization rate and gw level in atlanta metro area is inconclusive however for other land cover types especially grass and broadleaf trees the relationship can be discussed since the possible correlation between urban development and gw level variation has been mentioned by researchers and is undeniable at least for fast growing cities future research work can be conducted to use the same methodology of this study and assess this relationship in megacities in asia or africa by taking more parameters into account if possible 4 conclusion achieving sustainable water use in urban areas requires enhanced water resources management plans such as wastewater treatment reduction in evapotranspiration managed artificial irrigation and groundwater well monitoring in this research the potential effect of urban development or other land cover changes on groundwater level fluctuations was studied according to the results atlanta city as the case study location has experienced minor urbanized and developed land cover change during last decade however indeed it has developed during last 3 4 decades rapidly as we were not able to study the land cover change and urbanization of atlanta city for the years prior to 2001 due to unavailability of satellite data a more recent and smaller time frame was selected in other words it was discussed earlier that for a more accurate assessment and conclusion for studying land cover change and urban development a wider period of time e g 30 40 years or more should be considered we acknowledge that this was a limitation for our study since the data for grace based gw level was available for after 2001 by studying the relationship between net precipitation and total water storage change a relationship between these 2 parameters were observed except for the years 2008 and 2010 as the number of cells with land cover class of water experiences a decrease in the year 2008 according to fig 5 land cover the net precipitation data can be verified however the reason of increase in total water storage change in this year still cannot be fully explained for future works this analysis can be more accurate if more parameters are taken into account as atlanta city has not experienced significant changes in urban land cover during 13 past years no conclusive results can be obtained from no overall variations in total water storage although urban land cover type has not changed other land cover classes have experienced some fluctuations and the potential correlation between land over change of class 4 and 6 with water storage was discussed it is expected that the urban population of atlanta city increases in the following years hence the extra demand for water due to urbanization and denser population can deplete groundwater resources and also can cause socio environmental problems for residents of this city or any similar cities therefore a sustainable plan for urban development by considering all environmental and social impacts is recommended by the authors of this research the main aim of this study was to find out a potential correlation between urban development and gw level variation by using only remote sensing data although the result of this research is inconclusive for the case study location the novel methodology of this research study which was clearly explained step by step can be extended for other cities especially in asia due to their intense and accelerating growth rate for the future years this study also showed that grace data and other satellite based data can be used for regionals studies since they present an accurate assessment for a large grid cell as a whole and are easily accessible declarations of interest none funding this research did not receive any

12228,sustainable urban development has been one of the main concerns for policy makers and increasing rate of population and urbanization have resulted in several socio environmental impacts on people hence water resources management in cities as one of the most vital strategies has become more complicated and challenging in this study the impact of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater level fluctuations was assessed using remote sensing data from different satellites and missions data of water storage mass precipitation evapotranspiration temperature land cover etc was extracted and processed by employing different programming languages and mapping tools atlanta metro area in georgia usa was selected as the case study location and the potential impacts of urban development in this city on groundwater resources were studied the results suggest that from 2001 to 2013 limited urban development has happened in atlanta while this urbanization rate was more intense during previous decades and is predicted to be increased by 2050 therefore although other land cover types may be more correlated results of correlating groundwater level with urban land cover is inconclusive for atlanta metro area nonetheless since relationship between urbanization and gw level variations is undeniable novel methodology of this study can be employed for other fast growing cities especially in china and india graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainable development urbanization groundwater remote sensing atlanta grace 1 introduction urbanization growth is increasing rapidly in several regions of the world and causing numerous socio environmental problems kalhor and mahdisoltani 2015 rapid population growth in cities has stimulated new strategies for water saving and reusing approaches carlson et al 2011 in fact advances in science and technology during the last 2 centuries have led to significant increases in the world s population and have resulted in an accelerating population density in urban areas hayashi et al 2009 during recent decades urbanization and land cover change have become increasingly crucial and controversial concerns in political social and academic discussions haase 2009 moreover several environmental impacts mostly associated with urban areas have been reported by agencies and researchers during past decades it has been shown that urbanization growth and urban development play a major role in several environmental issues namely surface water contamination and groundwater depletion chen et al 2011 by increasing global population and the need for fresh water the importance of groundwater resources has been increased rapidly in other words most of the world s fresh water is stored in ice sheets ice caps glaciers icebergs and generally in polar regions and a small percentage of that is stored as groundwater in aquifers in fact only 3 of total water on the earth is considered as fresh water resources and roughly 30 of that is accessible as groundwater kalhor et al 2019 kalhor 2017 hence the relatively easy access to these fresh water resources has caused impacts on environmental processes such as the water balance in quantitative terms moreover in urban areas with more impervious land covers the runoff caused by precipitation cannot infiltrate into the ground to recharge the groundwater and remains as surface runoff the impact of urbanization on groundwater supply includes changes in impervious land cover sources of groundwater recharge surface water runoff evapotranspiration and municipal water demand in fact the increase in urbanization causes less infiltration which reduces the groundwater recharge and storage mishra et al 2014 however an additional recharge to the groundwater balance can be considered due to leakage from water distributions systems sewer lines detention ponds and storm drains over irrigation of lawns gardens and parks artificial recharge decreased evapotranspiration and finally infiltration through impervious land cover simultaneously the increase in impervious cover that accompanies urban sprawl and migration to suburb areas causes reduction in evapotranspiration and increases storm runoff mishra et al 2014 sharp 2010 several researchers have studied the impact of urbanization on groundwater quality and quantity using experimental or numerical methods to increase the awareness regarding the problems urbanization can cause for hydrological and hydrogeological systems foster 2001 foster 1990 this impact has been studied for many different regions of the world minnig et al 2018 wakode et al 2018 studies have been conducted regarding the effect of urbanization on hydrological regimes and also potential flood risk by considering several cities as case studies according to research results of ahmad et al 2008 a wide range of impacts from decreasing river discharge groundwater level decline increase in salinity and shrinkage of the wetlands were reported in fact it was reported that in the case study location in india urbanization has led to excessive water withdrawal and the groundwater depletion the excessive water turns into sewage and flows toward low lying areas causing water logging contamination and siltation of the local drainage systems ahmad et al 2008 furthermore some researchers have focused on urbanization impacts on groundwater and surface water quality in particular asadi et al 2007 subramani et al 2012 as an example khazaei et al conducted research on groundwater quality reduction due to urban development based on their study an increase in nitrate concentration to a level similar to domestic sewage a general increase in phosphorus in the urban areas and an increase in chloride concentration and contamination of the groundwater by fecal coliforms were observed due to urbanization in zahedan aquifer southeastern part of iran khazaei et al 2004 additionally research works have been conducted in order to investigate the effect of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater using remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis tools using these methods the changes in groundwater level and groundwater location and flow direction can also be investigated in addition to numerous applications of remote sensing in hydrological studies abdalla 2012 al bakri and al jahmany 2013 al bakri et al 2013 chaudhary et al 1996 edet et al 1998 lalbiakmawia 2015 mukherjee 2008 saraf and choudhury 1998 schmugge et al 2002 sener et al 2004 solomon and quiel 2006 by applying rs and gis based methods for describing the possible effects of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater and surface water kavitha and swedandra chose dindigul town as a case study and reported that groundwater pollution was increased due to intense population growth kavitha and swedandra 2011 other cities were also considered as case study location such as hyderabad in india venkateswarlu et al 2014 erbil in iraq hameed et al 2015 raipur in india madhuri et al 2012 zhujiang delta of southern china weng 2001 paochiao watershed in taiwan lin et al 2008 ajmer in india jat et al 2008 jat et al 2009 son watershed in india jaiswal et al 2003 moreover a number of studies about relationship between urbanization and groundwater and also about exploring potential groundwater zones have been carried out in india using an indian satellite named irs asadi et al 2007 madhuri et al 2012 singh et al 2014 it should be noted that for studying the changes in land cover data most of the researchers have used landsat data in their research work due to its relatively high temporal and spatial resolution and the availability of its data since couple of decades ago in current study using a remote sensing and gis based approach the possible impacts of urbanization and urban development on groundwater level fluctuation was investigated for atlanta city and its suburbs the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission data along with other satellite data were used in this study grace data has been used by researchers for observing total mass of the earth or water for specified grids worldwide landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 wahr et al 2006 according to a united nations un study united nations 2014 urban development and population growth rates are accelerating mostly in asia and africa rather than northern america australia and most of the europe as it is shown in fig 1 in a united nations un study in 2014 the 10 largest urban agglomerations are mostly located in asia most importantly cities like new delhi beijing shanghai and mumbai have had and will have accelerating population growth rate from 1990 to 2030 additionally fig 2 depicts the world s urban growth rate for each continent or large region as it appears in this figure asia and after that africa have the largest growth rates for megacities large cities and medium size cities the urban growth rate for large cities and medium sized cities is also relatively high for northern america and latin america in current study a growing city in northern america was chosen as case study location rather than a city in asia or africa mainly due to lack of accessible hydrological and meteorological data in asia and africa and also lack of relevant study works in northern america first by correlating rs based results and actual field results we wanted to verify that assessing gw level fluctuation using rs and satellite data is accurate enough second we wanted to present a novel methodology and approach for evaluating possible correlation between urban development which includes population growth and increased water usage and also increased impervious land covers and gw level variations this methodology can be applied for other cities especially in asia that have had accelerating urban growth rate during last 2 decades this is because satellite data is accessible for all regions around the world and the results of data processing from rs data can be directly used for future assessment however further verification and validation of results based on field data upon availability is always recommended since grace data deals with mass of water data for regions or grid cells that are fully or partially within water bodies or are in proximity of water bodies does not lead to accurate assessments therefore as a limitation for grace data it is recommended to choose study locations that are completely surrounded by land since most of the populated cities and also cities that are experiencing extensive urban development in the us are located in coastal areas or proximity of ocean or large lakes for example new york los angeles san diego chicago san francisco philadelphia houston etc options for choosing case study city within the us was limited after evaluating the options atlanta city was chosen because of its significant urban development rate compared to other similar cities in the us and also because very limited research studies related to groundwater issues and urban development were conducted for this city 2 methodology 2 1 case study location the case study city for this research is atlanta city and its suburbs atlanta metropolitan area in georgia usa this city is located in southeastern part of the us and has developed intensely during last decades the atlanta georgia metropolitan region is defined here to include several urban counties with a spatial extent of roughly 1 degree 1 degree during past decades atlanta georgia has developed to be considered as one of the largest commercial and industrial urban areas of the southeastern united states and one of the fastest growing cities in the country high rate of population growth is highly associated with this noticeable growth of the urban extent this has led to tremendous land cover changes in forested and agricultural lands adjacent to the city and urban areas moreover it has caused high rate of urban transformation in rural areas hu and lo 2007 moreover urbanization growth in this city has caused some impacts on hydrological systems in the past decades peters 2001 peters and rose 2001 rose and peters 2001 fig 3 shows land cover change in this region since 1973 until 1999 this figure can help the viewers to compare the urban development in the region using the extracted data from modis satellite since 2001 for a long period of time to observe the trend of urbanization in addition yang and lo 2003 defined 3 scenarios for future trend of urban development in this region these scenarios represent different growth strategies that can be adopted by planners and policy makers the first scenario simulated the continued growth trend if the urban sprawl is allowed to continue the second scenario shows the growth trend if future road and transportation development and environmental conservation are considered the third scenario simulated the development trend when the growth rate is reduced and the growth pattern is changed fig 4 represents the future of atlanta region urban growth based on 3 scenarios defined by yang and lo 2003 2 2 satellite data for observing the relationship between urbanization and groundwater level several parameters were considered in this study the satellite data for land cover change is informative for observing the urban land expansion also by considering the data of grace which determines the total mass of the earth or water in an area in addition to the precipitation and evapotranspiration data the approximate trend of groundwater level fluctuation can be observed in this project a 14 year data set from 2002 until 2015 was chosen to be studied however for some mission data which was used in this research the data for all these 14 years was not available for understanding the land cover change in atlanta metropolitan area annual data of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor was used according to nasa website https modis gsfc nasa gov about design php this sensor is located aboard the terra and aqua platforms offering a view the earth s surface every 1 2 days the modis sensor collects data within 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelengths from 0 4 μm to 14 4 μm and provides us with imagery at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir for two bands 500 m resolution for 5 bands and the remaining 29 bands at 1 km the modis land cover type product mcd12q1 version 051 provides data characterizing five global land cover classification systems in addition it provides a land cover type assessment and quality control information for this study land cover types description type 5 classification was chosen and based on the description of this type in usgs website different land cover types were distinguished using color indicator in arcmap this satellite provides data of land cover types in a relatively high spatial resolution 500 m sin grid and 1 year temporal resolution and also in hdf format table 1 represents land cover classes of type 5 classification according to usgs website as it is shown in table 1 urban and built up areas have a value of 9 thus for each year the number of pixels with value of 9 were counted in arcmap it should be noted that for the case study location atlanta metro half of the city was covered by 1 tile and another half was covered by anther tile therefore for describing the land cover change for whole area and with enough accuracy the data for both tiles was used and merged together moreover as the dimension of each tile is large approximately 10 degrees by 10 degrees in southeastern us a smaller area of interest was cut from the larger layer after merging 2 layers together in arcmap software for sticking merging 2 tiles layers together in arcgis mosaic to new raster sub tool from arc toolbox was used this sub tool is located in data management tools raster raster dataset tools furthermore for selecting our desired region from this large layer each merged layer was cut using spatial analysist tool map algebra raster calculator after zooming to the atlanta metropolitan area each layer was multiplied by 1 and in environments section in processing extent the extent was chosen as same as display hence all layers for each year have same dimensions in addition the data of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission was used to estimate the changes in total water storage in an area the spatial resolution of this level 3 data is 1 degree by 1 degree and has temporal resolution of approximately 1 month on average the first and last dates of this data are april 15 2000 and december 22 2013 respectively grace has an orbit of 500 km and circles earth 15 times per day it was launched in 2002 and can measures distance between two satellites to 10 μm over a distance of 220 km changes in distance over time provides acceleration which can be used to estimate local gravity grace is able to provide gravity estimates to 1 mgal or 0 00001 m s2 chen 2018 using the data of grace mission data products from 3 sources jet propulsion laboratory jpl university of texas center for space research csr and german research center for geosciences gfz were downloaded and processed moreover by running an r code the data for the cell in which atlanta city is located and its neighbor cells 9 cells in total was extracted it should be noted that the data of grace mission is based on 3 sources and should be multiplied by a scaling factor furthermore by using a matlab code the modified values after considering scaling factor the leakage error el and measurement error em were calculated based on the downloaded data for 9 cells by using 2 methods arithmetic means and co variance mean finally the total errors or regional errors or e based on these 2 methods were determined landerer and swenson 2012 1 e e m 2 e l 2 where mean measurement m and leakage l errors are based on co variance function ci j using distance between cells 2 e z i 1 n j 1 n w i w j c z i j where 3 c z i j σ z i σ z j e x p d i j 2 2 d z 0 2 where

for observing the trends in precipitation during the years 2002 2015 data of tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm mission was used trmm precipitation data has a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees and daily temporal resolution according to nasa website https pmm nasa gov trmm trmm instruments frequency wavelengths of visible infrared scanner are 0 63 1 6 3 75 10 8 12 μm and for precipitation radar is 13 8 ghz horizontal polarization moreover ground resolution and swath width of visible infrared scanner and precipitation radar are 2 1 km and 4 3 km at nadir and 720 km and 220 km respectively the trmm orbit is circular non sun synchronous at an altitude of 350 km and an inclination of 35 degrees to the equator it is worth mentioning that the trmm data was extracted for 64 cells 2 2 in the region the center of atlanta city is located in the boundary of 2 of the central cells thus the precipitation data for atlanta city was considered as the mean value of these 2 cells it is worth mentioning that trmm data was downloaded for each month in bin format using wget command in giovanni website trmm tmpa and other sources monthly rainfall product trmm product 3b43 version 7 data record of this product is available since 1998 using an r code the daily precipitation data was extracted in text file for an 8 8 grid 2 2 in total with atlanta city in its center although downloaded data is for a 2 2 grid because the airs and grace data for surface temperature and water storage respectively has 1 spatial resolution only 16 cells 1 1 of trmm data with atlanta city in its center was considered to be studied the monthly precipitation data of this data source is in mm unit furthermore data of atmospheric infrared sounder airs which is one of six instruments flying on board nasa s aqua satellite was used for following the trend of surface temperature during these years according to nasa website https airs jpl nasa gov index html airs is a high spectral resolution spectrometer with 2378 bands in the thermal infrared 3 7 15 4 μm and 4 bands in the visible 0 4 1 0 μm the vis nir sensor assembly shares the scan mirror with the spectrometer so that each ir footprint is overlaid with a grid of visible detector pixels in four wavelength channels the four channels provide spectral coverage from 0 4 μm to 1 0 μm some other information of aqua satellite are as follows orbit type sun synchronous polar orbit orbit altitude 705 km period 98 88 min orbits per day 14 5 overpasses 2 per day daytime ascending pass south pole to north pole at 1 30 p m local time nighttime descending pass north pole to south pole occurs at 1 30 a m local time daily coverage more than 95 of earth s surface swath width 1650 km 1025 mi the airs data was obtained from giovanni website in netcdf format surface temperature daytime ascending airx3stm v006 and surface temperature nighttime descending airx3stm v006 products this data is available for the year 2002 until current and has a dataset title of aqua airs level 3 monthly standard physical retrieval airs amsu version 006 using a matlab code the global data of airs was processed and the data for our desired cells were extracted this data has monthly temporal resolution and 1 1 spatial resolution hence to make a comparison with grace data which has the same spatial resolution the data of 9 cells the cell including atlanta city and its neighbor cells was considered this data has surface temperature for day time and night time and is in kalvin unit thus the surface temperature values were converted to celsius unit by subtracting 273 15 from each of them additionally the data of the global land data assimilation system gldas model gldas noah land surface model l4 monthly 0 25 0 25 degree v2 0 was used for evapotranspiration et values in each cell with spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and monthly temporal resolution starting january 2002 until december 2015 with unit of kg m 2s 1 this data was obtained from giovanni website in netcdf format and was processed and extracted for the case study location area using a matlab code the details of this matlab script are presented in appendix section the monthly data of gldas model is available from 1948 to 2012 it should be noted that to ensure accuracy of grace data field measurements of gw level for 2 stations north of atlanta city the only stations for gw level data in atlanta metro area were extracted and compared with grace data it was observed that all three gw level data sources have maximum and minimum peaks within the same time frame however the value of peaks and the slope of change are different this firstly shows that the trend of grace data correlates with field measurements and secondly demonstrates that how grace data can represent regional gw level fluctuations more accurately in other words for example in atlanta metro area and its suburbs we were able to get access to field measurements data of only 2 stations located in north of atlanta usgs 335517084164001 11ff04 and usgs 335612084312902 09ff18 while gw level might change differently in other parts therefore grace can give us a greater insight into overall gw level variations in regional studies which is extremely helpful for research works that are related to regional changes or studies that opt to estimate overall trend of a parameter over a long period of time this simplified approach for regional studies helps policy makers to do their assessments toward sustainable development easier 3 result and discussion after analyzing the data extracted from satellites mentioned in the materials and methods section an evaluation based on the trends of the parameters involved in this study was carried out table 2 represents the values of land cover classes for the years 2001 2013 except for 2003 due to its unavailability table for values of land cover was removed because the numbers are already being shown in following figure the table was redundant fig 5 represents the graph of number of pixels with different land cover classes based on table 2 data since 2001 until 2013 the values for 2013 was interpolated based on values of 2002 and 2004 as it is shown in fig 5 land cover data for class 4 deciduous broadleaf trees has some intense fluctuations land cover class 1 evergreen needleleaf trees experiences and increase until 2011 also land cover class 10 snow has a very small value and has not changed during these years this means snow fall and snow cover in this region is not noticeable surprisingly although all land cover classes experience some fluctuations during these years urban and developed areas do not experience any increase or decrease and has a low changing value for all the years this can indicate the fact that maybe for studying urbanization and urban development a wider period of time e g 30 years or more should be studied additionally it seems like there is an anomaly in value of class 4 for the year 2011 since the area of tree land cover is less likely to suddenly drop and rise again within a year therefore authors are assuming a value close to the value of years 2010 and 2012 for the year 2011 approximately 10 000 cells figs 6 and 7 illustrates the cells which were selected and global data was extracted for them in this study a 9 cell grid with 1 1 resolution was used for grace and airs data and also a 64 cell grid with 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution was used for trmm and gldas data the location of atlanta city is included in these figures in addition to latitude and longitude of corners for observing the changes in total water storage the data of grace mission was used fig 8 illustrates the water storage change from 3 resources which were mentioned in materials and methods section in addition to the line of grace data only for the cell in the center as it appears in fig 8 the values for central cell are relatively equal to the average of all cells except for some dates e g in 2005 2006 and 2011 overall the fluctuations seem natural however some average decrease in 2004 2006 and in 2010 can be observed and in contrast there is a peak in 2008 table 2 represents the errors of calculation in measurements based on 2 methods for grace data fig 9 shows a screen capture of land cover and water storage change data from modis and grace datasets for year 2003 in atlanta area furthermore fig 10 depicts the daily and monthly precipitation for atlanta metropolitan area in secondary axis based on trmm data from 2002 until 2015 atlanta city is the average value of cells 45 and 55 atlanta metropolitan area is the average value of cells 34 66 and 2 degree grid region is the average value of all cells in the 64 grid network as it is shown in fig 10 the precipitation in the 3 mentioned regions can be different however to make a comparison to grace data the precipitation for atlanta metropolitan area can be analyzed in addition fig 11 demonstrates monthly surface temperature values for the 1 1 cell in which atlanta metropolitan area is located and its neighbor cells as it is shown in fig 11 surface temperature data changes normally and does not have very intense fluctuations as it appears in this figure the average surface temperature in daytime has a range of 25 to 28 and 11 to 13 except for the year 2002 that the data for all the months was not available furthermore fig 12 shows the evapotranspiration et values from 2002 to 2010 atlanta city is the average value of cells 45 and 55 atlanta metropolitan area is the average value of cells 34 66 and 2 degree grid region is the average value of all cells in the 64 grid network the unit of et in this model is kg m 2s 1 which can be converted to mm month as kg m 2s 1 kg m 3 m s to go from m s to mm month the number should be multiplied by 86 400 1000 30 but to take out density measured in kg m 3 it should be divided by 1000 hence 1 kg m 2s 1 is equal to 1 mm s and consequently 2 592 000 mm month the numbers in this unit is shown in the right side if the et trend figure as it is depicted in fig 12 the trend in et is the same as surface temperature and does not have intense fluctuations each year s et values follow a similar pattern and overall it can be implied that the values of et have not changed during these years moreover this figure indicates the fact that in atlanta city the amounts of et are lower than other 2 grid scales this is also true about the values of atlanta metropolitan area compared to the 2 degree grid region fig 10 may explain the increase in grace data for the year 2010 due to some intense rainfalls however the precipitation at the end of 2004 does not match with the grace data which is questionable because the trend in surface temperature and evapotranspiration does not have fluctuations and et cannot affect the water that penetrates into the ground for a specific year for better understanding the changes in different parameters during the years of study a multivariate statistics analysis was carried out by including all involving parameters fig 13 represents the trend of involved parameters net precipitation and total water storage change for atlanta metropolitan area a grid with approximately 1 1 dimension it should be noted that based on the values of et for each month net precipitation was calculated by subtracting et from precipitation moreover fig 14 depicts seasonal trends of fig 13 for water storage change the average of each 3 months of each season were measured and for net precipitation total precipitation of each season was considered it should be noted that the data of et was not available for years 2011 2015 hence due to the similar trend in et change for each year the values of et for the year 2010 was considered for years 2011 2015 in order to measure the net precipitation as it appears in figs 13 and 14 there is a relationship between net precipitation and total water storage change after each net precipitation peak an increase in total water storage change can be observed nonetheless the water storage change in 2008 and 2010 is slightly unusual compared to other years in the year 2008 there is a large value for water storage change compared to relatively small amount of net precipitation and also in 2010 after a peak in net precipitation of 2009 the total water storage change does not increase very much also as it appears in fig 5 there is a decline in number of cells with class of water in the year 2008 which verifies the net precipitation trend in this year however the increase in water storage change in this year is still questionable additionally by comparing figs 13 and 14 with fig 5 a it can be observed that during years 2002 2006 when land cover changes are not changing dramatically and have a smooth trend with minimal slope changes in water level and net precipitation shown on figs 13 and 14 are more correlated and explainable but for the following years which we see intense fluctuations in land cover changes other than urban there are some extreme values and also strange relationships between net precipitation and water storage change although the level of uncertainty for this assessment similar to other relevant studies is high we are able to discuss some possible correlations between the behavior of precipitation and water storage and the trend of land cover change as an example for jan 2007 jan 2008 period fig 5 shows a max peak for class 4 deciduous broadleaf trees and min peak for class 6 grass for the same period of time fig 14 does not show a drop in water storage change although net precipitation has a low value this can be possibly due to the ability of grasslands to absorb and hold the water in contrast to tree lands where leaves intensify the evapotranspiration rate and consequently result in lowering gw recharge another example for the mentioned logic is for year 2011 in fig 5 a where class 6 grass has another max peak for the same time period in fig 14 it can be seen that although net precipitation has relatively a low value but water storage change is rising for this year although class 1 evergreen needleleaf trees also has a high value compared to other years due to lack of leaves it does not impact evapotranspiration that much as mentioned before level of uncertainty for these kinds of studies is high due to existence of many parameters that can impact the accuracy of assessment in each case study location nonetheless we tried to find out whether a correlation between land cover change especially urban areas and groundwater level variation can be asserted using a simplified approach which can be used for almost all locations worldwide the results of this study indicated that direct relationship between urbanization rate and gw level in atlanta metro area is inconclusive however for other land cover types especially grass and broadleaf trees the relationship can be discussed since the possible correlation between urban development and gw level variation has been mentioned by researchers and is undeniable at least for fast growing cities future research work can be conducted to use the same methodology of this study and assess this relationship in megacities in asia or africa by taking more parameters into account if possible 4 conclusion achieving sustainable water use in urban areas requires enhanced water resources management plans such as wastewater treatment reduction in evapotranspiration managed artificial irrigation and groundwater well monitoring in this research the potential effect of urban development or other land cover changes on groundwater level fluctuations was studied according to the results atlanta city as the case study location has experienced minor urbanized and developed land cover change during last decade however indeed it has developed during last 3 4 decades rapidly as we were not able to study the land cover change and urbanization of atlanta city for the years prior to 2001 due to unavailability of satellite data a more recent and smaller time frame was selected in other words it was discussed earlier that for a more accurate assessment and conclusion for studying land cover change and urban development a wider period of time e g 30 40 years or more should be considered we acknowledge that this was a limitation for our study since the data for grace based gw level was available for after 2001 by studying the relationship between net precipitation and total water storage change a relationship between these 2 parameters were observed except for the years 2008 and 2010 as the number of cells with land cover class of water experiences a decrease in the year 2008 according to fig 5 land cover the net precipitation data can be verified however the reason of increase in total water storage change in this year still cannot be fully explained for future works this analysis can be more accurate if more parameters are taken into account as atlanta city has not experienced significant changes in urban land cover during 13 past years no conclusive results can be obtained from no overall variations in total water storage although urban land cover type has not changed other land cover classes have experienced some fluctuations and the potential correlation between land over change of class 4 and 6 with water storage was discussed it is expected that the urban population of atlanta city increases in the following years hence the extra demand for water due to urbanization and denser population can deplete groundwater resources and also can cause socio environmental problems for residents of this city or any similar cities therefore a sustainable plan for urban development by considering all environmental and social impacts is recommended by the authors of this research the main aim of this study was to find out a potential correlation between urban development and gw level variation by using only remote sensing data although the result of this research is inconclusive for the case study location the novel methodology of this research study which was clearly explained step by step can be extended for other cities especially in asia due to their intense and accelerating growth rate for the future years this study also showed that grace data and other satellite based data can be used for regionals studies since they present an accurate assessment for a large grid cell as a whole and are easily accessible declarations of interest none funding this research did not receive any

12229,in order to characterize the radium distribution and submarine groundwater discharge sgd in the bohai sea area the three isotopes 223ra 224ra and 228ra in different water bodies were measured in a 4 year period with the radium delayed coincidence counting radecc system the results indicated that radium activities take an order of groundwater coastal seawater river water central seawater the radium activities of groundwater were controlled by the lithology human activities and salinity groundwater in aquifers with higher content of th and u like igneous and metamorphic has higher radium activities high salinity and oil exploitation which leads to groundwater contamination can also cause the higher radium activities the radium isotopes of offshore waters were controlled by their respective onshore groundwater and sgd flux rates the relative level of radium ra isotope activity of coastal groundwater and nearshore seawater is determined by the interaction between groundwater and seawater it is concluded that smaller radium mass transport from bottom sediments and the majority radium were supplied from landward groundwater from horizontal and vertical distribution of ra isotope the seasonal investigation showed that the seawater radium activities of 223ra 224ra and 228ra in autumn were higher than that in spring based on the seasonal variation of radium activities and the mass balance of radium sgd of the bohai sea during rainy season were calculated to be 1 43 108 m3 d 3 73 10 3 m3 m2 d in northern region and 2 84 107 1 76 10 3 m3 m2 d in western region by 228ra graphical abstract image 1 keywords the bohai sea radium isotope submarine groundwater discharge geological lithology seasonal variation 1 introduction natural radium isotopes have been widely used as a tracer for estimating groundwater flow into coastal surface water bodies in addition to being orders of magnitude more enriched in groundwater relative to seawater there are four isotopes of ra 224ra t1 2 3 66 d 223ra t1 2 11 4 d 228ra t1 2 5 75 yr 226ra t1 2 1600 yr with a wide range of half lives that makes them useful for studying processes that cover a wide span of time scales peterson et al 2008 moore et al 2006 webster et al 1995 in general ra isotopes are tightly bound to particle surfaces in freshwater but during the processes of mixing into seawater particle bound ra will be released to the aqueous phase as a result of the increasing ionic strength due to this effect the activities of ra isotopes in seawater are 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in freshwater moore 1996 wang et al 2014 moore et al 1995 based on the different activities of ra isotopes the different freshwater or salty water endmembers can be distinguished and the riverine plumes the ocean boundary inputs the submarine groundwater discharge sgd the residence time of waters as well as the estuary ocean mixing processes can also be indicated yang et al 2002 rama and moore 1996 moore 1999 2007 2008 moore and krest 2004 charette et al 2015 particularly the sgd flux can be quantified based on the radium activities over a large spatial scale which is essential for estimating the transport of not only ra isotopes but also nutrients from groundwater to estuary or sea moore 1996 2007 charette et al 2001 garcia solsona et al 2008 liu et al 2015 the radium age technique is also applied to flushing calculations in river which is dominated by shallow estuaries in addition to tracing water exchange in the bay area dulaiova and burnett 2008 however these studies were often limited by a poor understanding of the distribution of these isotopes in coastal groundwater the processes controlling these distributions and a lack of high resolution time series sampling of tracer activities in surface waters ra activity in groundwater can vary over many orders of magnitude due to geochemical heterogeneity including the abundance of parent isotopes in sediments pore water salinity redox conditions and other factors such as ph temperature and organic matter content michael et al 2011 in this paper we attempt to partly overcome these earlier limitations by mapping the distribution of radium isotopes through rich data in bohai area including both sea area and coastal zone water shortage and water quality are pressing issues on the bohai bay rim area where population growth and economic development are occurring rapidly and are expected to keep increasing in the future numerous studies cole et al 2006 bowen et al 2007 have shown that urbanization agriculture and dense human populations are associated with higher nutrient concentrations in groundwater because sgd is recognized as a pathway by which terrestrial nutrients enter the coastal ocean in this area characterizing sgd fluxes is a necessity to understand and maintain the mechanism governing the health of bohai ecology and environment radium isotope tracing has long been used in investigating the sgd of the bohai sea area for example chen and zhang 1989 studied the 226ra contents in sediments of chinese coast including the bohai sea and by comparing the radium activities between water and sediment they concluded that 226ra in nearshore shallow areas mainly comes from terrigenous sediments while the decay of 230th is the main source of 226ra in deep sea peterson et al 2008 used natural radium isotopes 223ra 224ra 226ra 228ra and other geochemical tracers to determine the transport rates in the yellow river bohai sea mixing zone by examining the activity ratio distribution of radium isotopes and their results have improved the knowledge of nutrient input to the open bohai sea the sgd fluxes in the yellow river estuary was quantified by xu et al 2013 through a 226ra mass balance model and the estimated sgd flux was 1 3 109 m3 d with a range of 2 8 108 3 0 109 m3 d even the minimum sgd value was about 3 times higher than the yellow river discharge tang et al 2015 studied the activities of 223ra and 224ra in two different areas of the bohai bay and explored their influencing factors it was found that the geochemical environment coastal land use patterns and the type of water are all the factors constrain the radium activities and the less developed qikou area has higher 223ra and 224ra activities than the highly developed tanggu area liu et al 2015 analyzed the distributions of two short lived isotopes 223ra and 224ra in the bohai bay and found that the activities of these short lived ra decreased exponentially with increasing offshore distance in a study of groundwater seawater interaction in the bohai bay yi et al 2016 used a three dimensional model to simulate the flow and transport process of a surficial saline aquifer seawater exchange in the bohai bay and estimate the rates of sgd and seawater intrusion swi and it was found that the estimated rates have relatively large temporal variations along with the sea level elevation fluctuations recently liu et al 2017 used the 226ra and 228ra mass balance model to estimate the fluxes of sgd and the associated dissolved inorganic nutrients into the bohai sea and they firstly pay attention on the whole bohai sea area and concluded that the sgd flux was about 2 0 1 3 1011 m3 yr in which the rsgd plays a major role these previous studies have made great breakthroughs in the hydrodynamic function nutrient inputs submarine groundwater discharge etc in the bohai sea using radium as a tracer however most studies focused on small portions of the bohai sea and not the whole sea area though liu et al 2017 took the whole bohai sea as the study area the study focused mainly on the analysis and calculation of sgd and nutrient fluxes by using the long half life isotopes 226ra and 228ra in order to better study the hydrodynamic effect of the bohai sea and the influence factors of radium activities in different types of water it s necessary to make a comprehensive analysis of the terrestrial groundwater river water and seawater in the whole bohai sea area as well as the sgd fluxes in the past years we carried out multiple radium isotopes sampling campaigns in the whole bohai sea area except for yellow river estuary including groundwater river water nearshore and offshore seawater the objectives of this article are 1 to elucidate the ra isotopes distribution characteristics of the whole bohai sea area through systematic analysis of these data 2 to explore their forming environment and major influence factors and 3 to present a new sgd estimation method based on seasonal difference of seawater radium isotopes activities 2 geologic setting the bohai sea which is located in north china as a part of the west pacific ocean is enclosed by liaodong and shandong peninsulas and is connected to the yellow sea by the bohai strait hu et al 2009 it is a semi enclosed continental sea and is mainly composed of five parts liaodong bay in the north bohai bay in the west laizhou bay in the south shallow bohai central basin and bohai strait in the east the bohai sea has a total area of 77 000 km2 a coastline of 3800 km an average water depth of 18 m and the maximum depth of 85 m sündermann and feng 2004 the areas with a depth of less than 30 m account for 93 5 of the total area and the other 6 5 which have a depth of above 30 m are mainly distributed around the bohai strait feng et al 2007 the study area in this paper is the whole bohai sea area with the longitude and latitude scopes of 117 30 122 40 e and 37 10 41 00 n respectively fig 1 influenced by the continental mass of the east asia continent and the pacific ocean the bohai sea has formed a unique climate feature dry winter characteristic of continental climate and rainy and less windy summer and autumn characteristic of southeast monsoon climate feng et al 2007 the average annual precipitation of the area is approximately 560 916 mm yr which is mainly concentrated in summer li et al 2006 affected by the land the bohai sea also has the characteristics of low temperature and low salt content its average temperature is about 12 c with a maximum of 25 c in july and a minimum of 4 c in january liu et al 2003 its annual average salinity is 30 with a higher salinity of 31 from the eastern part to the bohai strait and a lower salinity of around 26 in the neritic area the vertical distribution of salinity in the bohai sea is similar to its temperature distribution which is homogeneous in winter and exists with pycnocline in summer feng et al 2007 there are 36 rivers that flow into the bohai sea including the yellow river the hai river the luan river and the liao river which collectively contribute 5 98 1010 m3 discharge flux to the bohai sea each year among them the yellow river has the largest runoff of 3 22 1010 m3 yr approximately half of the total flux jin et al 2016 feng et al 2007 in the surrounding area of bohai sea the strata formed in the archeozoic proterozoic paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic era are all distributed and these strata consist of metamorphic rock igneous rock and sedimentary rock according to the difference of water storage condition of aquifers and characteristics of aqueous medium coastal aquifer systems of the bohai sea can be divided into six types marine mixed clay and fine sand pore aquifer alluvial and diluvial mixed clay and sand and gravel pore aquifer alluvial and diluvial mixed sand and gravel pore aquifer igneous and metamorphic rocks fissured aquifer sand and shale pore aquifer and karst aquifer these aquifers received adjacent upstream aquifers and rainfall recharge and most of the groundwater has been evaporated exploited or discharged into the bohai sea the submarine surface sediments in the study area present four types soft clay mud fine silt mud coarse silt and fine sand among which clay mud is the most important type and is mainly distributed in the bohai bay and bohai central basin these distribution patterns are mainly influenced by tidal currents in the bohai sea which are the major sources of kinetic energy hu et al 2009 zhenxia et al 1998 3 sampling and measurement the surface and deep water samples in the bohai sea the groundwater and river water samples in the coastal area were collected during several sampling campaigns from august 2013 to october 2017 particularly the samples in the bohai central basin were collected by the dong fang hong 2 research ship during the yellow sea bohai sea spring and autumn cruises all samples were stored in 25l plastic bottles with total volume of 50l for seawater and river water samples and total volume of 25l for groundwater samples then all samples were delivered to the laboratory for measurement within 24 h except for the central basin water samples which were measured in the shipboard laboratory 223ra and 224ra were measured by the radecc following moore and arnold s recommendations 1996 samples were counted again 6 months after collection to determine the initial 228ra activity moore 2008 detector efficiencies were determined using 232th and 227ac standards in secular equilibrium with their daughters analytical counting uncertainties were estimated by standard rules of error propagation as described in cheng et al 2015 224ra and 228ra are around 7 5 223ra is about 10 in this paper we analyzed in total 184 samples sample location were shown in fig 1 including 73 groundwater samples 58 coastal seawater samples 35 bohai central basin water samples 4 yellow sea water samples and 14 river water samples from duliujian river and hai river 4 results and discussion 4 1 radium activities in different water bodies the activity distribution of radium isotopes are presented in fig 2 the maximum minimum and average values in different water bodies are summarized in table 1 the results indicated that there is obvious difference among them the average activity of 223ra in groundwater coastal seawater central seawater and river water were 12 86 7 42 0 69 and 1 26 dpm 100l respectively the average activity of 224ra in groundwater coastal seawater central seawater and river water were 334 60 162 59 11 21 and 31 12 dpm 100l respectively the average activity of 228ra in groundwater coastal seawater central seawater and river water were 251 43 113 79 51 78 and 44 94 dpm 100l respectively these results clearly indicated that 223ra 224ra and 228ra in different water bodies exhibit nearly the same characteristics with an order of groundwater coastal seawater river water central seawater in fig 3 a comparison of radium isotopes activity ratios in all kinds of water is presented isotopes activity ratio ar generally reflect the mixing process between their sources and water bodies there were remarkable differences among ar of different water what we can draw conclusion from fig 3 is that significant positive correlations were observed between 224ra to 228ra and 224ra to 223ra in groundwater seawater and river water samples and each group is located in a somewhat distinct area of plot this implies that the sources of radium isotopes have distinct processes across groups and did not differ significantly within each group as components of the same 232 th day series 224ra and 228ra were the most closely related the sources of 228ra in groundwater mainly include recoil from 232th in minerals and decay of adsorbed 232th whereas the main source of 224ra is the alpha recoil by parent isotopes when a conservative radioactive equilibrium system is achieved the value of 224ra 228ra has been proved to be unity i e 1 fig 3 also shows that the average 224ra 228ra in groundwater and river were close to unity indicating that in the groundwater system and river water all 224ra nearly attain to a radioactive equilibrium with 228ra this is particularly true in river water as no additional 224ra was resupplied from some solid source containing uranium and thorium the average ar is less than 1 the average 224ra 228r ar of coastal water is 5 63 and much higher than 1 this is the result of the alpha particle recoil process whereby short lived isotopes accumulate to their equilibrium values faster than longer lived isotopes central seawater in contrast has a lowest average 224ra 228r ar value 0 42 in the scope of the study area this situation occurs because there were no excess desorption sources of 224ra and the input of its parent elements in central sea furthermore 224ra decays faster than 228ra 224ra and 223ra come from 232th and 235u radioactive decay series respectively 224ra 223ra is governed by the lithology through the water transport and its deviation from secular equilibrium depends on the rate of water rock processes the age of the groundwater and mixing processes with other water for current study the 224ra 223ra ar 24 32 in groundwater is much higher than the secular value of 18 18 iaea 2014 hu and yu 2002 indicating that the dominate host aquifer rocks of study area mainly consists of crystalline and sand rock with relatively high th u ratio 224ra 223ra of groundwater is consistent with the natural abundances of aquifers lithology once groundwater discharges to coastal seawater 224ra decays more rapidly than 223ra due to its shorter half life which lead to a slight lower 224ra 223ra ratio of the coastal seawater in our case the average 224ra 223ra ratio is equal to 19 68 and slightly higher than 18 18 which is determined by widespread formation with high th u ratio distributed in this area the central seawater has the lowest value of 224ra 223ra 11 73 the reason can be attributed to the rapid decay of 224ra compared to 223ra the significant mixing and diffusion effects and the less radium recharge 4 2 groundwater 4 2 1 geographical distribution characteristics in total 73 groundwater samples were collected in this study which is grouped into 5 categories based on the aquifers lithology and activity level table 2 and the distribution features are shown in fig 2 the groundwater radium activity level and their ratios reflect a rock type effect occurred the concentrations of these radionuclides in groundwater are mainly determined by the concentrations of u and th in the aquifer rocks it should be noted that the maximum activity values of 223ra 86 88 dpm 100l 224ra 1945 16 dpm 100l and 228ra 585 46 dpm 100l were all concentrated in igneous and metamorphic rocks fissured aquifer the salinity effect increasing radium levels with groundwater salinity is observed in west part of the study area where marine clay mixed with fine sand pore aquifer is dominant which confirms the lower concentration of radium isotopes and their parent nuclides in sand and clay iaea 2014 on the other hand since the groundwater of this aquifer has a high salinity it is logical that the groundwater has a higher radium activity level the higher average value and large variation range were observed for radium activities of groundwater radium isotopes form as daughter products during the decay of the naturally occurring elements uranium and thorium they accumulate in water via interaction of the water with solid phase materials that contain the initial source of the isotopes uranium for 226ra and 223ra thorium for 228ra and 224ra the isotopes accumulate through the processes of dissolution ion exchange and alpha particle recoil kraemer 2005 kraemer and genereux 1998 in a closed groundwater system the daughter products reach a level of radioactivity equivalent to that of the long lived head of the decay chain e g 238u for 226ra 232th for 224ra and 228ra and 235u for 223ra a condition that is known as secular equilibrium and this led to the highest activities in groundwater in this area furthermore due to the substantial differences in lithology and groundwater hydrodynamic diversity the largest variation range was observed in groundwater when water transits from a groundwater environment to surface water environment the accumulation process of radium isotopes will tend to cease but the water may retain the isotopes that already accumulated because river water has low salinity the radium adsorbed on suspended solid did not desorb into river water leading to lower activities in river water in this area by comparing the activity levels between groundwater and river water it was concluded that there was weak hydraulic connection between them 4 2 2 groundwater of oil exploitation area from fig 2 we can inferred that the first coastal section marked in orange has only one kind of aquifer lithology which is marine mixed clay and fine sand particularly the salinity of groundwater in this section area is high the distribution characteristic indicated that the activities of 223ra 224ra 228ra in the western region in the extreme west of map in fig 2 is higher than that of other places though they are under the same conditions of aquifer lithology and groundwater salinity this area is the location of a large dagang oilfield where distributed of many oil pumping sites during more than 50 years of oil exploitation activities there are great impacts on groundwater quality the shallow groundwater was generally polluted by oil exploitation liu et al 2007 according to previous studies the oil exploitation is one of the non nuclear industrial activities that result in enhancement of naturally occurring radioactive materials norm the concentrations of norm can be enhanced above natural levels in mainly two ways one is the changes of physicochemical or residues managing method which can enhance the bioavailability of radionuclides the other is the raw material processing during which the concentrations of norm in a product by product or residue can be enhanced iaea 2014 moreover one of the most common radioactive elements found in the oil products and by products is radium husain and sakhnini 2017 in a freshwater aquifer radium commonly co precipitates with barite celestite and ba sr so4 solid solutions during the oil treatment process through the addition of sulfate katherine et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 but in the groundwater aquifer of dagang the radium activities are even higher due to the higher salinity the activities of parent radionuclides u and th are generally low because of their low solubility in water however their decay products 223ra 224ra 228ra are often found as dissolved in the water and occurred in consequence of water rock interactions parmaksız et al 2015 table 3 shows the activity comparison of groundwater samples in oil exploration area g1 g15 and adjacent areas g16 g40 all the results indicated that human activity of oil exploitation contributes to an enhancement of radium activities in groundwater of this study area 4 3 seawater 4 3 1 geographical distribution characteristics the general geographical distribution characteristics of radium isotopes activities can be inferred from fig 2 generally radium isotopes absorbed on suspended particles in freshwater including groundwater and river water will suddenly release when they meet coastal water with higher salinity this can be explained by the first order rate constant of adsorption k1 may vary by approximately 5 orders of magnitude between freshwater and brine levels of salinity vinson 2011 if desorption is the major source of radium a peak in radium activities would be expected along the coastal shoreline but this situation hasn t occurred in bohai sea area because of complicated groundwater seawater interaction the whole coastal line can be grossly divided into four segments according to the mechanism of ra isotopes distribution the relative level of radium ra isotope activity of coastal groundwater and nearshore seawater is determined by the interaction between groundwater and seawater as is shown in fig 2 in the first segment marked in orange the rock of aquifers consists of marine sediments like clay and fine sand and groundwater in these aquifers has a higher salinity therefore the desorption of radium will be completed in aquifers before groundwater discharges into sea leading to occur higher radium activities of coastal groundwater than that of coastal seawater in the second segment marked in blue the rock of aquifers consists of alluvial and diluvial sediments like clay sand and gravel and igneous and metamorphic rocks the highest radium activity point is found in igneous fissured aquifer in this segment in this segment the dominate process of groundwater seawater interaction is seawater intrusion caused by groundwater over exploitation with small radium input by sgd in the third segment marked in light green the rock of aquifers comprises alluvial and diluvial sediments like sand and gravel the salinity of groundwater is generally low although the radium activity of groundwater is at medium to low level the activities with the highest values in coastal seawater in the bohai sea be found we can infer a qualitative conclusion from this phenomenon that sgd is highest and ra desorption is most intensive in this segment along the whole shoreline in the fourth segment marked in pink the rock of aquifers is composed of sandstone shale and carbonate and groundwater is freshwater the radium activities level of groundwater in these aquifers is the lowest among all aquifers which means that the general activities values of western part is lower than that of eastern part a consistent decreasing trend of 223 224 228ra can be identified from coastal to the central area indicating that the sgd and river input is the dominating radium sources in seawater the decreasing rates of ra activities show a difference with the order of 224ra 223ra 228ra the reason is that the short lived radium isotopes would experience more rapid decay process than that of the long lived isotopes the decay process is the key sink factor for 223 224ra while the dilution process is the dominate factor of 228ra activity decreasing radium isotopes in central seawater mainly come from diluted sgd and because of radioactivity decay with time the lowest activity levels in the bohai sea area were observed in the central waters 4 3 2 radium isotopes vertical distribution and its implication during the two sampling cruises in may spring and november autumn 2014 22 sets and 26 sets of data of 223ra 224ra and 228ra were obtained from surface and bottom respectively and the sampling sites covers most of the bohai area a number of paired t test between 223ra 224ra 228ra activities in surface and bottom water were performed to analyze their respective differences the analysis results are shown in table 3 the different significance values of data pair of the 223ra 224ra 228ra surface bottom are 0 988 0 843 and 0 217 in spring respectively and 0 682 0 984 and 0 498 in autumn respectively all the significance values were far greater than 0 05 and hence indicating no significant difference in radium activities between surface water and bottom water in bohai no matter in spring or autumn this phenomenon shows that the vertical mixing effect of seawater in the bohai is not significant and it is unlikely that the enrichments were resulted from deep physical or biological disturbance of the seabed as a result the sources of radium in the surface seawater should come mainly from the horizontal diffusion of radium from coastal seawater the decay and alpha recoil of parent nuclides retain in seawater in the long time run the sources of radium was recharged by inland groundwater and rivers 4 3 3 seasonal effect the total radium mass input of sgd during rainy season could be estimated from the seasonal variation of the radium activity in the bohai area more than seventy percent annual precipitation falls in summer time the average activities of 223ra 224ra and 228ra of the bohai seawater in spring were 4 90 0 52 dpm 100l 107 69 1 58 dpm 100l 91 74 1 99 dpm 100l respectively while the average activities of 223ra 224ra and 228ra in autumn were 5 36 0 65 dpm 100l 115 17 1 71 dpm 100l 95 49 2 14 dpm 100l respectively this result demonstrates a higher radium activity in autumn than that in spring which in turn reflects a large mass of radium input during rainy season from may to november for the case of 228ra quantitative calculations for three subjectively divided regions were performed fig 4 and table 4 employing this map and the bohai submarine contour information from http topex ucsd edu cgi bin get data cgi and using weighted average method the total volume of seawater in the bohai sea is calculated as 14 5 1011 m3 and the volume of seawater in regionⅰ regionⅱ region ⅲ were 7 56 1011 2 11 1011 4 83 1011 m3 respectively 228ra activities in the three parts of study area in spring and autumn were all presented in table 4 5 estimation of submarine groundwater discharge flux 5 1 assumption and calculation equation during the exploration of sgd flux in bohai sea we only estimate sgd in the period of rainy season from may to november in this paper in section 4 3 3 we acquired that the radium in autumn had a relatively higher concentration than that in spring we assumed that this increment was added by sgd and river input during the rainy season further on we assumed that the desorption effects from sediments and suspended particles in the ocean were considered same in different seasons as well as the interaction of seawater under the condition assumed above the source terms of ra activities would include river input and sgd and the sink term only referred to self decay then the specific formula could be expressed as below 1 f s w f s g d f r w f d where f s w represents the increased radium inventory of seawater f s g d is radium flux of sgd f r w is radium flux of river water f d is the radium decay loss 5 2 radium net increment of seawater considering suitability of time scale 228ra was chosen as the tracer to estimate the radium increment the volume of seawater of each part v i and their 228ra activities increment 228 r a s w i had been calculated in section 4 3 3 then the radium inventory of seawater f s w in calculation period 192 days from may to november can be calculated by 2 f s w v i r 228 a s w i then f s w in regionⅰ ⅱand ⅲ can be calculated and the summed results are presented in table 4 which are 4 65 1013 1 04 1013 and 2 71 1013dpm respectively 5 3 radium contribution from the rivers the radium inventory of river water in the three regions during rainy season can be calculated by 3 f r w q r r 228 a r w where q r is the input volume from river to each region 228 r a r w is the average activity of 228ra in river water we have obtained the discharge data of main rivers in the three regions and calculated the cumulative discharge volume of each region from may to november 2014 respectively see table 4 for rivers with no samples the corresponding radium activities were substituted by that of the largest river in the corresponding region data from peterson et al 2008 and this study and then the radium input from rivers in each region were calculated and summarized in table 4 5 4 the sinks of radium the loss amounts by decay f d can be calculated by 4 f d v i r 228 a s w s p r i n g 1 e λt where v i is the seawater volume of each region in the bohai sea 228 r a s w s p r i n g is the 228ra activity in seawater of each region in spring λ is the decay constant of 228ra which is 3 33 10 4 day 1 t is the period of calculation which is 192d the calculated results are shown in table 4 5 5 sgd flux estimated based on the balance model the weighted average activities of 228ra in groundwater in regionⅰand regionⅱwere calculated to be 278 21dpm 100l and 362 44dpm 100l respectively the input of sgd f s g d is obtained from equation 1 and the results are shown in table 5 6 conclusions radium isotopes 223ra 224ra and 228ra have been used to study the distribution of radium and the relevant sgd flux in the bohai sea samples of different water bodies including the coastal groundwater offshore seawater central seawater and river water were collected during a 4 year period sampling campaign the radium activities were measured by the radecc and the distributions of ra isotopes in the bohai sea and its coastal zone were explored comprehensively main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the activities of 223ra 224ra and 228ra showed significant difference in different water bodies with an order of groundwater coastal seawater river water central seawater 2 in the bohai surrounding area geological lithology and human activities have influenced the radium activities in groundwater significantly the content of th and u in aquifers matrix determine ra activity of groundwater radium activity in groundwater with an order of igneous rock metamorphic rock sedimentary rock shale sandstone limestone quaternary unconsolidated rock oil exploitations in dagang area of the bohai bay have severely polluted coastal groundwater and enhanced the concentration of radium which could also be delivered into surface water 3 the ra isotopes activities of offshore waters were mainly controlled by activities of their respective onshore groundwater sgd flux rates mixing processes and geochemical environment salinity the relative level of radium ra isotope activity of coastal groundwater and nearshore seawater is determined by the interaction between groundwater and seawater 4 the activities of 223 224 228ra exhibited seasonal effectiveness based on the seasonal effects on radium supplement and the 228ra mass balance model the sgd fluxes during rainy season were estimated to be 1 43 108 m3 d 3 73 10 3 m3 m2 d in regionⅰ the liaodong bay and 2 84 107 1 76 10 3 m3 m2 d in region ⅱ the bohai bay liaodong bay in the north discharged more groundwater than the bohai bay in the west this is because coastal aquifers of liaodong bay have favorable hydrogeological conditions and higher permeability acknowledgements this study was supported by a grant from the national

12229,in order to characterize the radium distribution and submarine groundwater discharge sgd in the bohai sea area the three isotopes 223ra 224ra and 228ra in different water bodies were measured in a 4 year period with the radium delayed coincidence counting radecc system the results indicated that radium activities take an order of groundwater coastal seawater river water central seawater the radium activities of groundwater were controlled by the lithology human activities and salinity groundwater in aquifers with higher content of th and u like igneous and metamorphic has higher radium activities high salinity and oil exploitation which leads to groundwater contamination can also cause the higher radium activities the radium isotopes of offshore waters were controlled by their respective onshore groundwater and sgd flux rates the relative level of radium ra isotope activity of coastal groundwater and nearshore seawater is determined by the interaction between groundwater and seawater it is concluded that smaller radium mass transport from bottom sediments and the majority radium were supplied from landward groundwater from horizontal and vertical distribution of ra isotope the seasonal investigation showed that the seawater radium activities of 223ra 224ra and 228ra in autumn were higher than that in spring based on the seasonal variation of radium activities and the mass balance of radium sgd of the bohai sea during rainy season were calculated to be 1 43 108 m3 d 3 73 10 3 m3 m2 d in northern region and 2 84 107 1 76 10 3 m3 m2 d in western region by 228ra graphical abstract image 1 keywords the bohai sea radium isotope submarine groundwater discharge geological lithology seasonal variation 1 introduction natural radium isotopes have been widely used as a tracer for estimating groundwater flow into coastal surface water bodies in addition to being orders of magnitude more enriched in groundwater relative to seawater there are four isotopes of ra 224ra t1 2 3 66 d 223ra t1 2 11 4 d 228ra t1 2 5 75 yr 226ra t1 2 1600 yr with a wide range of half lives that makes them useful for studying processes that cover a wide span of time scales peterson et al 2008 moore et al 2006 webster et al 1995 in general ra isotopes are tightly bound to particle surfaces in freshwater but during the processes of mixing into seawater particle bound ra will be released to the aqueous phase as a result of the increasing ionic strength due to this effect the activities of ra isotopes in seawater are 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in freshwater moore 1996 wang et al 2014 moore et al 1995 based on the different activities of ra isotopes the different freshwater or salty water endmembers can be distinguished and the riverine plumes the ocean boundary inputs the submarine groundwater discharge sgd the residence time of waters as well as the estuary ocean mixing processes can also be indicated yang et al 2002 rama and moore 1996 moore 1999 2007 2008 moore and krest 2004 charette et al 2015 particularly the sgd flux can be quantified based on the radium activities over a large spatial scale which is essential for estimating the transport of not only ra isotopes but also nutrients from groundwater to estuary or sea moore 1996 2007 charette et al 2001 garcia solsona et al 2008 liu et al 2015 the radium age technique is also applied to flushing calculations in river which is dominated by shallow estuaries in addition to tracing water exchange in the bay area dulaiova and burnett 2008 however these studies were often limited by a poor understanding of the distribution of these isotopes in coastal groundwater the processes controlling these distributions and a lack of high resolution time series sampling of tracer activities in surface waters ra activity in groundwater can vary over many orders of magnitude due to geochemical heterogeneity including the abundance of parent isotopes in sediments pore water salinity redox conditions and other factors such as ph temperature and organic matter content michael et al 2011 in this paper we attempt to partly overcome these earlier limitations by mapping the distribution of radium isotopes through rich data in bohai area including both sea area and coastal zone water shortage and water quality are pressing issues on the bohai bay rim area where population growth and economic development are occurring rapidly and are expected to keep increasing in the future numerous studies cole et al 2006 bowen et al 2007 have shown that urbanization agriculture and dense human populations are associated with higher nutrient concentrations in groundwater because sgd is recognized as a pathway by which terrestrial nutrients enter the coastal ocean in this area characterizing sgd fluxes is a necessity to understand and maintain the mechanism governing the health of bohai ecology and environment radium isotope tracing has long been used in investigating the sgd of the bohai sea area for example chen and zhang 1989 studied the 226ra contents in sediments of chinese coast including the bohai sea and by comparing the radium activities between water and sediment they concluded that 226ra in nearshore shallow areas mainly comes from terrigenous sediments while the decay of 230th is the main source of 226ra in deep sea peterson et al 2008 used natural radium isotopes 223ra 224ra 226ra 228ra and other geochemical tracers to determine the transport rates in the yellow river bohai sea mixing zone by examining the activity ratio distribution of radium isotopes and their results have improved the knowledge of nutrient input to the open bohai sea the sgd fluxes in the yellow river estuary was quantified by xu et al 2013 through a 226ra mass balance model and the estimated sgd flux was 1 3 109 m3 d with a range of 2 8 108 3 0 109 m3 d even the minimum sgd value was about 3 times higher than the yellow river discharge tang et al 2015 studied the activities of 223ra and 224ra in two different areas of the bohai bay and explored their influencing factors it was found that the geochemical environment coastal land use patterns and the type of water are all the factors constrain the radium activities and the less developed qikou area has higher 223ra and 224ra activities than the highly developed tanggu area liu et al 2015 analyzed the distributions of two short lived isotopes 223ra and 224ra in the bohai bay and found that the activities of these short lived ra decreased exponentially with increasing offshore distance in a study of groundwater seawater interaction in the bohai bay yi et al 2016 used a three dimensional model to simulate the flow and transport process of a surficial saline aquifer seawater exchange in the bohai bay and estimate the rates of sgd and seawater intrusion swi and it was found that the estimated rates have relatively large temporal variations along with the sea level elevation fluctuations recently liu et al 2017 used the 226ra and 228ra mass balance model to estimate the fluxes of sgd and the associated dissolved inorganic nutrients into the bohai sea and they firstly pay attention on the whole bohai sea area and concluded that the sgd flux was about 2 0 1 3 1011 m3 yr in which the rsgd plays a major role these previous studies have made great breakthroughs in the hydrodynamic function nutrient inputs submarine groundwater discharge etc in the bohai sea using radium as a tracer however most studies focused on small portions of the bohai sea and not the whole sea area though liu et al 2017 took the whole bohai sea as the study area the study focused mainly on the analysis and calculation of sgd and nutrient fluxes by using the long half life isotopes 226ra and 228ra in order to better study the hydrodynamic effect of the bohai sea and the influence factors of radium activities in different types of water it s necessary to make a comprehensive analysis of the terrestrial groundwater river water and seawater in the whole bohai sea area as well as the sgd fluxes in the past years we carried out multiple radium isotopes sampling campaigns in the whole bohai sea area except for yellow river estuary including groundwater river water nearshore and offshore seawater the objectives of this article are 1 to elucidate the ra isotopes distribution characteristics of the whole bohai sea area through systematic analysis of these data 2 to explore their forming environment and major influence factors and 3 to present a new sgd estimation method based on seasonal difference of seawater radium isotopes activities 2 geologic setting the bohai sea which is located in north china as a part of the west pacific ocean is enclosed by liaodong and shandong peninsulas and is connected to the yellow sea by the bohai strait hu et al 2009 it is a semi enclosed continental sea and is mainly composed of five parts liaodong bay in the north bohai bay in the west laizhou bay in the south shallow bohai central basin and bohai strait in the east the bohai sea has a total area of 77 000 km2 a coastline of 3800 km an average water depth of 18 m and the maximum depth of 85 m sündermann and feng 2004 the areas with a depth of less than 30 m account for 93 5 of the total area and the other 6 5 which have a depth of above 30 m are mainly distributed around the bohai strait feng et al 2007 the study area in this paper is the whole bohai sea area with the longitude and latitude scopes of 117 30 122 40 e and 37 10 41 00 n respectively fig 1 influenced by the continental mass of the east asia continent and the pacific ocean the bohai sea has formed a unique climate feature dry winter characteristic of continental climate and rainy and less windy summer and autumn characteristic of southeast monsoon climate feng et al 2007 the average annual precipitation of the area is approximately 560 916 mm yr which is mainly concentrated in summer li et al 2006 affected by the land the bohai sea also has the characteristics of low temperature and low salt content its average temperature is about 12 c with a maximum of 25 c in july and a minimum of 4 c in january liu et al 2003 its annual average salinity is 30 with a higher salinity of 31 from the eastern part to the bohai strait and a lower salinity of around 26 in the neritic area the vertical distribution of salinity in the bohai sea is similar to its temperature distribution which is homogeneous in winter and exists with pycnocline in summer feng et al 2007 there are 36 rivers that flow into the bohai sea including the yellow river the hai river the luan river and the liao river which collectively contribute 5 98 1010 m3 discharge flux to the bohai sea each year among them the yellow river has the largest runoff of 3 22 1010 m3 yr approximately half of the total flux jin et al 2016 feng et al 2007 in the surrounding area of bohai sea the strata formed in the archeozoic proterozoic paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic era are all distributed and these strata consist of metamorphic rock igneous rock and sedimentary rock according to the difference of water storage condition of aquifers and characteristics of aqueous medium coastal aquifer systems of the bohai sea can be divided into six types marine mixed clay and fine sand pore aquifer alluvial and diluvial mixed clay and sand and gravel pore aquifer alluvial and diluvial mixed sand and gravel pore aquifer igneous and metamorphic rocks fissured aquifer sand and shale pore aquifer and karst aquifer these aquifers received adjacent upstream aquifers and rainfall recharge and most of the groundwater has been evaporated exploited or discharged into the bohai sea the submarine surface sediments in the study area present four types soft clay mud fine silt mud coarse silt and fine sand among which clay mud is the most important type and is mainly distributed in the bohai bay and bohai central basin these distribution patterns are mainly influenced by tidal currents in the bohai sea which are the major sources of kinetic energy hu et al 2009 zhenxia et al 1998 3 sampling and measurement the surface and deep water samples in the bohai sea the groundwater and river water samples in the coastal area were collected during several sampling campaigns from august 2013 to october 2017 particularly the samples in the bohai central basin were collected by the dong fang hong 2 research ship during the yellow sea bohai sea spring and autumn cruises all samples were stored in 25l plastic bottles with total volume of 50l for seawater and river water samples and total volume of 25l for groundwater samples then all samples were delivered to the laboratory for measurement within 24 h except for the central basin water samples which were measured in the shipboard laboratory 223ra and 224ra were measured by the radecc following moore and arnold s recommendations 1996 samples were counted again 6 months after collection to determine the initial 228ra activity moore 2008 detector efficiencies were determined using 232th and 227ac standards in secular equilibrium with their daughters analytical counting uncertainties were estimated by standard rules of error propagation as described in cheng et al 2015 224ra and 228ra are around 7 5 223ra is about 10 in this paper we analyzed in total 184 samples sample location were shown in fig 1 including 73 groundwater samples 58 coastal seawater samples 35 bohai central basin water samples 4 yellow sea water samples and 14 river water samples from duliujian river and hai river 4 results and discussion 4 1 radium activities in different water bodies the activity distribution of radium isotopes are presented in fig 2 the maximum minimum and average values in different water bodies are summarized in table 1 the results indicated that there is obvious difference among them the average activity of 223ra in groundwater coastal seawater central seawater and river water were 12 86 7 42 0 69 and 1 26 dpm 100l respectively the average activity of 224ra in groundwater coastal seawater central seawater and river water were 334 60 162 59 11 21 and 31 12 dpm 100l respectively the average activity of 228ra in groundwater coastal seawater central seawater and river water were 251 43 113 79 51 78 and 44 94 dpm 100l respectively these results clearly indicated that 223ra 224ra and 228ra in different water bodies exhibit nearly the same characteristics with an order of groundwater coastal seawater river water central seawater in fig 3 a comparison of radium isotopes activity ratios in all kinds of water is presented isotopes activity ratio ar generally reflect the mixing process between their sources and water bodies there were remarkable differences among ar of different water what we can draw conclusion from fig 3 is that significant positive correlations were observed between 224ra to 228ra and 224ra to 223ra in groundwater seawater and river water samples and each group is located in a somewhat distinct area of plot this implies that the sources of radium isotopes have distinct processes across groups and did not differ significantly within each group as components of the same 232 th day series 224ra and 228ra were the most closely related the sources of 228ra in groundwater mainly include recoil from 232th in minerals and decay of adsorbed 232th whereas the main source of 224ra is the alpha recoil by parent isotopes when a conservative radioactive equilibrium system is achieved the value of 224ra 228ra has been proved to be unity i e 1 fig 3 also shows that the average 224ra 228ra in groundwater and river were close to unity indicating that in the groundwater system and river water all 224ra nearly attain to a radioactive equilibrium with 228ra this is particularly true in river water as no additional 224ra was resupplied from some solid source containing uranium and thorium the average ar is less than 1 the average 224ra 228r ar of coastal water is 5 63 and much higher than 1 this is the result of the alpha particle recoil process whereby short lived isotopes accumulate to their equilibrium values faster than longer lived isotopes central seawater in contrast has a lowest average 224ra 228r ar value 0 42 in the scope of the study area this situation occurs because there were no excess desorption sources of 224ra and the input of its parent elements in central sea furthermore 224ra decays faster than 228ra 224ra and 223ra come from 232th and 235u radioactive decay series respectively 224ra 223ra is governed by the lithology through the water transport and its deviation from secular equilibrium depends on the rate of water rock processes the age of the groundwater and mixing processes with other water for current study the 224ra 223ra ar 24 32 in groundwater is much higher than the secular value of 18 18 iaea 2014 hu and yu 2002 indicating that the dominate host aquifer rocks of study area mainly consists of crystalline and sand rock with relatively high th u ratio 224ra 223ra of groundwater is consistent with the natural abundances of aquifers lithology once groundwater discharges to coastal seawater 224ra decays more rapidly than 223ra due to its shorter half life which lead to a slight lower 224ra 223ra ratio of the coastal seawater in our case the average 224ra 223ra ratio is equal to 19 68 and slightly higher than 18 18 which is determined by widespread formation with high th u ratio distributed in this area the central seawater has the lowest value of 224ra 223ra 11 73 the reason can be attributed to the rapid decay of 224ra compared to 223ra the significant mixing and diffusion effects and the less radium recharge 4 2 groundwater 4 2 1 geographical distribution characteristics in total 73 groundwater samples were collected in this study which is grouped into 5 categories based on the aquifers lithology and activity level table 2 and the distribution features are shown in fig 2 the groundwater radium activity level and their ratios reflect a rock type effect occurred the concentrations of these radionuclides in groundwater are mainly determined by the concentrations of u and th in the aquifer rocks it should be noted that the maximum activity values of 223ra 86 88 dpm 100l 224ra 1945 16 dpm 100l and 228ra 585 46 dpm 100l were all concentrated in igneous and metamorphic rocks fissured aquifer the salinity effect increasing radium levels with groundwater salinity is observed in west part of the study area where marine clay mixed with fine sand pore aquifer is dominant which confirms the lower concentration of radium isotopes and their parent nuclides in sand and clay iaea 2014 on the other hand since the groundwater of this aquifer has a high salinity it is logical that the groundwater has a higher radium activity level the higher average value and large variation range were observed for radium activities of groundwater radium isotopes form as daughter products during the decay of the naturally occurring elements uranium and thorium they accumulate in water via interaction of the water with solid phase materials that contain the initial source of the isotopes uranium for 226ra and 223ra thorium for 228ra and 224ra the isotopes accumulate through the processes of dissolution ion exchange and alpha particle recoil kraemer 2005 kraemer and genereux 1998 in a closed groundwater system the daughter products reach a level of radioactivity equivalent to that of the long lived head of the decay chain e g 238u for 226ra 232th for 224ra and 228ra and 235u for 223ra a condition that is known as secular equilibrium and this led to the highest activities in groundwater in this area furthermore due to the substantial differences in lithology and groundwater hydrodynamic diversity the largest variation range was observed in groundwater when water transits from a groundwater environment to surface water environment the accumulation process of radium isotopes will tend to cease but the water may retain the isotopes that already accumulated because river water has low salinity the radium adsorbed on suspended solid did not desorb into river water leading to lower activities in river water in this area by comparing the activity levels between groundwater and river water it was concluded that there was weak hydraulic connection between them 4 2 2 groundwater of oil exploitation area from fig 2 we can inferred that the first coastal section marked in orange has only one kind of aquifer lithology which is marine mixed clay and fine sand particularly the salinity of groundwater in this section area is high the distribution characteristic indicated that the activities of 223ra 224ra 228ra in the western region in the extreme west of map in fig 2 is higher than that of other places though they are under the same conditions of aquifer lithology and groundwater salinity this area is the location of a large dagang oilfield where distributed of many oil pumping sites during more than 50 years of oil exploitation activities there are great impacts on groundwater quality the shallow groundwater was generally polluted by oil exploitation liu et al 2007 according to previous studies the oil exploitation is one of the non nuclear industrial activities that result in enhancement of naturally occurring radioactive materials norm the concentrations of norm can be enhanced above natural levels in mainly two ways one is the changes of physicochemical or residues managing method which can enhance the bioavailability of radionuclides the other is the raw material processing during which the concentrations of norm in a product by product or residue can be enhanced iaea 2014 moreover one of the most common radioactive elements found in the oil products and by products is radium husain and sakhnini 2017 in a freshwater aquifer radium commonly co precipitates with barite celestite and ba sr so4 solid solutions during the oil treatment process through the addition of sulfate katherine et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 but in the groundwater aquifer of dagang the radium activities are even higher due to the higher salinity the activities of parent radionuclides u and th are generally low because of their low solubility in water however their decay products 223ra 224ra 228ra are often found as dissolved in the water and occurred in consequence of water rock interactions parmaksız et al 2015 table 3 shows the activity comparison of groundwater samples in oil exploration area g1 g15 and adjacent areas g16 g40 all the results indicated that human activity of oil exploitation contributes to an enhancement of radium activities in groundwater of this study area 4 3 seawater 4 3 1 geographical distribution characteristics the general geographical distribution characteristics of radium isotopes activities can be inferred from fig 2 generally radium isotopes absorbed on suspended particles in freshwater including groundwater and river water will suddenly release when they meet coastal water with higher salinity this can be explained by the first order rate constant of adsorption k1 may vary by approximately 5 orders of magnitude between freshwater and brine levels of salinity vinson 2011 if desorption is the major source of radium a peak in radium activities would be expected along the coastal shoreline but this situation hasn t occurred in bohai sea area because of complicated groundwater seawater interaction the whole coastal line can be grossly divided into four segments according to the mechanism of ra isotopes distribution the relative level of radium ra isotope activity of coastal groundwater and nearshore seawater is determined by the interaction between groundwater and seawater as is shown in fig 2 in the first segment marked in orange the rock of aquifers consists of marine sediments like clay and fine sand and groundwater in these aquifers has a higher salinity therefore the desorption of radium will be completed in aquifers before groundwater discharges into sea leading to occur higher radium activities of coastal groundwater than that of coastal seawater in the second segment marked in blue the rock of aquifers consists of alluvial and diluvial sediments like clay sand and gravel and igneous and metamorphic rocks the highest radium activity point is found in igneous fissured aquifer in this segment in this segment the dominate process of groundwater seawater interaction is seawater intrusion caused by groundwater over exploitation with small radium input by sgd in the third segment marked in light green the rock of aquifers comprises alluvial and diluvial sediments like sand and gravel the salinity of groundwater is generally low although the radium activity of groundwater is at medium to low level the activities with the highest values in coastal seawater in the bohai sea be found we can infer a qualitative conclusion from this phenomenon that sgd is highest and ra desorption is most intensive in this segment along the whole shoreline in the fourth segment marked in pink the rock of aquifers is composed of sandstone shale and carbonate and groundwater is freshwater the radium activities level of groundwater in these aquifers is the lowest among all aquifers which means that the general activities values of western part is lower than that of eastern part a consistent decreasing trend of 223 224 228ra can be identified from coastal to the central area indicating that the sgd and river input is the dominating radium sources in seawater the decreasing rates of ra activities show a difference with the order of 224ra 223ra 228ra the reason is that the short lived radium isotopes would experience more rapid decay process than that of the long lived isotopes the decay process is the key sink factor for 223 224ra while the dilution process is the dominate factor of 228ra activity decreasing radium isotopes in central seawater mainly come from diluted sgd and because of radioactivity decay with time the lowest activity levels in the bohai sea area were observed in the central waters 4 3 2 radium isotopes vertical distribution and its implication during the two sampling cruises in may spring and november autumn 2014 22 sets and 26 sets of data of 223ra 224ra and 228ra were obtained from surface and bottom respectively and the sampling sites covers most of the bohai area a number of paired t test between 223ra 224ra 228ra activities in surface and bottom water were performed to analyze their respective differences the analysis results are shown in table 3 the different significance values of data pair of the 223ra 224ra 228ra surface bottom are 0 988 0 843 and 0 217 in spring respectively and 0 682 0 984 and 0 498 in autumn respectively all the significance values were far greater than 0 05 and hence indicating no significant difference in radium activities between surface water and bottom water in bohai no matter in spring or autumn this phenomenon shows that the vertical mixing effect of seawater in the bohai is not significant and it is unlikely that the enrichments were resulted from deep physical or biological disturbance of the seabed as a result the sources of radium in the surface seawater should come mainly from the horizontal diffusion of radium from coastal seawater the decay and alpha recoil of parent nuclides retain in seawater in the long time run the sources of radium was recharged by inland groundwater and rivers 4 3 3 seasonal effect the total radium mass input of sgd during rainy season could be estimated from the seasonal variation of the radium activity in the bohai area more than seventy percent annual precipitation falls in summer time the average activities of 223ra 224ra and 228ra of the bohai seawater in spring were 4 90 0 52 dpm 100l 107 69 1 58 dpm 100l 91 74 1 99 dpm 100l respectively while the average activities of 223ra 224ra and 228ra in autumn were 5 36 0 65 dpm 100l 115 17 1 71 dpm 100l 95 49 2 14 dpm 100l respectively this result demonstrates a higher radium activity in autumn than that in spring which in turn reflects a large mass of radium input during rainy season from may to november for the case of 228ra quantitative calculations for three subjectively divided regions were performed fig 4 and table 4 employing this map and the bohai submarine contour information from http topex ucsd edu cgi bin get data cgi and using weighted average method the total volume of seawater in the bohai sea is calculated as 14 5 1011 m3 and the volume of seawater in regionⅰ regionⅱ region ⅲ were 7 56 1011 2 11 1011 4 83 1011 m3 respectively 228ra activities in the three parts of study area in spring and autumn were all presented in table 4 5 estimation of submarine groundwater discharge flux 5 1 assumption and calculation equation during the exploration of sgd flux in bohai sea we only estimate sgd in the period of rainy season from may to november in this paper in section 4 3 3 we acquired that the radium in autumn had a relatively higher concentration than that in spring we assumed that this increment was added by sgd and river input during the rainy season further on we assumed that the desorption effects from sediments and suspended particles in the ocean were considered same in different seasons as well as the interaction of seawater under the condition assumed above the source terms of ra activities would include river input and sgd and the sink term only referred to self decay then the specific formula could be expressed as below 1 f s w f s g d f r w f d where f s w represents the increased radium inventory of seawater f s g d is radium flux of sgd f r w is radium flux of river water f d is the radium decay loss 5 2 radium net increment of seawater considering suitability of time scale 228ra was chosen as the tracer to estimate the radium increment the volume of seawater of each part v i and their 228ra activities increment 228 r a s w i had been calculated in section 4 3 3 then the radium inventory of seawater f s w in calculation period 192 days from may to november can be calculated by 2 f s w v i r 228 a s w i then f s w in regionⅰ ⅱand ⅲ can be calculated and the summed results are presented in table 4 which are 4 65 1013 1 04 1013 and 2 71 1013dpm respectively 5 3 radium contribution from the rivers the radium inventory of river water in the three regions during rainy season can be calculated by 3 f r w q r r 228 a r w where q r is the input volume from river to each region 228 r a r w is the average activity of 228ra in river water we have obtained the discharge data of main rivers in the three regions and calculated the cumulative discharge volume of each region from may to november 2014 respectively see table 4 for rivers with no samples the corresponding radium activities were substituted by that of the largest river in the corresponding region data from peterson et al 2008 and this study and then the radium input from rivers in each region were calculated and summarized in table 4 5 4 the sinks of radium the loss amounts by decay f d can be calculated by 4 f d v i r 228 a s w s p r i n g 1 e λt where v i is the seawater volume of each region in the bohai sea 228 r a s w s p r i n g is the 228ra activity in seawater of each region in spring λ is the decay constant of 228ra which is 3 33 10 4 day 1 t is the period of calculation which is 192d the calculated results are shown in table 4 5 5 sgd flux estimated based on the balance model the weighted average activities of 228ra in groundwater in regionⅰand regionⅱwere calculated to be 278 21dpm 100l and 362 44dpm 100l respectively the input of sgd f s g d is obtained from equation 1 and the results are shown in table 5 6 conclusions radium isotopes 223ra 224ra and 228ra have been used to study the distribution of radium and the relevant sgd flux in the bohai sea samples of different water bodies including the coastal groundwater offshore seawater central seawater and river water were collected during a 4 year period sampling campaign the radium activities were measured by the radecc and the distributions of ra isotopes in the bohai sea and its coastal zone were explored comprehensively main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the activities of 223ra 224ra and 228ra showed significant difference in different water bodies with an order of groundwater coastal seawater river water central seawater 2 in the bohai surrounding area geological lithology and human activities have influenced the radium activities in groundwater significantly the content of th and u in aquifers matrix determine ra activity of groundwater radium activity in groundwater with an order of igneous rock metamorphic rock sedimentary rock shale sandstone limestone quaternary unconsolidated rock oil exploitations in dagang area of the bohai bay have severely polluted coastal groundwater and enhanced the concentration of radium which could also be delivered into surface water 3 the ra isotopes activities of offshore waters were mainly controlled by activities of their respective onshore groundwater sgd flux rates mixing processes and geochemical environment salinity the relative level of radium ra isotope activity of coastal groundwater and nearshore seawater is determined by the interaction between groundwater and seawater 4 the activities of 223 224 228ra exhibited seasonal effectiveness based on the seasonal effects on radium supplement and the 228ra mass balance model the sgd fluxes during rainy season were estimated to be 1 43 108 m3 d 3 73 10 3 m3 m2 d in regionⅰ the liaodong bay and 2 84 107 1 76 10 3 m3 m2 d in region ⅱ the bohai bay liaodong bay in the north discharged more groundwater than the bohai bay in the west this is because coastal aquifers of liaodong bay have favorable hydrogeological conditions and higher permeability acknowledgements this study was supported by a grant from the national
