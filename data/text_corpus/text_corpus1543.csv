7715,study region yangtze river basin china study focus as agricultural drought originates from meteorological drought exploring the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought is an important step in providing early warning of agricultural drought in this study standardized precipitation index spi and improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index ismapi were adopted to indicate meteorological and agricultural droughts respectively the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was identified and probabilistic linkages between the two types of drought were investigated using the copula function and bayesian network new hydrological insights the average propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin yrb is 48 d the propagation times in the summer and autumn are shorter than those in the spring and winter the occurrence probability of more serious agricultural drought gradually increases with meteorological drought intensity agricultural and meteorological drought events were matched using the proposed drought event matching method in the yrb approximately 72 4 of meteorological drought events may translate into agricultural drought events generally an agricultural drought event that has the same drought category as that of the given meteorological drought event is most likely to occur regional differences in drought propagation time and occurrence probability of agricultural drought may be related to variations in climatic conditions across regions graphical abstract ga1

of the most recurrent and destructive types of natural disasters drought often has serious socio economic agricultural and environmental impacts on affected regions apurv et al 2017 bhardwaj et al 2020 gevaert et al 2018 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2019b typically drought can be classified as meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic drought apurv and cai 2020 fang et al 2020 wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2021a among these four types agricultural drought has a direct impact on crop growth and may further lead to a decline in grain production therefore agricultural drought poses challenges to food security promoting the need for research to improve the early warning capabilities for agricultural drought generally a strong relationship exists between meteorological drought and other drought types whereby meteorological drought is often regarded as a precursor to other drought types fang et al 2020 li et al 2020 sattar et al 2019 xu et al 2019a for example long term precipitation deficits meteorological drought may cause a reduction in soil moisture and trigger agricultural drought generally it is relatively easy to assess meteorological drought considering the readily available precipitation data worldwide therefore an accurate understanding of how meteorological drought propagates to agricultural drought and probabilistic linkages between these two types of drought are vital for the proactive warning of agricultural drought to mitigate its impact the transition from meteorological drought to other drought types is known as drought propagation bhardwaj et al 2020 ding et al 2021 eltahir and yeh 1999 xu et al 2021a zhou et al 2021b recently many studies have evaluated the propagation time from meteorological drought to other drought types the correlation analysis method is the method most commonly used to obtain drought propagation time which determines the correlation coefficients between the agricultural hydrological drought index at a given timescale generally monthly scale and the meteorological drought index at different timescales generally n month standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 with n 1 2 etc n is precipitation accumulation period the timescale of spi corresponding to the highest correlation coefficient is the drought propagation time barker et al 2016 bevacqua et al 2021 gevaert et al 2018 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2019a as the drought indices were calculated on a monthly scale the determined drought propagation time also had a monthly resolution for example han et al 2019 concluded that the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought in the pearl river basin was 8 months xu et al 2019a pointed out that the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in northern china varies from 1 to 12 months with seasonal variation xu et al 2021a pointed out that the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought is generally no more than 3 months in humid regions whereas it ranges from 1 to 8 months in the arid and semi arid regions of china however spatiotemporal variations in drought propagation time may be insufficient for detection at monthly resolution therefore more attempts are needed to determine the drought propagation time at a finer temporal resolution by introducing sub monthly drought indices to accurately represent the spatiotemporal differences in drought propagation time fang et al 2020 ho et al 2021 in addition to propagation time changes in drought characteristics and their relationships during drought propagation have attracted increasing attention guo et al 2020 for example wu et al 2017 established a non linear relationship between the hydrological and meteorological drought event characteristics li et al 2018 built a relationship between agricultural hydrological drought severity and its driving factors e g meteorological drought severity and daily average precipitation 10 days before agricultural hydrological drought using multiple regression analysis zhou et al 2021a found that the performances of the three parameter power function and linear function were satisfactory in characterizing the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought event characteristics however only a few studies exist regarding the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought owing to the limitations of soil moisture datasets in the evaluation of agricultural drought meanwhile most of these studies were conducted at the catchment scale which is not sufficient to capture the spatial variations in the linkages of drought characteristics during drought propagation barker et al 2016 recently grid based soil moisture data with finer spatiotemporal resolution simulated by hydrological models have been widely used to evaluate the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought gevaert et al 2018 xu et al 2021a zhu et al 2021 this aids in identifying the finer spatial variations in the linkages of drought characteristics during drought propagation however the main question regarding the use of grid based soil moisture to analyze the variation in drought characteristics during drought propagation is how to match meteorological drought events with agricultural drought events to the best of our knowledge among the numerous research efforts on drought propagation only guo et al 2020 proposed a drought event matching approach to match meteorological and hydrological drought events however guo et al 2020 did not consider the strong relationships between the hydrological and meteorological drought event characteristics the present study attempts to bridge this gap by proposing a new drought event matching method to analyze the variations in drought event characteristics during drought propagation at the grid scale moreover there is another question that has not been answered well in previous studies when analyzing the relationships of drought characteristics between meteorological and other drought types during drought propagation few studies have attempted to investigate the probabilistic linkages of drought event characteristics between meteorological drought and other drought types currently most studies have focused on creating and understanding the relationships between agricultural hydrological and meteorological drought characteristics using simple regression models li et al 2018 wu et al 2017 yu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021a these relationships can also be described by probabilistic statistical methods because meteorological drought implies probability information regarding the occurrence of subsequent agricultural hydrological drought sattar and kim 2018 sattar et al 2019 for example zhu et al 2019 found that the probabilistic method performed better than linear exponential and power functions in describing the nonlinear relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts therefore more effort should be made to demonstrate the feasibility of probabilistic statistical approaches to determine the probabilistic linkages between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics which can provide indispensable risk information for drought managers in this study using the yangtze river basin yrb as a case study spi and improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index ismapi xu et al 2021b were selected to represent meteorological and agricultural drought respectively the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought was detected using the daily updated spi and ismapi at a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 a copula based probabilistic framework is proposed to estimate the occurrence probability of agricultural drought under specific meteorological drought conditions finally a novel drought event matching method based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient was introduced to match meteorological and agricultural drought events and the probabilistic linkages between meteorological and agricultural drought event characteristics were quantified based on the proposed probabilistic framework the purposes of this study are the following 1 reveal the spatiotemporal variation of propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought at a finer temporal resolution 2 calculate the occurrence probability of agricultural drought at different levels under specific meteorological drought conditions 3 explore the probabilistic linkages between meteorological and agricultural drought event characteristics the results of this study will contribute to agricultural drought early warning and mitigate the impact of agricultural drought 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as the longest river in asia the yrb fig 1 with a length of approximately 6300 km the yrb has a drainage area of approximately 1 8 106 km2 accounting for 18 8 of china s territory the terrain of the yrb is high in the west and low in the east with complex topography that includes plateaus mountains hills basins and plains the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in the yrb is significantly uneven precipitation is concentrated mainly from may to october the yrb suffers from frequent drought and flood disasters which are influenced by the complex terrain and a changing climate we divided the yrb into four regions fig 1 according to lang et al 2014 regions i and ii belong to the upper reaches of the yrb and regions iii and iv correspond to the middle and lower reaches of the yrb 2 2 data sources and preprocessing daily precipitation and soil moisture data from 1981 to 2020 were obtained from xu et al 2022 soil moisture data were simulated using a well calibrated variable infiltration capacity vic model as evaluated by xu et al 2022 meteorological data from the china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn were interpolated into a 0 05 0 05 spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighted method and used to force the vic model more details regarding precipitation and soil moisture are available in xu et al 2022 3 methods in this study the daily updated spi and ismapi were selected to characterize meteorological and agricultural droughts respectively the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought a probability framework based on the copula function and bayesian network was used to quantify the probabilistic linkages between the two types of drought fig 2 presents the flowchart of this study 3 1 daily updated spi and ismapi spi mckee et al 1993 is one of the most commonly used drought indices because it can capture drought conditions at different time scales based only on long term precipitation records in most previous studies spi was typically calculated based on monthly precipitation and the drought propagation time also had a monthly scale to estimate the drought propagation time at a finer temporal resolution we employed the method proposed by liu et al 2018 to calculate the daily updated spi by moving the spi window from 1 month to 1 day which was also suggested by the world meteorological organization world meteorological organization 2012 we calculated spi during the period from 1981 to 2020 for precipitation accumulation periods of 30 d 40 d 350 d and 360 d and denoted n day precipitation accumulation period as spi n e g 30 d and 360 d precipitation accumulation periods denoted as spi 30 and spi 360 respectively similar to the monthly scale the procedure for the daily updated spi calculation comprises the following 3 steps first daily precipitation was aggregated at a predefined precipitation accumulation period the accumulated precipitation series for each calendar day was then independently fitted to a gamma distribution function finally the cumulative probability of precipitation was estimated based on the fitted probability distribution function and then transformed into a normally distributed variable spi is determined by this equiprobability transformation using spi 30 as an example fig 3 presents the procedure for calculating the daily updated spi ismapi proposed by xu et al 2021b was used to characterize agricultural drought the applicability of ismapi in agricultural drought monitoring was validated in the yrb by xu et al 2021b and xu et al 2023 which found that ismapi is highly reliable for agricultural drought monitoring the calculation process of ismapi is summarized as follows box cox transformation was used to transform non normally distributed soil moisture into a normally distributed soil moisture series 1 s m λ s m λ 1 λ λ 0 ln s m λ 0 where s m and s m λ are the simulated soil moisture and corresponding value estimated by the box cox transformation respectively and λ is the power exponent of the box cox transformation which was determined using the maximum likelihood algorithm the transformed soil moisture data s m λ are standardized 2 i s m a p i s m λ s m λ δ s m λ where s m λ and δ s m λ are the mean value and standard deviation of s m λ the drought categories of ismapi are the same as those of spi and are listed in table 1 3 2 drought propagation time in line with most previous studies the commonly used correlation analysis method was used to determine the drought propagation time han et al 2021 xu et al 2021a 2019a specifically the spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi with various precipitation accumulation periods and ismapi was calculated and the spi with the highest correlation with ismapi was denoted as spi p where p represents the propagation time 3 3 occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought under different levels of meteorological drought 3 3 1 copula function the copula function is a multivariable joint distribution function that forms the joint distribution of multiple random variables through their respective marginal distribution functions and has been widely employed in drought studies owing to its good flexibility and adaptability guo et al 2020 han et al 2021 xu et al 2021a in the bivariate case for random variables x and y with marginal distributions f x x and f y y there is a two dimensional copula function c that combines these two marginal distributions to form a joint distribution function f x y x y 3 f x y x y p x x y y c f x x f y y many copula families are available including the archimedean copula elliptical copula and quadratic copula among which the archimedean copula is the most widely used for analyzing bivariate joint dependence structures wu et al 2015 in this study five copulas from the archimedean family are considered comprising the ali mikhail haq clayton frank gumbel and joe copulas the root mean square error rmse between the empirical and theoretical values is adopted for the goodness of fit test of copula functions whereby the best fit copula in each grid cell should have the smallest rmse value 3 3 2 conditional probabilities calculation using a bayesian network in this section the spi p and ismapi series of each grid are regarded as two random variables as both spi and ismapi are standardized drought indices the normal distribution was used for fitting the spi p and ismapi series a significant correlation between the spi p and ismapi is a prerequisite for constructing the joint distribution of the spi p and ismapi series using the copula method therefore only grids with a spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi p and ismapi greater than 0 50 accounting for 98 9 of the total grids were selected in this study to estimate the conditional probabilities of agricultural drought conditioned on different levels of meteorological drought a bayesian network can represent the conditional dependencies between a group of variables and has been widely used in conditional probability calculations guo et al 2020 han et al 2021 sattar and kim 2018 sattar et al 2019 this study classified meteorological and agricultural drought into four categories table 1 once the marginal distributions of the two random variables and the best fit copula are determined the conditional probabilities of agricultural drought conditioned on four levels of meteorological drought can be calculated using a bayesian network the conditional probability of light moderate or severe agricultural drought under light moderate or severe meteorological drought conditions can be estimated as follows 4 p i 1 i i 2 s 1 s s 2 c f i i 2 f s s 2 c f i i 1 f s s 1 f s s 2 f s s 1 c f i i 1 f s s 2 c f i i 2 f s s 1 f s s 2 f s s 1 the conditional probability of extreme agricultural drought under light moderate or severe meteorological drought conditions can be estimated as follows 5 p i i 1 s 1 s s 2 c f i i 1 f s s 2 c f i i 1 f s s 1 f s s 2 f s s 1 the conditional probability of light moderate or severe agricultural drought under extreme meteorological drought conditions can be estimated as follows 6 p i 1 i i 2 s s 1 c f i i 2 f s s 1 c f i i 1 f s s 1 f s s 1 the conditional probability of extreme agricultural drought under extreme meteorological drought conditions can be estimated as follows 7 p i i 1 s s 1 c f i i 1 f s s 1 f s s 1 where f s and f i are the marginal cumulative distributions of spi and ismapi f s s and f i i are the cumulative probabilities of s s and i i and c f i i f s s is the joint cumulative probability of s s and i i eqs 5 and 7 can also be used to determine the conditional probability of agricultural drought under light moderate or severe and extreme meteorological drought respectively 3 4 probability relationship model between agricultural and meteorological drought characteristics 3 4 1 matching of agricultural and meteorological drought events drought duration and severity are the two most important characteristics of drought events the key step for determining the linkage between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics is to identify drought events and match the identified agricultural and meteorological drought events agricultural drought generally originates from meteorological drought therefore agricultural drought characteristics should have a good correlation with meteorological drought characteristics this relationship is also a prerequisite for constructing a joint distribution of agricultural and meteorological drought characteristics using the copula function and further estimating the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought events conditioned on a specific level of meteorological drought events with this background a novel drought event matching approach based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient is proposed to determine the meteorological drought events that correspond to the given agricultural drought event the following are the details of the major steps of the proposed drought event matching method 1 identification of drought events in this study the run theory was used to identify meteorological and agricultural drought events drought duration was defined as the number of consecutive days with the spi or ismapi value below 0 5 and drought severity is the total absolute value of spi or ismapi for the duration we used 30 d as the minimum drought duration threshold to identify drought events moreover two adjacent drought events were merged into a new drought event if their time interval was less than 5 days wu et al 2015 2 matching drought events according to guo et al 2020 for an agricultural drought event with duration d i severity s i start ts i and end te i the trigger interval t i of the corresponding meteorological drought events is from t p days before ts i ts i t p to te i if t i of two adjacent agricultural drought events are overlapped the t i of the latter agricultural drought event is from the end of the last agricultural drought event te i 1 to the end of the current drought event t i can be expressed as follows 8 t i t s i t p t e i t s i t e i 1 t p t e i 1 t e i t s i t e i 1 t p the duration d and severity s of the matched meteorological drought events can be expressed as 9 d i 1 n d i 10 s i 1 n s i j 1 m v j where d i and s i are the duration and severity of the ith meteorological drought event determined using run theory respectively and v j is the supply of wet events between two adjacent drought events the above introduction shows that an appropriate t p value must be determined for each grid before using the proposed drought event matching method to match meteorological and agricultural drought events we assumed that the t p value ranged from 0 to 360 d to obtain an appropriate t p value for each grid we examined t p value from 0 to 360 d at a time step of 5 d i e t p values of 0 d 5 d 355 d and 360 d the number of matched drought events and the significance level α1 α2 of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the agricultural and meteorological drought event severity duration were calculated for each t p value the best t p value in each grid was determined using the following three criteria 1 t p value corresponding to the minimum value of α 1 2 α 2 2 if the t p value is not unique the t p value of the target grid is determined by implementing the next criterion 2 t p value corresponding to the maximum number of matched drought events if the t p value is not unique the t p value of the target grid is determined by implementing the next criterion 3 minimum t p is selected as the t p value of the target grid on the premise that criteria 1 and 2 are simultaneously satisfied as mentioned above a significant correlation between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics is a prerequisite for constructing their joint distribution using the copula function and further estimating the probabilities of agricultural drought events conditioned on different levels of meteorological drought events therefore only grids that simultaneously satisfied the following three criteria were used to evaluate the probabilistic linkages between agricultural and meteorological drought characteristics 1 spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi p and ismapi is greater than 0 50 2 α1 and α2 are less than 0 10 and 3 there are at least 10 matched drought events these three criteria were simultaneously satisfied in approximately 94 0 of the total grids the translation rate is a key index for characterizing the sensitivity of agricultural drought to meteorological drought guo et al 2020 sattar et al 2019 the translation rate can be calculated as follows 11 t r m p m t 100 where t r is the translation rate m p is the number of matched meteorological droughts and m t is the number of meteorological droughts identified using run theory 3 4 2 marginal distribution of drought events characteristics in this section the matched drought event characteristics in section 3 4 1 are considered as random variables and fit their respective marginal distribution functions here 10 commonly used functions were used generalized extreme value distribution log normal distribution exponential distribution exponentiated weibull distribution gamma distribution right skewed gumbel distribution left skewed gumbel distribution logistic distribution normal distribution and weibull minimum extreme value distribution and the fitter package https pypi org project fitter in python was used to fit the marginal distribution of the drought characteristics the aic method in the fitter package was selected for the goodness of fit test of marginal distribution functions determining the best fit marginal distribution function for each grid 3 4 3 probabilistic linkages calculation based on a bayesian network drought events can be classified into four categories according to the cumulative probability of the drought duration or severity generally the classification boundary values of the cumulative probability between light and moderate drought moderate and severe drought and severe and extreme drought were 0 50 0 75 and 0 90 guo et al 2020 respectively the classification boundary values of the four categories of drought events were determined based on the best fit marginal distribution of the drought event characteristics moreover according to the drought event identification method introduced in section 3 4 1 we assumed that the lower limits of the drought event duration and severity were 30 d and 15 0 respectively as in section 3 3 2 once the marginal distributions of drought event characteristics and the best fit copula function are determined the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought events conditioned on four levels of meteorological drought events can be calculated using eq 12 15 the occurrence probability of light moderate or severe agricultural drought events under light moderate or severe meteorological drought events can be calculated as follows 12 p a 1 a a 2 m 1 m m 2 c f a a 2 f m m 2 c f a a 1 f m m 1 f m m 2 f m m 1 c f a a 1 f m m 2 c f a a 2 f m m 1 f m m 2 f m m 1 the occurrence probability of extreme agricultural drought events under light moderate or severe meteorological drought events can be estimated as follows 13 p a a 1 m 1 m m 2 1 0 c f a a 1 f m m 2 c f a a 1 f m m 1 f m m 2 f m m 1 the occurrence probability of light moderate or severe agricultural drought events under extreme meteorological drought events can be calculated as follows 14 p a 1 a a 2 m m 1 f a a 2 f a a 1 c f a a 2 f m m 1 1 0 f m m 1 c f a a 1 f m m 1 1 0 f m m 1 the occurrence probability of extreme agricultural drought events under extreme meteorological drought events can be calculated as follows 15 p a a 1 m m 1 1 0 f a a 1 f m m 1 c f a a 1 f m m 1 1 0 f m m 1 where f m and f a are the marginal distribution functions of the meteorological and agricultural drought event characteristics f m m and f a a are the cumulative probabilities of m m and a a respectively and c f a a f m m is the joint cumulative probability of m m and a a eqs 13 and 15 can also be used to determine the occurrence probability of agricultural drought events conditioned on light moderate or severe and extreme meteorological drought events respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 drought propagation time and its influencing factors 4 1 1 drought propagation time and its seasonal variability fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought and their corresponding spearman rank correlation coefficients in most regions accounting for 96 5 of the total grids the drought propagation time was generally within 150 d and the average propagation time in the yrb was 48 d in approximately 65 0 of the total grids the drought propagation time was 30 d and in approximately 20 5 of the total grids the drought propagation time ranged from 40 to 60 d the spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi p and ismapi ranged from 0 18 to 0 90 and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient in the yrb is 0 71 which indicates that there is a strong response relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought in the yrb in approximately 98 8 of the grids the spearman rank correlation coefficient was equal to or greater than 0 50 as shown in table 2 the longest propagation time and weakest response relationship were found in region i regions ii iii and iv had shorter propagation times and stronger response relationships than region i specifically only 58 5 of the total grids had a drought propagation time of no more than 60 d and the average propagation time in region i was 79 d however the average drought propagation times were 40 37 and 40 d and the percentages of grids with drought propagation times of no more than 60 d were approximately 93 6 93 7 and 93 4 in regions ii iii and iv respectively the average spearman rank correlation coefficients between the spi p and ismapi in the four sub regions were 0 65 0 73 0 73 and 0 70 respectively it is worth noting that in some grids in regions i and ii the spearman rank correlation coefficients between spi p and ismapi are relatively low and even negative which indicates that meteorological drought in these regions may not be the dominant factor causing agricultural drought a possible reason is that the temperature in these grids is very low and even negative resulting in rainfall mainly occurring in the solid phase with almost no infiltration of water that supplements the soil moisture promptly moreover snow cover reduces soil evaporation during low temperature periods and snowmelt could be an important recharge source of soil moisture during high temperature periods consequently the change in soil moisture was hardly influenced by precipitation and a negative spearman rank correlation coefficient was found in these grids furthermore the seasonal variations in drought propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yrb were analyzed as shown in fig 5 and table 2 the average propagation times in spring 64 d and winter 68 d were longer than those in summer 34 d and autumn 38 d in the yrb in spring the drought propagation times in regions i and ii were longer than those in regions iii and iv in summer the propagation time was quickly shortened with little difference between the four subregions in autumn the propagation time in the eastern areas of regions iii and iv was larger than that in regions i and ii in winter the propagation time in the middle of the yrb was shorter than that in the western and eastern areas of the yrb in regions i and ii the average drought propagation times in spring and winter were longer than those in the summer and autumn there was little difference in drought propagation time in different seasons in region iii and the drought propagation time in spring summer and autumn average was 39 34 and 40 d respectively was slightly shorter than that in winter average was 52 d in region iv the longest drought propagation time was found in winter with an average propagation time of 77 d followed by autumn with an average value of 47 d and the shortest was in spring and summer with average propagation times of 38 d and 35 d respectively as shown in fig 5 a2 d2 and table 2 there is a strong response relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought and the proportions of grids with spearman rank correlation coefficients equal to or greater than 0 50 are all above 97 5 in the four seasons the response relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought was stronger in spring than in other seasons and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient in spring was 0 78 followed by autumn and winter with average spearman rank correlation coefficients of 0 74 and 0 75 respectively the weakest response relationship was found in summer with an average spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0 71 seasonal variations in response relationships also exhibit distinct regional differences in region i the spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi p and ismapi gradually decreased from spring to winter in region ii the highest spearman rank correlation coefficient was found in spring followed by winter and the weakest was in summer in regions iii and iv the spearman rank correlation coefficients between spi p and ismapi in spring and summer were lower than those in autumn and winter 4 1 2 main factors affecting drought propagation time an increase or decrease in soil moisture is a continuous process a greater persistence of soil moisture indicates that it is insensitive to short term temperature and or precipitation anomalies and may correspond to a longer drought propagation time apurv and cai 2021 bhardwaj et al 2020 the lag correlation coefficient reflects the persistence characteristics of soil moisture a positive and larger lag correlation coefficient corresponds to a greater persistence of soil moisture xu et al 2021b therefore the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the drought propagation time and the lag correlation coefficient of soil moisture was calculated and the relationship between the persistence characteristics of soil moisture and drought propagation time was analyzed as shown in table 3 the drought propagation time and lag correlation coefficient of soil moisture have a significant positive correlation for example the spearman rank correlation coefficient between drought propagation time and lag correlation coefficient of soil moisture is 0 69 when the lag time is equal to 10 d these results indicate that in grids with a strong persistence of soil moisture the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought is long which is consistent with the results of apurv and cai 2021 and bhardwaj et al 2020 climatic factors are the main reason for the differences in soil moisture persistence and drought propagation time in different regions as demonstrated in previous studies apurv et al 2017 fang et al 2020 gevaert et al 2018 han et al 2019 wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2021a temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation are the most important meteorological factors that affect drought propagation han et al 2019 xu et al 2021a fig 6 presents the annual seasonal cycle of soil moisture a1 d1 and the precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature a2 d2 in each subregion in region i the temperatures in spring and winter were low and the average temperature for several months was negative fig 6 a2 owing to the limitations of energy evapotranspiration could almost be neglected and soil moisture showed less variation and strong persistence resulting in a longer drought propagation time in region i in spring and winter greater evapotranspiration in summer may contribute to a shorter drought propagation time wu et al 2018 specifically the temperature in region i reached the maximum and evapotranspiration was significantly higher than that in other seasons soil moisture is the major source of water for evapotranspiration with inadequate precipitation resulting in soil moisture persistence in summer being lower than that in spring and winter and the drought propagation time in summer being shorter than that in spring and summer the temperature and evapotranspiration in autumn were lower than those in summer but still higher than those in spring and winter meanwhile the soil moisture reached its maximum in early autumn in region i fig 6 a1 which may have led to a large baseflow therefore water loss caused by baseflow and evapotranspiration will cause a rapid decrease in soil moisture under conditions of insufficient precipitation which may be the reason for the lower soil moisture persistence and shorter drought propagation time in autumn the reason for the seasonal variation in drought propagation time in region ii is similar to that in region i however the temperatures in spring and winter in region ii are higher than those in region i resulting in a relatively faster hydrological cycle and weaker soil moisture persistence in region ii than in region i therefore the drought propagation time in spring and winter in region ii is significantly lower than that in region i owing to greater precipitation and higher temperatures in regions iii and iv the evapotranspiration in regions iii and iv is larger than those in regions i and ii leading to the strengthening of the hydrological cycle when there is a precipitation deficit in regions iii and iv the soil moisture falls rapidly owing to large evapotranspiration however the deficit in soil moisture caused by evapotranspiration can be quickly supplemented because high intensity precipitation events occur more frequently in regions iii and iv these factors led to dry wet transitions being more frequent and soil moisture in regions iii and iv having lower persistence therefore the drought propagation times in regions iii and iv were relatively short in regions iii and iv precipitation and evapotranspiration in spring and summer were significantly higher than those in the other seasons resulting in a relatively faster hydrological cycle and weaker soil moisture persistence in spring and summer therefore the drought propagation times in autumn and winter were longer than those in spring and summer in autumn the temperature and evapotranspiration in iv tended to decrease gradually and the precipitation was lower than that in spring and summer therefore the loss and supplement rate of soil moisture was slower than those in spring and summer and the drought propagation time in autumn was longer than those in spring and summer the climate characteristics in the western areas of region iii were similar to those in region ii whereas the climate characteristics in the eastern areas of region iii are similar to those in region iv resulting in the drought propagation time in the western areas of region iii being shorter than that in the eastern areas of region iii therefore on a regional average the drought propagation time in autumn in region iii was slightly shorter than that in region iv in winter the temperatures in regions iii and iv were the lowest during the entire year and lower temperatures lead to weaker evapotranspiration and a slower hydrological cycle which may increase the soil moisture persistence and prolong the drought propagation time xu et al 2019a as shown in fig 4 c1 and d1 the soil moisture in region iii changes little in winter indicating that precipitation infiltration is consistent with the soil water loss caused by evapotranspiration and baseflow however the soil moisture in region iv increased significantly in winter indicating that precipitation infiltration was greater than the soil water loss caused by evapotranspiration and baseflow therefore in the case of insufficient precipitation the soil moisture in region iii may decrease faster than that in region iv that is the soil moisture in region iii responds quickly to precipitation anomalies moreover region iv had higher soil moisture storage than region iii favoring a stronger resistance to precipitation deficits accumulated at shorter time scales and leading to delayed drought response this may be the reason for the shorter propagation time in region iii compared to that in region iv in winter 4 2 occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought under four meteorological drought conditions fig 7 presents the occurrence probabilities of different levels of agricultural drought under the four levels of meteorological drought conditions under light and moderate meteorological drought conditions the overall occurrence probabilities of light agricultural drought were the highest both were 0 29 on average followed by moderate agricultural drought 0 17 and 0 25 on average respectively under severe and extreme meteorological drought conditions the overall occurrence probability of moderate agricultural drought was highest both were 0 28 on average this was followed by light agricultural drought which had average occurrence probabilities under severe and extreme meteorological drought of 0 25 and 0 23 respectively the occurrence probability of severe and extreme agricultural droughts also increased with meteorological drought intensity specifically the occurrence probabilities of severe and extreme agricultural drought conditioned on light meteorological drought were 0 07 and 0 03 respectively whereas the occurrence probabilities of severe and extreme agricultural drought conditioned on extreme meteorological drought were 0 20 and 0 13 respectively the above results indicate that the occurrence probability of more serious agricultural drought gradually increases with an increase in meteorological drought intensity to distinguish the regional differences in the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought under multiple meteorological drought levels table 4 presents the regional mean occurrence probability of agricultural drought under the four levels of meteorological drought generally the occurrence probability of agricultural drought is expected to increase with an increase in meteorological drought intensity the average occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought in the yrb conditioned on light moderate severe and extreme meteorological drought were 0 57 0 74 0 81 and 0 84 respectively under the four levels of meteorological drought the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought in regions ii and iii were slightly higher than those in region iv and region i had the lowest probability of agricultural drought on average which indicates that regions ii and iii are less resilient to meteorological drought and have a higher risk of agricultural drought outbreaks the regional differences in the occurrence probability of agricultural drought under a given meteorological drought condition may be related to the various climatic characteristics of the four subregions 4 3 probabilistic relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics 4 3 1 matched agricultural and meteorological drought events the t p value in each grid was determined before matching the meteorological and agricultural drought events as shown in fig 8 in approximately 96 0 of the total grids the t p values were no greater than 240 d and the average t p value in the yrb was 67 d which demonstrates that the occurrence of an agricultural drought event lagged approximately 2 months behind that of the meteorological drought event from the results of the four subregions the t p value in region i was higher than that in region ii which in turn was higher than those in regions iii and iv and the average t p values in regions i ii iii and iv were 78 69 60 and 61 d respectively fig 9 presents the number of matched drought events and the spatial pattern of the translation rate the number of matched drought events was generally no more than 40 in approximately 99 4 of the total grids and an average of 27 drought events were matched in the yrb the number of matched drought events in the central and southern areas of region i region ii and the northwestern part of region iii is larger than those in the other regions specifically the number of matched drought events in region ii was greater than those in regions i and iii which in turn was greater than that in region iv the average numbers of matched drought events in regions i ii iii and iv were 27 28 27 and 25 respectively furthermore the sensitivity of agricultural drought events to meteorological drought events was analyzed by considering the translation rate the spatial distribution of the translation rate was consistent with the number of matched drought events fig 9 b that is the translation rate of meteorological drought events was higher in grids with more matched drought events the translation rate of meteorological drought events in the yrb is generally no less than 55 0 in approximately 83 6 of the total grids and the average translation rate is 72 4 which indicates that on average approximately 72 4 of meteorological drought events will evolve into agricultural drought events overall the translation rate gradually decreased from west to east and the average translation rates in regions i ii iii and iv were 79 5 74 4 69 5 and 64 2 respectively the main reason for the lower translation rates in regions iii and iv is that the precipitation frequencies and intensities in regions iii and iv were higher than those in regions i and ii and the deficit of soil moisture in regions iii and iv can be quickly supplemented some meteorological drought events with short duration and low intensity are less likely to cause agricultural drought events as the early recovery of rainfall may hinder the propagation of drought apurv et al 2017 4 3 2 probabilistic linkages between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics fig 10 presents the occurrence probabilities of different levels of agricultural drought duration under four levels of meteorological drought duration due to space limitation the probabilistic relationships between agricultural drought severity and meteorological drought severity are presented in fig a1 and table a1 generally an agricultural drought event that has the same drought category as that of the given meteorological drought event is most likely to occur for example the average occurrence probability of light agricultural drought duration was the largest under light meteorological drought duration under light meteorological drought duration conditions the occurrence probability of agricultural drought duration gradually decreased from light to extreme categories the average probabilities of light and moderate agricultural drought duration under moderate meteorological drought duration were 0 31 and 0 39 respectively which is larger than the average probability of severe and extreme agricultural drought duration however the occurrence probability of severe agricultural drought duration under moderate meteorological drought duration was significantly higher than that under light meteorological drought duration under severe meteorological drought duration conditions the average occurrence probabilities of moderate and severe agricultural drought duration were 0 31 and 0 34 respectively which are larger than those of light and extreme agricultural drought duration compared with the results under light and moderate meteorological drought duration the occurrence probability of light agricultural drought duration under severe meteorological drought duration was significantly decreased average probability of 0 14 while the occurrence probability of extreme agricultural drought duration increased significantly average probability of 0 19 under extreme meteorological drought duration the extreme agricultural drought duration had the highest occurrence probability average probability of 0 46 followed by severe agricultural drought duration average probability of 0 29 and light agricultural drought duration had the smallest occurrence probability average probability of 0 07 these results indicate that the probability of triggering an agricultural drought event with a longer duration is expected to increase with the meteorological drought duration table 5 presents the regional mean occurrence probability of agricultural drought events under the four levels of meteorological drought duration there is a strong relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought characteristics and the occurrence probability of an agricultural drought event is expected to increase with the meteorological drought duration the conditional probabilities of agricultural drought events conditioned on light moderate severe and extreme meteorological drought durations were 0 81 0 96 0 98 and 0 99 respectively under light meteorological drought duration conditions region ii had the highest probability of occurring agricultural drought events average probability of 0 84 followed by regions iii and iv and region i had the smallest probability of occurrence of agricultural drought events average probability of 0 79 this indicates that region ii is less resilient to meteorological drought events and has a higher risk of occurring agricultural drought events the regional differences in the probability of the occurrence of agricultural drought events may be related to the various climatic characteristics in the four subregions the average temperature in region i is lower than that in the other regions therefore with lower evapotranspiration and little soil water loss under meteorological drought events with short duration the probability of agricultural drought events occurring in region i was relatively low the temperature and evapotranspiration in region ii were higher than those in region i meanwhile the precipitation in region ii was lower than those in regions iii and iv therefore the soil moisture in region ii will decline rapidly and will be difficult to supplement effectively under meteorological drought conditions as such the occurrence probability of agricultural drought events in region ii is higher than that in region i among the four subregions regions iii and iv possess the highest temperature and evapotranspiration however regions iii and iv have frequent precipitation and more high intensity precipitation events than do regions i and ii which leads to the deficit in soil moisture caused by evapotranspiration under light meteorological drought duration being supplemented in time and some meteorological drought events with short duration are less likely to cause agricultural drought events therefore the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought events in regions iii and iv were higher than that in region i but lower than that in region ii under moderate or more severe meteorological drought conditions the occurrence probability of agricultural drought events in the four subregions is almost the same which may be because the soil moisture is significantly reduced with the increase in meteorological drought duration and cannot be supplemented during meteorological drought owing to insufficient long term precipitation this means that the risk of agricultural drought in the different regions is high 5 conclusions it is important to comprehensively understand the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought for early warning and prevention of agricultural drought in this study the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought and the probabilistic linkages between the two drought types were estimated based on the daily updated spi and ismapi taking the yrb as a case study we found that the average propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yrb was 48 d the propagation times in spring and winter were longer than those in summer and autumn the difference in soil moisture persistence among the different regions or seasons is probably one of the main reasons for spatiotemporal variations in propagation time the occurrence probability of agricultural drought gradually increased with an increase in meteorological drought intensity on average approximately 72 4 of meteorological drought events evolve into agricultural drought events generally an agricultural drought event that has the same drought category as that of the given meteorological drought event is most likely to occur overall we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of drought propagation time at a finer temporal resolution for the first time by introducing daily updated drought indices moreover we demonstrate the use of the proposed probability framework to characterize the linkages between agricultural and meteorological drought the findings of this study are helpful to better understanding the propagation mechanisms from meteorological to agricultural drought such knowledge is important for decision makers in water resource management and drought risk assessment this study mainly focused on the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yrb however the method proposed in this study is flexible and can be applied to other regions worldwide or other types of drought in future research more effort should be made to study drought propagation from a multiple drought type perspective as the occurrence time and mechanism of drought may vary with different drought types and their interaction with one another credit

7715,study region yangtze river basin china study focus as agricultural drought originates from meteorological drought exploring the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought is an important step in providing early warning of agricultural drought in this study standardized precipitation index spi and improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index ismapi were adopted to indicate meteorological and agricultural droughts respectively the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was identified and probabilistic linkages between the two types of drought were investigated using the copula function and bayesian network new hydrological insights the average propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin yrb is 48 d the propagation times in the summer and autumn are shorter than those in the spring and winter the occurrence probability of more serious agricultural drought gradually increases with meteorological drought intensity agricultural and meteorological drought events were matched using the proposed drought event matching method in the yrb approximately 72 4 of meteorological drought events may translate into agricultural drought events generally an agricultural drought event that has the same drought category as that of the given meteorological drought event is most likely to occur regional differences in drought propagation time and occurrence probability of agricultural drought may be related to variations in climatic conditions across regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords meteorological drought agricultural drought propagation time probabilistic linkage yangtze river basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as one of the most recurrent and destructive types of natural disasters drought often has serious socio economic agricultural and environmental impacts on affected regions apurv et al 2017 bhardwaj et al 2020 gevaert et al 2018 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2019b typically drought can be classified as meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic drought apurv and cai 2020 fang et al 2020 wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2021a among these four types agricultural drought has a direct impact on crop growth and may further lead to a decline in grain production therefore agricultural drought poses challenges to food security promoting the need for research to improve the early warning capabilities for agricultural drought generally a strong relationship exists between meteorological drought and other drought types whereby meteorological drought is often regarded as a precursor to other drought types fang et al 2020 li et al 2020 sattar et al 2019 xu et al 2019a for example long term precipitation deficits meteorological drought may cause a reduction in soil moisture and trigger agricultural drought generally it is relatively easy to assess meteorological drought considering the readily available precipitation data worldwide therefore an accurate understanding of how meteorological drought propagates to agricultural drought and probabilistic linkages between these two types of drought are vital for the proactive warning of agricultural drought to mitigate its impact the transition from meteorological drought to other drought types is known as drought propagation bhardwaj et al 2020 ding et al 2021 eltahir and yeh 1999 xu et al 2021a zhou et al 2021b recently many studies have evaluated the propagation time from meteorological drought to other drought types the correlation analysis method is the method most commonly used to obtain drought propagation time which determines the correlation coefficients between the agricultural hydrological drought index at a given timescale generally monthly scale and the meteorological drought index at different timescales generally n month standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 with n 1 2 etc n is precipitation accumulation period the timescale of spi corresponding to the highest correlation coefficient is the drought propagation time barker et al 2016 bevacqua et al 2021 gevaert et al 2018 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2019a as the drought indices were calculated on a monthly scale the determined drought propagation time also had a monthly resolution for example han et al 2019 concluded that the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought in the pearl river basin was 8 months xu et al 2019a pointed out that the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in northern china varies from 1 to 12 months with seasonal variation xu et al 2021a pointed out that the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought is generally no more than 3 months in humid regions whereas it ranges from 1 to 8 months in the arid and semi arid regions of china however spatiotemporal variations in drought propagation time may be insufficient for detection at monthly resolution therefore more attempts are needed to determine the drought propagation time at a finer temporal resolution by introducing sub monthly drought indices to accurately represent the spatiotemporal differences in drought propagation time fang et al 2020 ho et al 2021 in addition to propagation time changes in drought characteristics and their relationships during drought propagation have attracted increasing attention guo et al 2020 for example wu et al 2017 established a non linear relationship between the hydrological and meteorological drought event characteristics li et al 2018 built a relationship between agricultural hydrological drought severity and its driving factors e g meteorological drought severity and daily average precipitation 10 days before agricultural hydrological drought using multiple regression analysis zhou et al 2021a found that the performances of the three parameter power function and linear function were satisfactory in characterizing the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought event characteristics however only a few studies exist regarding the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought owing to the limitations of soil moisture datasets in the evaluation of agricultural drought meanwhile most of these studies were conducted at the catchment scale which is not sufficient to capture the spatial variations in the linkages of drought characteristics during drought propagation barker et al 2016 recently grid based soil moisture data with finer spatiotemporal resolution simulated by hydrological models have been widely used to evaluate the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought gevaert et al 2018 xu et al 2021a zhu et al 2021 this aids in identifying the finer spatial variations in the linkages of drought characteristics during drought propagation however the main question regarding the use of grid based soil moisture to analyze the variation in drought characteristics during drought propagation is how to match meteorological drought events with agricultural drought events to the best of our knowledge among the numerous research efforts on drought propagation only guo et al 2020 proposed a drought event matching approach to match meteorological and hydrological drought events however guo et al 2020 did not consider the strong relationships between the hydrological and meteorological drought event characteristics the present study attempts to bridge this gap by proposing a new drought event matching method to analyze the variations in drought event characteristics during drought propagation at the grid scale moreover there is another question that has not been answered well in previous studies when analyzing the relationships of drought characteristics between meteorological and other drought types during drought propagation few studies have attempted to investigate the probabilistic linkages of drought event characteristics between meteorological drought and other drought types currently most studies have focused on creating and understanding the relationships between agricultural hydrological and meteorological drought characteristics using simple regression models li et al 2018 wu et al 2017 yu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021a these relationships can also be described by probabilistic statistical methods because meteorological drought implies probability information regarding the occurrence of subsequent agricultural hydrological drought sattar and kim 2018 sattar et al 2019 for example zhu et al 2019 found that the probabilistic method performed better than linear exponential and power functions in describing the nonlinear relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts therefore more effort should be made to demonstrate the feasibility of probabilistic statistical approaches to determine the probabilistic linkages between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics which can provide indispensable risk information for drought managers in this study using the yangtze river basin yrb as a case study spi and improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index ismapi xu et al 2021b were selected to represent meteorological and agricultural drought respectively the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought was detected using the daily updated spi and ismapi at a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 a copula based probabilistic framework is proposed to estimate the occurrence probability of agricultural drought under specific meteorological drought conditions finally a novel drought event matching method based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient was introduced to match meteorological and agricultural drought events and the probabilistic linkages between meteorological and agricultural drought event characteristics were quantified based on the proposed probabilistic framework the purposes of this study are the following 1 reveal the spatiotemporal variation of propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought at a finer temporal resolution 2 calculate the occurrence probability of agricultural drought at different levels under specific meteorological drought conditions 3 explore the probabilistic linkages between meteorological and agricultural drought event characteristics the results of this study will contribute to agricultural drought early warning and mitigate the impact of agricultural drought 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as the longest river in asia the yrb fig 1 with a length of approximately 6300 km the yrb has a drainage area of approximately 1 8 106 km2 accounting for 18 8 of china s territory the terrain of the yrb is high in the west and low in the east with complex topography that includes plateaus mountains hills basins and plains the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in the yrb is significantly uneven precipitation is concentrated mainly from may to october the yrb suffers from frequent drought and flood disasters which are influenced by the complex terrain and a changing climate we divided the yrb into four regions fig 1 according to lang et al 2014 regions i and ii belong to the upper reaches of the yrb and regions iii and iv correspond to the middle and lower reaches of the yrb 2 2 data sources and preprocessing daily precipitation and soil moisture data from 1981 to 2020 were obtained from xu et al 2022 soil moisture data were simulated using a well calibrated variable infiltration capacity vic model as evaluated by xu et al 2022 meteorological data from the china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn were interpolated into a 0 05 0 05 spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighted method and used to force the vic model more details regarding precipitation and soil moisture are available in xu et al 2022 3 methods in this study the daily updated spi and ismapi were selected to characterize meteorological and agricultural droughts respectively the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought a probability framework based on the copula function and bayesian network was used to quantify the probabilistic linkages between the two types of drought fig 2 presents the flowchart of this study 3 1 daily updated spi and ismapi spi mckee et al 1993 is one of the most commonly used drought indices because it can capture drought conditions at different time scales based only on long term precipitation records in most previous studies spi was typically calculated based on monthly precipitation and the drought propagation time also had a monthly scale to estimate the drought propagation time at a finer temporal resolution we employed the method proposed by liu et al 2018 to calculate the daily updated spi by moving the spi window from 1 month to 1 day which was also suggested by the world meteorological organization world meteorological organization 2012 we calculated spi during the period from 1981 to 2020 for precipitation accumulation periods of 30 d 40 d 350 d and 360 d and denoted n day precipitation accumulation period as spi n e g 30 d and 360 d precipitation accumulation periods denoted as spi 30 and spi 360 respectively similar to the monthly scale the procedure for the daily updated spi calculation comprises the following 3 steps first daily precipitation was aggregated at a predefined precipitation accumulation period the accumulated precipitation series for each calendar day was then independently fitted to a gamma distribution function finally the cumulative probability of precipitation was estimated based on the fitted probability distribution function and then transformed into a normally distributed variable spi is determined by this equiprobability transformation using spi 30 as an example fig 3 presents the procedure for calculating the daily updated spi ismapi proposed by xu et al 2021b was used to characterize agricultural drought the applicability of ismapi in agricultural drought monitoring was validated in the yrb by xu et al 2021b and xu et al 2023 which found that ismapi is highly reliable for agricultural drought monitoring the calculation process of ismapi is summarized as follows box cox transformation was used to transform non normally distributed soil moisture into a normally distributed soil moisture series 1 s m λ s m λ 1 λ λ 0 ln s m λ 0 where s m and s m λ are the simulated soil moisture and corresponding value estimated by the box cox transformation respectively and λ is the power exponent of the box cox transformation which was determined using the maximum likelihood algorithm the transformed soil moisture data s m λ are standardized 2 i s m a p i s m λ s m λ δ s m λ where s m λ and δ s m λ are the mean value and standard deviation of s m λ the drought categories of ismapi are the same as those of spi and are listed in table 1 3 2 drought propagation time in line with most previous studies the commonly used correlation analysis method was used to determine the drought propagation time han et al 2021 xu et al 2021a 2019a specifically the spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi with various precipitation accumulation periods and ismapi was calculated and the spi with the highest correlation with ismapi was denoted as spi p where p represents the propagation time 3 3 occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought under different levels of meteorological drought 3 3 1 copula function the copula function is a multivariable joint distribution function that forms the joint distribution of multiple random variables through their respective marginal distribution functions and has been widely employed in drought studies owing to its good flexibility and adaptability guo et al 2020 han et al 2021 xu et al 2021a in the bivariate case for random variables x and y with marginal distributions f x x and f y y there is a two dimensional copula function c that combines these two marginal distributions to form a joint distribution function f x y x y 3 f x y x y p x x y y c f x x f y y many copula families are available including the archimedean copula elliptical copula and quadratic copula among which the archimedean copula is the most widely used for analyzing bivariate joint dependence structures wu et al 2015 in this study five copulas from the archimedean family are considered comprising the ali mikhail haq clayton frank gumbel and joe copulas the root mean square error rmse between the empirical and theoretical values is adopted for the goodness of fit test of copula functions whereby the best fit copula in each grid cell should have the smallest rmse value 3 3 2 conditional probabilities calculation using a bayesian network in this section the spi p and ismapi series of each grid are regarded as two random variables as both spi and ismapi are standardized drought indices the normal distribution was used for fitting the spi p and ismapi series a significant correlation between the spi p and ismapi is a prerequisite for constructing the joint distribution of the spi p and ismapi series using the copula method therefore only grids with a spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi p and ismapi greater than 0 50 accounting for 98 9 of the total grids were selected in this study to estimate the conditional probabilities of agricultural drought conditioned on different levels of meteorological drought a bayesian network can represent the conditional dependencies between a group of variables and has been widely used in conditional probability calculations guo et al 2020 han et al 2021 sattar and kim 2018 sattar et al 2019 this study classified meteorological and agricultural drought into four categories table 1 once the marginal distributions of the two random variables and the best fit copula are determined the conditional probabilities of agricultural drought conditioned on four levels of meteorological drought can be calculated using a bayesian network the conditional probability of light moderate or severe agricultural drought under light moderate or severe meteorological drought conditions can be estimated as follows 4 p i 1 i i 2 s 1 s s 2 c f i i 2 f s s 2 c f i i 1 f s s 1 f s s 2 f s s 1 c f i i 1 f s s 2 c f i i 2 f s s 1 f s s 2 f s s 1 the conditional probability of extreme agricultural drought under light moderate or severe meteorological drought conditions can be estimated as follows 5 p i i 1 s 1 s s 2 c f i i 1 f s s 2 c f i i 1 f s s 1 f s s 2 f s s 1 the conditional probability of light moderate or severe agricultural drought under extreme meteorological drought conditions can be estimated as follows 6 p i 1 i i 2 s s 1 c f i i 2 f s s 1 c f i i 1 f s s 1 f s s 1 the conditional probability of extreme agricultural drought under extreme meteorological drought conditions can be estimated as follows 7 p i i 1 s s 1 c f i i 1 f s s 1 f s s 1 where f s and f i are the marginal cumulative distributions of spi and ismapi f s s and f i i are the cumulative probabilities of s s and i i and c f i i f s s is the joint cumulative probability of s s and i i eqs 5 and 7 can also be used to determine the conditional probability of agricultural drought under light moderate or severe and extreme meteorological drought respectively 3 4 probability relationship model between agricultural and meteorological drought characteristics 3 4 1 matching of agricultural and meteorological drought events drought duration and severity are the two most important characteristics of drought events the key step for determining the linkage between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics is to identify drought events and match the identified agricultural and meteorological drought events agricultural drought generally originates from meteorological drought therefore agricultural drought characteristics should have a good correlation with meteorological drought characteristics this relationship is also a prerequisite for constructing a joint distribution of agricultural and meteorological drought characteristics using the copula function and further estimating the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought events conditioned on a specific level of meteorological drought events with this background a novel drought event matching approach based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient is proposed to determine the meteorological drought events that correspond to the given agricultural drought event the following are the details of the major steps of the proposed drought event matching method 1 identification of drought events in this study the run theory was used to identify meteorological and agricultural drought events drought duration was defined as the number of consecutive days with the spi or ismapi value below 0 5 and drought severity is the total absolute value of spi or ismapi for the duration we used 30 d as the minimum drought duration threshold to identify drought events moreover two adjacent drought events were merged into a new drought event if their time interval was less than 5 days wu et al 2015 2 matching drought events according to guo et al 2020 for an agricultural drought event with duration d i severity s i start ts i and end te i the trigger interval t i of the corresponding meteorological drought events is from t p days before ts i ts i t p to te i if t i of two adjacent agricultural drought events are overlapped the t i of the latter agricultural drought event is from the end of the last agricultural drought event te i 1 to the end of the current drought event t i can be expressed as follows 8 t i t s i t p t e i t s i t e i 1 t p t e i 1 t e i t s i t e i 1 t p the duration d and severity s of the matched meteorological drought events can be expressed as 9 d i 1 n d i 10 s i 1 n s i j 1 m v j where d i and s i are the duration and severity of the ith meteorological drought event determined using run theory respectively and v j is the supply of wet events between two adjacent drought events the above introduction shows that an appropriate t p value must be determined for each grid before using the proposed drought event matching method to match meteorological and agricultural drought events we assumed that the t p value ranged from 0 to 360 d to obtain an appropriate t p value for each grid we examined t p value from 0 to 360 d at a time step of 5 d i e t p values of 0 d 5 d 355 d and 360 d the number of matched drought events and the significance level α1 α2 of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the agricultural and meteorological drought event severity duration were calculated for each t p value the best t p value in each grid was determined using the following three criteria 1 t p value corresponding to the minimum value of α 1 2 α 2 2 if the t p value is not unique the t p value of the target grid is determined by implementing the next criterion 2 t p value corresponding to the maximum number of matched drought events if the t p value is not unique the t p value of the target grid is determined by implementing the next criterion 3 minimum t p is selected as the t p value of the target grid on the premise that criteria 1 and 2 are simultaneously satisfied as mentioned above a significant correlation between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics is a prerequisite for constructing their joint distribution using the copula function and further estimating the probabilities of agricultural drought events conditioned on different levels of meteorological drought events therefore only grids that simultaneously satisfied the following three criteria were used to evaluate the probabilistic linkages between agricultural and meteorological drought characteristics 1 spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi p and ismapi is greater than 0 50 2 α1 and α2 are less than 0 10 and 3 there are at least 10 matched drought events these three criteria were simultaneously satisfied in approximately 94 0 of the total grids the translation rate is a key index for characterizing the sensitivity of agricultural drought to meteorological drought guo et al 2020 sattar et al 2019 the translation rate can be calculated as follows 11 t r m p m t 100 where t r is the translation rate m p is the number of matched meteorological droughts and m t is the number of meteorological droughts identified using run theory 3 4 2 marginal distribution of drought events characteristics in this section the matched drought event characteristics in section 3 4 1 are considered as random variables and fit their respective marginal distribution functions here 10 commonly used functions were used generalized extreme value distribution log normal distribution exponential distribution exponentiated weibull distribution gamma distribution right skewed gumbel distribution left skewed gumbel distribution logistic distribution normal distribution and weibull minimum extreme value distribution and the fitter package https pypi org project fitter in python was used to fit the marginal distribution of the drought characteristics the aic method in the fitter package was selected for the goodness of fit test of marginal distribution functions determining the best fit marginal distribution function for each grid 3 4 3 probabilistic linkages calculation based on a bayesian network drought events can be classified into four categories according to the cumulative probability of the drought duration or severity generally the classification boundary values of the cumulative probability between light and moderate drought moderate and severe drought and severe and extreme drought were 0 50 0 75 and 0 90 guo et al 2020 respectively the classification boundary values of the four categories of drought events were determined based on the best fit marginal distribution of the drought event characteristics moreover according to the drought event identification method introduced in section 3 4 1 we assumed that the lower limits of the drought event duration and severity were 30 d and 15 0 respectively as in section 3 3 2 once the marginal distributions of drought event characteristics and the best fit copula function are determined the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought events conditioned on four levels of meteorological drought events can be calculated using eq 12 15 the occurrence probability of light moderate or severe agricultural drought events under light moderate or severe meteorological drought events can be calculated as follows 12 p a 1 a a 2 m 1 m m 2 c f a a 2 f m m 2 c f a a 1 f m m 1 f m m 2 f m m 1 c f a a 1 f m m 2 c f a a 2 f m m 1 f m m 2 f m m 1 the occurrence probability of extreme agricultural drought events under light moderate or severe meteorological drought events can be estimated as follows 13 p a a 1 m 1 m m 2 1 0 c f a a 1 f m m 2 c f a a 1 f m m 1 f m m 2 f m m 1 the occurrence probability of light moderate or severe agricultural drought events under extreme meteorological drought events can be calculated as follows 14 p a 1 a a 2 m m 1 f a a 2 f a a 1 c f a a 2 f m m 1 1 0 f m m 1 c f a a 1 f m m 1 1 0 f m m 1 the occurrence probability of extreme agricultural drought events under extreme meteorological drought events can be calculated as follows 15 p a a 1 m m 1 1 0 f a a 1 f m m 1 c f a a 1 f m m 1 1 0 f m m 1 where f m and f a are the marginal distribution functions of the meteorological and agricultural drought event characteristics f m m and f a a are the cumulative probabilities of m m and a a respectively and c f a a f m m is the joint cumulative probability of m m and a a eqs 13 and 15 can also be used to determine the occurrence probability of agricultural drought events conditioned on light moderate or severe and extreme meteorological drought events respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 drought propagation time and its influencing factors 4 1 1 drought propagation time and its seasonal variability fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought and their corresponding spearman rank correlation coefficients in most regions accounting for 96 5 of the total grids the drought propagation time was generally within 150 d and the average propagation time in the yrb was 48 d in approximately 65 0 of the total grids the drought propagation time was 30 d and in approximately 20 5 of the total grids the drought propagation time ranged from 40 to 60 d the spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi p and ismapi ranged from 0 18 to 0 90 and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient in the yrb is 0 71 which indicates that there is a strong response relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought in the yrb in approximately 98 8 of the grids the spearman rank correlation coefficient was equal to or greater than 0 50 as shown in table 2 the longest propagation time and weakest response relationship were found in region i regions ii iii and iv had shorter propagation times and stronger response relationships than region i specifically only 58 5 of the total grids had a drought propagation time of no more than 60 d and the average propagation time in region i was 79 d however the average drought propagation times were 40 37 and 40 d and the percentages of grids with drought propagation times of no more than 60 d were approximately 93 6 93 7 and 93 4 in regions ii iii and iv respectively the average spearman rank correlation coefficients between the spi p and ismapi in the four sub regions were 0 65 0 73 0 73 and 0 70 respectively it is worth noting that in some grids in regions i and ii the spearman rank correlation coefficients between spi p and ismapi are relatively low and even negative which indicates that meteorological drought in these regions may not be the dominant factor causing agricultural drought a possible reason is that the temperature in these grids is very low and even negative resulting in rainfall mainly occurring in the solid phase with almost no infiltration of water that supplements the soil moisture promptly moreover snow cover reduces soil evaporation during low temperature periods and snowmelt could be an important recharge source of soil moisture during high temperature periods consequently the change in soil moisture was hardly influenced by precipitation and a negative spearman rank correlation coefficient was found in these grids furthermore the seasonal variations in drought propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yrb were analyzed as shown in fig 5 and table 2 the average propagation times in spring 64 d and winter 68 d were longer than those in summer 34 d and autumn 38 d in the yrb in spring the drought propagation times in regions i and ii were longer than those in regions iii and iv in summer the propagation time was quickly shortened with little difference between the four subregions in autumn the propagation time in the eastern areas of regions iii and iv was larger than that in regions i and ii in winter the propagation time in the middle of the yrb was shorter than that in the western and eastern areas of the yrb in regions i and ii the average drought propagation times in spring and winter were longer than those in the summer and autumn there was little difference in drought propagation time in different seasons in region iii and the drought propagation time in spring summer and autumn average was 39 34 and 40 d respectively was slightly shorter than that in winter average was 52 d in region iv the longest drought propagation time was found in winter with an average propagation time of 77 d followed by autumn with an average value of 47 d and the shortest was in spring and summer with average propagation times of 38 d and 35 d respectively as shown in fig 5 a2 d2 and table 2 there is a strong response relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought and the proportions of grids with spearman rank correlation coefficients equal to or greater than 0 50 are all above 97 5 in the four seasons the response relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought was stronger in spring than in other seasons and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient in spring was 0 78 followed by autumn and winter with average spearman rank correlation coefficients of 0 74 and 0 75 respectively the weakest response relationship was found in summer with an average spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0 71 seasonal variations in response relationships also exhibit distinct regional differences in region i the spearman rank correlation coefficient between spi p and ismapi gradually decreased from spring to winter in region ii the highest spearman rank correlation coefficient was found in spring followed by winter and the weakest was in summer in regions iii and iv the spearman rank correlation coefficients between spi p and ismapi in spring and summer were lower than those in autumn and winter 4 1 2 main factors affecting drought propagation time an increase or decrease in soil moisture is a continuous process a greater persistence of soil moisture indicates that it is insensitive to short term temperature and or precipitation anomalies and may correspond to a longer drought propagation time apurv and cai 2021 bhardwaj et al 2020 the lag correlation coefficient reflects the persistence characteristics of soil moisture a positive and larger lag correlation coefficient corresponds to a greater persistence of soil moisture xu et al 2021b therefore the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the drought propagation time and the lag correlation coefficient of soil moisture was calculated and the relationship between the persistence characteristics of soil moisture and drought propagation time was analyzed as shown in table 3 the drought propagation time and lag correlation coefficient of soil moisture have a significant positive correlation for example the spearman rank correlation coefficient between drought propagation time and lag correlation coefficient of soil moisture is 0 69 when the lag time is equal to 10 d these results indicate that in grids with a strong persistence of soil moisture the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought is long which is consistent with the results of apurv and cai 2021 and bhardwaj et al 2020 climatic factors are the main reason for the differences in soil moisture persistence and drought propagation time in different regions as demonstrated in previous studies apurv et al 2017 fang et al 2020 gevaert et al 2018 han et al 2019 wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2021a temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation are the most important meteorological factors that affect drought propagation han et al 2019 xu et al 2021a fig 6 presents the annual seasonal cycle of soil moisture a1 d1 and the precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature a2 d2 in each subregion in region i the temperatures in spring and winter were low and the average temperature for several months was negative fig 6 a2 owing to the limitations of energy evapotranspiration could almost be neglected and soil moisture showed less variation and strong persistence resulting in a longer drought propagation time in region i in spring and winter greater evapotranspiration in summer may contribute to a shorter drought propagation time wu et al 2018 specifically the temperature in region i reached the maximum and evapotranspiration was significantly higher than that in other seasons soil moisture is the major source of water for evapotranspiration with inadequate precipitation resulting in soil moisture persistence in summer being lower than that in spring and winter and the drought propagation time in summer being shorter than that in spring and summer the temperature and evapotranspiration in autumn were lower than those in summer but still higher than those in spring and winter meanwhile the soil moisture reached its maximum in early autumn in region i fig 6 a1 which may have led to a large baseflow therefore water loss caused by baseflow and evapotranspiration will cause a rapid decrease in soil moisture under conditions of insufficient precipitation which may be the reason for the lower soil moisture persistence and shorter drought propagation time in autumn the reason for the seasonal variation in drought propagation time in region ii is similar to that in region i however the temperatures in spring and winter in region ii are higher than those in region i resulting in a relatively faster hydrological cycle and weaker soil moisture persistence in region ii than in region i therefore the drought propagation time in spring and winter in region ii is significantly lower than that in region i owing to greater precipitation and higher temperatures in regions iii and iv the evapotranspiration in regions iii and iv is larger than those in regions i and ii leading to the strengthening of the hydrological cycle when there is a precipitation deficit in regions iii and iv the soil moisture falls rapidly owing to large evapotranspiration however the deficit in soil moisture caused by evapotranspiration can be quickly supplemented because high intensity precipitation events occur more frequently in regions iii and iv these factors led to dry wet transitions being more frequent and soil moisture in regions iii and iv having lower persistence therefore the drought propagation times in regions iii and iv were relatively short in regions iii and iv precipitation and evapotranspiration in spring and summer were significantly higher than those in the other seasons resulting in a relatively faster hydrological cycle and weaker soil moisture persistence in spring and summer therefore the drought propagation times in autumn and winter were longer than those in spring and summer in autumn the temperature and evapotranspiration in iv tended to decrease gradually and the precipitation was lower than that in spring and summer therefore the loss and supplement rate of soil moisture was slower than those in spring and summer and the drought propagation time in autumn was longer than those in spring and summer the climate characteristics in the western areas of region iii were similar to those in region ii whereas the climate characteristics in the eastern areas of region iii are similar to those in region iv resulting in the drought propagation time in the western areas of region iii being shorter than that in the eastern areas of region iii therefore on a regional average the drought propagation time in autumn in region iii was slightly shorter than that in region iv in winter the temperatures in regions iii and iv were the lowest during the entire year and lower temperatures lead to weaker evapotranspiration and a slower hydrological cycle which may increase the soil moisture persistence and prolong the drought propagation time xu et al 2019a as shown in fig 4 c1 and d1 the soil moisture in region iii changes little in winter indicating that precipitation infiltration is consistent with the soil water loss caused by evapotranspiration and baseflow however the soil moisture in region iv increased significantly in winter indicating that precipitation infiltration was greater than the soil water loss caused by evapotranspiration and baseflow therefore in the case of insufficient precipitation the soil moisture in region iii may decrease faster than that in region iv that is the soil moisture in region iii responds quickly to precipitation anomalies moreover region iv had higher soil moisture storage than region iii favoring a stronger resistance to precipitation deficits accumulated at shorter time scales and leading to delayed drought response this may be the reason for the shorter propagation time in region iii compared to that in region iv in winter 4 2 occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought under four meteorological drought conditions fig 7 presents the occurrence probabilities of different levels of agricultural drought under the four levels of meteorological drought conditions under light and moderate meteorological drought conditions the overall occurrence probabilities of light agricultural drought were the highest both were 0 29 on average followed by moderate agricultural drought 0 17 and 0 25 on average respectively under severe and extreme meteorological drought conditions the overall occurrence probability of moderate agricultural drought was highest both were 0 28 on average this was followed by light agricultural drought which had average occurrence probabilities under severe and extreme meteorological drought of 0 25 and 0 23 respectively the occurrence probability of severe and extreme agricultural droughts also increased with meteorological drought intensity specifically the occurrence probabilities of severe and extreme agricultural drought conditioned on light meteorological drought were 0 07 and 0 03 respectively whereas the occurrence probabilities of severe and extreme agricultural drought conditioned on extreme meteorological drought were 0 20 and 0 13 respectively the above results indicate that the occurrence probability of more serious agricultural drought gradually increases with an increase in meteorological drought intensity to distinguish the regional differences in the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought under multiple meteorological drought levels table 4 presents the regional mean occurrence probability of agricultural drought under the four levels of meteorological drought generally the occurrence probability of agricultural drought is expected to increase with an increase in meteorological drought intensity the average occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought in the yrb conditioned on light moderate severe and extreme meteorological drought were 0 57 0 74 0 81 and 0 84 respectively under the four levels of meteorological drought the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought in regions ii and iii were slightly higher than those in region iv and region i had the lowest probability of agricultural drought on average which indicates that regions ii and iii are less resilient to meteorological drought and have a higher risk of agricultural drought outbreaks the regional differences in the occurrence probability of agricultural drought under a given meteorological drought condition may be related to the various climatic characteristics of the four subregions 4 3 probabilistic relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics 4 3 1 matched agricultural and meteorological drought events the t p value in each grid was determined before matching the meteorological and agricultural drought events as shown in fig 8 in approximately 96 0 of the total grids the t p values were no greater than 240 d and the average t p value in the yrb was 67 d which demonstrates that the occurrence of an agricultural drought event lagged approximately 2 months behind that of the meteorological drought event from the results of the four subregions the t p value in region i was higher than that in region ii which in turn was higher than those in regions iii and iv and the average t p values in regions i ii iii and iv were 78 69 60 and 61 d respectively fig 9 presents the number of matched drought events and the spatial pattern of the translation rate the number of matched drought events was generally no more than 40 in approximately 99 4 of the total grids and an average of 27 drought events were matched in the yrb the number of matched drought events in the central and southern areas of region i region ii and the northwestern part of region iii is larger than those in the other regions specifically the number of matched drought events in region ii was greater than those in regions i and iii which in turn was greater than that in region iv the average numbers of matched drought events in regions i ii iii and iv were 27 28 27 and 25 respectively furthermore the sensitivity of agricultural drought events to meteorological drought events was analyzed by considering the translation rate the spatial distribution of the translation rate was consistent with the number of matched drought events fig 9 b that is the translation rate of meteorological drought events was higher in grids with more matched drought events the translation rate of meteorological drought events in the yrb is generally no less than 55 0 in approximately 83 6 of the total grids and the average translation rate is 72 4 which indicates that on average approximately 72 4 of meteorological drought events will evolve into agricultural drought events overall the translation rate gradually decreased from west to east and the average translation rates in regions i ii iii and iv were 79 5 74 4 69 5 and 64 2 respectively the main reason for the lower translation rates in regions iii and iv is that the precipitation frequencies and intensities in regions iii and iv were higher than those in regions i and ii and the deficit of soil moisture in regions iii and iv can be quickly supplemented some meteorological drought events with short duration and low intensity are less likely to cause agricultural drought events as the early recovery of rainfall may hinder the propagation of drought apurv et al 2017 4 3 2 probabilistic linkages between agricultural and meteorological drought event characteristics fig 10 presents the occurrence probabilities of different levels of agricultural drought duration under four levels of meteorological drought duration due to space limitation the probabilistic relationships between agricultural drought severity and meteorological drought severity are presented in fig a1 and table a1 generally an agricultural drought event that has the same drought category as that of the given meteorological drought event is most likely to occur for example the average occurrence probability of light agricultural drought duration was the largest under light meteorological drought duration under light meteorological drought duration conditions the occurrence probability of agricultural drought duration gradually decreased from light to extreme categories the average probabilities of light and moderate agricultural drought duration under moderate meteorological drought duration were 0 31 and 0 39 respectively which is larger than the average probability of severe and extreme agricultural drought duration however the occurrence probability of severe agricultural drought duration under moderate meteorological drought duration was significantly higher than that under light meteorological drought duration under severe meteorological drought duration conditions the average occurrence probabilities of moderate and severe agricultural drought duration were 0 31 and 0 34 respectively which are larger than those of light and extreme agricultural drought duration compared with the results under light and moderate meteorological drought duration the occurrence probability of light agricultural drought duration under severe meteorological drought duration was significantly decreased average probability of 0 14 while the occurrence probability of extreme agricultural drought duration increased significantly average probability of 0 19 under extreme meteorological drought duration the extreme agricultural drought duration had the highest occurrence probability average probability of 0 46 followed by severe agricultural drought duration average probability of 0 29 and light agricultural drought duration had the smallest occurrence probability average probability of 0 07 these results indicate that the probability of triggering an agricultural drought event with a longer duration is expected to increase with the meteorological drought duration table 5 presents the regional mean occurrence probability of agricultural drought events under the four levels of meteorological drought duration there is a strong relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought characteristics and the occurrence probability of an agricultural drought event is expected to increase with the meteorological drought duration the conditional probabilities of agricultural drought events conditioned on light moderate severe and extreme meteorological drought durations were 0 81 0 96 0 98 and 0 99 respectively under light meteorological drought duration conditions region ii had the highest probability of occurring agricultural drought events average probability of 0 84 followed by regions iii and iv and region i had the smallest probability of occurrence of agricultural drought events average probability of 0 79 this indicates that region ii is less resilient to meteorological drought events and has a higher risk of occurring agricultural drought events the regional differences in the probability of the occurrence of agricultural drought events may be related to the various climatic characteristics in the four subregions the average temperature in region i is lower than that in the other regions therefore with lower evapotranspiration and little soil water loss under meteorological drought events with short duration the probability of agricultural drought events occurring in region i was relatively low the temperature and evapotranspiration in region ii were higher than those in region i meanwhile the precipitation in region ii was lower than those in regions iii and iv therefore the soil moisture in region ii will decline rapidly and will be difficult to supplement effectively under meteorological drought conditions as such the occurrence probability of agricultural drought events in region ii is higher than that in region i among the four subregions regions iii and iv possess the highest temperature and evapotranspiration however regions iii and iv have frequent precipitation and more high intensity precipitation events than do regions i and ii which leads to the deficit in soil moisture caused by evapotranspiration under light meteorological drought duration being supplemented in time and some meteorological drought events with short duration are less likely to cause agricultural drought events therefore the occurrence probabilities of agricultural drought events in regions iii and iv were higher than that in region i but lower than that in region ii under moderate or more severe meteorological drought conditions the occurrence probability of agricultural drought events in the four subregions is almost the same which may be because the soil moisture is significantly reduced with the increase in meteorological drought duration and cannot be supplemented during meteorological drought owing to insufficient long term precipitation this means that the risk of agricultural drought in the different regions is high 5 conclusions it is important to comprehensively understand the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought for early warning and prevention of agricultural drought in this study the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought and the probabilistic linkages between the two drought types were estimated based on the daily updated spi and ismapi taking the yrb as a case study we found that the average propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yrb was 48 d the propagation times in spring and winter were longer than those in summer and autumn the difference in soil moisture persistence among the different regions or seasons is probably one of the main reasons for spatiotemporal variations in propagation time the occurrence probability of agricultural drought gradually increased with an increase in meteorological drought intensity on average approximately 72 4 of meteorological drought events evolve into agricultural drought events generally an agricultural drought event that has the same drought category as that of the given meteorological drought event is most likely to occur overall we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of drought propagation time at a finer temporal resolution for the first time by introducing daily updated drought indices moreover we demonstrate the use of the proposed probability framework to characterize the linkages between agricultural and meteorological drought the findings of this study are helpful to better understanding the propagation mechanisms from meteorological to agricultural drought such knowledge is important for decision makers in water resource management and drought risk assessment this study mainly focused on the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yrb however the method proposed in this study is flexible and can be applied to other regions worldwide or other types of drought in future research more effort should be made to study drought propagation from a multiple drought type perspective as the occurrence time and mechanism of drought may vary with different drought types and their interaction with one another credit

7716,study region the buffalo river br catchment kwazulu natal south africa study focus due to the vast majority of the br catchment s water demands not being fully satisfied in recent years studies investigating potential climate change impacts on the catchment s water supply availability are needed the study s objective was to therefore assess climate change induced surface water availability swa variations in the br catchment from 2020 to 2100 to achieve this the hydrologic water evaluation and planning model was forced with the catchment s physical and hydrological data and projected climate data from an ensemble of gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios from cmip5 new hydrological insights for the region the study findings projected increased precipitation especially in the far future 2070 2100 whereby mean annual precipitation increased by 5 to 8286 mm3 annum under the worst case climate change scenario rcp8 5 with evapotranspiration and water abstractions averaging 4500 mm3 annum and 115 mm3 annum respectively surface runoff and swa increased by 8 and 10 yielding averages of 3265 mm3 annum and 287 mm3 annum respectively even with the increased swa unmet demands also increased by 113 towards the end of the 21st century as the study established that climate change might exacerbate the br catchment s water supply system s insufficiency to meet growing demands such findings present an opportunity for the integrated water energy food nexus approach to be further utilised for formulating sustainable water management strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords

rwanda for example is currently developing plans for four selected demonstration catchments using the weap modelling tool droogers et al 2017 the island of mauritius also utilised the weap model for simulating river systems in 60 catchments to assess the implications of local municipal and agricultural water requirements on national water supply schemes welsch et al 2014 several water availability and management studies were performed in south africa using the weap model for example levite et al 2003 evaluated the usefulness of weap in assessing water demand management scenarios in the steelpoort sub catchment of the olifants river through the analyses of simulated catchments met and unmet demands arranz and mccartney 2007 used weap to assess the impacts of likely future water use on the water resources of the olifants catchment haji 2011 investigated the effects of future cc on meeting the water demands of different consumers in the upper vaal river basin using the weap model these studies concluded that weap is useful for water resources assessment in south african catchments and for a holistic view of an entire river basin the buffalo river br catchment is a sub catchment of the thukela water management area whose water source is in the drakensberg region the br catchment is characterised as a relatively high runoff sub catchment dlamini and schulze 2006 that supplies water to numerous sectors including irrigation power generation domestic mining and bulk industries statssa 2010 there have been severe droughts in past years especially during 2015 2016 which consequently affected the livelihoods and socio economic activities of local and surrounding communities as well as the capability of the catchment s water supply system to meet its water demands umgeni 2020 thus an integrated surface water availability assessments is essential in such cases for the effective and responsible management of water resources tena et al 2019 previous studies that investigated the long term changes of the water supply demand relationship within the br catchment primarily focused on whether current water supplies are sufficient to meet projected population demand rather than how climate change may influence and change the quantity of water stored and made available to users dwaf 2003 dwa 2011 umgeni 2016 2020 to our knowledge a detailed climate change and water resources analysis has not been undertaken for the br catchment umgeni 2020 therefore the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of cc on surface water availability in the br catchment it is difficult to predict and quantify the exact available surface water and water balance hence a scenario analysis was chosen as the most appropriate approach to meet the objective using the weap modelling tool 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the br catchment covering an estimated area of 9 803 km2 has minimum latitude and maximum longitude values of 28 42 59 s and 30 38 30 e respectively umgeni 2020 the catchment is situated in a warm and humid region that receives most of its annual rainfall during summer as per fig 1 the br is the main northern tributary of the uthukela river it flows approximately 339 km south easterly from the eastern escarpment newcastle area through the amajuba and umzinyathi district municipalities then confluences with the uthukela river in the msinga local municipality dlamini and mostert 2019 umgeni 2020 the predominant land cover in the br catchment is grassland 58 followed by cultivated land 22 as seen in fig 2 umgeni 2020 grassland is mostly utilised for the grazing of livestock inr 2019 commercial scale production of maize soybean and wheat dominates the upper catchment region with irrigated production mainly taking place in the fertile region of the western newcastle local municipality statssa 2017 lgccp 2018 commercial and subsistence farming under rainfed conditions is more prominent in the br catchment s middle and lower southern regions statssa 2017 2 2 hydrological characteristics the hydrological characteristics of the br catchment are summarised in table 1 the upper tertiary catchment v31 where the slang incandu and ingagane rivers are located generates the largest mean annual runoff of 119 mm dws 2015 umgeni 2020 this can be mainly attributed to the high rainfall and steeper gradient of the drakensberg mountains regions umgeni 2020 however mean annual runoff trends have been noted to decrease as the br traverses to the middle v32 and lower v33 regions yielding 73 and 64 mm annum respectively dws 2015 umgeni 2020 2 3 surface water infrastructure the total supply capacity of the br catchment s existing surface water infrastructure is approximately 405 mm3 providing a hydrological yield of 136 9 mm3 annum unspecified assurance level the ntshingwayo dam contributes significantly to the water supply with a full supply capacity of 211 mm3 and yield of 59 mm3 annum as well as the zaaihoek dam with a full supply capacity of 185 mm3 and yield of 54 mm3 annum umgeni 2020 the br catchment s water supply system br system also includes eight water treatment plants wtp which as listed in table a 1 extract water from supply sources and distribute it to their designated supply areas other wtps within the br system such as the charlestown wtp are primarily supplied by groundwater sources and distribute approximately 440 kl day to their respective water demand sites umgeni 2020 due to the lack of data availability related to the location and distribution of these groundwater resources the aforementioned wtps were not included in this study 2 4 weap model description the weap model is an innovative integrated modelling software that offers a detailed dynamic and user friendly framework for establishing water balances scenario generation planning and policy analysis ayele 2016 tena et al 2019 the model was developed for integrated water resources planning tena et al 2019 and can be applied to municipal and agricultural systems and to a single catchment or a complex transboundary river basin system ayele 2016 the weap model simulates a wide range of natural and engineered components of the aforementioned systems from precipitation to streamflow reservoirs groundwater discharge and water demand and supply agarwal et al 2018 2 4 1 weap model water balance computation the weap model was used to simulate the water balance components in eq 1 sieber 2015 using climate physical and hydrological inputs from the br catchment and the modelling process used is visualised in fig 3 actual evapotranspiration included evaporation losses from vegetation and open water bodies streamflow comprised of surface runoff only i e no groundwater contributions hence the impact of groundwater recharge on reservoir storage was assumed negligible however it is important to note that there are five hydrogeological units comprising one primary and four secondary type aquifers within the br catchment they exhibit moderate potential to provide mean yields of 0 9 2 7 l per second l s via boreholes of 30 60 m deep umgeni 2020 thus various water supply schemes within the br catchment rely solely on groundwater supply from boreholes 1 p e x et a q w a s wherep precipitation mm3 annum e x external flows mm3 annum et a actual evapotranspiration mm3 annum q

runoff and b irrigation demands only versions of the simplified coefficient approach c the soil moisture method d the mabia method and e the plant growth model sieber 2015 the rainfall runoff simplified coefficient method was chosen due to the availability of data required by this approach the rainfall runoff method is similar to the irrigation demands only method as they both use crop coefficients to compute potential evapotranspiration in the catchment for the rainfall runoff method the remainder of rainfall not consumed by evapotranspiration is simulated as runoff to a river or can be proportioned among runoff to a river and flow to groundwater via runoff infiltration links it does not however track soil moisture changes sieber 2015 the concept of water balance is based on mass conservation principles in a closed system sieber 2015 and includes all water inflows and outflows in a catchment area tena et al 2019 2 4 2 weap model scenario computation a scenario is a plausible depiction of how the future may unfold based on a detailed and scientifically sound set of assumptions regarding key interconnections and driving factors arranz and mccartney 2007 as it is impossible to forecast exactly how water demands and other variables affecting water supplies could change in the future scenarios were employed in this study initially a current account of the br catchment was created in the weap model the current accounts represents the basic definition of the water system as it currently exists by providing a snapshot of actual water demands resources and supplies for the system using historical data it forms the foundation of all scenarios sieber 2015 the representative concentration pathways rcps which are scenarios developed for the climate modelling community as a basis for near and long term modelling experiments vuuren et al 2011 are named according to radiative forcing target levels for 2100 as per table a 2 this study used the following three scenarios to evaluate cc impacts on surface water availability in the br catchment which are further elaborated on later section 2 5 3 a the baseline scenario which reflects historical climate conditions and utilised for comparison purposes against rcp scenarios b the rcp4 5 scenario which is a stabilisation scenario that assumes climate policies are invoked to limit emissions and radiative forcing thompson et al 2011 carbon emissions peak at mid century at around 50 higher than the historical levels wayne 2013 c the rcp8 5 scenario is a high emission scenario based on no policy driven mitigation vuuren et al 2011 emissions continue to increase rapidly through the early and mid parts of the century carbon dioxide concentration accelerates and reaches 1370 ppm by 2100 vuuren et al 2011 2 5 weap model input data 2 5 1 buffalo river catchment schematic in weap using gis based vector data a schematic of the br catchment was created in the weap model fig 1 the vector layers included a kwazulu natal kzn secondary drainage regions b kzn district municipalities c river network of the amajuba and umzinyathi district municipalities and d dams within the amajuba and umzinyathi district municipalities all vector layers were obtained from dws 2016 and their attribute data were further sorted using esri s arcgis software version 10 6 0 8321 released on 17 july 2018 for the purpose of computing the rates and quantities of water recharge and abstraction thirteen demand nodes were created for the br system s demand analysis every demand node corresponds to a particular group of water consumers four represent the municipal demand domestic and irrigation water demand eight represent wtps and one represents the energy demands all water demand nodes depend on surface water resources only the weap model was run at the monthly time step with the hydrological year starting in october and ending in september 2 5 2 historical climate data the input precipitation data used in weap to simulate historical and current catchment conditions were obtained from the climate hazards group infra red precipitation with station dataset chirps funk et al 2015 the chirps dataset builds on previous approaches to smart interpolation and high resolution techniques where precipitation estimates are based on infra red cold cloud duration ccd observations funk et al 2015 the algorithm uses satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations and provides daily pentadal and monthly rainfall estimates from 1981 to the near present at a 0 05º spatial resolution since the projections timeframe for this study spans from 01 01 2020 31 12 2099 data for a 30 year baseline period wmo 2021 was acquired for the entire boundary of the br catchment from 01 01 1990 31 12 2019 using 0 05º pixels of the chirps gridded data to ensure that the chirps dataset represented the catchment s climate conditions it was bias corrected using the linear scaling ls method as demonstrated in eq 2 the ls bias correction method was selected as it preserves the mean signal of the observed variable and yields very good hydrological performance when applied under a monthly approach ghimire et al 2018 the scaling factor was derived using the catchment s observed map of 802 mm obtained from umgeni 2020 with the chirps map of 722 03 mm gudmundsson et al 2012 2 p corr p raw cf where p corr bias corrected precipitation mm p raw raw precipitation data mm cf scaling factor map observed data map raw data the resulting historical annual precipitation values increased over time with the lowest values of 645 584 and 574 mm noted in the years 1992 2003 and 2015 respectively this coincides with the findings by dube and jury 2003 and ndlovu and demlie 2020 which highlighted the droughts experienced in the kzn province during these years an extreme peak in precipitation was modelled for the year 1995 which aligns with ndlovu and demlie 2020 observation that northern kzn had extremely wet conditions in 1995 ndlovu and demlie 2020 also stated that there were more extreme dry conditions than wet ones during the historical period which is mirrored in the outcomes of this study 2 5 3 future climate projections the precipitation projections under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were obtained from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled climate projections dataset nex gddp thrasher et al 2012 via the google earth engine the nex gddp dataset comprises of statistically downscaled climate scenarios for the entire globe at a spatial resolution of 0 25 25 by 25 km derived from 21 global climate model gcm runs conducted under phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the nex gddp dataset provides daily estimates of precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum for the historical period 1950 2005 and the future period 2006 2099 over the entire globe thrasher et al 2012 from the ensemble of projections derived from 21 gcms the six selected gcms used in this research are listed in table a 3 the selection was done by statistically comparing precipitation trends between each gcm s historical data and the corrected chirps dataset from 01 01 1990 31 12 2005 using the coefficient of determination r 2 r 2 represents the goodness of fit between the observed and simulated data for r 2 a range of 0 5 1 0 represents a good agreement between observed and simulated values the selected gcms precipitation outputs achieved the highest r 2 values which ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 as observed in figure a 1 thus deeming them satisfactory the monthly historical rainfall data from 01 01 1990 31 12 2005 of the selected gcms including their rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projection data from 01 01 2006 31 12 2019 were also bias corrected using the ls method the resulting trends are observed in figs a 2 to a 5 the scaling factor for each gcm model under each rcp scenario was factored into their respective projected precipitation data from 01 01 2020 31 12 2099 2 5 4 physical data the br catchment was delineated into four local municipalities lms viz a newcastle b utrecht c dannhauser and d nquthu physical data inputs included the population capacity and growth rate per lm as given in table a 4 regarding land use characteristics only irrigated agricultural land area per lm was accounted for and are listed in table a 4 the irrigated areas per crop type as seen in fig a 6 were kept constant throughout the study period 2 5 5 hydrologic data the hydrologic parameters used in this study were surface water abstractions w a and reference evapotranspiration et r to quantify w a for each lm within the br catchment annual water requirements for each wtp were used together with domestic irrigation and energy production water demands water requirement data for each wtp and the majuba power station was obtained from umgeni 2020 table a 5 displays each municipality s population s annual domestic water requirements which were used to compute the total domestic water consumption of the catchment maize wheat oats soybeans and ryegrass are the dominant irrigated crops across all lms dard 2015 statssa 2017 as seen in figure a 6 with the irrigation water requirements per crop tabulated in table a 6 for this study irrigation water requirements per crop type per hectare were assumed constant throughout the study period in computing the maximum evapotranspiration et c for irrigated crops et r and crop coefficients k c were used see eq a 1 due to ease of use and availability et r data was obtained from the modis 16 global terrestrial evapotranspiration product mod16 via google earth engine the mod16 global evapotranspiration data is available at a 1 km2 resolution across the 109 03 million km2 vegetated land area at 8 day monthly and annual intervals jiang et al 2020 for the br catchment the 8 day et r data which was the only dataset available in the google earth engine ranged from the period 01 01 2001 31 12 2014 as seen in figure a 7 the 8 day et r is the sum of et r during these 8 day periods in 0 1 kg m 2 thus a conversion factor of 0 1 was applied to obtain et r values in mm per 8 days jiang et al 2020 the data was replicated to cover the period of 1990 2099 under all climate change scenarios as per figure a 8 with an average value of 549 82 mm annum monthly k c values were obtained from savva and frenken 2002 and provided in table a 7 the largest k c value was considered in months when more than one crop was planted in determining the actual evapotranspiration et a which is the amount of water consumed by evapotranspiration in the catchment including water supplied by irrigation the effective precipitation is initially determined effective precipitation percentage p eff is the annual percentage of precipitation available for evapotranspiration the remainder contributes to surface runoff weap initially assumes a value of 100 for p eff i e all precipitation is available for evapotranspiration for this study as part of calibrating and evaluating the weap model see section 2 6 p eff values were adjusted such that the historical streamflow closely matched the catchment s observed streamflow from 1990 to 2019 using equation a 2 the average effective precipitation depth p eff was computed by the weap model therefore in determining the et a the weap model selects the minimum value between the et c and the p eff the average et a was 496 mm annum for the historical period lower than that estimated by dws 2015 of 802 mm annum this is consistent with the assumption that irrigated areas and crops remained unchanged during the study period reservoir storage data such as storage capacity reservoir elevation net evaporation and surface area is also important in computing storage changes s as there are many reservoirs within the br catchment it was impossible to simulate all reservoirs operations therefore it was decided that only government registered dams should be considered the above mentioned data are tabulated in tables a 8 and a 9 2 6 model calibration validation and data analyses as previously mentioned the model was calibrated to produce acceptable streamflow simulations by fine tuning p eff from 1990 to 2019 sieber 2015 the adopted annual variations of p eff for all bias corrected gcm s precipitation are displayed in fig a 9 the p eff variations were replicated throughout the study period during the calibration process monthly chirps and gcm s average ensembles simulated streamflow were compared with the observed streamflow from 01 01 1990 31 12 2019 obtained from station v3h010 buffels river tayside at latitude 28 3 33 55 and longitude 30 22 24 13 dws 2018 for the validation process the precipitation dataset used as input to validate the model was statistically compared with the precipitation used in the calibration process to ensure that there is uniformity in the two datasets in carrying out the statistical analysis the statistical welch test for parametric t tests and the mann whitney test for non parametric t tests mauser et al 2015 were used after checking for the assumption of normality using the shapiro wilks test gyamfi et al 2016 the t tests were carried out fixing the probability α at 5 so that the null assumption the means do not differ is rejected where this is true the observed streamflow data used to validate the model was obtained from station v3h033 buffels river return flow schurvepoort at latitude 27 36 9 65 and longitude 29 56 33 07 dws 2018 and it was compared with the simulated streamflow data from 01 01 1994 31 12 2002 the study applied the following statistical criteria in the evaluation process normalised root mean square error nrmse willmott s 1981 index of agreement d percent bias pbias and the r 2 to assess the model s performance the selected criteria are defined by eqs a 3 to a 6 and in table a 10 the error index nrmse shows the model s performance however it does not indicate the degree of over and under estimation thus d was employed to detect additive and proportional differences between observed and simulated means however due to the squared differences d is over sensitive to extreme values moriasi et al 2007 the pbias which measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts was further utilised the optimal value of pbias is 0 with low values showing that the model simulation is credible positive values indicate under estimation bias and negative values indicate over estimation bias a d of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between measured and predicted values and 0 indicates no agreement moriasi et al 2007 descriptive statistics such as means percent increases relative to the historical scenario and coefficients of variation were used to analyse the model s output data the welsh parametric and the mann whitney non parametric t tests were also carried out to analyse and compare data variability and in cases where three or more datasets were being compared one way anova tests were performed kim 2017 box and whisker plots were also employed to analyse outputs as they can demonstrate dataset stability and general distribution the variations of the minimum and maximum rainfall across the catchment are displayed by the heights of the box plots with the median value shown by the line in the middle of the box plots and outliers indicated by the dots above and or below the boxplots 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation from the box and whisker plots in fig 4 and fig 5 it is evident that the selected gcms bias corrected historical precipitation data follow the trend and spread of the chirps dataset for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios except for the cnrm cm5 model which over simulated the dispersion and extreme rainfall events of the catchment for the rcp4 5 scenario as per fig 4 the projected precipitation trends coincide with the dea 2013b s rcp4 5 statistically downscaled projections for eastern south africa where significant increases in br catchment s rainfall magnitude and variability were projected in the far future however in the near and mid future rainfall patterns are unclear and indicate a general mixed signal of wetter or drier conditions depending on the gcm used under the rcp8 5 scenario as seen in fig 5 similar projections of average increases are found throughout the study period however the near future scenario is the exception where 5 out of 6 gcms projected a decline in precipitation compared with the chirps data to investigate the overall projected climate changes in the br catchment the multi model ensemble mean approach was adopted tramblay et al 2018 hadri et al 2022 whereby the projected changes of the 6 gcms were averaged annually under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the near and mid future periods the average ensemble of the rcp4 5 scenario projected precipitation to remain within the historical range with map increases of 0 06 and 0 32 respectively decreases in variability are also modelled in the aforementioned timeframes for rcp4 5 shown by the coefficient of variation cv decreasing slightly from a historical value of 7 9 6 5 and 6 7 respectively however for the far future timeframe a slight increase in rainfall is projected as the percent increase of map is 3 4 increased variability is also noted by the cv value increasing to 7 1 the average ensemble of the rcp8 5 scenario projected a slight decrease in the amount of precipitation received by the catchment in the near future with a map percentage decrease of 2 resulting in an overall map value of 787 mm the rainfall variations amplified slightly during this timeframe as the cv increased from a historical value of 7 9 8 1 increases in precipitation magnitude and fluctuations in the mid and far future are more prominent than in the rcp4 5 scenario with the percentage increase of map being 4 3 and 5 4 respectively and the cv value reaching 8 5 in both periods from the box and whisker plot in fig 6 a positive skewness resulted in the far future signifying that the frequency of low rainfall occurrences 825 mm lower than the average of 845 mm is expected to increase it is also important to highlight the widened lengths of the 75th and 90th quartile whiskers in the far future which reflect an anticipated increase in the magnitude of extreme wet events a statistical analysis was carried out to compare the gcms precipitation output ensembles for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 shown in table 2 findings indicated that there is no significant difference between the scenarios results furthermore one way anova kruskal wallis tests were run to examine if there is any significant variability in the data kruskal and wallis 1952 from each rcp scenario s four timeframes historical near future mid future and far future the rcp4 5 produced a p value of 0 255 indicating that there is no significant difference within its dataset throughout the study period the rcp8 5 scenario on the other hand yielded a p value of 0 01 indicating a significant difference within its dataset attributable to its mid and far future fluctuation increases 3 2 evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration et a was the largest component of the water budget represented by the model fig 7 shows that low et a values are under simulated for all gcm models compared to the chirps dataset overall the average ensembles of et a projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios maintained a value of 4500 mm3 annum small declines in et a are only noted in the near future under the rcp8 5 scenario as the percentage decrease was 2 this being a consequence of the decline in precipitation projected in the same timeframe there is a strong correlation between precipitation and et a fluctuations for the rcp4 5 scenario the et a s cv declined from a historical value of 10 7 5 and 7 9 in the near and mid future respectively however the et a s cv increased to 9 in the far future the rcp8 5 scenario s cv slightly increased in the near future from a historical value of 8 5 8 6 and then it declined in the mid and far future to 8 1 and 8 4 respectively the decline is to be noted as a result of the increased frequency of low precipitation events 3 3 surface runoff and streamflow when compared to the surface runoff r simulated using the chirps historical precipitation fig 8 shows over simulated r values under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the over simulation is however statistically insignificant after performing the shapiro wilk normality test all three datasets exhibited a normal distribution the welch s anova f test liu 2015 was therefore performed on the chirps and all gcm output data which produced a p value of 0 17 for r projections as seen in figs 9 and 10 r is constant throughout the study period under the rcp4 5 scenario with an average value of 3330 mm3 annum however significant increases are observed in the far future with the mean r being 3566 mm3 annum the cv displays a decreasing trend as it dropped from a historical value of 19 to 17 in the near future and 15 in both the mid and far future timeframes r projections under the rcp8 5 scenarios display decreasing fluctuations in the near future the cv dropped from a historical value of 19 16 however the mean remained unchanged as it is 3315 mm3 annum for the mid and far future notable increases in both magnitude and fluctuations are projected the mean values increased by 0 6 and 8 to 3698 and 3815 mm3 annum respectively and the cv also increased to 21 and 17 respectively after computing surface water abstractions w a which are discussed in section 3 4 and return flows a streamflow graph was produced by the weap model of each river s nodes and reaches in the water balance computation the streamflow at the br s outlet q is considered projections for q values under the rcp4 5 scenario display slight increases in the near and mid future as the annual averages increase from a historical value of 3028 mm3 annum to 3034 and 3046 mm3 annum respectively as per the precipitation and r projection trends q also increased rapidly in the far future with the percentage increase shooting up from a mid future value of 0 6 8 in the far future and the annual average q being 3267 mm3 annum the rcp8 5 scenario displays the highest q averages under the mid and far future timeframes as seen in fig 11 a very slight decline by 2 in the annual average q is projected in the near future from a historical value of 3081 3024 mm3 annum moreover increases by 13 and 14 are projected in the mid and far future timeframes respectively these increases in magnitude were accompanied by increased fluctuations as the cv increased from 17 in the near future to 22 and 18 in the mid and far future respectively the box and whisker plot for the far future timeframe also displays a positive skewness of 1 105 indicating anticipated increased events of high value streamflow exiting the catchment this is mainly attributed to increased precipitation values as well as low magnitude and variability in et a values during this period these results are consistent with the research findings by graham et al 2011 dea 2013a and schütte et al 2022 which projected that the rcp8 5 cc scenario would increase q in kzn 3 4 water abstractions as previously mentioned in addition to et a and q w a were considered an outflow component of the water balance the br system s bulk water supplies wtps were modelled to require 63 mm3 annum in order to function at their optimum capacity as seen in fig b 1 similar to the umgeni 2019 umgeni 2020 value of 61 8 mm3 annum the total primary water demands that the br system s wtps transfer water to i e energy production domestic and irrigation water demands were estimated to increase from approximately 108 mm3 annum in 1990 to 197 mm3 annum in 2099 as per fig 12 domestic water demands which were projected to increase in line with the lms population growth rates produced satisfactory and similar results when compared to study findings from recent reports as shown in table 3 it should be noted that for the nquthu lm only area 2 and area 5 are dependent on the br catchment for water supplies shabalala and mthembu 2022 of the above mentioned water demands the average w a from the br catchment s raw water supplies i e rivers and reservoirs range from 113 mm3 annum to 115 mm3 annum as per fig 13 when taking a closer look at the monthly distribution of these w a under the worst case climate change scenario rcp8 5 also seen in fig 13 approximately 40 constitute of water supplied to the ngagane wtp mainly because it is the primary supplier of numerous water demand sites in the catchment including the densely populated newcastle lm also the majuba power station abstracts 100 of its water demands which are approximately 23 of w a due to it being the primary demand site assigned at the zaaihoek dam in terms of lms newcastle is expected to extract the majority of water supplies which is attributable to its rapidly increasing population that forms 53 of the total domestic water demands such outcomes are also reflected under the rcp4 5 climate scenario as per fig b 2 with the br system only allowing maximum w a of 118 mm3 annum throughout the study period as per fig 13 and b 9 unmet demands are therefore anticipated to be exacerbated in the catchment from 90 mm3 annum in the historical timeframe to 135 mm3 annum in the far future this is understood to be a result of the limitations imposed by the storage capacity of the br catchment which does not capture the increased precipitation received throughout the 21st century and also confirms findings from the umgeni 2020 which state that the br catchment s water storage capacity is not sufficient to provide the increasing demands of the catchment 3 5 changes in surface water store the hydrological water balance components for the br catchment developed from the weap model under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are summarised in tables b 1 and b 2 respectively when compared to the historical surface water storage s n trends simulated with the chirps data which yielded a cv of 28 9 both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 historical average ensembles displayed slightly lower variations see fig 14 with the cv being 22 this is due to the average ensembles precipitation values under both rcp scenarios also consisting of lower fluctuations than the chirps historical average from fig 15 and also in tables b 1 and b 2 the annual projections of s n indicate slight increases in magnitude and decreased variations more so in the far future whereby the average s n is expected to increase by 8 under both climate scenarios relative to the historical average of 260 mm3 annum and cv values are projected to decline by 7 and 8 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively this is also anticipated as a result of increased precipitation which is likely to increase the frequency with which reservoirs are recharged however as also observed in fig 15 these changes in water storage are similar to those of the historical timeframe and are minimal as compared to the precipitation increases expected towards the end of the 21st century such findings also reflect the inadequacies and limitations imposed by the water storage facilities of the catchment in capturing the increased precipitation causing increased q and unmet demands throughout the projection period 3 6 model performance evaluation the precipitation datasets utilised in the calibration and validation processes displayed no statistical difference as seen in table 4 and the performance measures also indicated a very good performance of the weap model in the br catchment for streamflow simulation at a monthly scale in the first instance of model calibration the model s performance was satisfactory as evidenced by the model performance statistics table 5 however the model over simulated streamflow under the chirps dataset and the average ensemble of the gcms under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios as seen in fig 16 this is also indicated by the pbias values ranging from 19 62 to 24 17 the over simulation could be attributed to the use of 8 day et a data in the water balance computation which had to be disaggregated evenly across 8 days to obtain daily et a values this method of calculating monthly et a values during the data input process could be one of the causes of overestimated streamflow however the evaluation statistics all qualify as satisfactory under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 gcms average ensembles the model s simulated streamflow displayed the least correlation when compared to the observed with the r 2 values being 0 7614 and 0 805 respectively and the nrmse values being 40 77 and 44 25 respectively after validation the model s performance was deemed to be very good an improvement in the streamflow simulation was observed as seen in fig 17 which yielded positive pbias values ranging from 8 94 to 18 43 in terms of correlation among the streamflow trends the model produced streamflow values with improved correlation when compared to the observed as the nrmse values decreased from a range of 22 32 44 25 during calibration to a range of 2 674 5 51 4 limitations according to the study findings the br catchment is a high rainfall region expected to receive more rainfall under the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios using statistically downscaled precipitation projections which lack high resolution data to base their downscaling limits the findings however from the weap model performance evaluation statistics the bias correction method applied to the precipitation projections produced suitable precipitation results reflective of the catchment s hydrology it is worth remembering that for the purpose of this study groundwater recharge was not modelled additional limitations include the assumption of uniform reference evapotranspiration under all scenarios and constant irrigated areas and irrigation water requirements throughout the study period as such these limits must be taken into account when employing the simulated runoff values produced by this weap model configuration as a result the simulated runoff values are recommended for comparison purposes including comparing runoff generated under various rcp scenarios gcms and time periods 5 conclusion and recommendations the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of climate change on surface water availability in the buffalo river catchment various future scenarios were developed by acquiring the catchment s historical and climate model output data these were integrated into the weap model which evaluated the catchment s available surface water under all scenarios the findings under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are coherent and suggest that mean annual precipitation is expected to increase under climate change consequently inducing increased evapotranspiration and surface runoff increased magnitudes of droughts and floods are also anticipated under climate change and as such larger variations in surface runoff and reservoir storage were modelled through recharge during periods of peak flood extreme wet events climate change is expected to increase surface water availability the weap model s accuracy depends on the amount of available information and the degree of detailedness thus it is highly recommended that future works improve the accuracy of details used in simulating hydrological processes using the weap model even with the increased surface water availability unmet demands are anticipated to increase in the catchment the study s results also revealed that the bulk of the catchment s precipitation is converted to evapotranspiration surface runoff at the outlet of the catchment is projected to increase under climate change therefore it is recommended that the catchment s surface water storage capacity be increased water storage capacity can be optimised through the expansion and construction of new water treatment facilities and using various water harvesting technologies such as micro dams ponds weirs and check dams such projects do however need to take into consideration the maintenance of environmental flows needed to maintain river ecosystems in promoting integrated resource management the wef nexus approach can be applied in this case for designing multi purpose reservoirs which can be operated not only for increased water supply but also for hydropower generation maintenance of navigation depths and flood management multi purpose dams also increase irrigation diversions as well as intensifying small holder agriculture in planning and designing of multi purpose reservoirs there are trade offs that do need to be addressed such as the negative effect hydropower generation has on water quality through a increased water temperatures and b an altered sediment regime which consequently disturbs river ecosystems and poses a risk of waterborne diseases therefore applying the wef nexus approach will assist in detecting trade offs and formulating strategies that minimise their materialisation with cc expected to increase the fluctuation of surface water availability it is also recommended that integrated catchment management strategies that holistically view land use interests and understand inherent trade offs within the system be put into effect in partnership with water users and the community this includes discussing and designing management approaches to meet demands for food production and ecosystem services in the context of limited land resources climate change and ecosystem degradation for such there are significant trade offs that need to be addressed expansion of agricultural lands to meet short and long term societal needs necessitates more land and water resulting in a larger water footprint less available water for domestic consumption and increased deforestation which deteriorates water quality curtailing agricultural land expansion would thus require increased yields per hectare but this might demand rigorous usage of pesticides and fertilisers which might degrades water quality through run off and nitrate pollution and thus plummets the ecosystem s health the wef nexus approach could therefore be used to improve food production sustainably through the investigation of technological and policy measures such as designing conservation and climate smart agricultural techniques and improved irrigation systems focused on increasing water productivity and or average yield without affecting water quality the performance of the weap model was assessed statistically and the results indicate a sufficient model fit this study s findings illustrate the wef nexus clew complex relationships particularly the examined relationship between climate and water availability in its ability to do so the wef nexus has proven capable of systematically analysing integrating and managing the challenges brought upon by climate change on water resources in a sustainable manner through the use of other wef nexus quantitative and conceptual analytical tools and frameworks credit authorship contribution statement conceptualization n

7716,study region the buffalo river br catchment kwazulu natal south africa study focus due to the vast majority of the br catchment s water demands not being fully satisfied in recent years studies investigating potential climate change impacts on the catchment s water supply availability are needed the study s objective was to therefore assess climate change induced surface water availability swa variations in the br catchment from 2020 to 2100 to achieve this the hydrologic water evaluation and planning model was forced with the catchment s physical and hydrological data and projected climate data from an ensemble of gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios from cmip5 new hydrological insights for the region the study findings projected increased precipitation especially in the far future 2070 2100 whereby mean annual precipitation increased by 5 to 8286 mm3 annum under the worst case climate change scenario rcp8 5 with evapotranspiration and water abstractions averaging 4500 mm3 annum and 115 mm3 annum respectively surface runoff and swa increased by 8 and 10 yielding averages of 3265 mm3 annum and 287 mm3 annum respectively even with the increased swa unmet demands also increased by 113 towards the end of the 21st century as the study established that climate change might exacerbate the br catchment s water supply system s insufficiency to meet growing demands such

and simulate future scenarios for decision support in planning mcnamara et al 2018 for water and basin management the use of water balance models has recently increased especially in cc impact studies and for the simulation of different environmental processes parra et al 2018 the water evaluation and planning weap system model developed by the stockholm environment institute sei is an integrated approach used to simulate both natural and engineered hydrological components of a water system s demands and supplies sieber 2015 the weap model is classified as an iwrm tool due to its water centric nature tena et al 2019 however since weap is designed to interact with other models it is used as a wef nexus qat through integration with food and energy centric models this gave rise to the climate land use energy and water strategies clews wef nexus modelling framework howells et al 2013 used internationally and within africa to introduce integrated land and water management the government of rwanda for example is currently developing plans for four selected demonstration catchments using the weap modelling tool droogers et al 2017 the island of mauritius also utilised the weap model for simulating river systems in 60 catchments to assess the implications of local municipal and agricultural water requirements on national water supply schemes welsch et al 2014 several water availability and management studies were performed in south africa using the weap model for example levite et al 2003 evaluated the usefulness of weap in assessing water demand management scenarios in the steelpoort sub catchment of the olifants river through the analyses of simulated catchments met and unmet demands arranz and mccartney 2007 used weap to assess the impacts of likely future water use on the water resources of the olifants catchment haji 2011 investigated the effects of future cc on meeting the water demands of different consumers in the upper vaal river basin using the weap model these studies concluded that weap is useful for water resources assessment in south african catchments and for a holistic view of an entire river basin the buffalo river br catchment is a sub catchment of the thukela water management area whose water source is in the drakensberg region the br catchment is characterised as a relatively high runoff sub catchment dlamini and schulze 2006 that supplies water to numerous sectors including irrigation power generation domestic mining and bulk industries statssa 2010 there have been severe droughts in past years especially during 2015 2016 which consequently affected the livelihoods and socio economic activities of local and surrounding communities as well as the capability of the catchment s water supply system to meet its water demands umgeni 2020 thus an integrated surface water availability assessments is essential in such cases for the effective and responsible management of water resources tena et al 2019 previous studies that investigated the long term changes of the water supply demand relationship within the br catchment primarily focused on whether current water supplies are sufficient to meet projected population demand rather than how climate change may influence and change the quantity of water stored and made available to users dwaf 2003 dwa 2011 umgeni 2016 2020 to our knowledge a detailed climate change and water resources analysis has not been undertaken for the br catchment umgeni 2020 therefore the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of cc on surface water availability in the br catchment it is difficult to predict and quantify the exact available surface water and water balance hence a scenario analysis was chosen as the most appropriate approach to meet the objective using the weap modelling tool 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the br catchment covering an estimated area of 9 803 km2 has minimum latitude and maximum longitude values of 28 42 59 s and 30 38 30 e respectively umgeni 2020 the catchment is situated in a warm and humid region that receives most of its annual rainfall during summer as per fig 1 the br is the main northern tributary of the uthukela river it flows approximately 339 km south easterly from the eastern escarpment newcastle area through the amajuba and umzinyathi district municipalities then confluences with the uthukela river in the msinga local municipality dlamini and mostert 2019 umgeni 2020 the predominant land cover in the br catchment is grassland 58 followed by cultivated land 22 as seen in fig 2 umgeni 2020 grassland is mostly utilised for the grazing of livestock inr 2019 commercial scale production of maize soybean and wheat dominates the upper catchment region with irrigated production mainly taking place in the fertile region of the western newcastle local municipality statssa 2017 lgccp 2018 commercial and subsistence farming under rainfed conditions is more prominent in the br catchment s middle and lower southern regions statssa 2017 2 2 hydrological characteristics the hydrological characteristics of the br catchment are summarised in table 1 the upper tertiary catchment v31 where the slang incandu and ingagane rivers are located generates the largest mean annual runoff of 119 mm dws 2015 umgeni 2020 this can be mainly attributed to the high rainfall and steeper gradient of the drakensberg mountains regions umgeni 2020 however mean annual runoff trends have been noted to decrease as the br traverses to the middle v32 and lower v33 regions yielding 73 and 64 mm annum respectively dws 2015 umgeni 2020 2 3 surface water infrastructure the total supply capacity of the br catchment s existing surface water infrastructure is approximately 405 mm3 providing a hydrological yield of 136 9 mm3 annum unspecified assurance level the ntshingwayo dam contributes significantly to the water supply with a full supply capacity of 211 mm3 and yield of 59 mm3 annum as well as the zaaihoek dam with a full supply capacity of 185 mm3 and yield of 54 mm3 annum umgeni 2020 the br catchment s water supply system br system also includes eight water treatment plants wtp which as listed in table a 1 extract water from supply sources and distribute it to their designated supply areas other wtps within the br system such as the charlestown wtp are primarily supplied by groundwater sources and distribute approximately 440 kl day to their respective water demand sites umgeni 2020 due to the lack of data availability related to the location and distribution of these groundwater resources the aforementioned wtps were not included in this study 2 4 weap model description the weap model is an innovative integrated modelling software that offers a detailed dynamic and user friendly framework for establishing water balances scenario generation planning and policy analysis ayele 2016 tena et al 2019 the model was developed for integrated water resources planning tena et al 2019 and can be applied to municipal and agricultural systems and to a single catchment or a complex transboundary river basin system ayele 2016 the weap model simulates a wide range of natural and engineered components of the aforementioned systems from precipitation to streamflow reservoirs groundwater discharge and water demand and supply agarwal et al 2018 2 4 1 weap model water balance computation the weap model was used to simulate the water balance components in eq 1 sieber 2015 using climate physical and hydrological inputs from the br catchment and the modelling process used is visualised in fig 3 actual evapotranspiration included evaporation losses from vegetation and open water bodies streamflow comprised of surface runoff only i e no groundwater contributions hence the impact of groundwater recharge on reservoir storage was assumed negligible however it is important to note that there are five hydrogeological units comprising one primary and four secondary type aquifers within the br catchment they exhibit moderate potential to provide mean yields of 0 9 2 7 l per second l s via boreholes of 30 60 m deep umgeni 2020 thus various water supply schemes within the br catchment rely solely on groundwater supply from boreholes 1 p e x et a q w a s wherep precipitation mm3 annum e x external flows mm3 annum et a actual evapotranspiration mm3 annum q streamflow buffalo river outlet mm3 annum w a abstractions mm3 annum s change in reservoir storage mm3 annum there are five methods which weap can be used for water resources simulation a the rainfall runoff and b irrigation demands only versions of the simplified coefficient approach c the soil moisture method d the mabia method and e the plant growth model sieber 2015 the rainfall runoff simplified coefficient method was chosen due to the availability of data required by this approach the rainfall runoff method is similar to the irrigation demands only method as they both use crop coefficients to compute potential evapotranspiration in the catchment for the rainfall runoff method the remainder of rainfall not consumed by evapotranspiration is simulated as runoff to a river or can be proportioned among runoff to a river and flow to groundwater via runoff infiltration links it does not however track soil moisture changes sieber 2015 the concept of water balance is based on mass conservation principles in a closed system sieber 2015 and includes all water inflows and outflows in a catchment area tena et al 2019 2 4 2 weap model scenario computation a scenario is a plausible depiction of how the future may unfold based on a detailed and scientifically sound set of assumptions regarding key interconnections and driving factors arranz and mccartney 2007 as it is impossible to forecast exactly how water demands and other variables affecting water supplies could change in the future scenarios were employed in this study initially a current account of the br catchment was created in the weap model the current accounts represents the basic definition of the water system as it currently exists by providing a snapshot of actual water demands resources and supplies for the system using historical data it forms the foundation of all scenarios sieber 2015 the representative concentration pathways rcps which are scenarios developed for the climate modelling community as a basis for near and long term modelling experiments vuuren et al 2011 are named according to radiative forcing target levels for 2100 as per table a 2 this study used the following three scenarios to evaluate cc impacts on surface water availability in the br catchment which are further elaborated on later section 2 5 3 a the baseline scenario which reflects historical climate conditions and utilised for comparison purposes against rcp scenarios b the rcp4 5 scenario which is a stabilisation scenario that assumes climate policies are invoked to limit emissions and radiative forcing thompson et al 2011 carbon emissions peak at mid century at around 50 higher than the historical levels wayne 2013 c the rcp8 5 scenario is a high emission scenario based on no policy driven mitigation vuuren et al 2011 emissions continue to increase rapidly through the early and mid parts of the century carbon dioxide concentration accelerates and reaches 1370 ppm by 2100 vuuren et al 2011 2 5 weap model input data 2 5 1 buffalo river catchment schematic in weap using gis based vector data a schematic of the br catchment was created in the weap model fig 1 the vector layers included a kwazulu natal kzn secondary drainage regions b kzn district municipalities c river network of the amajuba and umzinyathi district municipalities and d dams within the amajuba and umzinyathi district municipalities all vector layers were obtained from dws 2016 and their attribute data were further sorted using esri s arcgis software version 10 6 0 8321 released on 17 july 2018 for the purpose of computing the rates and quantities of water recharge and abstraction thirteen demand nodes were created for the br system s demand analysis every demand node corresponds to a particular group of water consumers four represent the municipal demand domestic and irrigation water demand eight represent wtps and one represents the energy demands all water demand nodes depend on surface water resources only the weap model was run at the monthly time step with the hydrological year starting in october and ending in september 2 5 2 historical climate data the input precipitation data used in weap to simulate historical and current catchment conditions were obtained from the climate hazards group infra red precipitation with station dataset chirps funk et al 2015 the chirps dataset builds on previous approaches to smart interpolation and high resolution techniques where precipitation estimates are based on infra red cold cloud duration ccd observations funk et al 2015 the algorithm uses satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations and provides daily pentadal and monthly rainfall estimates from 1981 to the near present at a 0 05º spatial resolution since the projections timeframe for this study spans from 01 01 2020 31 12 2099 data for a 30 year baseline period wmo 2021 was acquired for the entire boundary of the br catchment from 01 01 1990 31 12 2019 using 0 05º pixels of the chirps gridded data to ensure that the chirps dataset represented the catchment s climate conditions it was bias corrected using the linear scaling ls method as demonstrated in eq 2 the ls bias correction method was selected as it preserves the mean signal of the observed variable and yields very good hydrological performance when applied under a monthly approach ghimire et al 2018 the scaling factor was derived using the catchment s observed map of 802 mm obtained from umgeni 2020 with the chirps map of 722 03 mm gudmundsson et al 2012 2 p corr p raw cf where p corr bias corrected precipitation mm p raw raw precipitation data mm cf scaling factor map observed data map raw data the resulting historical annual precipitation values increased over time with the lowest values of 645 584 and 574 mm noted in the years 1992 2003 and 2015 respectively this coincides with the findings by dube and jury 2003 and ndlovu and demlie 2020 which highlighted the droughts experienced in the kzn province during these years an extreme peak in precipitation was modelled for the year 1995 which aligns with ndlovu and demlie 2020 observation that northern kzn had extremely wet conditions in 1995 ndlovu and demlie 2020 also stated that there were more extreme dry conditions than wet ones during the historical period which is mirrored in the outcomes of this study 2 5 3 future climate projections the precipitation projections under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were obtained from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled climate projections dataset nex gddp thrasher et al 2012 via the google earth engine the nex gddp dataset comprises of statistically downscaled climate scenarios for the entire globe at a spatial resolution of 0 25 25 by 25 km derived from 21 global climate model gcm runs conducted under phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the nex gddp dataset provides daily estimates of precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum for the historical period 1950 2005 and the future period 2006 2099 over the entire globe thrasher et al 2012 from the ensemble of projections derived from 21 gcms the six selected gcms used in this research are listed in table a 3 the selection was done by statistically comparing precipitation trends between each gcm s historical data and the corrected chirps dataset from 01 01 1990 31 12 2005 using the coefficient of determination r 2 r 2 represents the goodness of fit between the observed and simulated data for r 2 a range of 0 5 1 0 represents a good agreement between observed and simulated values the selected gcms precipitation outputs achieved the highest r 2 values which ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 as observed in figure a 1 thus deeming them satisfactory the monthly historical rainfall data from 01 01 1990 31 12 2005 of the selected gcms including their rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projection data from 01 01 2006 31 12 2019 were also bias corrected using the ls method the resulting trends are observed in figs a 2 to a 5 the scaling factor for each gcm model under each rcp scenario was factored into their respective projected precipitation data from 01 01 2020 31 12 2099 2 5 4 physical data the br catchment was delineated into four local municipalities lms viz a newcastle b utrecht c dannhauser and d nquthu physical data inputs included the population capacity and growth rate per lm as given in table a 4 regarding land use characteristics only irrigated agricultural land area per lm was accounted for and are listed in table a 4 the irrigated areas per crop type as seen in fig a 6 were kept constant throughout the study period 2 5 5 hydrologic data the hydrologic parameters used in this study were surface water abstractions w a and reference evapotranspiration et r to quantify w a for each lm within the br catchment annual water requirements for each wtp were used together with domestic irrigation and energy production water demands water requirement data for each wtp and the majuba power station was obtained from umgeni 2020 table a 5 displays each municipality s population s annual domestic water requirements which were used to compute the total domestic water consumption of the catchment maize wheat oats soybeans and ryegrass are the dominant irrigated crops across all lms dard 2015 statssa 2017 as seen in figure a 6 with the irrigation water requirements per crop tabulated in table a 6 for this study irrigation water requirements per crop type per hectare were assumed constant throughout the study period in computing the maximum evapotranspiration et c for irrigated crops et r and crop coefficients k c were used see eq a 1 due to ease of use and availability et r data was obtained from the modis 16 global terrestrial evapotranspiration product mod16 via google earth engine the mod16 global evapotranspiration data is available at a 1 km2 resolution across the 109 03 million km2 vegetated land area at 8 day monthly and annual intervals jiang et al 2020 for the br catchment the 8 day et r data which was the only dataset available in the google earth engine ranged from the period 01 01 2001 31 12 2014 as seen in figure a 7 the 8 day et r is the sum of et r during these 8 day periods in 0 1 kg m 2 thus a conversion factor of 0 1 was applied to obtain et r values in mm per 8 days jiang et al 2020 the data was replicated to cover the period of 1990 2099 under all climate change scenarios as per figure a 8 with an average value of 549 82 mm annum monthly k c values were obtained from savva and frenken 2002 and provided in table a 7 the largest k c value was considered in months when more than one crop was planted in determining the actual evapotranspiration et a which is the amount of water consumed by evapotranspiration in the catchment including water supplied by irrigation the effective precipitation is initially determined effective precipitation percentage p eff is the annual percentage of precipitation available for evapotranspiration the remainder contributes to surface runoff weap initially assumes a value of 100 for p eff i e all precipitation is available for evapotranspiration for this study as part of calibrating and evaluating the weap model see section 2 6 p eff values were adjusted such that the historical streamflow closely matched the catchment s observed streamflow from 1990 to 2019 using equation a 2 the average effective precipitation depth p eff was computed by the weap model therefore in determining the et a the weap model selects the minimum value between the et c and the p eff the average et a was 496 mm annum for the historical period lower than that estimated by dws 2015 of 802 mm annum this is consistent with the assumption that irrigated areas and crops remained unchanged during the study period reservoir storage data such as storage capacity reservoir elevation net evaporation and surface area is also important in computing storage changes s as there are many reservoirs within the br catchment it was impossible to simulate all reservoirs operations therefore it was decided that only government registered dams should be considered the above mentioned data are tabulated in tables a 8 and a 9 2 6 model calibration validation and data analyses as previously mentioned the model was calibrated to produce acceptable streamflow simulations by fine tuning p eff from 1990 to 2019 sieber 2015 the adopted annual variations of p eff for all bias corrected gcm s precipitation are displayed in fig a 9 the p eff variations were replicated throughout the study period during the calibration process monthly chirps and gcm s average ensembles simulated streamflow were compared with the observed streamflow from 01 01 1990 31 12 2019 obtained from station v3h010 buffels river tayside at latitude 28 3 33 55 and longitude 30 22 24 13 dws 2018 for the validation process the precipitation dataset used as input to validate the model was statistically compared with the precipitation used in the calibration process to ensure that there is uniformity in the two datasets in carrying out the statistical analysis the statistical welch test for parametric t tests and the mann whitney test for non parametric t tests mauser et al 2015 were used after checking for the assumption of normality using the shapiro wilks test gyamfi et al 2016 the t tests were carried out fixing the probability α at 5 so that the null assumption the means do not differ is rejected where this is true the observed streamflow data used to validate the model was obtained from station v3h033 buffels river return flow schurvepoort at latitude 27 36 9 65 and longitude 29 56 33 07 dws 2018 and it was compared with the simulated streamflow data from 01 01 1994 31 12 2002 the study applied the following statistical criteria in the evaluation process normalised root mean square error nrmse willmott s 1981 index of agreement d percent bias pbias and the r 2 to assess the model s performance the selected criteria are defined by eqs a 3 to a 6 and in table a 10 the error index nrmse shows the model s performance however it does not indicate the degree of over and under estimation thus d was employed to detect additive and proportional differences between observed and simulated means however due to the squared differences d is over sensitive to extreme values moriasi et al 2007 the pbias which measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts was further utilised the optimal value of pbias is 0 with low values showing that the model simulation is credible positive values indicate under estimation bias and negative values indicate over estimation bias a d of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between measured and predicted values and 0 indicates no agreement moriasi et al 2007 descriptive statistics such as means percent increases relative to the historical scenario and coefficients of variation were used to analyse the model s output data the welsh parametric and the mann whitney non parametric t tests were also carried out to analyse and compare data variability and in cases where three or more datasets were being compared one way anova tests were performed kim 2017 box and whisker plots were also employed to analyse outputs as they can demonstrate dataset stability and general distribution the variations of the minimum and maximum rainfall across the catchment are displayed by the heights of the box plots with the median value shown by the line in the middle of the box plots and outliers indicated by the dots above and or below the boxplots 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation from the box and whisker plots in fig 4 and fig 5 it is evident that the selected gcms bias corrected historical precipitation data follow the trend and spread of the chirps dataset for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios except for the cnrm cm5 model which over simulated the dispersion and extreme rainfall events of the catchment for the rcp4 5 scenario as per fig 4 the projected precipitation trends coincide with the dea 2013b s rcp4 5 statistically downscaled projections for eastern south africa where significant increases in br catchment s rainfall magnitude and variability were projected in the far future however in the near and mid future rainfall patterns are unclear and indicate a general mixed signal of wetter or drier conditions depending on the gcm used under the rcp8 5 scenario as seen in fig 5 similar projections of average increases are found throughout the study period however the near future scenario is the exception where 5 out of 6 gcms projected a decline in precipitation compared with the chirps data to investigate the overall projected climate changes in the br catchment the multi model ensemble mean approach was adopted tramblay et al 2018 hadri et al 2022 whereby the projected changes of the 6 gcms were averaged annually under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the near and mid future periods the average ensemble of the rcp4 5 scenario projected precipitation to remain within the historical range with map increases of 0 06 and 0 32 respectively decreases in variability are also modelled in the aforementioned timeframes for rcp4 5 shown by the coefficient of variation cv decreasing slightly from a historical value of 7 9 6 5 and 6 7 respectively however for the far future timeframe a slight increase in rainfall is projected as the percent increase of map is 3 4 increased variability is also noted by the cv value increasing to 7 1 the average ensemble of the rcp8 5 scenario projected a slight decrease in the amount of precipitation received by the catchment in the near future with a map percentage decrease of 2 resulting in an overall map value of 787 mm the rainfall variations amplified slightly during this timeframe as the cv increased from a historical value of 7 9 8 1 increases in precipitation magnitude and fluctuations in the mid and far future are more prominent than in the rcp4 5 scenario with the percentage increase of map being 4 3 and 5 4 respectively and the cv value reaching 8 5 in both periods from the box and whisker plot in fig 6 a positive skewness resulted in the far future signifying that the frequency of low rainfall occurrences 825 mm lower than the average of 845 mm is expected to increase it is also important to highlight the widened lengths of the 75th and 90th quartile whiskers in the far future which reflect an anticipated increase in the magnitude of extreme wet events a statistical analysis was carried out to compare the gcms precipitation output ensembles for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 shown in table 2 findings indicated that there is no significant difference between the scenarios results furthermore one way anova kruskal wallis tests were run to examine if there is any significant variability in the data kruskal and wallis 1952 from each rcp scenario s four timeframes historical near future mid future and far future the rcp4 5 produced a p value of 0 255 indicating that there is no significant difference within its dataset throughout the study period the rcp8 5 scenario on the other hand yielded a p value of 0 01 indicating a significant difference within its dataset attributable to its mid and far future fluctuation increases 3 2 evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration et a was the largest component of the water budget represented by the model fig 7 shows that low et a values are under simulated for all gcm models compared to the chirps dataset overall the average ensembles of et a projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios maintained a value of 4500 mm3 annum small declines in et a are only noted in the near future under the rcp8 5 scenario as the percentage decrease was 2 this being a consequence of the decline in precipitation projected in the same timeframe there is a strong correlation between precipitation and et a fluctuations for the rcp4 5 scenario the et a s cv declined from a historical value of 10 7 5 and 7 9 in the near and mid future respectively however the et a s cv increased to 9 in the far future the rcp8 5 scenario s cv slightly increased in the near future from a historical value of 8 5 8 6 and then it declined in the mid and far future to 8 1 and 8 4 respectively the decline is to be noted as a result of the increased frequency of low precipitation events 3 3 surface runoff and streamflow when compared to the surface runoff r simulated using the chirps historical precipitation fig 8 shows over simulated r values under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the over simulation is however statistically insignificant after performing the shapiro wilk normality test all three datasets exhibited a normal distribution the welch s anova f test liu 2015 was therefore performed on the chirps and all gcm output data which produced a p value of 0 17 for r projections as seen in figs 9 and 10 r is constant throughout the study period under the rcp4 5 scenario with an average value of 3330 mm3 annum however significant increases are observed in the far future with the mean r being 3566 mm3 annum the cv displays a decreasing trend as it dropped from a historical value of 19 to 17 in the near future and 15 in both the mid and far future timeframes r projections under the rcp8 5 scenarios display decreasing fluctuations in the near future the cv dropped from a historical value of 19 16 however the mean remained unchanged as it is 3315 mm3 annum for the mid and far future notable increases in both magnitude and fluctuations are projected the mean values increased by 0 6 and 8 to 3698 and 3815 mm3 annum respectively and the cv also increased to 21 and 17 respectively after computing surface water abstractions w a which are discussed in section 3 4 and return flows a streamflow graph was produced by the weap model of each river s nodes and reaches in the water balance computation the streamflow at the br s outlet q is considered projections for q values under the rcp4 5 scenario display slight increases in the near and mid future as the annual averages increase from a historical value of 3028 mm3 annum to 3034 and 3046 mm3 annum respectively as per the precipitation and r projection trends q also increased rapidly in the far future with the percentage increase shooting up from a mid future value of 0 6 8 in the far future and the annual average q being 3267 mm3 annum the rcp8 5 scenario displays the highest q averages under the mid and far future timeframes as seen in fig 11 a very slight decline by 2 in the annual average q is projected in the near future from a historical value of 3081 3024 mm3 annum moreover increases by 13 and 14 are projected in the mid and far future timeframes respectively these increases in magnitude were accompanied by increased fluctuations as the cv increased from 17 in the near future to 22 and 18 in the mid and far future respectively the box and whisker plot for the far future timeframe also displays a positive skewness of 1 105 indicating anticipated increased events of high value streamflow exiting the catchment this is mainly attributed to increased precipitation values as well as low magnitude and variability in et a values during this period these results are consistent with the research findings by graham et al 2011 dea 2013a and schütte et al 2022 which projected that the rcp8 5 cc scenario would increase q in kzn 3 4 water abstractions as previously mentioned in addition to et a and q w a were considered an outflow component of the water balance the br system s bulk water supplies wtps were modelled to require 63 mm3 annum in order to function at their optimum capacity as seen in fig b 1 similar to the umgeni 2019 umgeni 2020 value of 61 8 mm3 annum the total primary water demands that the br system s wtps transfer water to i e energy production domestic and irrigation water demands were estimated to increase from approximately 108 mm3 annum in 1990 to 197 mm3 annum in 2099 as per fig 12 domestic water demands which were projected to increase in line with the lms population growth rates produced satisfactory and similar results when compared to study findings from recent reports as shown in table 3 it should be noted that for the nquthu lm only area 2 and area 5 are dependent on the br catchment for water supplies shabalala and mthembu 2022 of the above mentioned water demands the average w a from the br catchment s raw water supplies i e rivers and reservoirs range from 113 mm3 annum to 115 mm3 annum as per fig 13 when taking a closer look at the monthly distribution of these w a under the worst case climate change scenario rcp8 5 also seen in fig 13 approximately 40 constitute of water supplied to the ngagane wtp mainly because it is the primary supplier of numerous water demand sites in the catchment including the densely populated newcastle lm also the majuba power station abstracts 100 of its water demands which are approximately 23 of w a due to it being the primary demand site assigned at the zaaihoek dam in terms of lms newcastle is expected to extract the majority of water supplies which is attributable to its rapidly increasing population that forms 53 of the total domestic water demands such outcomes are also reflected under the rcp4 5 climate scenario as per fig b 2 with the br system only allowing maximum w a of 118 mm3 annum throughout the study period as per fig 13 and b 9 unmet demands are therefore anticipated to be exacerbated in the catchment from 90 mm3 annum in the historical timeframe to 135 mm3 annum in the far future this is understood to be a result of the limitations imposed by the storage capacity of the br catchment which does not capture the increased precipitation received throughout the 21st century and also confirms findings from the umgeni 2020 which state that the br catchment s water storage capacity is not sufficient to provide the increasing demands of the catchment 3 5 changes in surface water store the hydrological water balance components for the br catchment developed from the weap model under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are summarised in tables b 1 and b 2 respectively when compared to the historical surface water storage s n trends simulated with the chirps data which yielded a cv of 28 9 both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 historical average ensembles displayed slightly lower variations see fig 14 with the cv being 22 this is due to the average ensembles precipitation values under both rcp scenarios also consisting of lower fluctuations than the chirps historical average from fig 15 and also in tables b 1 and b 2 the annual projections of s n indicate slight increases in magnitude and decreased variations more so in the far future whereby the average s n is expected to increase by 8 under both climate scenarios relative to the historical average of 260 mm3 annum and cv values are projected to decline by 7 and 8 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively this is also anticipated as a result of increased precipitation which is likely to increase the frequency with which reservoirs are recharged however as also observed in fig 15 these changes in water storage are similar to those of the historical timeframe and are minimal as compared to the precipitation increases expected towards the end of the 21st century such findings also reflect the inadequacies and limitations imposed by the water storage facilities of the catchment in capturing the increased precipitation causing increased q and unmet demands throughout the projection period 3 6 model performance evaluation the precipitation datasets utilised in the calibration and validation processes displayed no statistical difference as seen in table 4 and the performance measures also indicated a very good performance of the weap model in the br catchment for streamflow simulation at a monthly scale in the first instance of model calibration the model s performance was satisfactory as evidenced by the model performance statistics table 5 however the model over simulated streamflow under the chirps dataset and the average ensemble of the gcms under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios as seen in fig 16 this is also indicated by the pbias values ranging from 19 62 to 24 17 the over simulation could be attributed to the use of 8 day et a data in the water balance computation which had to be disaggregated evenly across 8 days to obtain daily et a values this method of calculating monthly et a values during the data input process could be one of the causes of overestimated streamflow however the evaluation statistics all qualify as satisfactory under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 gcms average ensembles the model s simulated streamflow displayed the least correlation when compared to the observed with the r 2 values being 0 7614 and 0 805 respectively and the nrmse values being 40 77 and 44 25 respectively after validation the model s performance was deemed to be very good an improvement in the streamflow simulation was observed as seen in fig 17 which yielded positive pbias values ranging from 8 94 to 18 43 in terms of correlation among the streamflow trends the model produced streamflow values with improved correlation when compared to the observed as the nrmse values decreased from a range of 22 32 44 25 during calibration to a range of 2 674 5 51 4 limitations according to the study findings the br catchment is a high rainfall region expected to receive more rainfall under the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios using statistically downscaled precipitation projections which lack high resolution data to base their downscaling limits the findings however from the weap model performance evaluation statistics the bias correction method applied to the precipitation projections produced suitable precipitation results reflective of the catchment s hydrology it is worth remembering that for the purpose of this study groundwater recharge was not modelled additional limitations include the assumption of uniform reference evapotranspiration under all scenarios and constant irrigated areas and irrigation water requirements throughout the study period as such these limits must be taken into account when employing the simulated runoff values produced by this weap model configuration as a result the simulated runoff values are recommended for comparison purposes including comparing runoff generated under various rcp scenarios gcms and time periods 5 conclusion and recommendations the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of climate change on surface water availability in the buffalo river catchment various future scenarios were developed by acquiring the catchment s historical and climate model output data these were integrated into the weap model which evaluated the catchment s available surface water under all scenarios the findings under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are coherent and suggest that mean annual precipitation is expected to increase under climate change consequently inducing increased evapotranspiration and surface runoff increased magnitudes of droughts and floods are also anticipated under climate change and as such larger variations in surface runoff and reservoir storage were modelled through recharge during periods of peak flood extreme wet events climate change is expected to increase surface water availability the weap model s accuracy depends on the amount of available information and the degree of detailedness thus it is highly recommended that future works improve the accuracy of details used in simulating hydrological processes using the weap model even with the increased surface water availability unmet demands are anticipated to increase in the catchment the study s results also revealed that the bulk of the catchment s precipitation is converted to evapotranspiration surface runoff at the outlet of the catchment is projected to increase under climate change therefore it is recommended that the catchment s surface water storage capacity be increased water storage capacity can be optimised through the expansion and construction of new water treatment facilities and using various water harvesting technologies such as micro dams ponds weirs and check dams such projects do however need to take into consideration the maintenance of environmental flows needed to maintain river ecosystems in promoting integrated resource management the wef nexus approach can be applied in this case for designing multi purpose reservoirs which can be operated not only for increased water supply but also for hydropower generation maintenance of navigation depths and flood management multi purpose dams also increase irrigation diversions as well as intensifying small holder agriculture in planning and designing of multi purpose reservoirs there are trade offs that do need to be addressed such as the negative effect hydropower generation has on water quality through a increased water temperatures and b an altered sediment regime which consequently disturbs river ecosystems and poses a risk of waterborne diseases therefore applying the wef nexus approach will assist in detecting trade offs and formulating strategies that minimise their materialisation with cc expected to increase the fluctuation of surface water availability it is also recommended that integrated catchment management strategies that holistically view land use interests and understand inherent trade offs within the system be put into effect in partnership with water users and the community this includes discussing and designing management approaches to meet demands for food production and ecosystem services in the context of limited land resources climate change and ecosystem degradation for such there are significant trade offs that need to be addressed expansion of agricultural lands to meet short and long term societal needs necessitates more land and water resulting in a larger water footprint less available water for domestic consumption and increased deforestation which deteriorates water quality curtailing agricultural land expansion would thus require increased yields per hectare but this might demand rigorous usage of pesticides and fertilisers which might degrades water quality through run off and nitrate pollution and thus plummets the ecosystem s health the wef nexus approach could therefore be used to improve food production sustainably through the investigation of technological and policy measures such as designing conservation and climate smart agricultural techniques and improved irrigation systems focused on increasing water productivity and or average yield without affecting water quality the performance of the weap model was assessed statistically and the results indicate a sufficient model fit this study s findings illustrate the wef nexus clew complex relationships particularly the examined relationship between climate and water availability in its ability to do so the wef nexus has proven capable of systematically analysing integrating and managing the challenges brought upon by climate change on water resources in a sustainable manner through the use of other wef nexus quantitative and conceptual analytical tools and frameworks credit authorship contribution statement conceptualization n

7717,study region lake chaohu is a typically large shallow freshwater lake in china experiencing long term eutrophication and a short period of drought study focus this study employs a three dimensional 3 d hydrodynamic ecological model to assess the impacts of water transfer on lake flow water quality and their relationship and then reveals optimal strategies for achieving improved water quality in lake chaohu new hydrological insights for the region results indicated that clean water transfer could dramatically increase flow rate and decrease nutrient concentrations near the water transfer inlets while the grade level of lake water quality is not changed the degree of improvement in water quality parameters is not always proportional to lake flow rate a clean water transfer through the eastern route zh has the largest improvement effect on the average flow rate and water quality total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp of the entire lake winter water transfer improves tn and tp better than summer while the opposite for ammonia nitrogen nh3 n decrease of wind speed is essential for mitigating nutrient accumulation in western lake s heavily polluted bay through weakening the reverse circulation and the northwest flow water transfer operations are revealed to improve water quality in lake chaohu conduct water transfer through zh in winter strictly control nh3

data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater lake ecosystems play an essential role in water supply agriculture irrigation recreation zone ecological habitats landscaping and flood control due to the rapid socio economic development and human population growth over the past few decades nearly 6 billion people will face water shortages by 2050 wwap 2018 because of the increasing sources of urban wastewater domestic sewage and diffuse agricultural pollution many lakes worldwide have suffered from nutrient pollution and eutrophication mammides 2020 these problems have threatened water supply and aggravated water shortages especially during extreme climatic events z peng et al 2021b globally large scale water transfers are widely implemented to conserve the quality and quantity of freshwater wang et al 2018 bargu et al 2019 lee et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 f peng et al 2021 h h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 y h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 many studies have demonstrated the positive effects of water transfer on receiving water systems such as increasing water exchange and reoxygenation rate supplementing water resources and improving water quality l hu et al 2010 gao et al 2015 y wang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 while some researches showed that although water transfer could dramatically facilitate water exchange in most lake regions its influence on receiving water quality is variable feng et al 2017 tang et al 2021 in addition the increase of external nutrient loads during the water transfer period may cause water quality deterioration in some areas of the receiving lake jin et al 2015 qin et al 2019 chen et al 2020 zhang and wu 2020 y zhuang et al 2021 due to their high implementation costs and varied impacts on lake hydrodynamics and water quality w zhuang 2016 shah et al 2020 it is essential to comprehensively understand the effects of water transfer and determine the most effective operation strategies for improving the hydrodynamic and water quality in the receiving water ecosystems previous studies mainly focused on the effects of water transfer on the changes of water transport time parameters such as water age and water residence time while whether these hydrodynamic parameters can indicate the improvement of water quality is variable in different lakes x zhang et al 2016 tang et al 2018 f peng et al 2021 qi et al 2016 demonstrated that water age was highly correlated with the pattern of chlorophyll a chl a and could be an indicator of the water quality variations in lake poyang while x zhang et al 2016 suggested that water age influences the improvement effectiveness of total phosphorus but not total nitrogen in lake dianchi h h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 indicated that an accelerated inflow rate did not necessarily enable a higher improvement in nh3 n concentration tang et al 2021 also suggested that although water transfer can significantly increase water exchange and reduce residence time in most lake regions in lake wanghu its influence on water quality is variable multiple factors impact the effectiveness of hydrodynamics and water quality in receiving water during water transfer such as transferred inflow rate nutrient concentration routes and time and wind direction and magnitude zhou et al 2020 r xu et al 2020 f peng et al 2021 z peng et al 2021a tang et al 2021 before implementing water transfer it is necessary to evaluate the effects of various impacting factors simultaneously in addition to the transport time parameters water quality parameters such as nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations must be prioritized during water transfer lake chaohu the fifth largest freshwater shallow lake in china is a typical eutrophic lake in the lower reach of the yangtze river basin due to the urban wastewater discharge from hefei city the increasing diffuse point source pollution and the construction of the chaohu sluice in 1962 the lake was subjected to high nitrogen and phosphorus loads and is characterized as hypereutrophic in the west and mesotrophic in the east f xu et al 1999 since the 1990 s several watershed management strategies have been implemented to improve lake water quality in the 2010 s l zhang et al 2021 however lake chaohu continued to experience eutrophication and frequent algal blooms in the summer j li et al 2020 in addition the frequency and severity of drought increased for instance the lake water level decreased to 8 23 m on 28 june 2017 which was 0 91 m lower than the average water level from 2014 to 2020 z peng et al 2021a large external loads and occasional extreme droughts have posed the greatest threat to the security of the water supply the large scale water transfer project has been constructed in the lake chaohu basin since 2017 to alleviate this situation although several studies have investigated the impacts of the joint operation of water transfer and chaohu sluice on lake current and water quality z peng et al 2021a and water transfer on lake water age and residence time huang et al 2016 how the lake water flow and quality respond to water transfer under various impact factors transferred inflow rate time route and wind field is still unknown given the importance of the water transfer project to the lake chaohu ecosystem this study aims to analyze its impacts on lake flow and water quality using a 3 d hydrodynamic ecological model this model thoroughly considers multiple impact factors including transferred inflow rate water quality time routes and wind speed the main objectives are to 1 investigate how different transfer scenarios influence lake flow speed and direction and nutrient distribution 2 clarify the combined effects of the wind field and transfer scenarios on lake flow and water quality 3 analyze the relationship between water flow and quality and 4 reveal reliable water transfer strategies to improve lake water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area covers lake chaohu basin in the central part of anhui province fig 1 lake chaohu has a total lake area of 780 km2 an average depth of 2 7 m a mean water level of 9 2 m above sea level from 2014 to 2020 and a mean water residence time of 168 days wang et al 2020 typically the lake is divided into western central and eastern basins based on the difference of nutrient concentration in both the water and sediment wang et al 2021 fig 1 lake chaohu basin has 33 tributaries among which 14 main rivers are identified and considered in this study the total discharges of hangbu river hb nanfei river nf baishitian river bst and zhegao river zg account for more than 90 of the total inflow wang et al 2020 specifically zhao river zh is occasionally used as an outflow for irrigation the yuxi river yx is the largest outflow connecting the lake to the yangtze river and is regulated by the chaohu sluice with the rapid socio economic development this lake received a total inflow with a mean concentration of 23 2 g tn m 2 yr 1 and 1 3 g tp m 2 yr 1 from 2014 to 2018 wang et al 2020 the annual mean tn and tp concentrations in the lake water were 1 3 6 0 mg l 1 and 0 03 0 42 mg l 1 respectively from 1986 to 2018 and showed a steady trend over the last ten years wang et al 2021 l zhang et al 2021 these numbers indicate that eutrophication is still a significant issue in this lake and new strategies are discussed to find provincial authorities responsible for maintaining the lake s water quality and supply the water transfer project for lake chaohu is conducted through two routes fig 1 the east route zh transfers water from the yangtze river at the fenghuangjing pumping station fht to lake chaohu through the zh sluice the west route bst starts from lake caizi flows through bst and connects to the yangtze river by the chang river the designed water transfer capacity is 150 m3 s 1 for both routes during the dry season a water transfer is occasionally carried out to meet the water supply and navigation demands in lake chaohu from 15 july to 8 august 2017 an emergent water transfer was performed for 24 days the daily average inflow rate ranged from 90 m3 s 1 to 140 m3 s 1 the mean water quality in donating water meets the grade iv for tn 1 5 mg l 1 grade ii for nh3 n 0 5 mg l 1 and grade iii for tp 0 05 mg l 1 according to the chinese environmental water quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 for lakes z peng et al 2021a 2 2 data collection hydrological meteorological and water quality data for lake chaohu in 2013 and 2018 were collected in this study water level and water quality data in these two years were utilized to calibrate model parameters and validate model performance respectively the average water level in 2013 and 2018 is 9 28 m and 8 96 m above the mean sea level of wusong station in the yangtze river estuary respectively representing the high flow and normal flow conditions data from 2018 in the normal flow year were subsequently employed to simulate the impacts of different scenarios on the lake water flow and water quality wind speed direction and solar radiation data at the hourly interval were obtained from the meteorological stations near lake chaohu fig 1 daily precipitation evaporation data water level and discharge of tributaries were obtained through fixed stations or determined according to the two stage runoff coefficient estimation and scaling approach wang 2019 peng et al 2019 the monthly water quality data including total nitrogen nitrate nitrite total phosphorus phosphate dissolved oxygen etc for eight lake water sites and 14 inflow and one outflow sites were obtained from the administration bureau of lake chaohu in anhui province the daily nutrient concentration of tributaries was obtained by linear interpolation of monthly data 2 3 water transfer modelling 2 3 1 model description the ecolake model is used in this study to simulate water transfer scenarios in lake chaohu ecolake is a vertically compressed 3 d hydrodynamic ecological model which uses ecological functions to predict the changes in ecosystem structure hu et al 2006 2011 ecolake model has been successfully applied in assessing the impacts of yangtze river water transfer on the restoration of lake chaohu lake taihu and lake yangchenghu hu et al 2008 wang et al 2018 z peng et al 2021a and forecasting the short term of algal bloom in lake taihu and lake chaohu h zhang et al 2013 peng et al 2019 this model comprises a relatively independent hydrodynamic module a food chain network module and a material transformation and transport module in specific lake flow in the hydrodynamic module dissolved oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus in the material transport and transformation module and algae in the food chain network module are considered in this study and the related parameters are determined through model calibration an irregular shoreline of lake chaohu is determined in the ecolake model excluding the two small islands in the western lake from the computation domain in a cartesian mesh 3363 active square grids 500 m 500 m are utilized to subdivide the lake the time step for the hydrodynamic module is set to 30 s while it is 300 s for water quality modules the hydrological time step was determined according to grid size and water depth and it should avoid model divergence during running the concentration field was calculated once every 10 steps of flow field calculation simultaneously ensuring the simulation s accuracy and efficiency 2 3 2 model calibration and validation a trial and error method was used in this study for model calibration and validation two widely used quantitative fit criteria were utilized to evaluate model performance including the h index eq 1 and relative standard deviation ar d eq 2 j zhang et al 2003 kong et al 2013 the results are acceptable if 0 h 1 and ar d is less than 35 the verified model was used for the simulation and analysis of the different scenarios that are going to be discussed in the following sub sections 1 h observed simulated 2 n observed 2 n simulated 2 n 2 a r d observed simulated observed where observed simulated and n represent the observed data simulated data and the number of monitoring stations respectively 2 4 designed scenarios typically the water transfer duration in lake chaohu lasts approximately one month due to the large cost such as the 24 d water transfer in the drought year of 2017 the transferred rate was set to be 90 m3 s 1 and 140 m3 s 1 respectively covering the range of the monitored transfer rate during the water transfer in 2017 the transferred water quality for both n and p was set to be the local government management criterion of grade ii 0 5 mgtn l 1 and 0 025 mgtp l 1 and grade iii 1 0 mgtn l 1 and 0 05 mgtp l 1 gb3838 2002 respectively named as clean and poor water transfers hereafter for the transfer time water transfer was normally carried out in july august and january february respectively when the algal bloom frequently breaks out and water quality is relatively poor based on the above two factors transferred water quality and time four groups were designed including group a summer clean water transfer group b winter clean water transfer group c summer poor water transfer and group d winter poor water transfer table 1 the transfer route transfer rate and wind field in the lake chaohu basin were considered in each group which composed of 12 water transfer scenarios table 2 although the east prevailing wind direction dominates during the two transfer periods the wind speed and direction in the lake chaohu basin varied greatly fig s1 for example the average wind speed during two transfer periods from 2014 to 2019 ranged from 1 98 to 2 76 m s 1 with the relative change of 20 14 thus the daily wind speed was set to be increasing and decreasing by 20 at the basis of the baseline value and the wind direction remained unchanged in this study the wind speed effect was only presented under the high transfer inflow rate 140 m3 s 1 due to its larger water quality improvement effect in the baseline scenario the average concentration of tn tp and nh3 n in the lake water was 1 15 0 10 0 10 mg l 1 and 1 65 0 08 0 13 mg l 1 respectively during the summer and winter transfer periods fig 2 the nutrient concentrations in winter were generally higher than those in summer the total inflow amount was 16 9 million m3 0 8 lake volume and 9 94 million m3 0 5 lake volume in the baishitian river bst and zhao river zh respectively in the summer water transfer period while it was 17 1 million m3 0 8 lake volume and 62 4 million m3 2 8 lake volume respectively during the winter water transfer period when zh was used as an outflow a total of 233 28 million m3 10 5 lake volume and 362 88 million m3 16 3 lake volume of water were transferred over one month transfer period at the transfer flow rates of 90 m3 s 1 and 140 m3 s 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance and limitations the ecolake model reproduces tn tp and nh3 n concentrations at the eight sampling stations and the water level in the three monitoring stations reasonably well with all h values less than 1 and ar d values less than 35 table 3 the detailed calibration and validation results can be found in wang et al 2018 2023 although the ecolake model performs well at most stations in the water column deviations do exist partly because it uses the constant parameter values at all stations including the mineralization rate of organic matter the assimilation rate of algae the growth rate of algae etc for instance organic matter in different lake regions may have different sources e g allochthonous versus autochthonous which may influence the particulate size and therefore affect their reactivities and mineralization rate in the water column wang et al 2023 in addition water transfer may trigger sediment resuspension and accompanying sediment n or p release at the same time however the dynamic exchange process for both n and p at the interface is not considered in this model which may induce deviations of smaller simulation values relative to reality furthermore there are inevitably some uncertainties regarding the accuracy and frequency of the measured data such as the monthly observed nutrient concentration that was used for model calibration and validation all the above mentioned possibilities can result in deviations in modelling results hence additional spatial and temporal high frequency data are required to further calibrate the model 3 2 impacts of water transfer on lake water flow the offshore flow direction in the lake is generally from the west to the east for different operation scenarios figs 3 and 4 and s2 s3 strongly reverse circulation is observed in the middle area of the western basin fig 3 and s2 this flow pattern is primarily determined by the tributary inflowing rate since most inflows locate in the western basin modeling results show that both summer and winter water transfers increase the average flow rate of the entire lake the increased proportion of the depth mean flow rate over the entire lake are 5 4 9 6 5 4 9 8 4 1 and 7 6 for scenarios b90 b140 z90 z140 bz45 and bz70 respectively in summer water transfer and 6 3 10 4 5 8 9 6 5 6 and 9 1 for these scenarios respectively in winter water transfer the increased proportion of flow rate is similar through bst and zh routes during the summer transfer period while it is slightly larger through bst route during the winter transfer period when the water transfer route starts from bst river operation scenarios of b90 and b140 have a remarkably positive effect on the flow rate in 97 of the entire lake and a significant negative effect on the flow rate near the outflow mouth of the eastern basin fig 3 and s2 influences of the inflow rate on the lake flow rate are enhanced under scenario b140 in general the change in flow rate ranges from 0 2 5 6 cm s 1 and 0 4 5 1 cm s 1 respectively for summer and winter water transfer scenarios when the water transfer route switches from the bst to zh the western region of the central basin undergoes a significant decrease in the flow rate fig 3 and s2 and the lake area with rising flow rate decreases to 83 88 during both water transfer periods the change in flow rate ranges from 0 2 5 0 cm s 1 and 0 2 3 9 cm s 1 for summer and winter water transfer scenarios respectively the same transferred inflow rate using the bz routes bz45 and bz70 has a similar spatial impact on flow rate as scenarios z90 and z140 during both water transfer seasons fig 3 and s2 it indicates that at the same inflow rate the transfer route from zh has a greater impact on the flow rate in the central basin than from bst the water transfer from bst accelerates the flow rate near the bst inlet and thus only a small area near the island exhibits a decrease of flow rate fig 3 and s2 the area with increased flow rate undergoes 93 95 of the total lake area the flow rate acceleration in the lake ranges from 0 2 2 7 cm s 1 and 0 2 2 4 cm s 1 for summer and winter water transfer scenarios respectively less than the single bst or zh route it is noteworthy that the flow direction in the northwestern area of nanfei inlet is northwest under different water transfer scenarios which may limit the dispersion of pollutants with high concentration and their transport to the southern lake area wind as an essential driving force has been widely considered in previous studies and different hydrodynamic responses have been concluded f peng et al 2021 tang et al 2021 h h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 the wind speed increased by 20 combines with a high transferred inflow rate b140 20 z140 20 and bz70 20 which significantly increases the average flow rate of the entire lake in both transfer periods fig 4 and figs s3 4 specifically wind speed increase can significantly strengthen the reverse circulation in the middle of the western basin and forms a weak clockwise circulation in the western basin s heavily polluted confluence bay during the winter transfer period this condition further increases the block effects of water transfer on nutrient dispersion and transport in this area in contrast wind speed decreased by 20 b140 20 z140 20 and bz70 20 reduces the flow rate in 94 99 of the total lake area as well as the reverse circulation in the western basin in addition it significantly weakens the promoting effect of water transfer on lake flow rate in the middle and eastern basins in summary a higher transferred inflow rate has a greater effect on the acceleration of the mean flow rate of the entire lake fig s4 higher transfer inflow rate scenarios through both bst and bz routes could accelerate the flow rate in more than 90 of the total lake area although the lake area with accelerated flow rate is smaller through zh than the bst route its improvement ratio of mean flow rate is comparable many previous studies have found that water flow improvement may not completely cover the lake during a low inflow rate water transfer due to the large size and complex shoreline huang et al 2016 tang et al 2021 in addition winter water transfer has a higher influence on flow rate but a similar influence on the distribution of the flow field compared to summer water transfer fig 3 and s2 furthermore changes in wind speed during water transfer affect the magnitude and distribution of the lake flow rate fig 4 and s3 which will affect nutrient distribution as well 3 3 impacts of water transfer on lake water quality two water quality conditions grade ii and iii in the donating water two water transfer times summer and winter and three kinds of transfer routes bst zh and bz routes were considered to investigate the effects of water transfer on lake water quality figs 5 and 6 and s5 7 the summer clean water transfer donating water quality in grade ii can improve the water quality of tn nh3 n and tp in lake chaohu but the improvement efficiency is insignificant and the grade level of nutrient in the lake water is not changed fig 5 the higher transfer inflow rate will likely induce more substantial effects on nutrient concentration compared to lower transfer inflow rate the zh route has the largest effects on water quality improvement compared to other transfer routes with decreased nutrient concentration in more than 50 of the total lake area fig 7 responses of nutrient concentration are more sensitive in the central basin than that in western and eastern basins particularly the average change of tn concentration of the entire lake is 2 7 4 3 and 3 5 for scenarios b140 z140 and bz70 respectively this finding is consistent with previous studies gu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 h h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 they suggested that water transfer has a significant effect on the water quality improvement in small lakes while the effects are limited in large lakes such as lake dianchi and lake taihu hu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 compared to summer water transfer winter water transfer exerts a large improvement for tn and tp while a small improvement for nh3 n fig s5 the zh route also exerts a larger tn and tp improvement compared to other transfer routes different with summer water transfer the mean nh3 n concentration in the central and eastern basins shows a considerable increase in different scenarios with a higher inflow rate improving nh3 n concentration more than a low one the area with increased nh3 n concentration accounts for over 50 of the total lake area fig 7 m zhang et al 2020 reported that the averaged nh3 n concentration in lake chaohu significantly decreased from 0 43 to 0 35 mg l 1 between 2012 and 2018 which is always classified as grade ii gb3838 2002 in addition the nutrient concentration in the central and eastern basins is lower than that in the western basin m zhang et al 2020 therefore the nh3 n deterioration in the central and eastern basins is likely attributed to the higher nh3 n concentration 0 5 mg l 1 in donating water compared to that in receiving lake water 0 13 mg l 1 which is similar to the results in lake yangchenghu wang et al 2018 the effect of water transfer with poor donating water quality grade iii on lake water quality during summer and winter is shown in figs s6 and s7 respectively during summer poor water transfer the average tn concentration of the entire lake decreases 1 3 2 1 and 1 6 in scenarios b140 z140 and bz70 respectively fig s6 a poor water transfer improves lake water quality less than a clean one z140 is also the optimum transfer route for decreasing the mean tn and tp concentrations of the entire lake an average increase of 0 8 16 2 for the nh3 n concentration indicates a decline in water quality in the most lake area and the deterioration effect is larger during the winter water transfer period thus nh3 n concentration in the donating water should be more strictly controlled in winter moreover regardless of the nutrient concentration of donating water transfer route and transfer time water transfer operations were unable to improve water quality in the heavily polluted confluence bay in the north region of the western basin the accumulation of pollutants with high concentrations was probably due to the strengthened northwest flow 3 4 impacts of wind on lake water quality during water transfer as the wind is a critical driving force for water transport in lake chaohu huang et al 2016 its influence on lake water quality during water transfer is investigated further as shown in figs 6 and 7 and figs s8 s11 wind speed decreased by 20 b140 20 z140 20 and bz70 20 can notably enlarge the lake area with reduced nutrient concentration especially for tn and nh3 n in the heavily polluted confluence bay of the western basin in this area the weakened reverse circulation accelerates the transport of pollutants to the central and eastern basins with low nutrient concentration and thus increases the dilution effects of transferred water on nutrients in the western basin compared to common water transfer scenarios without wind field change the proportion of the lake area with reduced nutrient concentration increases significantly especially in the western basin fig 7 in specific the lake area proportion with reduced nutrient concentration increases from 52 49 49 scenario z140 to 61 69 69 scenario z140 20 for tn nh3 n and tp respectively during summer clean water transfer period indeed the mean nutrient concentration of the entire lake has been decreased to varying degrees in contrast an increase in wind speed can promote nutrient accumulation in the heavily polluted confluence bay in the northern region of the western basin which largely reduces the improvement effectiveness of water transfer on lake water quality fig s8 the promoted effects of reverse circulation and weak clockwise circulation in the western basin is probably the main reason in previous studies the impact of wind field on the water exchange rate and water age has been well investigated ding et al 2019 tang et al 2021 but the lake water quality responses lack deep analysis ding et al 2019 although the larger lake flow rate and the exchange rate are essential for nutrient dilution nutrient concentration and distribution in the lake water are also primarily affected by the tributary inlet s location flow direction and the biochemical processes of the lake water body such as phytoplankton uptake sedimentation etc in the present study due to increased wind speed during water transfer the increased reverse circulation and northwest flow speed in the northwestern lake blocks the nutrients transport to the area with low nutrient concentration central and eastern basins and limits the water quality improvement effectiveness of water transfer h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 also demonstrated that a high flow rate cannot guarantee an efficient improvement in water quality hence both the flow rate and direction may play a great role in improving water quality in lake chaohu 3 5 the follow up effects of water transfer the effects of all water transfer scenarios on water quality continue until the end of the simulation exhibiting distinct spatial and temporal variations fig 8 and s12 nutrient concentrations in the western basin show the smallest improvement response of the four operation groups during the water transfer period but the deterioration response increases significantly after the water transfer ends the decreased magnitude of nutrient concentration in the central basin is larger than that in the western basin particularly in groups a and b fig 8 tn and tp concentrations in the western basin quickly recover after the water transfer ends and gradually surpass the baseline level in contrast tn and tp concentrations in the central basin decrease rapidly at first and increase gradually after the operation ends for the entire lake the average tn and tp concentrations exhibit a similar temporal trend to that in the central basin but the variation of nutrient concentration is smaller and the rebound time of nutrient concentrations decrease lags around half month these results are similar to the previous study by z peng et al 2021a but the magnitude of nutrient change is different in the various water transfer operations particularly different water transfer routes pose similar effects on the improvement of mean water quality in the entire lake the improvement effect on tn continues to last longer than nh3 n and tp and the improvement effect of clean water transfer continues longer than a poor one in addition wind speed has a larger impact on nutrient concentration variation in the western basin compared to that in the central and eastern basins during the water transfer period the effect of wind speed on the averaged nutrient concentration in the central eastern basin and the entire lake is less than the effect of transfer route and water quality in donating water it is noteworthy that nh3 n concentration in the central and eastern basins increases rapidly during the winter transfer period and decreases fast afterwards for all scenarios the increased nh3 n concentration in the central and eastern basins caused by winter water transfer requires significantly more attention 3 6 relationship between lake water flow and water quality the proportion of tn change has a generally exponential relation with flow rate change during the summer clean water transfer period fig 9 r2 0 56 the extremely high increase in lake flow rate is commonly accompanied by relatively stable tn change but a significant tp and nh3 n increase flow rate increase larger than 30 will not improve the water quality in scenario z140 this critical proportion value will increase to 50 and decrease to 15 under wind speed increase z140 20 and decrease z140 20 scenarios respectively it is noteworthy that both the decrease and increase of nutrient concentrations may occur when the flow rate changes similar results also occur during the winter transfer period but the relationship pattern is distinct fig s13 in addition during summer clean water transfer the average increase of flow rate of 9 6 9 8 and 7 6 scenarios b140 z140 and bz70 respectively is significantly higher than the decrease of nutrient concentration of the entire lake fig 9 similar with the finding in lake wanghu water transfer induces a more remarkable improvement of the hydrodynamic process than that of water quality parameters tang et al 2021 it is well known that high water inflow rate can increase the water exchange rate and dilute the nutrient concentrations in the lake water bargu et al 2019 meanwhile it can also limit the dispersion and transport of nutrients in the heavily polluted bay where the water flows to the shoreline of the northwestern lake under the strengthened reverse circulation figs 3 and 4 the spatial and temporal distribution of nutrients is determined by the combined effect of lake hydrodynamics and biochemical processes previous studies have also shown that the water exchange parameter such as water age has no apparent relationship with nutrient distribution tang et al 2021 thus it is inadequate to assess the water quality improvement during water transfer based only on water exchange parameters x zhang et al 2016 in lake chaohu both hydrodynamical flow field and water quality parameters should be considered when assessing the efficacy of water transfer 3 7 implication for water transfer management although water transfer can remarkably enhance the water flow rate in some regions of the lake its influence on water quality may be less and variable due to the influence of various impact factors thus some critical strategies for water transfer in lake chaohu are proposed as follows 3 7 1 optimum transfer inflow rate and time the transferred inflow rate can physically facilitate the water flow rate in a specific lake area increasing the transferred inflow rate by 56 from 90 to 140 m3 s 1 can increase the lake water flow rate by 76 9 82 5 and decrease the nutrient concentration by 43 91 hence a transferred inflow rate of 140 m3 s 1 effectively improves lake water flow and water quality besides water transfer has a greater improvement effectiveness on tn and tp during winter than summer mainly due to the significant nutrient concentration differences between donating water and receiving lake water 3 7 2 development of a reliable water transfer route lake flow and water quality always show spatial heterogeneity in response to water transfer operations due to different lake shapes and topographies multiple inlet transfer routes were proposed for lake taihu and lake poyang to improve the water transfer efficiency li et al 2013a qi et al 2016 in lake chaohu z peng et al 2021a suggested that bz transfer routes are preferable for improving water quality when the total transfer inflow rate is doubled however in the case of the same total transfer inflow rate the zh route is advised for the improvement of the average flow rate and water quality of the entire lake 3 7 3 ensuring good water quality in donating water in poor water transfer scenarios higher nutrient concentrations in donating water threaten water quality in the receiving lake water especially for nh3 n this result agrees with the previous studies zeng et al 2015 tang et al 2021 the improvement effect of water transfer can become significant when the nutrient concentration in donated water is at a low level hu et al 2008 li et al 2013b to ensure the efficacy of water transfer in lake chaohu more stringent nh3 n monitoring in donating water should be implemented 3 7 4 utilizing the low east wind due to the predominant east wind direction in the lake chaohu basin fig s1 changes in wind speed have a distinct influence on the improvement in water quality during water transfer period in lake chaohu a decrease in wind speed decelerates the mean water flow rate of the entire lake and greatly improves water quality in the heavily polluted confluence bay of the western basin the possible reason is the weakened reverse circulation and northwestern flow rate in the western basin which promotes the transport and dispersion of nutrients with high concentration to the central and eastern basins 4 conclusions how the hydrodynamics and water quality respond to water transfer is affected by various factors and whether the lake water flow can indicate water quality is variable in different lakes this study analyzes the effects of water transfer and wind field on improving lake flow and water quality tn nh3 n and tp in lake chaohu using the ecolake model results obtained in this study indicate that 1 the water transfer projects could significantly increase the flow rate in most lake areas while their influence on water quality is variable due to the interaction of many driving factors the degree of tn and tp improvement is not always proportional to the flow rate 2 a water transferred rate of 140 m3 s 1 through zh is recommended for improving the mean water flow rate and water quality of the entire lake wind speed has less effect on water quality compared to transferred inflow rate route and water quality but it significantly improves the average water quality in the heavily polluted bay of the western basin 3 a clean water transfer has a significantly better improvement in water quality than a poor one the effects of water transfer on tn improvement last longer than nh3 n and tp the concentration of nh3 n in the donated water should be strictly controlled 4 to improve the water quality of lake chaohu the improvement of the water quality in the donating system water transfer through zh and during winter and a combination of the effects of the low east wind are recommended the results obtained in this study are useful to lake managers in lake chaohu and provide deep insight into selecting the appropriate assessment parameters when analyzing the water transfer efficacy due to the limitation of the water quality observation data in the donating system the numerical experiments in this study are conducted under specific water quality conditions in addition the increased transfer inflow rate may trigger sediment resuspension which is accompanied by the nutrient release from the sediment thus real time monitoring of water quality and more internal nutrient release flux data are needed to improve model performance and to investigate the impact of

7717,study region lake chaohu is a typically large shallow freshwater lake in china experiencing long term eutrophication and a short period of drought study focus this study employs a three dimensional 3 d hydrodynamic ecological model to assess the impacts of water transfer on lake flow water quality and their relationship and then reveals optimal strategies for achieving improved water quality in lake chaohu new hydrological insights for the region results indicated that clean water transfer could dramatically increase flow rate and decrease nutrient concentrations near the water

data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater lake ecosystems play an essential role in water supply agriculture irrigation recreation zone ecological habitats landscaping and flood control due to the rapid socio economic development and human population growth over the past few decades nearly 6 billion people will face water shortages by 2050 wwap 2018 because of the increasing sources of urban wastewater domestic sewage and diffuse agricultural pollution many lakes worldwide have suffered from nutrient pollution and eutrophication mammides 2020 these problems have threatened water supply and aggravated water shortages especially during extreme climatic events z peng et al 2021b globally large scale water transfers are widely implemented to conserve the quality and quantity of freshwater wang et al 2018 bargu et al 2019 lee et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 f peng et al 2021 h h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 y h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 many studies have demonstrated the positive effects of water transfer on receiving water systems such as increasing water exchange and reoxygenation rate supplementing water resources and improving water quality l hu et al 2010 gao et al 2015 y wang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 while some researches showed that although water transfer could dramatically facilitate water exchange in most lake regions its influence on receiving water quality is variable feng et al 2017 tang et al 2021 in addition the increase of external nutrient loads during the water transfer period may cause water quality deterioration in some areas of the receiving lake jin et al 2015 qin et al 2019 chen et al 2020 zhang and wu 2020 y zhuang et al 2021 due to their high implementation costs and varied impacts on lake hydrodynamics and water quality w zhuang 2016 shah et al 2020 it is essential to comprehensively understand the effects of water transfer and determine the most effective operation strategies for improving the hydrodynamic and water quality in the receiving water ecosystems previous studies mainly focused on the effects of water transfer on the changes of water transport time parameters such as water age and water residence time while whether these hydrodynamic parameters can indicate the improvement of water quality is variable in different lakes x zhang et al 2016 tang et al 2018 f peng et al 2021 qi et al 2016 demonstrated that water age was highly correlated with the pattern of chlorophyll a chl a and could be an indicator of the water quality variations in lake poyang while x zhang et al 2016 suggested that water age influences the improvement effectiveness of total phosphorus but not total nitrogen in lake dianchi h h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 indicated that an accelerated inflow rate did not necessarily enable a higher improvement in nh3 n concentration tang et al 2021 also suggested that although water transfer can significantly increase water exchange and reduce residence time in most lake regions in lake wanghu its influence on water quality is variable multiple factors impact the effectiveness of hydrodynamics and water quality in receiving water during water transfer such as transferred inflow rate nutrient concentration routes and time and wind direction and magnitude zhou et al 2020 r xu et al 2020 f peng et al 2021 z peng et al 2021a tang et al 2021 before implementing water transfer it is necessary to evaluate the effects of various impacting factors simultaneously in addition to the transport time parameters water quality parameters such as nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations must be prioritized during water transfer lake chaohu the fifth largest freshwater shallow lake in china is a typical eutrophic lake in the lower reach of the yangtze river basin due to the urban wastewater discharge from hefei city the increasing diffuse point source pollution and the construction of the chaohu sluice in 1962 the lake was subjected to high nitrogen and phosphorus loads and is characterized as hypereutrophic in the west and mesotrophic in the east f xu et al 1999 since the 1990 s several watershed management strategies have been implemented to improve lake water quality in the 2010 s l zhang et al 2021 however lake chaohu continued to experience eutrophication and frequent algal blooms in the summer j li et al 2020 in addition the frequency and severity of drought increased for instance the lake water level decreased to 8 23 m on 28 june 2017 which was 0 91 m lower than the average water level from 2014 to 2020 z peng et al 2021a large external loads and occasional extreme droughts have posed the greatest threat to the security of the water supply the large scale water transfer project has been constructed in the lake chaohu basin since 2017 to alleviate this situation although several studies have investigated the impacts of the joint operation of water transfer and chaohu sluice on lake current and water quality z peng et al 2021a and water transfer on lake water age and residence time huang et al 2016 how the lake water flow and quality respond to water transfer under various impact factors transferred inflow rate time route and wind field is still unknown given the importance of the water transfer project to the lake chaohu ecosystem this study aims to analyze its impacts on lake flow and water quality using a 3 d hydrodynamic ecological model this model thoroughly considers multiple impact factors including transferred inflow rate water quality time routes and wind speed the main objectives are to 1 investigate how different transfer scenarios influence lake flow speed and direction and nutrient distribution 2 clarify the combined effects of the wind field and transfer scenarios on lake flow and water quality 3 analyze the relationship between water flow and quality and 4 reveal reliable water transfer strategies to improve lake water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area covers lake chaohu basin in the central part of anhui province fig 1 lake chaohu has a total lake area of 780 km2 an average depth of 2 7 m a mean water level of 9 2 m above sea level from 2014 to 2020 and a mean water residence time of 168 days wang et al 2020 typically the lake is divided into western central and eastern basins based on the difference of nutrient concentration in both the water and sediment wang et al 2021 fig 1 lake chaohu basin has 33 tributaries among which 14 main rivers are identified and considered in this study the total discharges of hangbu river hb nanfei river nf baishitian river bst and zhegao river zg account for more than 90 of the total inflow wang et al 2020 specifically zhao river zh is occasionally used as an outflow for irrigation the yuxi river yx is the largest outflow connecting the lake to the yangtze river and is regulated by the chaohu sluice with the rapid socio economic development this lake received a total inflow with a mean concentration of 23 2 g tn m 2 yr 1 and 1 3 g tp m 2 yr 1 from 2014 to 2018 wang et al 2020 the annual mean tn and tp concentrations in the lake water were 1 3 6 0 mg l 1 and 0 03 0 42 mg l 1 respectively from 1986 to 2018 and showed a steady trend over the last ten years wang et al 2021 l zhang et al 2021 these numbers indicate that eutrophication is still a significant issue in this lake and new strategies are discussed to find provincial authorities responsible for maintaining the lake s water quality and supply the water transfer project for lake chaohu is conducted through two routes fig 1 the east route zh transfers water from the yangtze river at the fenghuangjing pumping station fht to lake chaohu through the zh sluice the west route bst starts from lake caizi flows through bst and connects to the yangtze river by the chang river the designed water transfer capacity is 150 m3 s 1 for both routes during the dry season a water transfer is occasionally carried out to meet the water supply and navigation demands in lake chaohu from 15 july to 8 august 2017 an emergent water transfer was performed for 24 days the daily average inflow rate ranged from 90 m3 s 1 to 140 m3 s 1 the mean water quality in donating water meets the grade iv for tn 1 5 mg l 1 grade ii for nh3 n 0 5 mg l 1 and grade iii for tp 0 05 mg l 1 according to the chinese environmental water quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 for lakes z peng et al 2021a 2 2 data collection hydrological meteorological and water quality data for lake chaohu in 2013 and 2018 were collected in this study water level and water quality data in these two years were utilized to calibrate model parameters and validate model performance respectively the average water level in 2013 and 2018 is 9 28 m and 8 96 m above the mean sea level of wusong station in the yangtze river estuary respectively representing the high flow and normal flow conditions data from 2018 in the normal flow year were subsequently employed to simulate the impacts of different scenarios on the lake water flow and water quality wind speed direction and solar radiation data at the hourly interval were obtained from the meteorological stations near lake chaohu fig 1 daily precipitation evaporation data water level and discharge of tributaries were obtained through fixed stations or determined according to the two stage runoff coefficient estimation and scaling approach wang 2019 peng et al 2019 the monthly water quality data including total nitrogen nitrate nitrite total phosphorus phosphate dissolved oxygen etc for eight lake water sites and 14 inflow and one outflow sites were obtained from the administration bureau of lake chaohu in anhui province the daily nutrient concentration of tributaries was obtained by linear interpolation of monthly data 2 3 water transfer modelling 2 3 1 model description the ecolake model is used in this study to simulate water transfer scenarios in lake chaohu ecolake is a vertically compressed 3 d hydrodynamic ecological model which uses ecological functions to predict the changes in ecosystem structure hu et al 2006 2011 ecolake model has been successfully applied in assessing the impacts of yangtze river water transfer on the restoration of lake chaohu lake taihu and lake yangchenghu hu et al 2008 wang et al 2018 z peng et al 2021a and forecasting the short term of algal bloom in lake taihu and lake chaohu h zhang et al 2013 peng et al 2019 this model comprises a relatively independent hydrodynamic module a food chain network module and a material transformation and transport module in specific lake flow in the hydrodynamic module dissolved oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus in the material transport and transformation module and algae in the food chain network module are considered in this study and the related parameters are determined through model calibration an irregular shoreline of lake chaohu is determined in the ecolake model excluding the two small islands in the western lake from the computation domain in a cartesian mesh 3363 active square grids 500 m 500 m are utilized to subdivide the lake the time step for the hydrodynamic module is set to 30 s while it is 300 s for water quality modules the hydrological time step was determined according to grid size and water depth and it should avoid model divergence during running the concentration field was calculated once every 10 steps of flow field calculation simultaneously ensuring the simulation s accuracy and efficiency 2 3 2 model calibration and validation a trial and error method was used in this study for model calibration and validation two widely used quantitative fit criteria were utilized to evaluate model performance including the h index eq 1 and relative standard deviation ar d eq 2 j zhang et al 2003 kong et al 2013 the results are acceptable if 0 h 1 and ar d is less than 35 the verified model was used for the simulation and analysis of the different scenarios that are going to be discussed in the following sub sections 1 h observed simulated 2 n observed 2 n simulated 2 n 2 a r d observed simulated observed where observed simulated and n represent the observed data simulated data and the number of monitoring stations respectively 2 4 designed scenarios typically the water transfer duration in lake chaohu lasts approximately one month due to the large cost such as the 24 d water transfer in the drought year of 2017 the transferred rate was set to be 90 m3 s 1 and 140 m3 s 1 respectively covering the range of the monitored transfer rate during the water transfer in 2017 the transferred water quality for both n and p was set to be the local government management criterion of grade ii 0 5 mgtn l 1 and 0 025 mgtp l 1 and grade iii 1 0 mgtn l 1 and 0 05 mgtp l 1 gb3838 2002 respectively named as clean and poor water transfers hereafter for the transfer time water transfer was normally carried out in july august and january february respectively when the algal bloom frequently breaks out and water quality is relatively poor based on the above two factors transferred water quality and time four groups were designed including group a summer clean water transfer group b winter clean water transfer group c summer poor water transfer and group d winter poor water transfer table 1 the transfer route transfer rate and wind field in the lake chaohu basin were considered in each group which composed of 12 water transfer scenarios table 2 although the east prevailing wind direction dominates during the two transfer periods the wind speed and direction in the lake chaohu basin varied greatly fig s1 for example the average wind speed during two transfer periods from 2014 to 2019 ranged from 1 98 to 2 76 m s 1 with the relative change of 20 14 thus the daily wind speed was set to be increasing and decreasing by 20 at the basis of the baseline value and the wind direction remained unchanged in this study the wind speed effect was only presented under the high transfer inflow rate 140 m3 s 1 due to its larger water quality improvement effect in the baseline scenario the average concentration of tn tp and nh3 n in the lake water was 1 15 0 10 0 10 mg l 1 and 1 65 0 08 0 13 mg l 1 respectively during the summer and winter transfer periods fig 2 the nutrient concentrations in winter were generally higher than those in summer the total inflow amount was 16 9 million m3 0 8 lake volume and 9 94 million m3 0 5 lake volume in the baishitian river bst and zhao river zh respectively in the summer water transfer period while it was 17 1 million m3 0 8 lake volume and 62 4 million m3 2 8 lake volume respectively during the winter water transfer period when zh was used as an outflow a total of 233 28 million m3 10 5 lake volume and 362 88 million m3 16 3 lake volume of water were transferred over one month transfer period at the transfer flow rates of 90 m3 s 1 and 140 m3 s 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance and limitations the ecolake model reproduces tn tp and nh3 n concentrations at the eight sampling stations and the water level in the three monitoring stations reasonably well with all h values less than 1 and ar d values less than 35 table 3 the detailed calibration and validation results can be found in wang et al 2018 2023 although the ecolake model performs well at most stations in the water column deviations do exist partly because it uses the constant parameter values at all stations including the mineralization rate of organic matter the assimilation rate of algae the growth rate of algae etc for instance organic matter in different lake regions may have different sources e g allochthonous versus autochthonous which may influence the particulate size and therefore affect their reactivities and mineralization rate in the water column wang et al 2023 in addition water transfer may trigger sediment resuspension and accompanying sediment n or p release at the same time however the dynamic exchange process for both n and p at the interface is not considered in this model which may induce deviations of smaller simulation values relative to reality furthermore there are inevitably some uncertainties regarding the accuracy and frequency of the measured data such as the monthly observed nutrient concentration that was used for model calibration and validation all the above mentioned possibilities can result in deviations in modelling results hence additional spatial and temporal high frequency data are required to further calibrate the model 3 2 impacts of water transfer on lake water flow the offshore flow direction in the lake is generally from the west to the east for different operation scenarios figs 3 and 4 and s2 s3 strongly reverse circulation is observed in the middle area of the western basin fig 3 and s2 this flow pattern is primarily determined by the tributary inflowing rate since most inflows locate in the western basin modeling results show that both summer and winter water transfers increase the average flow rate of the entire lake the increased proportion of the depth mean flow rate over the entire lake are 5 4 9 6 5 4 9 8 4 1 and 7 6 for scenarios b90 b140 z90 z140 bz45 and bz70 respectively in summer water transfer and 6 3 10 4 5 8 9 6 5 6 and 9 1 for these scenarios respectively in winter water transfer the increased proportion of flow rate is similar through bst and zh routes during the summer transfer period while it is slightly larger through bst route during the winter transfer period when the water transfer route starts from bst river operation scenarios of b90 and b140 have a remarkably positive effect on the flow rate in 97 of the entire lake and a significant negative effect on the flow rate near the outflow mouth of the eastern basin fig 3 and s2 influences of the inflow rate on the lake flow rate are enhanced under scenario b140 in general the change in flow rate ranges from 0 2 5 6 cm s 1 and 0 4 5 1 cm s 1 respectively for summer and winter water transfer scenarios when the water transfer route switches from the bst to zh the western region of the central basin undergoes a significant decrease in the flow rate fig 3 and s2 and the lake area with rising flow rate decreases to 83 88 during both water transfer periods the change in flow rate ranges from 0 2 5 0 cm s 1 and 0 2 3 9 cm s 1 for summer and winter water transfer scenarios respectively the same transferred inflow rate using the bz routes bz45 and bz70 has a similar spatial impact on flow rate as scenarios z90 and z140 during both water transfer seasons fig 3 and s2 it indicates that at the same inflow rate the transfer route from zh has a greater impact on the flow rate in the central basin than from bst the water transfer from bst accelerates the flow rate near the bst inlet and thus only a small area near the island exhibits a decrease of flow rate fig 3 and s2 the area with increased flow rate undergoes 93 95 of the total lake area the flow rate acceleration in the lake ranges from 0 2 2 7 cm s 1 and 0 2 2 4 cm s 1 for summer and winter water transfer scenarios respectively less than the single bst or zh route it is noteworthy that the flow direction in the northwestern area of nanfei inlet is northwest under different water transfer scenarios which may limit the dispersion of pollutants with high concentration and their transport to the southern lake area wind as an essential driving force has been widely considered in previous studies and different hydrodynamic responses have been concluded f peng et al 2021 tang et al 2021 h h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 the wind speed increased by 20 combines with a high transferred inflow rate b140 20 z140 20 and bz70 20 which significantly increases the average flow rate of the entire lake in both transfer periods fig 4 and figs s3 4 specifically wind speed increase can significantly strengthen the reverse circulation in the middle of the western basin and forms a weak clockwise circulation in the western basin s heavily polluted confluence bay during the winter transfer period this condition further increases the block effects of water transfer on nutrient dispersion and transport in this area in contrast wind speed decreased by 20 b140 20 z140 20 and bz70 20 reduces the flow rate in 94 99 of the total lake area as well as the reverse circulation in the western basin in addition it significantly weakens the promoting effect of water transfer on lake flow rate in the middle and eastern basins in summary a higher transferred inflow rate has a greater effect on the acceleration of the mean flow rate of the entire lake fig s4 higher transfer inflow rate scenarios through both bst and bz routes could accelerate the flow rate in more than 90 of the total lake area although the lake area with accelerated flow rate is smaller through zh than the bst route its improvement ratio of mean flow rate is comparable many previous studies have found that water flow improvement may not completely cover the lake during a low inflow rate water transfer due to the large size and complex shoreline huang et al 2016 tang et al 2021 in addition winter water transfer has a higher influence on flow rate but a similar influence on the distribution of the flow field compared to summer water transfer fig 3 and s2 furthermore changes in wind speed during water transfer affect the magnitude and distribution of the lake flow rate fig 4 and s3 which will affect nutrient distribution as well 3 3 impacts of water transfer on lake water quality two water quality conditions grade ii and iii in the donating water two water transfer times summer and winter and three kinds of transfer routes bst zh and bz routes were considered to investigate the effects of water transfer on lake water quality figs 5 and 6 and s5 7 the summer clean water transfer donating water quality in grade ii can improve the water quality of tn nh3 n and tp in lake chaohu but the improvement efficiency is insignificant and the grade level of nutrient in the lake water is not changed fig 5 the higher transfer inflow rate will likely induce more substantial effects on nutrient concentration compared to lower transfer inflow rate the zh route has the largest effects on water quality improvement compared to other transfer routes with decreased nutrient concentration in more than 50 of the total lake area fig 7 responses of nutrient concentration are more sensitive in the central basin than that in western and eastern basins particularly the average change of tn concentration of the entire lake is 2 7 4 3 and 3 5 for scenarios b140 z140 and bz70 respectively this finding is consistent with previous studies gu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 h h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 they suggested that water transfer has a significant effect on the water quality improvement in small lakes while the effects are limited in large lakes such as lake dianchi and lake taihu hu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 compared to summer water transfer winter water transfer exerts a large improvement for tn and tp while a small improvement for nh3 n fig s5 the zh route also exerts a larger tn and tp improvement compared to other transfer routes different with summer water transfer the mean nh3 n concentration in the central and eastern basins shows a considerable increase in different scenarios with a higher inflow rate improving nh3 n concentration more than a low one the area with increased nh3 n concentration accounts for over 50 of the total lake area fig 7 m zhang et al 2020 reported that the averaged nh3 n concentration in lake chaohu significantly decreased from 0 43 to 0 35 mg l 1 between 2012 and 2018 which is always classified as grade ii gb3838 2002 in addition the nutrient concentration in the central and eastern basins is lower than that in the western basin m zhang et al 2020 therefore the nh3 n deterioration in the central and eastern basins is likely attributed to the higher nh3 n concentration 0 5 mg l 1 in donating water compared to that in receiving lake water 0 13 mg l 1 which is similar to the results in lake yangchenghu wang et al 2018 the effect of water transfer with poor donating water quality grade iii on lake water quality during summer and winter is shown in figs s6 and s7 respectively during summer poor water transfer the average tn concentration of the entire lake decreases 1 3 2 1 and 1 6 in scenarios b140 z140 and bz70 respectively fig s6 a poor water transfer improves lake water quality less than a clean one z140 is also the optimum transfer route for decreasing the mean tn and tp concentrations of the entire lake an average increase of 0 8 16 2 for the nh3 n concentration indicates a decline in water quality in the most lake area and the deterioration effect is larger during the winter water transfer period thus nh3 n concentration in the donating water should be more strictly controlled in winter moreover regardless of the nutrient concentration of donating water transfer route and transfer time water transfer operations were unable to improve water quality in the heavily polluted confluence bay in the north region of the western basin the accumulation of pollutants with high concentrations was probably due to the strengthened northwest flow 3 4 impacts of wind on lake water quality during water transfer as the wind is a critical driving force for water transport in lake chaohu huang et al 2016 its influence on lake water quality during water transfer is investigated further as shown in figs 6 and 7 and figs s8 s11 wind speed decreased by 20 b140 20 z140 20 and bz70 20 can notably enlarge the lake area with reduced nutrient concentration especially for tn and nh3 n in the heavily polluted confluence bay of the western basin in this area the weakened reverse circulation accelerates the transport of pollutants to the central and eastern basins with low nutrient concentration and thus increases the dilution effects of transferred water on nutrients in the western basin compared to common water transfer scenarios without wind field change the proportion of the lake area with reduced nutrient concentration increases significantly especially in the western basin fig 7 in specific the lake area proportion with reduced nutrient concentration increases from 52 49 49 scenario z140 to 61 69 69 scenario z140 20 for tn nh3 n and tp respectively during summer clean water transfer period indeed the mean nutrient concentration of the entire lake has been decreased to varying degrees in contrast an increase in wind speed can promote nutrient accumulation in the heavily polluted confluence bay in the northern region of the western basin which largely reduces the improvement effectiveness of water transfer on lake water quality fig s8 the promoted effects of reverse circulation and weak clockwise circulation in the western basin is probably the main reason in previous studies the impact of wind field on the water exchange rate and water age has been well investigated ding et al 2019 tang et al 2021 but the lake water quality responses lack deep analysis ding et al 2019 although the larger lake flow rate and the exchange rate are essential for nutrient dilution nutrient concentration and distribution in the lake water are also primarily affected by the tributary inlet s location flow direction and the biochemical processes of the lake water body such as phytoplankton uptake sedimentation etc in the present study due to increased wind speed during water transfer the increased reverse circulation and northwest flow speed in the northwestern lake blocks the nutrients transport to the area with low nutrient concentration central and eastern basins and limits the water quality improvement effectiveness of water transfer h yang et al 2021 y yang et al 2021 also demonstrated that a high flow rate cannot guarantee an efficient improvement in water quality hence both the flow rate and direction may play a great role in improving water quality in lake chaohu 3 5 the follow up effects of water transfer the effects of all water transfer scenarios on water quality continue until the end of the simulation exhibiting distinct spatial and temporal variations fig 8 and s12 nutrient concentrations in the western basin show the smallest improvement response of the four operation groups during the water transfer period but the deterioration response increases significantly after the water transfer ends the decreased magnitude of nutrient concentration in the central basin is larger than that in the western basin particularly in groups a and b fig 8 tn and tp concentrations in the western basin quickly recover after the water transfer ends and gradually surpass the baseline level in contrast tn and tp concentrations in the central basin decrease rapidly at first and increase gradually after the operation ends for the entire lake the average tn and tp concentrations exhibit a similar temporal trend to that in the central basin but the variation of nutrient concentration is smaller and the rebound time of nutrient concentrations decrease lags around half month these results are similar to the previous study by z peng et al 2021a but the magnitude of nutrient change is different in the various water transfer operations particularly different water transfer routes pose similar effects on the improvement of mean water quality in the entire lake the improvement effect on tn continues to last longer than nh3 n and tp and the improvement effect of clean water transfer continues longer than a poor one in addition wind speed has a larger impact on nutrient concentration variation in the western basin compared to that in the central and eastern basins during the water transfer period the effect of wind speed on the averaged nutrient concentration in the central eastern basin and the entire lake is less than the effect of transfer route and water quality in donating water it is noteworthy that nh3 n concentration in the central and eastern basins increases rapidly during the winter transfer period and decreases fast afterwards for all scenarios the increased nh3 n concentration in the central and eastern basins caused by winter water transfer requires significantly more attention 3 6 relationship between lake water flow and water quality the proportion of tn change has a generally exponential relation with flow rate change during the summer clean water transfer period fig 9 r2 0 56 the extremely high increase in lake flow rate is commonly accompanied by relatively stable tn change but a significant tp and nh3 n increase flow rate increase larger than 30 will not improve the water quality in scenario z140 this critical proportion value will increase to 50 and decrease to 15 under wind speed increase z140 20 and decrease z140 20 scenarios respectively it is noteworthy that both the decrease and increase of nutrient concentrations may occur when the flow rate changes similar results also occur during the winter transfer period but the relationship pattern is distinct fig s13 in addition during summer clean water transfer the average increase of flow rate of 9 6 9 8 and 7 6 scenarios b140 z140 and bz70 respectively is significantly higher than the decrease of nutrient concentration of the entire lake fig 9 similar with the finding in lake wanghu water transfer induces a more remarkable improvement of the hydrodynamic process than that of water quality parameters tang et al 2021 it is well known that high water inflow rate can increase the water exchange rate and dilute the nutrient concentrations in the lake water bargu et al 2019 meanwhile it can also limit the dispersion and transport of nutrients in the heavily polluted bay where the water flows to the shoreline of the northwestern lake under the strengthened reverse circulation figs 3 and 4 the spatial and temporal distribution of nutrients is determined by the combined effect of lake hydrodynamics and biochemical processes previous studies have also shown that the water exchange parameter such as water age has no apparent relationship with nutrient distribution tang et al 2021 thus it is inadequate to assess the water quality improvement during water transfer based only on water exchange parameters x zhang et al 2016 in lake chaohu both hydrodynamical flow field and water quality parameters should be considered when assessing the efficacy of water transfer 3 7 implication for water transfer management although water transfer can remarkably enhance the water flow rate in some regions of the lake its influence on water quality may be less and variable due to the influence of various impact factors thus some critical strategies for water transfer in lake chaohu are proposed as follows 3 7 1 optimum transfer inflow rate and time the transferred inflow rate can physically facilitate the water flow rate in a specific lake area increasing the transferred inflow rate by 56 from 90 to 140 m3 s 1 can increase the lake water flow rate by 76 9 82 5 and decrease the nutrient concentration by 43 91 hence a transferred inflow rate of 140 m3 s 1 effectively improves lake water flow and water quality besides water transfer has a greater improvement effectiveness on tn and tp during winter than summer mainly due to the significant nutrient concentration differences between donating water and receiving lake water 3 7 2 development of a reliable water transfer route lake flow and water quality always show spatial heterogeneity in response to water transfer operations due to different lake shapes and topographies multiple inlet transfer routes were proposed for lake taihu and lake poyang to improve the water transfer efficiency li et al 2013a qi et al 2016 in lake chaohu z peng et al 2021a suggested that bz transfer routes are preferable for improving water quality when the total transfer inflow rate is doubled however in the case of the same total transfer inflow rate the zh route is advised for the improvement of the average flow rate and water quality of the entire lake 3 7 3 ensuring good water quality in donating water in poor water transfer scenarios higher nutrient concentrations in donating water threaten water quality in the receiving lake water especially for nh3 n this result agrees with the previous studies zeng et al 2015 tang et al 2021 the improvement effect of water transfer can become significant when the nutrient concentration in donated water is at a low level hu et al 2008 li et al 2013b to ensure the efficacy of water transfer in lake chaohu more stringent nh3 n monitoring in donating water should be implemented 3 7 4 utilizing the low east wind due to the predominant east wind direction in the lake chaohu basin fig s1 changes in wind speed have a distinct influence on the improvement in water quality during water transfer period in lake chaohu a decrease in wind speed decelerates the mean water flow rate of the entire lake and greatly improves water quality in the heavily polluted confluence bay of the western basin the possible reason is the weakened reverse circulation and northwestern flow rate in the western basin which promotes the transport and dispersion of nutrients with high concentration to the central and eastern basins 4 conclusions how the hydrodynamics and water quality respond to water transfer is affected by various factors and whether the lake water flow can indicate water quality is variable in different lakes this study analyzes the effects of water transfer and wind field on improving lake flow and water quality tn nh3 n and tp in lake chaohu using the ecolake model results obtained in this study indicate that 1 the water transfer projects could significantly increase the flow rate in most lake areas while their influence on water quality is variable due to the interaction of many driving factors the degree of tn and tp improvement is not always proportional to the flow rate 2 a water transferred rate of 140 m3 s 1 through zh is recommended for improving the mean water flow rate and water quality of the entire lake wind speed has less effect on water quality compared to transferred inflow rate route and water quality but it significantly improves the average water quality in the heavily polluted bay of the western basin 3 a clean water transfer has a significantly better improvement in water quality than a poor one the effects of water transfer on tn improvement last longer than nh3 n and tp the concentration of nh3 n in the donated water should be strictly controlled 4 to improve the water quality of lake chaohu the improvement of the water quality in the donating system water transfer through zh and during winter and a combination of the effects of the low east wind are recommended the results obtained in this study are useful to lake managers in lake chaohu and provide deep insight into selecting the appropriate assessment parameters when analyzing the water transfer efficacy due to the limitation of the water quality observation data in the donating system the numerical experiments in this study are conducted under specific water quality conditions in addition the increased transfer inflow rate may trigger sediment resuspension which is accompanied by the nutrient release from the sediment thus real time monitoring of water quality and more internal nutrient release flux data are needed to improve model performance and to investigate the impact of

7718,study region lake nam co a typical deep alpine lake in the central of tibetan plateau study focus this study investigates the role of surface turbulent fluxes in simulating lake freeze up and the role of solar radiation transfer when lake ice exists in simulating the lake ice break up new hydrological insights in the coupled model the realistic representation of surface turbulent heat fluxes is crucial to simulate the lake freeze up this is because turbulent heat fluxes especially the latent heat directly controlling the lake water temperature through energy exchange between water and atmosphere additionally the partitioning of solar radiation transfers when lake ice exist is crucial in simulating lake ice break up the proportion absorbed by the ice surface will be released associated with upward longwave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes and only a fraction is used for surface ice water phase change the proportion absorbed by the subsurface layer ice is directly used for ice water phase changes the proportion absorbed by the water through ice penetration is temporarily stored and used for ice melting through heat exchange between the ice and water the offline flake model is much less sensitive to the above two processes implying the importance and necessity in improving the model physics in coupled model graphical abstract ga1 keywords alpine lake coupled atmosphere lake model lake freeze up and break up wrf flake data availability the model code and the simulation data are available at the following page https data mendeley com datasets 4k7sg33636 1 1 introduction alpine lake is one of the key land cover types in the tibetan plateau tp together with rivers glaciers and snow it is a key component of the asian water tower immerzeel et al 2010 xu et al 2008 yao et al 2019 and serves as a main water storage covering a total area of more than 47000 km2 zhang et al 2019 2014 therefore it plays crucial roles in hydrological and energy cycles due to evaporative and thermal feedbacks to the atmosphere which can influence the local and regional climate alpine lakes in the tp have been undergoing rapid extension especially in recent years lei et al 2014 2013 yang et al 2017 and their influence on regional climate is becoming more and more significant the atmospheric feedbacks of lake differ significantly from the surrounding land in terms of momentum flux evaporation and sensible heat these differences are caused by the strong land water contrasts compared with land lake has much lower albedo smaller roughness much more humid surface and larger heat capacity ma et al 2013 stepanenko et al 2014 wu et al 2019 through these feedbacks alpine lake can influence local and regional climate through various ways the low surface roughness can accelerate the horizontal wind speed and then enhance orographic precipitation over its downwind land yao et al 2021 through its evaporative compensation to air water vapor lakes can contribute to significant amount of precipitation over its surface and downwind land area dai et al 2018a the high heat capacity can lead to opposite land lake atmospheric circulation during day and night in summer wu et al 2019 if the lake surface temperature lst is higher than the air temperature it will triggering convective instability and may result in enhanced precipitation over lakes while on the contrary the lower lst will inhibit the development of convection and lead to a weaken of lake effect precipitation su et al 2018 the influences of alpine lake to the local and regional climate are not only limited to summer but also reflected in the other seasons as well as the seasonal variability one typical characteristic of alpine lakes is seasonal freezing and thawing accurate simulation of the freeze thaw process is crucial to represent the seasonality of climatic impacts of alpine lakes in coupled atmosphere lake models however modelling this process is challenging with key issues arising from the following three uncertainties first there is a lack of observational data due to the harsh environment of the tp which brings practical difficulties for field observations about lake parameters such as salinity transparency and lake depth these parameters vary significantly between different alpine lakes for example the salinity of an inner flow lake might be much higher than other lakes even for inner flow lakes the salinity may differ significantly due to variable precipitation and evaporation intensity the depth of a lake may also vary from a few meters to hundreds of meters these parameters are very important in representing the energy and water balance in numerical models recently there have been some exciting results by liu et al 2021 who measured the salinity transparency and water temperature of 124 alpine lakes across the tp so far this fieldwork is still ongoing second there is currently a lack of understanding about the complexity of important physical processes of the lake and lake atmosphere interactions associated with lake freezing and thawing for example the melting of lake ice mainly depends on solar radiation related processes efremova and palshin 2011 especially shortwave radiation absorption by ice and water which is closely related to the albedo and extinction coefficients li et al 2020 high ice albedo can delay the onset of melt due to less energy absorption that can be used for ice water phase change kirillin et al 2012 the absorbed shortwave radiation is partly by the ice surface partly by deeper lake ice and partly by the water underneath the ice the first part is associated with surface cleanness while the latter two are controlled by the ice thickness and extinction coefficients currently the role of the latter two parts have been highlighted in most studies e g li et al 2020 however the partitioning of shortwave radiation absorbed by the ice surface and deeper ice water is also important this former part of energy can be released in the form of longwave radiation turbulent heat fluxes and ice water phase change the energy directly absorbed by deep ice is only used for ice water phase change and ice temperature change the energy absorbed by lake water underneath the ice can increase the water temperature to more than the freezing point huang et al 2021 kirillin et al 2021 lazhu et al 2021 and delay ice melt by temporarily storing the energy instead of being immediately used for ice melting these processes need to be carefully parameterized in lake models especially in coupled atmosphere lake models when used for regional weather and climate forecasting third large uncertainties exist for offline atmospheric forcing currently there are few numerical investigations on the freeze thaw of alpine lakes and these are almost all based on offline simulations lazhu et al 2016 applied the fresh water lake flake model to lake nam co and found that it can generally simulate the seasonality of lst compared with modis data huang et al 2019a showed that when forced by station data the default three offline lake models flake mironov 2008 mironov et al 2009 wrf lake gu et al 2013 2016 and common land model colm lake dai et al 2003 can generally represent seasonal freezing and thawing of lake nam co although with considerable delayed or advanced freeze up break up time tuning of key parameters such as the extinction coefficient surface albedo surface roughness and turbulent mixing factors can obviously improve the ability of the model to represent lake temperature profiles and their freeze thaw seasonality based on the lake2 0 model li et al 2020 diagnosed the sensitivity of ice melting to the snow and ice albedo ice and water extinction water temperature profiles and turbulent heat fluxes this study highlighted that improving the parameterization of lake freeze thaw processes is very necessary dai et al 2018b applied colm lake to ten worldwide lakes and found that this model can simulate the freeze thaw of lake sparking but with considerable errors in simulating the freeze up time of the great lakes in north america indicating that large uncertainties exist between different lakes these previous researches have demonstrated that offline lake models show considerable ability to simulate lake freezing and melting of alpine lakes however these offline simulations were either driven by onshore station observations near the lake or by reanalysis data which may have large deviations from the real meteorology conditions above the lake surface consequently some key empirical parameters which are suitable for offline lake models may not be appropriate for coupled models and our understandings of the key physical processes inferred from offline sensitivity simulations are often limited to address these challenging issues and difficulties the objective of this study is to investigate and understand the importance of key physical processes associated with lake ice phenology based on a coupled atmosphere lake model wrf flake at lake nam co which is a typical deep alpine lake in the tp the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data model and experimental design section 3 diagnoses the role of two key typical processes in simulating the freeze up and break up times of lake nam co section 4 compares the simulation results of wrf flake with the offline flake and the default wrf lake finally the conclusions are provided in section 5 2 data and model 2 1 modis lst data lst from modis was used to compare with the model simulation results focusing on the frozen status of the lake two 1 km resolution version 006 products are used including mod11a1 and myd11a1 these products cover a period from february 24th in 2000 to present due to the contamination of clouds the modis data product has considerable missing observations for some time periods the mean lst over the lake area was calculated and compared with the mean value from the simulations for quality control the land water mixed pixels the nearest two pixels to land in modis were excluded and a total of 1574 grids is used additionally when the missing data were larger than 90 the values were also excluded before comparison even though there are still some outliers caused by the cloud contamination especially for nighttime lst more details and a link to download the data can be found at https modis gsfc nasa gov for fair comparisons the modis data was interpolated to the modeled grids using area weighted method and the modeled data was linearly interpolated to the modis passing time for comparisons with one dimensional flake model grids mean values are used for modis 2 2 the flake model the flake model is a one dimensional freshwater model developed by mironov 2008 the model has two dynamic layers with an upper mixed layer and a thermocline layer in which the water temperature is parameterized by the self similarity theory additional considerations of lake ice snow and bottom sediments are also considered one key characteristic of the flake model is that the mixed layer depth is parameterized dynamically by diagnosing the water convection and stability conditions this method is different from a finite differential model where energy exchange is parameterized by a turbulent mixing ratio in flake model consistent with the wrf lake and community land model clm lake the water temperature is set to the freezing point normally equal to zero once the lake is frozen by default flake assumes that all the un reflected solar radiation is absorbed by ice surface without penetration there is only one single layer for ice and the ice accumulation is not balanced with the lake water which is different from finite differential models in the finite differential models such as clm lake model the lake is frozen layer by layer and the amount of liquid water reduced accordingly the later guarantee the water mass balance which could be very important for simulations of shallow lakes for deep lakes flake might be a better choice because the turbulent mixing is implicitly considered by the self similarity theory rather than an explicit parameterization as in finite differential lake models additionally the water mass balance can be negligible for deep lakes 2 3 coupled wrf flake model and experimental design 2 3 1 general model description and setup the atmospheric part of the coupled model is the wrf model which was developed by ncar and has been continuously updated since the 1990 s the wrf is a non hydrostatic model with multi parameterizations including for planetary boundary layer pbl land surface model lsm cloud microphysics cumulus convection and orographic drag schemes based on numerical tests we found that the default wrf lake model simulated lake freeze up and ice break up at nam co too early section 4 2 therefore in this work flake was coupled with wrf instead of the default lake model to see whether this would reduce model errors mallard et al 2014 previously used a dynamically coupling of wrf and flake however we use a different coupling strategy in this study in mallard et al 2014 at each time step the atmosphere components temperature pressure humidity wind speed precipitation downward shortwave radiation and downward longwave radiation drive the flake model and the lst in the wrf is replaced with the one from flake to calculate the turbulent heat fluxes and the longwave radiation components at the surface in current coupling strategy as shown in fig 1a the atmosphere components drive the flake model and the turbulent fluxes albedo to calculate solar radiation reflection and surface temperature to calculate upward longwave radiation output from flake feedback to the atmosphere independently the latter method guarantees that the energy and water balance is satisfied during sensitivity tests when changing lake parameters and is more suitable for understanding the physical processes other differences may exist between the two coupling strategies but this is beyond the focus of current work in the newly coupled wrf flake model the lake depth was set to the average value of 40 m at each grid the lake status can be initialized by long term simulations from lazhu et al 2016 which save a lot of time for the spin up lake water temperature due to the high salinity and transparency of nam co the water extinction was set to 0 12 based on observations by wang et al 2009 which was also used by the numerical study by huang et al 2019a the temperature at maximum water density was set to 3 5 c wang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and the threshold of ice albedo has been set to 0 2 in the parameterization of ice albedo according to observations by li et al 2020 fig 1b shows the simulation domain with the nam co located at the center nam co is a typical alpine lake located in the middle of the tp centered at about 30 7 n 90 6 e with an area of more than 2000 km2 it is an inner flow lake with three recharging rivers and has an average depth of about 40 m lazhu et al 2016 under global warming the lake area has experienced rapid increases since the 1990 s due to increased precipitation and melting of snow and glaciers within the basin lei et al 2014 2013 zhang et al 2020 in the simulations the horizontal grid spacing is 0 04 about 4 5 km which is able to resolve deep convection processes there are 116 lake grids in the model the initial and lateral boundary conditions of the model were provided by the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 at a 6 hour interval since the surrounding terrain at nam co is rather complex as shown in fig 1a a turbulent orographic drag scheme beljaars et al 2004 zhou et al 2018 was applied to represent the dynamic drag induced by unresolved sub grid topography this scheme significantly reduces the wind speed bias over the tp and reduces water vapor transport zhou et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 for the other model configurations we follow the model setup used in the har dataset maussion et al 2014 with dudhia scheme and rrtm for shortwave and longwave radiation transfer the modified thompson scheme for microphysics the noah land surface model and the mellor yamada janjic turbulent kinetic energy planetary boundary layer scheme 2 3 2 sensitivity experiments focusing on two key processes the two key processes focused in this study are the role of surface turbulent fluxes in simulating lake freeze up and the role of solar radiation transfer when lake ice exists in simulating the lake ice break up see fig 2 for sketches of the two processes in the current work the freeze up time is defined as the first day of three consecutive days that no open water is detected for all lake grids the break up time is defined as the first day of three consecutive days that open water is detected for at least one lake grid such definitions are to make a relatively fair comparison with modis because modis cannot distinguish if a pixel is ice surface or contaminated by cloud and the times of ice occurrence and ice disappear cannot be accurately detected the formation of ice is mainly determined by energy storage su et al 2020 which could be associated with turbulent heat fluxes released to the atmosphere wen et al 2016 demonstrated that surface turbulent heat fluxes are very important for energy processes in alpine lakes but that large uncertainties exist for large open water surfaces wind induced water surface waves and spray can enhance the turbulent fluxes see fig 2a for a schematic of this process and should be properly considered in the parameterization of these fluxes chen and yu 2016 subin et al 2012 the melting of lake ice mainly depends on solar radiation related processes efremova and palshin 2011 especially shortwave absorption of ice and water li et al 2020 the solar radiation absorbed when lake ice exists should be partitioned into three parts fig 2b the first part is absorbed by the ice surface and in addition to ice melting it is also used for surface energy balance associated with turbulent heat fluxes and upward longwave radiation the second part is absorbed by deeper ice and is used only for ice phase change from solid to liquid the third part is absorbed by the water underneath the ice as highlighted by kirillin et al 2021 lazhu et al 2021 and this part will be temporarily stored and then used for ice melting through water ice heat exchange normally such as wrf lake and clm lake model the water temperature is set to the freezing point normally equal to zero once the lake is frozen and the penetrated solar radiation the second part plus the third part is directly used for lake ice melting from the bottom without considering water ice fluxes the penetrated part can be all used for ice water phase change which is more effective in reducing lake ice than the first part thus take into account the solar radiation absorption at the ice surface and sub surface is important in simulating lake ice phenology there are thermal dynamic ice models that considering the solar radiation partitioning at surface and subsurface using solar radiation penetrating schemes hoffman and price 2014 hoffman et al 2018 maykut and perovich 1987 some offline lake models also consider such processes for example hightsi model launiainen and cheng 1998 this model has also been applied to a shallow lake in tp to simulate the ice phonology huang et al 2019b in the default flake model all the shortwave radiation that is not reflected is assumed to be absorbed by the ice surface this process doesn t seem to play a dominant role in simulating ice break up by the offline flake and the model can generally simulate the break up time at nam co huang et al 2019a however is the performance similar in the coupled atmosphere lake model wrf flake therefore two group of sensitivity experiments are designed using both coupled wrf flake model and offline flake model the first group of simulation focuses on the role of surface turbulent fluxes on lake freeze up covers a simulation period from july 1st in 2013 to may 31st in 2014 both the coupled wrf flake and offline flake are initialized using the long term offline simulation results by lazhu et al 2016 the second group of simulation focuses on the role of solar radiation partitioning between the ice surface and the subsurface on lake ice break up covers a simulation period from jan 1st in 2014 to jun 30th in 2014 both the coupled wrf flake and offline flake are initialized by the modis lst because the turbulent mixing of lake water is the strongest before freeze up and the temperature profile is generally uniform additionally the newly coupled wrf flake model will be compared with the default wrf lake model both model are initialized by the long term flake offline simulation by lazhu et al 2016 started in july 1st in 2013 and finished in jun 30th in 2015 3 results and analysis this section diagnoses the roles of the two key processes as described in section 2 3 2 on lake freeze up and ice break up based on the coupled wrf flake model the enhancement effect by water surface waves and spray on the turbulent fluxes is diagnosed by enlarging these fluxes as shown in section 3 1 in section 3 2 the role of partitioning solar radiation absorption at the ice surface and subsurface on lake ice break up is diagnosed by empirically introducing a surface absorption coefficient 3 1 the role of surface turbulent heat fluxes on lake freeze up su et al 2020 stated that introducing a scaling factor sf for friction velocity based on the theory of gao et al 2009 is an effective way to account for the wave induced effects of enhancing the turbulent heat fluxes in the flake model when an sf of 2 0 is applied a positive bias in the simulated lst is significantly reduced in unfrozen seasons the scaling of the friction velocity directly modifies the magnitude of turbulent heat fluxes and the associated energy balance at the lake surface therefore the sf should also influence the lake freeze up through the surface energy balance consequently sensitivity tests are performed between the lake freeze up time and the magnitude of the sf at nam co using the coupled wrf flake model to diagnose the role of surface turbulent fluxes each sensitivity run was initialized by the long term offline simulations from lazhu et al 2016 fig 3a shows the comparison between the simulation results and the modis lst data when the sf is set to 1 0 the default value in flake 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 0 in the sensitivity runs the results show that the lake lst is very sensitive to sf note that the lst in simulation is in best agreement with modis when sf is set to 1 25 this is because modis has large errors in detecting ice surface due to the contamination of cloud it represents an average of grids only with open water while lst in the simulation is an average of all grids thus for a fair comparison the simulated frozen fraction of lake nam co in the sensitivity experiments are shown in fig 3b for each grid the freeze up time is defined as the first day of three continuous days without occurrence of open water i e a night and day time lst of greater than 0 c when the sf is set to 1 5 the lake freeze up time shows the best agreement with modis while the default sf and 1 25 sf experiments show late freeze up later than mid march even with a considerable proportion of lake grids never freeze when the sf is set to 1 75 or 2 0 the lake freezes too early around mid december or earlier the sf directly modifies the friction velocity u in the calculation of turbulent heat flux through which the lake water energy storage and lake freeze up time is controlled therefore the sensible heat sh and latent heat lh in the sensitivity experiments are presented in fig 4 these figures show that the lh is more sensitive to the scaling of u this result implies that accounting for the impacts of wind induced water surface waves and spray on surface heat fluxes by scaling of u is very important in accurately simulating the lake freeze up time 3 2 the role of solar radiation partitioning between the ice surface and the subsurface focusing on the lake ice break up time we conducted tests by setting the shortwave absorption ratio at the ice surface abs to 1 0 the default of flake 0 8 0 7 0 6 and 0 5 using the coupled wrf flake model to investigate the role of solar radiation partitioning between the ice surface and the subsurface abs is defined as the ratio of the solar radiation absorbed by the ice surface layer to the total the amount of absorbed by the ice surface layer plus penetrated absorbed solar radiation in the default flake model all the downward sw absorbed at the ice surface is used for the ice fusion ice temperature changes and surface energy balance e g upward longwave sh and lh however in the sensitivity tests this proportion of energy was reduced meaning that a considerable part of sw will be penetrated and absorbed by the ice subsurface deeper ice and water beneath the ice for simplify following the method in wrf lake and clm lake the penetrated part is directly used by the ice water phase change without considering the water ice energy exchange assume zero water ice heat flux fig 5a shows the comparison between the sensitivity simulation results and modis lst data the results show that the lake ice break up time is very sensitive to abs for each grid the break up time is defined as the first day of three consecutive days with occurrence of open water i e night and day time lst of greater than 0 c fig 5b shows the simulated break up time of lake nam co when the abs is set to 0 7 the lake break up time shows the best agreement with modis with break up occurring during early may when the abs is set to 0 8 and 1 0 the experiments show late break up later than mid may and never break up when the abs is set to 0 5 and 0 6 the break up occurs too early during late march and early april in the default flake model all the un reflected shortwave is absorbed by the ice surface when abs was set to 1 0 contributing to the turbulent heat flux upward longwave ice fusion and ice temperature change however a considerable proportion of the shortwave radiation can penetrate the ice surface and be absorbed by the deep ice or even the water beneath this part of the energy will be used only for ice fusion ice water phase changes and ice temperature change consequently the ice melting process can be more accurately described if these processes are included in the model abs directly determines the amount of sw that penetrates the ice surface and is used for ice fusion the penetrated sw in each sensitivity experiment is shown in fig 6a more penetrated sw can be used for lake ice melting when the abs is set to a smaller value this process alleviates the accumulation of lake ice during the freezing period and accelerates ice melting during the thawing period therefore the phenology of ice is expected to be more realistically represented by using abs 0 7 in the coupled model fig 6b the above results show the realistic description of solar radiation transfer when lake ice exists by proper partitioning of ice surface and deep ice water absorption is very important and plays a dominant role in accurately simulating the lake break up time the importance of solar radiation transfers when lake ice exists has also been highlighted in the study of huang et al 2021 based on observation however their study negelect the partitioning of ice surface and deep ice water absorption which plays significant roles in controling the lake break up time in the coupled wrf flake model additionally in recent lake models such as flake wrf lake and clm lake the freezing point temperature normally equal to zero is introduced as a threshold for the under ice water temperature once the lake is frozen however observations show that part of the absorbed solar radiation by the lake water underneath the ice can increase the water temperature to higher than the freezing point and delay ice melting by temporarily storing the energy in the water instead of being immediately used for ice melting kirillin et al 2021 lazhu et al 2021 this process is very complicated and not considered in these models as well as in current work 4 discussion 4 1 compared with the offline flake simulations the above sensitivity experiments show that proper modulation of surface turbulent heat fluxes during unfreezing period and the absorptions of solar radiation at ice surface and subsurface during freezing period are very important in the simulation of lake ice freeze up and break up time in the coupled wrf flake model but how about in offline flake in this section two groups of sensitivity experiments have also been carried out using the offline flake model to make a comparison results show that the sensitivity of the freeze up time to sf is totally different from the coupled wrf flake model fig 7a the freeze up time of nam co is always earlier in the offline flake than in the coupled wrf flake fig 7a vs fig 3a b though using the same values of sf additionally the freeze up time in the coupled model is more sensitive to the sf than the offline flake this comparison demonstrates that some key parameters or model settings that are suitable for a coupled atmosphere lake model may not be able to be derived from offline sensitivity tests similarly the sensitivity of the ice break up time to abs in the offline flake model are also significantly different from the coupled wrf flake model fig 7b vs fig 5a b for example the break up time of nam co shows low sensitivity to abs compared with the coupled wrf flake model fig 7b this comparison further demonstrates that some key parameters or model settings that are suitable for a coupled atmosphere lake model cannot be derived based on offline sensitivity tests therefore it is very important to obtain key parameters and verify the simulation capability of the lake model based on coupled atmosphere lake model 4 2 compared with the default wrf lake coupled model section 3 shows that proper settings of sf and abs can reasonably simulate the freeze up time and ice break up time by better descriptions of the two energy processes to further address the importance of these two processes the coupled wrf flake model with the optimal sf 1 5 and abs 0 7 is compared with the default coupled model i e wrf coupled with default lake both models have been integrated from 1st july 2013 31 st june 2015 to cover two seasonal cycles both simulation uses the same initial settings and lake parameters including lake depth salinity maximum density temperature and etc then the lst and ice thickness has been compared as shown in fig 8 compared with modis the lake freeze up and break up in wrf lake are too early while the wrf flake is more consistent with modis with proper setting of sf and abs fig 8a simultaneously the ice thickness from the two model are also presented fig 8b ice thickness reaches its maximum to 0 1 m equal to the thickness of the first lake layer in wrf lake and keeps unchanged for a considerable period of time while it follows a smooth curve in wrf flake fig 8b this might be associated with the different handling of lake ice between the two lake models the wrf lake is frozen layer by layer while the ice thickness is independent of the lake depth in flake the depth of second layer in wrf lake has been set to 4 0 m which is too thick to frozen and the ice thickness keeps constant equal to the thickness of the first lake layer for a considerable time period during frozen this comparison demonstrates that the parameterizations of the same physical process could differ significantly between different lake models the design of wrf flake obviously shows advantages regarding the simulation of ice thickness than the wrf lake model additionally the wrf flake model with the optimal settings of sf and abs outperforms the default wrf lake model in simulating the freeze up and ice break up time fig 8b and table 1 however the current way of introducing sf and abs might be too empirical and lack of rigorous theoretical support thus more comprehensive work is required to improve the parametrizations of these two processes in wrf flake nevertheless this comparison demonstrated that wrf flake model with better representations of key physical processes has the potential to outperform wrf lake 5 conclusions two groups of experiments were conducted to investigate the role of two key energy processes in simulating lake freeze up and lake ice break up using the wrf flake coupled atmosphere lake model the main findings are summarized in the following 1 proper consideration of the impacts of surface heat fluxes is very important to simulate the lake freeze up in a coupled atmosphere lake model 2 realistic descriptions of solar radiation transfer when lake ice exists especially partitioning of ice surface and subsurface ice water absorption is very important in simulating the lake ice break up 3 the coupled model is much more sensitive to the key processes in parameterizations of surface heat fluxes and lake ice solar radiation transfer than the offline lake model 4 using coupled model to understanding the roles of physical processes calibration of specific parameters and verification of the simulation capability of lake models for alpine lakes are necessary in general this work provides valuable preliminary insights into the role of two key energy processes in simulating lake freezing and thawing using a newly coupled atmosphere lake model wrf flake proper consideration of these two processes can reasonably improve the simulating of lake freezing and melting seasonality however the real physical processes are more complicated and substantial work is needed to more accurately parameterize the lake surface energy balance and lake ice solar radiation transmission nevertheless the key results of this study provide new insights in the simulation of lake ice phenology using coupled atmosphere lake models especially for deep alpine

7718,study region lake nam co a typical deep alpine lake in the central of tibetan plateau study focus this study investigates the role of surface turbulent fluxes in simulating lake freeze up and the role of solar radiation transfer when lake ice exists in simulating the lake ice break up new hydrological insights in the coupled model the realistic representation of surface turbulent heat fluxes is crucial to simulate the lake freeze up this is because turbulent heat fluxes especially the latent heat directly controlling the lake water temperature through energy exchange between water and atmosphere additionally the partitioning of solar radiation transfers when lake ice exist is crucial in simulating lake ice break up the proportion absorbed by the ice surface will be released associated with upward longwave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes and only a fraction is used for surface ice water phase change the proportion absorbed by the subsurface layer ice is directly used for ice water phase changes the proportion absorbed by the water through ice penetration is temporarily stored and used for ice melting through heat exchange between the ice and water the offline flake model is much less sensitive to the above two processes implying the importance and necessity in improving the model physics in coupled model graphical abstract ga1 keywords alpine lake coupled

introduction alpine lake is one of the key land cover types in the tibetan plateau tp together with rivers glaciers and snow it is a key component of the asian water tower immerzeel et al 2010 xu et al 2008 yao et al 2019 and serves as a main water storage covering a total area of more than 47000 km2 zhang et al 2019 2014 therefore it plays crucial roles in hydrological and energy cycles due to evaporative and thermal feedbacks to the atmosphere which can influence the local and regional climate alpine lakes in the tp have been undergoing rapid extension especially in recent years lei et al 2014 2013 yang et al 2017 and their influence on regional climate is becoming more and more significant the atmospheric feedbacks of lake differ significantly from the surrounding land in terms of momentum flux evaporation and sensible heat these differences are caused by the strong land water contrasts compared with land lake has much lower albedo smaller roughness much more humid surface and larger heat capacity ma et al 2013 stepanenko et al 2014 wu et al 2019 through these feedbacks alpine lake can influence local and regional climate through various ways the low surface roughness can accelerate the horizontal wind speed and then enhance orographic precipitation over its downwind land yao et al 2021 through its evaporative compensation to air water vapor lakes can contribute to significant amount of precipitation over its surface and downwind land area dai et al 2018a the high heat capacity can lead to opposite land lake atmospheric circulation during day and night in summer wu et al 2019 if the lake surface temperature lst is higher than the air temperature it will triggering convective instability and may result in enhanced precipitation over lakes while on the contrary the lower lst will inhibit the development of convection and lead to a weaken of lake effect precipitation su et al 2018 the influences of alpine lake to the local and regional climate are not only limited to summer but also reflected in the other seasons as well as the seasonal variability one typical characteristic of alpine lakes is seasonal freezing and thawing accurate simulation of the freeze thaw process is crucial to represent the seasonality of climatic impacts of alpine lakes in coupled atmosphere lake models however modelling this process is challenging with key issues arising from the following three uncertainties first there is a lack of observational data due to the harsh environment of the tp which brings practical difficulties for field observations about lake parameters such as salinity transparency and lake depth these parameters vary significantly between different alpine lakes for example the salinity of an inner flow lake might be much higher than other lakes even for inner flow lakes the salinity may differ significantly due to variable precipitation and evaporation intensity the depth of a lake may also vary from a few meters to hundreds of meters these parameters are very important in representing the energy and water balance in numerical models recently there have been some exciting results by liu et al 2021 who measured the salinity transparency and water temperature of 124 alpine lakes across the tp so far this fieldwork is still ongoing second there is currently a lack of understanding about the complexity of important physical processes of the lake and lake atmosphere interactions associated with lake freezing and thawing for example the melting of lake ice mainly depends on solar radiation related processes efremova and palshin 2011 especially shortwave radiation absorption by ice and water which is closely related to the albedo and extinction coefficients li et al 2020 high ice albedo can delay the onset of melt due to less energy absorption that can be used for ice water phase change kirillin et al 2012 the absorbed shortwave radiation is partly by the ice surface partly by deeper lake ice and partly by the water underneath the ice the first part is associated with surface cleanness while the latter two are controlled by the ice thickness and extinction coefficients currently the role of the latter two parts have been highlighted in most studies e g li et al 2020 however the partitioning of shortwave radiation absorbed by the ice surface and deeper ice water is also important this former part of energy can be released in the form of longwave radiation turbulent heat fluxes and ice water phase change the energy directly absorbed by deep ice is only used for ice water phase change and ice temperature change the energy absorbed by lake water underneath the ice can increase the water temperature to more than the freezing point huang et al 2021 kirillin et al 2021 lazhu et al 2021 and delay ice melt by temporarily storing the energy instead of being immediately used for ice melting these processes need to be carefully parameterized in lake models especially in coupled atmosphere lake models when used for regional weather and climate forecasting third large uncertainties exist for offline atmospheric forcing currently there are few numerical investigations on the freeze thaw of alpine lakes and these are almost all based on offline simulations lazhu et al 2016 applied the fresh water lake flake model to lake nam co and found that it can generally simulate the seasonality of lst compared with modis data huang et al 2019a showed that when forced by station data the default three offline lake models flake mironov 2008 mironov et al 2009 wrf lake gu et al 2013 2016 and common land model colm lake dai et al 2003 can generally represent seasonal freezing and thawing of lake nam co although with considerable delayed or advanced freeze up break up time tuning of key parameters such as the extinction coefficient surface albedo surface roughness and turbulent mixing factors can obviously improve the ability of the model to represent lake temperature profiles and their freeze thaw seasonality based on the lake2 0 model li et al 2020 diagnosed the sensitivity of ice melting to the snow and ice albedo ice and water extinction water temperature profiles and turbulent heat fluxes this study highlighted that improving the parameterization of lake freeze thaw processes is very necessary dai et al 2018b applied colm lake to ten worldwide lakes and found that this model can simulate the freeze thaw of lake sparking but with considerable errors in simulating the freeze up time of the great lakes in north america indicating that large uncertainties exist between different lakes these previous researches have demonstrated that offline lake models show considerable ability to simulate lake freezing and melting of alpine lakes however these offline simulations were either driven by onshore station observations near the lake or by reanalysis data which may have large deviations from the real meteorology conditions above the lake surface consequently some key empirical parameters which are suitable for offline lake models may not be appropriate for coupled models and our understandings of the key physical processes inferred from offline sensitivity simulations are often limited to address these challenging issues and difficulties the objective of this study is to investigate and understand the importance of key physical processes associated with lake ice phenology based on a coupled atmosphere lake model wrf flake at lake nam co which is a typical deep alpine lake in the tp the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data model and experimental design section 3 diagnoses the role of two key typical processes in simulating the freeze up and break up times of lake nam co section 4 compares the simulation results of wrf flake with the offline flake and the default wrf lake finally the conclusions are provided in section 5 2 data and model 2 1 modis lst data lst from modis was used to compare with the model simulation results focusing on the frozen status of the lake two 1 km resolution version 006 products are used including mod11a1 and myd11a1 these products cover a period from february 24th in 2000 to present due to the contamination of clouds the modis data product has considerable missing observations for some time periods the mean lst over the lake area was calculated and compared with the mean value from the simulations for quality control the land water mixed pixels the nearest two pixels to land in modis were excluded and a total of 1574 grids is used additionally when the missing data were larger than 90 the values were also excluded before comparison even though there are still some outliers caused by the cloud contamination especially for nighttime lst more details and a link to download the data can be found at https modis gsfc nasa gov for fair comparisons the modis data was interpolated to the modeled grids using area weighted method and the modeled data was linearly interpolated to the modis passing time for comparisons with one dimensional flake model grids mean values are used for modis 2 2 the flake model the flake model is a one dimensional freshwater model developed by mironov 2008 the model has two dynamic layers with an upper mixed layer and a thermocline layer in which the water temperature is parameterized by the self similarity theory additional considerations of lake ice snow and bottom sediments are also considered one key characteristic of the flake model is that the mixed layer depth is parameterized dynamically by diagnosing the water convection and stability conditions this method is different from a finite differential model where energy exchange is parameterized by a turbulent mixing ratio in flake model consistent with the wrf lake and community land model clm lake the water temperature is set to the freezing point normally equal to zero once the lake is frozen by default flake assumes that all the un reflected solar radiation is absorbed by ice surface without penetration there is only one single layer for ice and the ice accumulation is not balanced with the lake water which is different from finite differential models in the finite differential models such as clm lake model the lake is frozen layer by layer and the amount of liquid water reduced accordingly the later guarantee the water mass balance which could be very important for simulations of shallow lakes for deep lakes flake might be a better choice because the turbulent mixing is implicitly considered by the self similarity theory rather than an explicit parameterization as in finite differential lake models additionally the water mass balance can be negligible for deep lakes 2 3 coupled wrf flake model and experimental design 2 3 1 general model description and setup the atmospheric part of the coupled model is the wrf model which was developed by ncar and has been continuously updated since the 1990 s the wrf is a non hydrostatic model with multi parameterizations including for planetary boundary layer pbl land surface model lsm cloud microphysics cumulus convection and orographic drag schemes based on numerical tests we found that the default wrf lake model simulated lake freeze up and ice break up at nam co too early section 4 2 therefore in this work flake was coupled with wrf instead of the default lake model to see whether this would reduce model errors mallard et al 2014 previously used a dynamically coupling of wrf and flake however we use a different coupling strategy in this study in mallard et al 2014 at each time step the atmosphere components temperature pressure humidity wind speed precipitation downward shortwave radiation and downward longwave radiation drive the flake model and the lst in the wrf is replaced with the one from flake to calculate the turbulent heat fluxes and the longwave radiation components at the surface in current coupling strategy as shown in fig 1a the atmosphere components drive the flake model and the turbulent fluxes albedo to calculate solar radiation reflection and surface temperature to calculate upward longwave radiation output from flake feedback to the atmosphere independently the latter method guarantees that the energy and water balance is satisfied during sensitivity tests when changing lake parameters and is more suitable for understanding the physical processes other differences may exist between the two coupling strategies but this is beyond the focus of current work in the newly coupled wrf flake model the lake depth was set to the average value of 40 m at each grid the lake status can be initialized by long term simulations from lazhu et al 2016 which save a lot of time for the spin up lake water temperature due to the high salinity and transparency of nam co the water extinction was set to 0 12 based on observations by wang et al 2009 which was also used by the numerical study by huang et al 2019a the temperature at maximum water density was set to 3 5 c wang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and the threshold of ice albedo has been set to 0 2 in the parameterization of ice albedo according to observations by li et al 2020 fig 1b shows the simulation domain with the nam co located at the center nam co is a typical alpine lake located in the middle of the tp centered at about 30 7 n 90 6 e with an area of more than 2000 km2 it is an inner flow lake with three recharging rivers and has an average depth of about 40 m lazhu et al 2016 under global warming the lake area has experienced rapid increases since the 1990 s due to increased precipitation and melting of snow and glaciers within the basin lei et al 2014 2013 zhang et al 2020 in the simulations the horizontal grid spacing is 0 04 about 4 5 km which is able to resolve deep convection processes there are 116 lake grids in the model the initial and lateral boundary conditions of the model were provided by the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 at a 6 hour interval since the surrounding terrain at nam co is rather complex as shown in fig 1a a turbulent orographic drag scheme beljaars et al 2004 zhou et al 2018 was applied to represent the dynamic drag induced by unresolved sub grid topography this scheme significantly reduces the wind speed bias over the tp and reduces water vapor transport zhou et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 for the other model configurations we follow the model setup used in the har dataset maussion et al 2014 with dudhia scheme and rrtm for shortwave and longwave radiation transfer the modified thompson scheme for microphysics the noah land surface model and the mellor yamada janjic turbulent kinetic energy planetary boundary layer scheme 2 3 2 sensitivity experiments focusing on two key processes the two key processes focused in this study are the role of surface turbulent fluxes in simulating lake freeze up and the role of solar radiation transfer when lake ice exists in simulating the lake ice break up see fig 2 for sketches of the two processes in the current work the freeze up time is defined as the first day of three consecutive days that no open water is detected for all lake grids the break up time is defined as the first day of three consecutive days that open water is detected for at least one lake grid such definitions are to make a relatively fair comparison with modis because modis cannot distinguish if a pixel is ice surface or contaminated by cloud and the times of ice occurrence and ice disappear cannot be accurately detected the formation of ice is mainly determined by energy storage su et al 2020 which could be associated with turbulent heat fluxes released to the atmosphere wen et al 2016 demonstrated that surface turbulent heat fluxes are very important for energy processes in alpine lakes but that large uncertainties exist for large open water surfaces wind induced water surface waves and spray can enhance the turbulent fluxes see fig 2a for a schematic of this process and should be properly considered in the parameterization of these fluxes chen and yu 2016 subin et al 2012 the melting of lake ice mainly depends on solar radiation related processes efremova and palshin 2011 especially shortwave absorption of ice and water li et al 2020 the solar radiation absorbed when lake ice exists should be partitioned into three parts fig 2b the first part is absorbed by the ice surface and in addition to ice melting it is also used for surface energy balance associated with turbulent heat fluxes and upward longwave radiation the second part is absorbed by deeper ice and is used only for ice phase change from solid to liquid the third part is absorbed by the water underneath the ice as highlighted by kirillin et al 2021 lazhu et al 2021 and this part will be temporarily stored and then used for ice melting through water ice heat exchange normally such as wrf lake and clm lake model the water temperature is set to the freezing point normally equal to zero once the lake is frozen and the penetrated solar radiation the second part plus the third part is directly used for lake ice melting from the bottom without considering water ice fluxes the penetrated part can be all used for ice water phase change which is more effective in reducing lake ice than the first part thus take into account the solar radiation absorption at the ice surface and sub surface is important in simulating lake ice phenology there are thermal dynamic ice models that considering the solar radiation partitioning at surface and subsurface using solar radiation penetrating schemes hoffman and price 2014 hoffman et al 2018 maykut and perovich 1987 some offline lake models also consider such processes for example hightsi model launiainen and cheng 1998 this model has also been applied to a shallow lake in tp to simulate the ice phonology huang et al 2019b in the default flake model all the shortwave radiation that is not reflected is assumed to be absorbed by the ice surface this process doesn t seem to play a dominant role in simulating ice break up by the offline flake and the model can generally simulate the break up time at nam co huang et al 2019a however is the performance similar in the coupled atmosphere lake model wrf flake therefore two group of sensitivity experiments are designed using both coupled wrf flake model and offline flake model the first group of simulation focuses on the role of surface turbulent fluxes on lake freeze up covers a simulation period from july 1st in 2013 to may 31st in 2014 both the coupled wrf flake and offline flake are initialized using the long term offline simulation results by lazhu et al 2016 the second group of simulation focuses on the role of solar radiation partitioning between the ice surface and the subsurface on lake ice break up covers a simulation period from jan 1st in 2014 to jun 30th in 2014 both the coupled wrf flake and offline flake are initialized by the modis lst because the turbulent mixing of lake water is the strongest before freeze up and the temperature profile is generally uniform additionally the newly coupled wrf flake model will be compared with the default wrf lake model both model are initialized by the long term flake offline simulation by lazhu et al 2016 started in july 1st in 2013 and finished in jun 30th in 2015 3 results and analysis this section diagnoses the roles of the two key processes as described in section 2 3 2 on lake freeze up and ice break up based on the coupled wrf flake model the enhancement effect by water surface waves and spray on the turbulent fluxes is diagnosed by enlarging these fluxes as shown in section 3 1 in section 3 2 the role of partitioning solar radiation absorption at the ice surface and subsurface on lake ice break up is diagnosed by empirically introducing a surface absorption coefficient 3 1 the role of surface turbulent heat fluxes on lake freeze up su et al 2020 stated that introducing a scaling factor sf for friction velocity based on the theory of gao et al 2009 is an effective way to account for the wave induced effects of enhancing the turbulent heat fluxes in the flake model when an sf of 2 0 is applied a positive bias in the simulated lst is significantly reduced in unfrozen seasons the scaling of the friction velocity directly modifies the magnitude of turbulent heat fluxes and the associated energy balance at the lake surface therefore the sf should also influence the lake freeze up through the surface energy balance consequently sensitivity tests are performed between the lake freeze up time and the magnitude of the sf at nam co using the coupled wrf flake model to diagnose the role of surface turbulent fluxes each sensitivity run was initialized by the long term offline simulations from lazhu et al 2016 fig 3a shows the comparison between the simulation results and the modis lst data when the sf is set to 1 0 the default value in flake 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 0 in the sensitivity runs the results show that the lake lst is very sensitive to sf note that the lst in simulation is in best agreement with modis when sf is set to 1 25 this is because modis has large errors in detecting ice surface due to the contamination of cloud it represents an average of grids only with open water while lst in the simulation is an average of all grids thus for a fair comparison the simulated frozen fraction of lake nam co in the sensitivity experiments are shown in fig 3b for each grid the freeze up time is defined as the first day of three continuous days without occurrence of open water i e a night and day time lst of greater than 0 c when the sf is set to 1 5 the lake freeze up time shows the best agreement with modis while the default sf and 1 25 sf experiments show late freeze up later than mid march even with a considerable proportion of lake grids never freeze when the sf is set to 1 75 or 2 0 the lake freezes too early around mid december or earlier the sf directly modifies the friction velocity u in the calculation of turbulent heat flux through which the lake water energy storage and lake freeze up time is controlled therefore the sensible heat sh and latent heat lh in the sensitivity experiments are presented in fig 4 these figures show that the lh is more sensitive to the scaling of u this result implies that accounting for the impacts of wind induced water surface waves and spray on surface heat fluxes by scaling of u is very important in accurately simulating the lake freeze up time 3 2 the role of solar radiation partitioning between the ice surface and the subsurface focusing on the lake ice break up time we conducted tests by setting the shortwave absorption ratio at the ice surface abs to 1 0 the default of flake 0 8 0 7 0 6 and 0 5 using the coupled wrf flake model to investigate the role of solar radiation partitioning between the ice surface and the subsurface abs is defined as the ratio of the solar radiation absorbed by the ice surface layer to the total the amount of absorbed by the ice surface layer plus penetrated absorbed solar radiation in the default flake model all the downward sw absorbed at the ice surface is used for the ice fusion ice temperature changes and surface energy balance e g upward longwave sh and lh however in the sensitivity tests this proportion of energy was reduced meaning that a considerable part of sw will be penetrated and absorbed by the ice subsurface deeper ice and water beneath the ice for simplify following the method in wrf lake and clm lake the penetrated part is directly used by the ice water phase change without considering the water ice energy exchange assume zero water ice heat flux fig 5a shows the comparison between the sensitivity simulation results and modis lst data the results show that the lake ice break up time is very sensitive to abs for each grid the break up time is defined as the first day of three consecutive days with occurrence of open water i e night and day time lst of greater than 0 c fig 5b shows the simulated break up time of lake nam co when the abs is set to 0 7 the lake break up time shows the best agreement with modis with break up occurring during early may when the abs is set to 0 8 and 1 0 the experiments show late break up later than mid may and never break up when the abs is set to 0 5 and 0 6 the break up occurs too early during late march and early april in the default flake model all the un reflected shortwave is absorbed by the ice surface when abs was set to 1 0 contributing to the turbulent heat flux upward longwave ice fusion and ice temperature change however a considerable proportion of the shortwave radiation can penetrate the ice surface and be absorbed by the deep ice or even the water beneath this part of the energy will be used only for ice fusion ice water phase changes and ice temperature change consequently the ice melting process can be more accurately described if these processes are included in the model abs directly determines the amount of sw that penetrates the ice surface and is used for ice fusion the penetrated sw in each sensitivity experiment is shown in fig 6a more penetrated sw can be used for lake ice melting when the abs is set to a smaller value this process alleviates the accumulation of lake ice during the freezing period and accelerates ice melting during the thawing period therefore the phenology of ice is expected to be more realistically represented by using abs 0 7 in the coupled model fig 6b the above results show the realistic description of solar radiation transfer when lake ice exists by proper partitioning of ice surface and deep ice water absorption is very important and plays a dominant role in accurately simulating the lake break up time the importance of solar radiation transfers when lake ice exists has also been highlighted in the study of huang et al 2021 based on observation however their study negelect the partitioning of ice surface and deep ice water absorption which plays significant roles in controling the lake break up time in the coupled wrf flake model additionally in recent lake models such as flake wrf lake and clm lake the freezing point temperature normally equal to zero is introduced as a threshold for the under ice water temperature once the lake is frozen however observations show that part of the absorbed solar radiation by the lake water underneath the ice can increase the water temperature to higher than the freezing point and delay ice melting by temporarily storing the energy in the water instead of being immediately used for ice melting kirillin et al 2021 lazhu et al 2021 this process is very complicated and not considered in these models as well as in current work 4 discussion 4 1 compared with the offline flake simulations the above sensitivity experiments show that proper modulation of surface turbulent heat fluxes during unfreezing period and the absorptions of solar radiation at ice surface and subsurface during freezing period are very important in the simulation of lake ice freeze up and break up time in the coupled wrf flake model but how about in offline flake in this section two groups of sensitivity experiments have also been carried out using the offline flake model to make a comparison results show that the sensitivity of the freeze up time to sf is totally different from the coupled wrf flake model fig 7a the freeze up time of nam co is always earlier in the offline flake than in the coupled wrf flake fig 7a vs fig 3a b though using the same values of sf additionally the freeze up time in the coupled model is more sensitive to the sf than the offline flake this comparison demonstrates that some key parameters or model settings that are suitable for a coupled atmosphere lake model may not be able to be derived from offline sensitivity tests similarly the sensitivity of the ice break up time to abs in the offline flake model are also significantly different from the coupled wrf flake model fig 7b vs fig 5a b for example the break up time of nam co shows low sensitivity to abs compared with the coupled wrf flake model fig 7b this comparison further demonstrates that some key parameters or model settings that are suitable for a coupled atmosphere lake model cannot be derived based on offline sensitivity tests therefore it is very important to obtain key parameters and verify the simulation capability of the lake model based on coupled atmosphere lake model 4 2 compared with the default wrf lake coupled model section 3 shows that proper settings of sf and abs can reasonably simulate the freeze up time and ice break up time by better descriptions of the two energy processes to further address the importance of these two processes the coupled wrf flake model with the optimal sf 1 5 and abs 0 7 is compared with the default coupled model i e wrf coupled with default lake both models have been integrated from 1st july 2013 31 st june 2015 to cover two seasonal cycles both simulation uses the same initial settings and lake parameters including lake depth salinity maximum density temperature and etc then the lst and ice thickness has been compared as shown in fig 8 compared with modis the lake freeze up and break up in wrf lake are too early while the wrf flake is more consistent with modis with proper setting of sf and abs fig 8a simultaneously the ice thickness from the two model are also presented fig 8b ice thickness reaches its maximum to 0 1 m equal to the thickness of the first lake layer in wrf lake and keeps unchanged for a considerable period of time while it follows a smooth curve in wrf flake fig 8b this might be associated with the different handling of lake ice between the two lake models the wrf lake is frozen layer by layer while the ice thickness is independent of the lake depth in flake the depth of second layer in wrf lake has been set to 4 0 m which is too thick to frozen and the ice thickness keeps constant equal to the thickness of the first lake layer for a considerable time period during frozen this comparison demonstrates that the parameterizations of the same physical process could differ significantly between different lake models the design of wrf flake obviously shows advantages regarding the simulation of ice thickness than the wrf lake model additionally the wrf flake model with the optimal settings of sf and abs outperforms the default wrf lake model in simulating the freeze up and ice break up time fig 8b and table 1 however the current way of introducing sf and abs might be too empirical and lack of rigorous theoretical support thus more comprehensive work is required to improve the parametrizations of these two processes in wrf flake nevertheless this comparison demonstrated that wrf flake model with better representations of key physical processes has the potential to outperform wrf lake 5 conclusions two groups of experiments were conducted to investigate the role of two key energy processes in simulating lake freeze up and lake ice break up using the wrf flake coupled atmosphere lake model the main findings are summarized in the following 1 proper consideration of the impacts of surface heat fluxes is very important to simulate the lake freeze up in a coupled atmosphere lake model 2 realistic descriptions of solar radiation transfer when lake ice exists especially partitioning of ice surface and subsurface ice water absorption is very important in simulating the lake ice break up 3 the coupled model is much more sensitive to the key processes in parameterizations of surface heat fluxes and lake ice solar radiation transfer than the offline lake model 4 using coupled model to understanding the roles of physical processes calibration of specific parameters and verification of the simulation capability of lake models for alpine lakes are necessary in general this work provides valuable preliminary insights into the role of two key energy processes in simulating lake freezing and thawing using a newly coupled atmosphere lake model wrf flake proper consideration of these two processes can reasonably improve the simulating of lake freezing and melting seasonality however the real physical processes are more complicated and substantial work is needed to more accurately parameterize the lake surface energy balance and lake ice solar radiation transmission nevertheless the key results of this study provide new insights in the simulation of lake ice phenology using coupled atmosphere lake models especially for deep alpine lakes these insights are expected to provide new guidance for advancing model development credit authorship contribution statement conceptualization xu zhou and binbin wang funding acquisition xu zhou

agricultural output this study focuses on the distinguishing characteristics of an evolutionary and ensemble machine learning ml based modeling to provide an in depth insight of escalating water quality problems the 360 temporal readings of electric conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds with several input variables are used to establish multi expression programing mep model and random forest rf regression model for the assessment of water quality at indus river new hydrological insight for the region the developed models were evaluated using several statistical metrics the findings reveal that the determination coefficient r2 in the testing phase subject to unseen data for the all the developed models is more than 0 95 indicating the accurateness of the developed models furthermore the error measurements are much lesser with root mean square logarithmic error rmsle nearly equals to zero for each developed model the mean absolute percent error mape of mep models and rf models falls below 10 and 5 respectively in all three phases training validation and testing according to the sensitivity study of generated mep models about the relevance of inputs on the predicted ec and tds shows that bi carbonates and chlorine content have significant influence with a sensitiveness score more than 0 90 whereas the impact of sodium content is less pronounced all the models rf and mep have lower uncertainty based on the prediction interval coverage probability picp calculated using the quartile regression qr approach the picp of each model is greater than 85 in all three stages thus the findings of the study indicate that developing intelligent models for water quality parameter is cost effective and feasible for monitoring and analyzing the indus river water quality graphical abstract ga1 keywords water quality assessment evolutionary algorithm ensemble learning random forest regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the important element for managing and supervising the water cycle environment social welfare and economic development is surface water linked with streams and rivers pandhiani et al 2020 there are various factors which affect the quality of river water such as environmental events like annual precipitation and erosion and social components such as industrial and agricultural production processes singh et al 2019 surface water acts as an utmost resource of fresh water across the globe its deficiency can cause severe problems in accessing drinking water and on environmental and economic development shahzad et al 2019 water pollution is caused by exchange of river systems and its surroundings waste products of industries and agriculture solangi et al 2019 polluted water is an important problem which is creating deadly situation for human welfare agriculture and environment singh et al 2019 the accumulated salt due to salinity produce a negative hydrological effect in water which creates hurdles in its domestic agricultural and commercial use inspecting water quality and saline water is becoming important thus balance between water supply and demand has reached the required limit kim et al 2016 electric conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds is an important scale which can be used to determine water quality and its suitability for irrigation and drinking purposes jamei et al 2020 the ec reflects the number of dissolved substances and minerals furthermore tds is a combination of dissolved inorganic salts like sodium na calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 nitrates no3 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and other dissolved organic particles jagaba et al 2020 the quality of water can be determined by levels of salt and organic matter as higher level of salt and organic matter replicates the poor water quality jagaba et al 2020 the assessment monitoring and regulation of water quality is turn out to be decisive and thus the water supply and demand reached the threshold velmurugan et al 2020 tds and ec scales have been the topic of laboratory experimental events but the results of manual laboratory are time consuming and inaccurate and has system errors too jamei et al 2020 also the sensors used for calculation of ec and tds are expansive and need proper maintenance since the sensors are installed on river sites and can be stolen or damaged so computerized tests can be used to check the water quality sattari et al 2016 by using numerical statistical and mechanical methods numerous scientific publications have analyzed different qualities of water bozorg haddad et al 2017 salami et al 2016 such type of traditional sources can still forecast the linear and uniform data sources deng et al 2015 during last two decades the artificial intelligence ai techniques such as supervised machine learning ml has been used widely to overcome different environmental challenges especially water quality index simulation aldrees et al 2022 alizadeh et al 2018 kargar et al 2020 singh et al 2019 ml technique is a step forward for developing the supervision and management of engineering projects sihag et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 such techniques can give suitable predictions without modern programming officials ml models gain support from the collected data the data subsets i e training set validation set and testing techniques are then used to develop and test performance of different predictive models najafzadeh et al 2018 the ml techniques are important and prevalent for predicting the quality of water tung and yaseen 2020 study of tripathi and singal 2019 report the establishment of innovative water quality index wqi computation method for the indian ganges river principal components analysis pca approach was used in which twenty eight inputs were reduced to only nine which includes total coliform tc dissolved oxygen do chlorine content cl magnesium content mg sulfates content so4 electrical conductivity ec biochemical oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds and power of hydrogen ions ph the usage of these nine variables saves a lot of time and give quick analysis medium for water quality assessment likewise zali et al 2011 exercised the most prevalent ml method ann artificial neural network to check the effect of six inputs ss suspended solids cod chemical oxygen demand do bod ph and nitrates for the calculation of wqi by using sensitivity analysis similarities of each variable were compared in wqi prediction which showed that do no3 and ss are very important inputs nigam and sm 2019 assessed fuzzy based models and traditional calculation techniques on the basis of prediction performance for the computation of ground water wqi it was noted that fuzzy based models have more predictive power it leaves behind the traditional techniques of calculation and categorizes the quality of water srinivas and singh 2018 further extended the study of nigam and sm 2019 they gave the idea of an interactive fuzzy model ifm which was a remarkable fuzzy decision making approach for forecasting river wqi their research showed that wqi predictive power was more accurate in ifm as compared to traditional fuzzy technique yaseen et al 2018 did research on the performance of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis based hybridized models which includes grid partitioning gp subtractive clustering sc and fuzzy c mean data clustering fcm it was noted that anfis sc s performance is persistent continuous and best to make a correlation among wqi and biological inputs such as do ss cod bod ph and nitrates different algorithms like radial basis function neural network rbfnn and back propagation neural network bpnn were also used hameed et al 2017 the study reveals that the predictive results of rbfnn model were comparatively good the functioning of least square support vector regression lssvr and genetic programming gp was tested for the estimation of potassium sodium magnesium sulphates ph tds and ec in the sefidrood river situated in iran bozorg haddad et al 2017 the r2 is above 0 9 for all established models which shows good correlation to check the quality of abu ziriq river in iran al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 exercised multiple linear regression mlr anfis and ann approach they tested different models of tds and ec with most important inputs like magnesium chloride nitrate calcium sulfate and hardness during this trial they reported that anfis gave the best results similarly for the estimation of do in river water sarkar and pandey 2015 used ann technique in different water vicinity with four distinct variables like ph do bod and temperature and concluded that the correlation coefficient r is above 0 90 between the predicted and measured data furthermore to estimate the quantity of drinking water produced from chemical treatment plants zhang et al 2019 exercised the ann and gp hybridized model and revealed that the performance of these models was better the further data added to the algorithm improves the efficacy of the output models many other different procedures were also used for different hydrological and meteorological challenges rainfall fall estimation these methods contain tree based algorithmic procedure which include support vector machine svm decision tree dt and random forest rf model different research had revealed that these algorithms have outstanding forecasting abilities aghelpour et al 2019 hazarika et al 2020 the authors used svm and rf models estimate the tss bod tds and cod content granata et al 2017 the predictive power of svm was excellent during learning stage however when this model was exposed to unseen data fresh data not used while modelling its result was not efficient common and typical algorithms are still used widely but experts are in research of new flexible and intelligent algorithm alizadeh et al 2018 kargar et al 2020 it is worth remembrance that neural networks do not provide the physical aspect of the problem it acts just like a black box models based in ann are simply called as a relation between input and output azimi et al 2019 moreover the relation will either be linear or will depend on the pre defined functions ismael et al 2021 kim et al 2021 similarly the results of tree based algorithms are better in linear relation only koranga et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 for the mentioned problems researchers are using evolutionary algorithm ea like gep for simulation of water quality parameters wqps jiang and chui 2022 li et al 2021 najafzadeh et al 2019 shah et al 2021 ea works best in a condition where the requirement is precise mathematical equation and higher generalization capabilities for creating an ideal predictive model gep is unable to work with deviating output values so it must skip in the training period for improving the performance of a model moreover gep are only suitable in a simple relation between input and output because it encodes one expression at a time and gives its output oltean and grosan 2003 mep is opposite to gep on basis of encoding chromosomes mep can code multiple chromosomes in a single program oltean and grosan 2003 by checking the unknown complications it has the capability of giving accurate results arabshahi et al 2020 the mep evolution stage can remove the error complexities from the resultant expression as compared to other ml methods decoding process of mep is quite instinctive the enormous advantages of mep algorithm demand its wide scale adoption and recognition however it is rarely used by environmentalists based on the provided literature review in current research water quality indices such as ec and tdc of the upper indus basin were designed at bisham qilla monitoring stations using mep technique and random forest rf regression technique based on the most influencing variables the eight effective parameters considered in this study for the estimation of electric conductivity and total dissolved solids are graphically presented in fig 1 the total of 360 readings recoded on monthly basis are retrieved from water and power development authority wapda these readings are divided into three sets i e learning set training and validation and testing set a deep statistical analysis tests and sensitivity study is done on the presented models to check their efficiency and reliability the established models are beneficial in reducing the difficulty and cost which forecast ec and tds concentrations properly on a small group of inputs 2 research methodology in this section the methods of multi expression programming mep and an ensemble learning approach known as random forest rf will be explained checking the water quality indicator tds and ec with the selected study area and performance evaluation indicators will be discussed 2 1 multi expression programming genetic algorithms ga are based on stochastic and metaheuristic technique for creating best solutions that depends on the principles of biological selection and genetics goldberg 2006 by using the traditional optimization methods a series of binary strings is created by ga for describing the results genetic programming gp was an updated version of ga which encodes string expressions into executable computer program koza and koza 1992 for solving any problem gp implements the darwin s biological evolution theory gp s main purpose is to use the fitness metric for finding a code that can merge the inputs and outputs generally there are three types of gp in which linear gp is more productive than graph based and tree based gp alavi et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 reason of its effectiveness is that it does not need active researchers it also improves the accuracy in real time scale for forecasting the water quality indices tds and ec a multi expression programming linear gp approach was used in current paper mep keeps a track of all records by using linear chromosomes the most suitable answer that defines chromosome is determined by comparing the fitness values of the script first step in mep algorithmic process is to create code from a randomly selected population all the subsequent steps are performed until the required condition is achieved oltean and grosan 2003 1 by using simple binary tournament process parents are selected after which they are established again on the basis of specific crossover probability 2 the combination of two parents produces two offspring 3 after that the weakest is changed with the best among them using the mutation process mep works same as pascal and c compilers that interpret mathematical expression to coding alavi et al 2013 2010 a series of formulae represents the genes of mep the length of chromosomes is defined by the set of genes that remains constant throughout the whole calculation the gene is created by a function set f and terminals t 1 or 2 for generating the proper code the first gene of chromosome must match to the randomly chosen terminal inside a terminal set having reference is very important for the function gene values of the terminal scores produced by the specific gene are less than the gene s chromosomal location simple mep chromosome is explained by the example provided in fig 2 the function set i e f pow and the terminal set i e t b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 are uses to encode mep gene the mep gene can be transformed into program by decryption the chromosomes the decryption process starts from top to bottom the particular code is offered in the shape of gene in fig 2 the genes number 0 1 3 and 5 code just single terminal i e y 0 b 1 y 1 b 2 y 3 b 3 and y 5 b 4 respectively at positions 0 and 1 the gene 2 is used to represent the pow function applied on supposed operands and encodes the expression y 2 b 1 b 2 similarly at locations 2 and 3 gene 4 denotes the function applied on the operands thus encoding the expression y 4 b 1 b 2 b 3 ultimately the gene 6 represent the final expression as y 4 b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 accordingly the chromosomal order can be seen in the form of forest of gene trees entertaining numerous expressions following the effectiveness of different expression the best expression tree is revealed oltean and grosan 2003 2 2 random forest regression approach the rf technique is a popular approach for addressing regression and classification problems it is a breiman 2001 developed ensemble learning approach that integrates a number of regression trees random forest is basically a set of decision trees whose outcomes are combined in a single outcome generally the correlations and statistical errors achieved in the current rf model are equivalent to those found in previous optimization methods however the simplicity of predicting with categorical data utilizing rf makes it a preferred forecasting method the use of decision trees has the benefit of relatively rapid simulation for huge datasets xiong et al 2019 furthermore it can process both numerical and categorical descriptive data the collection of arranged circumstances in compliance with leaf of the regression tree is represented by the root of the regressive trees iqbal m et al 2021 vickers 2017 initially bootstrapping data are generated randomly via substitution of the entire training set and the prediction trees are assembled to every bootstrap instance rf then receives the weights of various evidentiary attributes i e the x input array following that rf constructs k regression trees and aggregates the findings the k t x 1 k are constructed the rf regression predictor is shown as eq 1 1 f yf ˆ k x k 1 k t x k the bagging technique improves the variability of the forest causing trees to develop using various training data groups designed to minimize overlapping with competing trees the data that were not chosen for constructing the kth tree during the bagging procedure are included in additional set known as out of bag oob set these oob samples are used by the kth tree to evaluate performance peters et al 2007 rf can thus construct a reliable and unbiased estimate of the prediction error not relying on an extrinsic data subset xiong et al 2019 fig 3 depicts the flowchart of the rf algorithm in this research the results obtained from mep metaheuristic approach are compared with rf ensemble machine learning method to estimate the parameters used for water quality assessment i e electric conductivity and total dissolved solids an attempt is made to make sure the superiority of modern machine learning technique ensemble machine technique rf used in this study is performed with the help of rapidminer studio available online as an open source tool while mep is performed using open source package mepx v 2 0 chu et al 2021 shah et al 2020 2 3 study area and data collection the indus river is one of the transboundary rivers of the asia which flows in three different countries the length of the river which is 3180 kilometer starts from tibet and enters into india near ladakh and ends in the karachi by touching arabian sea the annual flow of indus river is around 253 km3 and is one of the 50 largest rivers of the world the area surrounded by indus river consists of mountains and glaciers mostly the water quality assessment in these areas is important for the life of ecosystem established around the river shah et al 2021 tahir et al 2011 water and power development authority wapda of pakistan recorded the water quality data on monthly basis at different points of river indus the data used in this research was obtained from wapda a total of 360 datapoints were collected from them recorded from 1975 to 2005 the data used in this research was recorded at the bisham qilla and doyian stations the pictorial representation of the study area is provided in fig 4 after vast literature review eight parameters i e water temperature 0c calcium ca magnesium mg sulphate so4 sodium na ph bicarbonates hco3 and chloride cl were selected as input variables while two parameters i e tds and ec were selected as output although the discharge is also among the most important variable however the data retrieved from the wapda does not include any information about the measurement of discharge at bisham qilla and doyian stations the statistical details like mean standard deviation kurtosis skewness and range of all the parameters are shown in table 1 it can be seen that all values of tds and ec lie within the acceptable range provided by who for drinkable water tds 300 600 mg l ec 88 770 μs cm jamei et al 2020 also the dispersion statistics lies in the permissible range kurtosis 10 10 skewness 3 3 khan et al 2022b khan et al 2022c as accuracy of machine learning models largely depends on the input data therefore its necessary to calculate the correlation coefficient amongst the input variables and output to avoid multicollinearity problem khan et al 2021a the correlation coefficients for both outputs are shown in table 2 all values of correlation coefficient between inputs are less than 0 8 showing good dispersion of data in addition the values show a strong connection between selected input variables and output parameter with correlation values greater than 0 8 azim et al 2021 jalal et al 2021b furthermore the significance p value of the outputs corresponding to correlation coefficients at significance level of 5 α 0 05 are less than 0 00001 showing a significant relationship between outputs and input parameters considered in this study hence the data is randomly divided into three different sets training testing and validation as suggested by different researchers khan et al 2022a nguyen et al 2021 70 of the obtained data is used for training set while 15 of the data is used for testing set whereas the remaining 15 is used for validation set 2 4 statistical metrics for performance assessment of models to check the accuracy and applicability of the developed modes various statistical parameters like mean absolute percent error mape root mean squared logarithmic error rmsle r square root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae of all three sets are calculated and assessed amongst all the statistical parameters r square is the most reliable one in assessing the applicability of the model the detail description along with their formulae is provided in table 3 where the p and m represents the forecasted and measured reading respectively and k is the overall sum of experiments 2 5 uncertainty analysis in current research quantile regression qr was applied for evaluation of the overall uncertainty of a predictive model qr is a simple linear mathematical method used in several studies to estimate the quantiles of a predictor variables in the absence of a hypothesis kouadri et al 2022 taşan et al 2022 the implementation of qr to analyse error rates based on anticipated water quality indicators has been shown to be a comparatively simple effective and reliable approach for evaluating predictive models uncertainty weerts et al 2011 for every quartile q the mathematical relationship among measured m and predicted p water quality indicators ec and tds are provided as 2 m a q p b q in eq 2 a q and b q are the linear regression coefficients that can be derived and calculated through minimization of the sum of residuals as provided in eq 3 3 min j 1 k ρ q m j a q p j b q wherein m j and p j are the j th observations out of a total of j observations and ρ q is the function used for quantile regression 4 ρ q ε j q 1 ε j ε j 0 q ε j ε j 0 eq 4 is used to calculate the error ε j which can be described as the difference between the measured values m j and the estimated linear qr a q p b q for the specified quantile 5 95 shrestha and solomatine 2006 proposed uncertainty indicator using the performance evaluation of the qr method i e predictive interval coverage probability picp taşan et al 2022 the picp is a useful indicator reflecting that how many readings fit inside the expected area 5 95 when the picp is equal to 1 there is no uncertainty eq 5 shows the calculation of picp the mean width of the predictive interval uncertainty band is the range between the lower predictive limit pl j lower and upper predictive limit pl j upper 5 picp 1 k j 1 k c 6 c 1 pl j lower p j pl j upper 0 otherwise 2 6 tunning the mep model algorithmic parameters when beginning modeling specific mep algorithmic parameters are turned to generate robust accurate and adaptive models the appropriate settings are established considering literature recommendations and a hit and trial technique mousavi et al 2010 the overall number of programs raised in the population is determined by the size of the population an increased population take longer to reach convergence and provide more complicated but realistic and correct code yet increasing the population above certain level may cause overfitting in the simulated model the optimal algorithmic parameters for the best mep models ec and tds are provided in table 4 the modeling process started with the supposition of total ten subpopulations basic arithmetic operators x were chosen to generate a simple formula and to reach convergence with a better level of accurateness and robustness different iterations are used to define the level of accuracy which the program should achieve until being stopped simulations with multiple iterations provide a model with the least error also mutation and crossover rates manage the chance of offspring participating in the genetic process the crossover rate ranges from 50 to 95 following the evaluation of numerous configurations of these parameters the top potential combinations were selected based on the efficacy of the model as shown in table 4 an overfitting of the model performance is a common issue with supervised ml modeling a model seems to perform acceptably on the presented data set but its effectiveness degrades substantially when evolved using the unknown data to tackle the stated difficulty the research proposed to evaluate the trained model on an unseen data testing dataset qiu et al 2020 in a nutshell the whole readings in the database were randomly divided into 3 consistent and unique sets training set comprised of 252 readings 70 while both the validation and testing set contains 54 readings 15 it was confirmed that data distribution is consistent across all sets the optimal model was computed using the learning set training and validation the accuracy of the validated models was next assessed with unknown data kept aside in the testing set the generated models performed well in all 3 levels the process involves the production of a population for finding an optimal solution the procedures are recurring with each cycle getting us nearer to the best solution each iteration performance is evaluated over the whole population the algorithm will continue to evolve till a pre defined fitness r2 or rmse value becomes stagnant when the model results for any of the three datasets were inappropriate the process was repeated by gradually increasing the number and size sub populations the best solution is then picked due to the least rmse and high r2 it is worth remembering that evolving duration and number of generations make an impact on the correctness of the models generated because of the incorporation of more parameters into the operation a model would evolve indefinitely in the present simulation however the modeling was stopped at 1000 generations or when the increase in fitness score dropped to 0 1 additionally as described in section an optimal solution should meet several performance measures 2 7 tunning the rf model algorithmic parameters the preceding approach was used to create the rf model in the rapidminer studio version 9 8 framework the data from 360 temporal readings of the water quality indices was obtained in the processing window during the first stage of model development a number of operators was used to execute the process the select attribute operator to select the attributes subset for the modelling process the command set role was then employed to modify the position of an attribute as a targeting variable among several factors assessed the ec and tds were picked as the target attribute applying the split data operation the data were randomly divided into 70 train and 30 validation set optimize parameter grid was utilized to determine the optimum solution of the specified parameters numerous other criterions were used to analyze the best possible productivity of the presented model including the sum of trees maximum depth minimum leaf size confidence apply pre pruning and pruning rf minimum gain guess subset ratio random splits minimum size for split and enable parallel execution the optimum rf model was obtained by employing the lowest value of rf minimal gain i e zero while the highest value over the 1000 steps on a linear scale is equals to infinity the optimum rf model was obtained by employing the lowest value of rf minimal gain i e zero while the highest value over the 1000 steps on a linear scale is equals to infinity a greater minimum gain value leads in smaller splits and consequently fewer trees a too high value eliminates splitting resulting in trees containing only one node as a result the frequency of repetitions was altered to get an optimal model in many trails ultimately 1000 trials produced the best model the operator s ports were precisely linked to get the finest rf model the cross validation with automated sampling technique was included inside the optimize grid parameter using the k fold cross validation approach for this reason the whole data was split into ten different subsets the nine subsets of data were used for learning by performing the regression analysis while the one subset is kept for cross validation the operation is repeated till all the subsets are used as a cross validation set the ultimate cross validation performance is calculated by taking the average of performance metrics of all cross validation sample after expanding the density of trees indefinitely it was discovered that 200 trees produced the best results the processing duration of the model development doubled as the values of hyper parameters increasing without enhancing the correlations or creating a decrease in error table 5 lists the additional training parameters for the learned model the generated rf model s performance was evaluated using r2 rmsle mae rmse and mape 3 results and discussions 3 1 formulation of tds and ec using mep model the mep code of ec and tds is denoted by s 1 and s 2 the code utilizes nine input variables as provided in supplementary information the experimental ec predicted results is graphically presented in fig 5 best position of regression line is 450 which means that the slope must be equal to 1 for strong correlation iqbal m f et al 2021 the slope for all three sets is shown in fig 5 a as training 0 9885 validation 0 9921 and testing 0 9918 these results show a mutual relationship between experimental and forecasted ec moreover the results are nearly close to each other which is a best fit for sets due to this the proper training of model is defined iqbal m f et al 2021 khan s et al 2022 consequently it has great generalization power as it works almost similar on testing set fresh unseen data similar analysis was also done for tds findings of developed mep model as shown in fig 5 b generated model of tds was well trained and has the capacity of following experimental tds the slope of regression line of all three sets is nearly equal i e training 0 9924 validation 1 0119 and testing 0 9989 the functioning of tds model in testing stage is exceptional just like an ec model which shows that the over fitting problem was solved in a best manner anonna et al 2021 iqbal m f et al 2021 jalal et al 2021a moreover the r2 of each mep model is higher than 0 9 in training validation and testing phase it is clear from fig 5 a and 5 b that the spread of data points is nearer to 450 lines showing the greater prediction accuracy like the slope the r2 values of both models are also above 0 9 specifically on the unseen data testing phase it is equals to 0 9725 and 0 9674 for tds and ec respectively performance of both the models is similar in each phase of the developed mep model with a minor difference between slope or r2 values khan et al 2021b moreover the efficiency and adaptability of the models also depend on the number of data points use during simulation gholampour et al 2017 the higher number of data points equaling 360 results in an accurate prediction with less errors in both models mansouri et al 2018 3 1 1 comprehensive performance analysis of developed mep models reliability of model and number of used readings in foundation of model are directly proportional to each other ration of instances to independent variables must be higher than 5 according to the literature liu et al 2021 this ratio is 31 5 in training phase and it is 6 75 in the other two sets validation or testing good relationship between measured and predicted results can be achieved when r2 score will be higher than 0 8 farooq et al 2021 association of both tds and ec with each input is remarkable the research showed that r2 calculates the linear relationship of outcome with input variables that is why it is insufficient to inspect ec and tds models just on the basis of slope and regression coefficient liu et al 2021 so multi statistical scales must be used to check the reliability of developed tds and ec models statistical analytics i e rmsle mape mae and rmse of each set is mentioned in table 6 from which the power of the developed mep ec model can be calculated three error metrics i e rmse rmsle and mae are presented graphically through the mean absolute error graph fig 6 a whereas the absolute percent error histogram fig 6 b is shown for the investigation of mape both rmse and mae are important in examining the performance of the model rmse give more importance to large values of errors whereas mae have capacity of identifying small values of errors that is why mae is always smaller than rmse the mae in each phase is equals to training 12 36 validation 12 14 and testing 11 12 while the rmse is equals to 18 54 17 19 and 16 43 respectively which proves the condition i e mae rmse hazarika et al 2020 the minimum value of absolute error is 0 016 while maximum value is 98 16 moreover in each stage rmsle is almost zero which mimics the outstanding operation of the developed model larger values are penalized by rmlse very accurately additionally the histograms illustrate that 78 33 means 282 readings have an absolute error lower than 20 with no predicted output with error greater than 40 the mape values also decreases to 10 for all three phases i e training 5 32 validation 6 15 and testing 6 12 the developed ec model can be called as excellent model according to the conditions defined in section 2 4 jagaba et al 2020 jamei et al 2020 it can be utilized for future prediction because it has high power of accuracy and fewer errors it will eventually help the designers to avoid machine and human errors tung and yaseen 2020 zhang et al 2019 tds mep is like the ec mep model in terms of accuracy and reliability the spreading of absolute error close to x axis shows excellent efficacy of the developed tds model as shown in fig 7 a from table 6 it can be observed that the value of mae in testing phase is 8 27 ppm and which is less than rmse 11 36 ppm the maximum and minimum absolute error is 66 25 ppm and 0 046 ppm respectively which shows that the model is very effective jamei et al 2020 moreover the error histogram replicates that 85 83 data means 309 readings have an absolute error lower than 10 with no predicted output with error greater than 45 as shown in fig 7 b just like an ec model the mape values also decreases to 10 for all three phases i e training 7 40 validation 8 25 and testing 5 54 and thus it can also be categorized as an excellent model jamei et al 2020 3 2 prediction of tds and ec using rf model rf is an ensemble machine learning approach that uses the weak learners trees as a supervised learner the best performing model is extracted based on the coefficient of determination i e r2 or r square the rf algorithm is trained to splits the model into 20 sub models using n estimators the n ranges from 10 to 200 with an increment of 20 as summarized in the fig 8 a the maximum ensemble r2 and mean ensemble r2 for ec is equal to 0 9784 and 0 9698 respectively at the incorporation of 40 estimators while the tds fig 8 b gives an outstanding performance at 80 estimators with maximum ensemble r2 and mean ensemble r2 equals to 0 9816 and 0 9736 respectively such an exceptional performance of ransom forest ensemble regression is due to the utilization of decision trees as a weak learner peters et al 2007 3 3 comparison of developed mep and rf models the rf regression model was developed to predict the ec and tds using the same input variables and dataset used in the development of mep models hazarika et al 2020 shah et al 2020 the details of the statistical analysis of the rf models observed in table 7 while the fig 9 and fig 10 are used to graphically represent the flowing track of observed and predicted values along with the frequency distribution of error values both the rf ec and rf tds models provides relatively better performance than the mep ec and mep tds models the forecasted ec and tds shows the minor deviation from their targeted values with the promising reliability and performance based on the statical indicators considered in this study the rf ec models provides 20 r2 50 rmsle 17 rmse 14 mae and 42 mape better prediction in the testing stage than the developed mep ec model similarly rf tds models provided 17 4 r2 77 rmsle 39 rmse 34 mae and 40 mape better prediction in the testing stage than the developed mep tds model the fig 9 a and 10 a shows that for rf ec and rf tds model the maximum absolute error is equals to 68 21 μs cm and 28 51 ppm which is 30 and 57 lower than mep developed models respectively thus showing the superiority of the rf regression technique for both rf ec and rf tds models around 98 of the prediction carries an absolute percent error less than 10 with no prediction carrying absolute percent error greater than 12 5 the mape in all three stages of rf models for both ec and tds fall below 5 indicating the efficacy and leading performance of the random forest regression however as compared to mep algorithm the rf lacks in providing the mathematical equations for the future estimation of the tds and ec 3 4 sensitivity analysis of developed ec mep and tds mep model in order to check the successful functioning and reliability of machine learning modeling on different types of data it is very important to do variety of tests higher efficiency in training validation and testing phase does not mean that the model is superior sensitivity analysis is necessary to check the effectiveness of model it is used to check that the model is performing excellent and it is not merely a relation of outputs and inputs all the developed models are examined by sensitivity analysis to get more detail on the significance of the independent variables on the forecasted water quality parameters ec and tds the sensitivity importance r sens of the considered independent variables i k were calculated using the eq 2 ardakani and kordnaeij 2019 wang and yin 2020 2 r sens k 1 l m k n k k 1 l m k 2 k 1 l n k 2 in this equation n k is the estimated result of the projected models i e ec or tds whereas l denotes the number of readings which is equal to 360 r sens score whose value is from zero to one shows a relation between input and output when the value of r sens is 1 the input has a more effect on the output fig 11 a and 11 b signifies the sensitivity importance r sens of the input variables used for the estimation of mep ec and mep tds respectively all eight inputs greatly affect the predictive power of developed mep models chlorides sulphates and carbonates are the most sensitive and important qualities that effect the result of predicting output with sensitivity index above 0 5 zhang et al 2019 among all the least sensitive input is sodium content the sensitivity index of sodium is 0 53 and 0 51 in the mep ec and mep tds models respectively 3 5 uncertainty analysis of mep and rf models this research also included an uncertainty analysis of evolutionary mep and ensemble rf learning models model uncertainty is primarily defined via uncertainty in the independent variables of the model sharafati and pezeshki 2020 however because the same set of input variables considered for predicting water quality indicators therefore only the uncertainty of predictive models ec mep tds mep ec rf tds rf were evaluated in this work taşan et al 2022 the quantile regression qr approach was utilized to evaluate the uncertainty of two distinct ml approaches employed in the assessment of water quality indexes in this approach model residuals are undertaken to calculate uncertainty estimates for both mep and rf based ml models 95 confidence intervals were employed to estimate ec and tds in each dataset training validation and testing the prediction interval coverage probability picp was used to assess uncertainty furthermore picp percentage for all phases of each model as shown in table 8 it can be seen that the both the mep and rf models for ec and tds have almost similar picp between all the three phases indicating the robustness of predictive models however the picp for rf models is higher than mep models showing that the rf have comparatively lower uncertainty for ec mep and tds mep models the picp is greater than 85 in each set while the picp exceed 95 in case of rf in testing phase the picp for ec rf and tds rf is equals to 97 53 and 98 36 respectively indicating higher sensitivity and lower uncertainty in tree based random forest regression models for the prediction of water quality indices this is attributable to the bagging approach used in rf regression the rf based ensemble approach provides more accurate prediction by combining multiple regression trees into a single model 4 conclusion water pollution is a very serious problem that is very dangerous to humans environment and agriculture in the current study the evolutionary algorithm ea based multi expression programming mep models and ensemble learning algorithm ela based random forest rf regression models are suggested for forecasting the electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds using the most effective inputs eight i e water temperature 0c sodium content na bicarbonates hco3 calcium ca sulphate so4 magnesium mg power of hydron ions ph and chloride cl content various statistical tests were done to check the accuracy and efficiency of models using statistical indicators i e slope and determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute present error mape mean absolute error mae and root mean square logarithmic error rmsle from the evaluation of the performance indicators it is revealed that all models mep ec mep tds rf ec and rf tds gave very accurate results with r2 value than 0 95 and are reliable with least error statistics in the testing stage the mae and rmse were 11 22 us cm and 16 43 us cm 9 73 us cm and 13 54 us cm 8 27 ppm and 11 36 ppm and 5 45 ppm and 6 99 ppm for mep ec rf ec mep tds and rf tds model respectively for each model the rmsle is almost equals to zero reflecting the remarkable functioning of the developed models furthermore the mape of the mep models for both ec and tds falls below 10 and are classified as excellent in contrary the rf models have mape values below 5 in all three stages showing their exceptional performance also the sensitivity analysis showed that the all the eight input factors greatly affect the prediction of water quality with sensitivity index more than 0 5 all the models rf and mep have lower uncertainty based on the prediction interval coverage probability picp calculated using the quartile regression qr approach the picp of each model is greater than 85 in all three stages thus the established models are not just a correlation of inputs and output and can be confidently used for future prediction of ec and tds by the decision makers and practitioners eventually it will be more helpful for researchers because it will save the time and cost needed for inspecting the parameters of water quality 5 suggestions and recommendations the present research mainly focused on analysis of upper indus river basin after the analysis a detailed knowledge of challenges regarding water was provided this information can be used to check the quality of water and performance of machines learning algorithms results showed that predictions of both ensemble rf and evolutionary algorithms mep were strong and can be used for checking water quality it will be valuable for government researchers policy makers and designers it can also be used to save limited sources of water which will be beneficial for environment moreover it is very important to do more research to check new methods and to evaluate the performance of parameters used in calculating water quality metrics some new parameters of water must be taken into consideration as well when checking the prediction capacity a complete point of view and techniques that decrease the quality of water will be provided by spatiotemporal test credit authorship contribution statement ali aldrees conceptualization investigation writing original draft

7719,study region bisham qilla and doyian stations indus river basin of pakistan study focus water pollution is an international concern that impedes human health ecological sustainability and agricultural output this study focuses on the distinguishing characteristics of an evolutionary and ensemble machine learning ml based modeling to provide an in depth insight of escalating water quality problems the 360 temporal readings of electric conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds with several input variables are used to establish multi expression programing mep model and random forest rf regression model for the assessment of water quality at indus river new hydrological insight for the region the developed models were evaluated using several statistical metrics the findings reveal that the determination coefficient r2 in the testing phase subject to unseen data for the all the developed models is more than 0 95 indicating the accurateness of the developed models furthermore the error measurements are much lesser with root mean square logarithmic error rmsle nearly equals to zero for each developed model the mean absolute percent error mape of mep models and rf models falls below 10 and 5 respectively in all three phases training validation and testing according to the sensitivity study of generated mep models about the relevance of inputs on the predicted ec and tds shows that bi carbonates and chlorine content have significant influence with a sensitiveness score more than 0 90 whereas the impact of sodium content is less pronounced all the models rf and mep have lower uncertainty based on the prediction interval coverage probability picp calculated using the quartile regression qr approach the picp of each model is greater than 85 in all three stages thus the findings of the study indicate that developing intelligent models for water quality parameter is cost effective and feasible for monitoring and analyzing the indus river water quality graphical abstract ga1 keywords water quality assessment evolutionary algorithm ensemble learning random forest regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the important element for managing and supervising the water cycle environment social welfare and economic development is surface water linked with streams and rivers pandhiani et al 2020 there are various factors which affect the quality of river water such as environmental events like annual precipitation and erosion and social components such as industrial and agricultural production processes singh et al 2019 surface water acts as an utmost resource of fresh water across the globe its deficiency can cause severe problems in accessing drinking water and on environmental and economic development shahzad et al 2019 water pollution is caused by exchange of river systems and its surroundings waste products of industries and agriculture solangi et al 2019 polluted water is an important problem which is creating deadly situation for human welfare agriculture and environment singh et al 2019 the accumulated salt due to salinity produce a negative hydrological effect in water which creates hurdles in its domestic agricultural and commercial use inspecting water quality and saline water is becoming important thus balance between water supply and demand has reached the required limit kim et al 2016 electric conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds is an important scale which can be used to determine water quality and its suitability for irrigation and drinking purposes jamei et al 2020 the ec reflects the number of dissolved substances and minerals furthermore tds is a combination of dissolved inorganic salts like sodium na calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 nitrates no3 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and other dissolved organic particles jagaba et al 2020 the quality of water can be determined by levels of salt and organic matter as higher level of salt and organic matter replicates the poor water quality jagaba et al 2020 the assessment monitoring and regulation of water quality is turn out to be decisive and thus the water supply and demand reached the threshold velmurugan et al 2020 tds and ec scales have been the topic of laboratory experimental events but the results of manual laboratory are time consuming and inaccurate and has system errors too jamei et al 2020 also the sensors used for calculation of ec and tds are expansive and need proper maintenance since the sensors are installed on river sites and can be stolen or damaged so computerized tests can be used to check the water quality sattari et al 2016 by using numerical statistical and mechanical methods numerous scientific publications have analyzed different qualities of water bozorg haddad et al 2017 salami et al 2016 such type of traditional sources can still forecast the linear and uniform data sources deng et al 2015 during last two decades the artificial intelligence ai techniques such as supervised machine learning ml has been used widely to overcome different environmental challenges especially water quality index simulation aldrees et al 2022 alizadeh et al 2018 kargar et al 2020 singh et al 2019 ml technique is a step forward for developing the supervision and management of engineering projects sihag et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 such techniques can give suitable predictions without modern programming officials ml models gain support from the collected data the data subsets i e training set validation set and testing techniques are then used to develop and test performance of different predictive models najafzadeh et al 2018 the ml techniques are important and prevalent for predicting the quality of water tung and yaseen 2020 study of tripathi and singal 2019 report the establishment of innovative water quality index wqi computation method for the indian ganges river principal components analysis pca approach was used in which twenty eight inputs were reduced to only nine which includes total coliform tc dissolved oxygen do chlorine content cl magnesium content mg sulfates content so4 electrical conductivity ec biochemical oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds and power of hydrogen ions ph the usage of these nine variables saves a lot of time and give quick analysis medium for water quality assessment likewise zali et al 2011 exercised the most prevalent ml method ann artificial neural network to check the effect of six inputs ss suspended solids cod chemical oxygen demand do bod ph and nitrates for the calculation of wqi by using sensitivity analysis similarities of each variable were compared in wqi prediction which showed that do no3 and ss are very important inputs nigam and sm 2019 assessed fuzzy based models and traditional calculation techniques on the basis of prediction performance for the computation of ground water wqi it was noted that fuzzy based models have more predictive power it leaves behind the traditional techniques of calculation and categorizes the quality of water srinivas and singh 2018 further extended the study of nigam and sm 2019 they gave the idea of an interactive fuzzy model ifm which was a remarkable fuzzy decision making approach for forecasting river wqi their research showed that wqi predictive power was more accurate in ifm as compared to traditional fuzzy technique yaseen et al 2018 did research on the performance of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis based hybridized models which includes grid partitioning gp subtractive clustering sc and fuzzy c mean data clustering fcm it was noted that anfis sc s performance is persistent continuous and best to make a correlation among wqi and biological inputs such as do ss cod bod ph and nitrates different algorithms like radial basis function neural network rbfnn and back propagation neural network bpnn were also used hameed et al 2017 the study reveals that the predictive results of rbfnn model were comparatively good the functioning of least square support vector regression lssvr and genetic programming gp was tested for the estimation of potassium sodium magnesium sulphates ph tds and ec in the sefidrood river situated in iran bozorg haddad et al 2017 the r2 is above 0 9 for all established models which shows good correlation to check the quality of abu ziriq river in iran al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 exercised multiple linear regression mlr anfis and ann approach they tested different models of tds and ec with most important inputs like magnesium chloride nitrate calcium sulfate and hardness during this trial they reported that anfis gave the best results similarly for the estimation of do in river water sarkar and pandey 2015 used ann technique in different water vicinity with four distinct variables like ph do bod and temperature and concluded that the correlation coefficient r is above 0 90 between the predicted and measured data furthermore to estimate the quantity of drinking water produced from chemical treatment plants zhang et al 2019 exercised the ann and gp hybridized model and revealed that the performance of these models was better the further data added to the algorithm improves the efficacy of the output models many other different procedures were also used for different hydrological and meteorological challenges rainfall fall estimation these methods contain tree based algorithmic procedure which include support vector machine svm decision tree dt and random forest rf model different research had revealed that these algorithms have outstanding forecasting abilities aghelpour et al 2019 hazarika et al 2020 the authors used svm and rf models estimate the tss bod tds and cod content granata et al 2017 the predictive power of svm was excellent during learning stage however when this model was exposed to unseen data fresh data not used while modelling its result was not efficient common and typical algorithms are still used widely but experts are in research of new flexible and intelligent algorithm alizadeh et al 2018 kargar et al 2020 it is worth remembrance that neural networks do not provide the physical aspect of the problem it acts just like a black box models based in ann are simply called as a relation between input and output azimi et al 2019 moreover the relation will either be linear or will depend on the pre defined functions ismael et al 2021 kim et al 2021 similarly the results of tree based algorithms are better in linear relation only koranga et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 for the mentioned problems researchers are using evolutionary algorithm ea like gep for simulation of water quality parameters wqps jiang and chui 2022 li et al 2021 najafzadeh et al 2019 shah et al 2021 ea works best in a condition where the requirement is precise mathematical equation and higher generalization capabilities for creating an ideal predictive model gep is unable to work with deviating output values so it must skip in the training period for improving the performance of a model moreover gep are only suitable in a simple relation between input and output because it encodes one expression at a time and gives its output oltean and grosan 2003 mep is opposite to gep on basis of encoding chromosomes mep can code multiple chromosomes in a single program oltean and grosan 2003 by checking the unknown complications it has the capability of giving accurate results arabshahi et al 2020 the mep evolution stage can remove the error complexities from the resultant expression as compared to other ml methods decoding process of mep is quite instinctive the enormous advantages of mep algorithm demand its wide scale adoption and recognition however it is rarely used by environmentalists based on the provided literature review in current research water quality indices such as ec and tdc of the upper indus basin were designed at bisham qilla monitoring stations using mep technique and random forest rf regression technique based on the most influencing variables the eight effective parameters considered in this study for the estimation of electric conductivity and total dissolved solids are graphically presented in fig 1 the total of 360 readings recoded on monthly basis are retrieved from water and power development authority wapda these readings are divided into three sets i e learning set training and validation and testing set a deep statistical analysis tests and sensitivity study is done on the presented models to check their efficiency and reliability the established models are beneficial in reducing the difficulty and cost which forecast ec and tds concentrations properly on a small group of inputs 2 research methodology in this section the methods of multi expression programming mep and an ensemble learning approach known as random forest rf will be explained checking the water quality indicator tds and ec with the selected study area and performance evaluation indicators will be discussed 2 1 multi expression programming genetic algorithms ga are based on stochastic and metaheuristic technique for creating best solutions that depends on the principles of biological selection and genetics goldberg 2006 by using the traditional optimization methods a series of binary strings is created by ga for describing the results genetic programming gp was an updated version of ga which encodes string expressions into executable computer program koza and koza 1992 for solving any problem gp implements the darwin s biological evolution theory gp s main purpose is to use the fitness metric for finding a code that can merge the inputs and outputs generally there are three types of gp in which linear gp is more productive than graph based and tree based gp alavi et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 reason of its effectiveness is that it does not need active researchers it also improves the accuracy in real time scale for forecasting the water quality indices tds and ec a multi expression programming linear gp approach was used in current paper mep keeps a track of all records by using linear chromosomes the most suitable answer that defines chromosome is determined by comparing the fitness values of the script first step in mep algorithmic process is to create code from a randomly selected population all the subsequent steps are performed until the required condition is achieved oltean and grosan 2003 1 by using simple binary tournament process parents are selected after which they are established again on the basis of specific crossover probability 2 the combination of two parents produces two offspring 3 after that the weakest is changed with the best among them using the mutation process mep works same as pascal and c compilers that interpret mathematical expression to coding alavi et al 2013 2010 a series of formulae represents the genes of mep the length of chromosomes is defined by the set of genes that remains constant throughout the whole calculation the gene is created by a function set f and terminals t 1 or 2 for generating the proper code the first gene of chromosome must match to the randomly chosen terminal inside a terminal set having reference is very important for the function gene values of the terminal scores produced by the specific gene are less than the gene s chromosomal location simple mep chromosome is explained by the example provided in fig 2 the function set i e f pow and the terminal set i e t b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 are uses to encode mep gene the mep gene can be transformed into program by decryption the chromosomes the decryption process starts from top to bottom the particular code is offered in the shape of gene in fig 2 the genes number 0 1 3 and 5 code just single terminal i e y 0 b 1 y 1 b 2 y 3 b 3 and y 5 b 4 respectively at positions 0 and 1 the gene 2 is used to represent the pow function applied on supposed operands and encodes the expression y 2 b 1 b 2 similarly at locations 2 and 3 gene 4 denotes the function applied on the operands thus encoding the expression y 4 b 1 b 2 b 3 ultimately the gene 6 represent the final expression as y 4 b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 accordingly the chromosomal order can be seen in the form of forest of gene trees entertaining numerous expressions following the effectiveness of different expression the best expression tree is revealed oltean and grosan 2003 2 2 random forest regression approach the rf technique is a popular approach for addressing regression and classification problems it is a breiman 2001 developed ensemble learning approach that integrates a number of regression trees random forest is basically a set of decision trees whose outcomes are combined in a single outcome generally the correlations and statistical errors achieved in the current rf model are equivalent to those found in previous optimization methods however the simplicity of predicting with categorical data utilizing rf makes it a preferred forecasting method the use of decision trees has the benefit of relatively rapid simulation for huge datasets xiong et al 2019 furthermore it can process both numerical and categorical descriptive data the collection of arranged circumstances in compliance with leaf of the regression tree is represented by the root of the regressive trees iqbal m et al 2021 vickers 2017 initially bootstrapping data are generated randomly via substitution of the entire training set and the prediction trees are assembled to every bootstrap instance rf then receives the weights of various evidentiary attributes i e the x input array following that rf constructs k regression trees and aggregates the findings the k t x 1 k are constructed the rf regression predictor is shown as eq 1 1 f yf ˆ k x k 1 k t x k the bagging technique improves the variability of the forest causing trees to develop using various training data groups designed to minimize overlapping with competing trees the data that were not chosen for constructing the kth tree during the bagging procedure are included in additional set known as out of bag oob set these oob samples are used by the kth tree to evaluate performance peters et al 2007 rf can thus construct a reliable and unbiased estimate of the prediction error not relying on an extrinsic data subset xiong et al 2019 fig 3 depicts the flowchart of the rf algorithm in this research the results obtained from mep metaheuristic approach are compared with rf ensemble machine learning method to estimate the parameters used for water quality assessment i e electric conductivity and total dissolved solids an attempt is made to make sure the superiority of modern machine learning technique ensemble machine technique rf used in this study is performed with the help of rapidminer studio available online as an open source tool while mep is performed using open source package mepx v 2 0 chu et al 2021 shah et al 2020 2 3 study area and data collection the indus river is one of the transboundary rivers of the asia which flows in three different countries the length of the river which is 3180 kilometer starts from tibet and enters into india near ladakh and ends in the karachi by touching arabian sea the annual flow of indus river is around 253 km3 and is one of the 50 largest rivers of the world the area surrounded by indus river consists of mountains and glaciers mostly the water quality assessment in these areas is important for the life of ecosystem established around the river shah et al 2021 tahir et al 2011 water and power development authority wapda of pakistan recorded the water quality data on monthly basis at different points of river indus the data used in this research was obtained from wapda a total of 360 datapoints were collected from them recorded from 1975 to 2005 the data used in this research was recorded at the bisham qilla and doyian stations the pictorial representation of the study area is provided in fig 4 after vast literature review eight parameters i e water temperature 0c calcium ca magnesium mg sulphate so4 sodium na ph bicarbonates hco3 and chloride cl were selected as input variables while two parameters i e tds and ec were selected as output although the discharge is also among the most important variable however the data retrieved from the wapda does not include any information about the measurement of discharge at bisham qilla and doyian stations the statistical details like mean standard deviation kurtosis skewness and range of all the parameters are shown in table 1 it can be seen that all values of tds and ec lie within the acceptable range provided by who for drinkable water tds 300 600 mg l ec 88 770 μs cm jamei et al 2020 also the dispersion statistics lies in the permissible range kurtosis 10 10 skewness 3 3 khan et al 2022b khan et al 2022c as accuracy of machine learning models largely depends on the input data therefore its necessary to calculate the correlation coefficient amongst the input variables and output to avoid multicollinearity problem khan et al 2021a the correlation coefficients for both outputs are shown in table 2 all values of correlation coefficient between inputs are less than 0 8 showing good dispersion of data in addition the values show a strong connection between selected input variables and output parameter with correlation values greater than 0 8 azim et al 2021 jalal et al 2021b furthermore the significance p value of the outputs corresponding to correlation coefficients at significance level of 5 α 0 05 are less than 0 00001 showing a significant relationship between outputs and input parameters considered in this study hence the data is randomly divided into three different sets training testing and validation as suggested by different researchers khan et al 2022a nguyen et al 2021 70 of the obtained data is used for training set while 15 of the data is used for testing set whereas the remaining 15 is used for validation set 2 4 statistical metrics for performance assessment of models to check the accuracy and applicability of the developed modes various statistical parameters like mean absolute percent error mape root mean squared logarithmic error rmsle r square root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae of all three sets are calculated and assessed amongst all the statistical parameters r square is the most reliable one in assessing the applicability of the model the detail description along with their formulae is provided in table 3 where the p and m represents the forecasted and measured reading respectively and k is the overall sum of experiments 2 5 uncertainty analysis in current research quantile regression qr was applied for evaluation of the overall uncertainty of a predictive model qr is a simple linear mathematical method used in several studies to estimate the quantiles of a predictor variables in the absence of a hypothesis kouadri et al 2022 taşan et al 2022 the implementation of qr to analyse error rates based on anticipated water quality indicators has been shown to be a comparatively simple effective and reliable approach for evaluating predictive models uncertainty weerts et al 2011 for every quartile q the mathematical relationship among measured m and predicted p water quality indicators ec and tds are provided as 2 m a q p b q in eq 2 a q and b q are the linear regression coefficients that can be derived and calculated through minimization of the sum of

quantile 5 95 shrestha and solomatine 2006 proposed uncertainty indicator using the performance evaluation of the qr method i e predictive interval coverage probability picp taşan et al 2022 the picp is a useful indicator reflecting that how many readings fit inside the expected area 5 95 when the picp is equal to 1 there is no uncertainty eq 5 shows the calculation of picp the mean width of the predictive interval uncertainty band is the range between the lower predictive limit pl j lower and upper predictive limit pl j upper 5 picp 1 k j 1 k c 6 c 1 pl j lower p j pl j upper 0 otherwise 2 6 tunning the mep model algorithmic parameters when beginning modeling specific mep algorithmic parameters are turned to generate robust accurate and adaptive models the appropriate settings are established considering literature recommendations and a hit and trial technique mousavi et al 2010 the overall number of programs raised in the population is determined by the size of the population an increased population take longer to reach convergence and provide more complicated but realistic and correct code yet increasing the population above certain level may cause overfitting in the simulated model the optimal algorithmic parameters for the best mep models ec and tds are provided in table 4 the modeling process started with the supposition of total ten subpopulations basic arithmetic operators x were chosen to generate a simple formula and to reach convergence with a better level of accurateness and robustness different iterations are used to define the level of accuracy which the program should achieve until being stopped simulations with multiple iterations provide a model with the least error also mutation and crossover rates manage the chance of offspring participating in the genetic process the crossover rate ranges from 50 to 95 following the evaluation of numerous configurations of these parameters the top potential combinations were selected based on the efficacy of the model as shown in table 4 an overfitting of the model performance is a common issue with supervised ml modeling a model seems to perform acceptably on the presented data set but its effectiveness degrades substantially when evolved using the unknown data to tackle the stated difficulty the research proposed to evaluate the trained model on an unseen data testing dataset qiu et al 2020 in a nutshell the whole readings in the database were randomly divided into 3 consistent and unique sets training set comprised of 252 readings 70 while both the validation and testing set contains 54 readings 15 it was confirmed that data distribution is consistent across all sets the optimal model was computed using the learning set training and validation the accuracy of the validated models was next assessed with unknown data kept aside in the testing set the generated models performed well in all 3 levels the process involves the production of a population for finding an optimal solution the procedures are recurring with each cycle getting us nearer to the best solution each iteration performance is evaluated over the whole population the algorithm will continue to evolve till a pre defined fitness r2 or rmse value becomes stagnant when the model results for any of the three datasets were inappropriate the process was repeated by gradually increasing the number and size sub populations the best solution is then picked due to the least rmse and high r2 it is worth remembering that evolving duration and number of generations make an impact on the correctness of the models generated because of the incorporation of more parameters into the operation a model would evolve indefinitely in the present simulation however the modeling was stopped at 1000 generations or when the increase in fitness score dropped to 0 1 additionally as described in section an optimal solution should meet several performance measures 2 7 tunning the rf model algorithmic parameters the preceding approach was used to create the rf model in the rapidminer studio version 9 8 framework the data from 360 temporal readings of the water quality indices was obtained in the processing window during the first stage of model development a number of operators was used to execute the process the select attribute operator to select the attributes subset for the modelling process the command set role was then employed to modify the position of an attribute as a targeting variable among several factors assessed the ec and tds were picked as the target attribute applying the split data operation the data were randomly divided into 70 train and 30 validation set optimize parameter grid was utilized to determine the optimum solution of the specified parameters numerous other criterions were used to analyze the best possible productivity of the presented model including the sum of trees maximum depth minimum leaf size confidence apply pre pruning and pruning rf minimum gain guess subset ratio random splits minimum size for split and enable parallel execution the optimum rf model was obtained by employing the lowest value of rf minimal gain i e zero while the highest value over the 1000 steps on a linear scale is equals to infinity the optimum rf model was obtained by employing the lowest value of rf minimal gain i e zero while the highest value over the 1000 steps on a linear scale is equals to infinity a greater minimum gain value leads in smaller splits and consequently fewer trees a too high value eliminates splitting resulting in trees containing only one node as a result the frequency of repetitions was altered to get an optimal model in many trails ultimately 1000 trials produced the best model the operator s ports were precisely linked to get the finest rf model the cross validation with automated sampling technique was included inside the optimize grid parameter using the k fold cross validation approach for this reason the whole data was split into ten different subsets the nine subsets of data were used for learning by performing the regression analysis while the one subset is kept for cross validation the operation is repeated till all the subsets are used as a cross validation set the ultimate cross validation performance is calculated by taking the average of performance metrics of all cross validation sample after expanding the density of trees indefinitely it was discovered that 200 trees produced the best results the processing duration of the model development doubled as the values of hyper parameters increasing without enhancing the correlations or creating a decrease in error table 5 lists the additional training parameters for the learned model the generated rf model s performance was evaluated using r2 rmsle mae rmse and mape 3 results and discussions 3 1 formulation of tds and ec using mep model the mep code of ec and tds is denoted by s 1 and s 2 the code utilizes nine input variables as provided in supplementary information the experimental ec predicted results is graphically presented in fig 5 best position of regression line is 450 which means that the slope must be equal to 1 for strong correlation iqbal m f et al 2021 the slope for all three sets is shown in fig 5 a as training 0 9885 validation 0 9921 and testing 0 9918 these results show a mutual relationship between experimental and forecasted ec moreover the results are nearly close to each other which is a best fit for sets due to this the proper training of model is defined iqbal m f et al 2021 khan s et al 2022 consequently it has great generalization power as it works almost similar on testing set fresh unseen data similar analysis was also done for tds findings of developed mep model as shown in fig 5 b generated model of tds was well trained and has the capacity of following experimental tds the slope of regression line of all three sets is nearly equal i e training 0 9924 validation 1 0119 and testing 0 9989 the functioning of tds model in testing stage is exceptional just like an ec model which shows that the over fitting problem was solved in a best manner anonna et al 2021 iqbal m f et al 2021 jalal et al 2021a moreover the r2 of each mep model is higher than 0 9 in training validation and testing phase it is clear from fig 5 a and 5 b that the spread of data points is nearer to 450 lines showing the greater prediction accuracy like the slope the r2 values of both models are also above 0 9 specifically on the unseen data testing phase it is equals to 0 9725 and 0 9674 for tds and ec respectively performance of both the models is similar in each phase of the developed mep model with a minor difference between slope or r2 values khan et al 2021b moreover the efficiency and adaptability of the models also depend on the number of data points use during simulation gholampour et al 2017 the higher number of data points equaling 360 results in an accurate prediction with less errors in both models mansouri et al 2018 3 1 1 comprehensive performance analysis of developed mep models reliability of model and number of used readings in foundation of model are directly proportional to each other ration of instances to independent variables must be higher than 5 according to the literature liu et al 2021 this ratio is 31 5 in training phase and it is 6 75 in the other two sets validation or testing good relationship between measured and predicted results can be achieved when r2 score will be higher than 0 8 farooq et al 2021 association of both tds and ec with each input is remarkable the research showed that r2 calculates the linear relationship of outcome with input variables that is why it is insufficient to inspect ec and tds models just on the basis of slope and regression coefficient liu et al 2021 so multi statistical scales must be used to check the reliability of developed tds and ec models statistical analytics i e rmsle mape mae and rmse of each set is mentioned in table 6 from which the power of the developed mep ec model can be calculated three error metrics i e rmse rmsle and mae are presented graphically through the mean absolute error graph fig 6 a whereas the absolute percent error histogram fig 6 b is shown for the investigation of mape both rmse and mae are important in examining the performance of the model rmse give more importance to large values of errors whereas mae have capacity of identifying small values of errors that is why mae is always smaller than rmse the mae in each phase is equals to training 12 36 validation 12 14 and testing 11 12 while the rmse is equals to 18 54 17 19 and 16 43 respectively which proves the condition i e mae rmse hazarika et al 2020 the minimum value of absolute error is 0 016 while maximum value is 98 16 moreover in each stage rmsle is almost zero which mimics the outstanding operation of the developed model larger values are penalized by rmlse very accurately additionally the histograms illustrate that 78 33 means 282 readings have an absolute error lower than 20 with no predicted output with error greater than 40 the mape values also decreases to 10 for all three phases i e training 5 32 validation 6 15 and testing 6 12 the developed ec model can be called as excellent model according to the conditions defined in section 2 4 jagaba et al 2020 jamei et al 2020 it can be utilized for future prediction because it has high power of accuracy and fewer errors it will eventually help the designers to avoid machine and human errors tung and yaseen 2020 zhang et al 2019 tds mep is like the ec mep model in terms of accuracy and reliability the spreading of absolute error close to x axis shows excellent efficacy of the developed tds model as shown in fig 7 a from table 6 it can be observed that the value of mae in testing phase is 8 27 ppm and which is less than rmse 11 36 ppm the maximum and minimum absolute error is 66 25 ppm and 0 046 ppm respectively which shows that the model is very effective jamei et al 2020 moreover the error histogram replicates that 85 83 data means 309 readings have an absolute error lower than 10 with no predicted output with error greater than 45 as shown in fig 7 b just like an ec model the mape values also decreases to 10 for all three phases i e training 7 40 validation 8 25 and testing 5 54 and thus it can also be categorized as an excellent model jamei et al 2020 3 2 prediction of tds and ec using rf model rf is an ensemble machine learning approach that uses the weak learners trees as a supervised learner the best performing model is extracted based on the coefficient of determination i e r2 or r square the rf algorithm is trained to splits the model into 20 sub models using n estimators the n ranges from 10 to 200 with an increment of 20 as summarized in the fig 8 a the maximum ensemble r2 and mean ensemble r2 for ec is equal to 0 9784 and 0 9698 respectively at the incorporation of 40 estimators while the tds fig 8 b gives an outstanding performance at 80 estimators with maximum ensemble r2 and mean ensemble r2 equals to 0 9816 and 0 9736 respectively such an exceptional performance of ransom forest ensemble regression is due to the utilization of decision trees as a weak learner peters et al 2007 3 3 comparison of developed mep and rf models the rf regression model was developed to predict the ec and tds using the same input variables and dataset used in the development of mep models hazarika et al 2020 shah et al 2020 the details of the statistical analysis of the rf models observed in table 7 while the fig 9 and fig 10 are used to graphically represent the flowing track of observed and predicted values along with the frequency distribution of error values both the rf ec and rf tds models provides relatively better performance than the mep ec and mep tds models the forecasted ec and tds shows the minor deviation from their targeted values with the promising reliability and performance based on the statical indicators considered in this study the rf ec models provides 20 r2 50 rmsle 17 rmse 14 mae and 42 mape better prediction in the testing stage than the developed mep ec model similarly rf tds models provided 17 4 r2 77 rmsle 39 rmse 34 mae and 40 mape better prediction in the testing stage than the developed mep tds model the fig 9 a and 10 a shows that for rf ec and rf tds model the maximum absolute error is equals to 68 21 μs cm and 28 51 ppm which is 30 and 57 lower than mep developed models respectively thus showing the superiority of the rf regression technique for both rf ec and rf tds models around 98 of the prediction carries an absolute percent error less than 10 with no prediction carrying absolute percent error greater than 12 5 the mape in all three stages of rf models for both ec and tds fall below 5 indicating the efficacy and leading performance of the random forest regression however as compared to mep algorithm the rf lacks in providing the mathematical equations for the future estimation of the tds and ec 3 4 sensitivity analysis of developed ec mep and tds mep model in order to check the successful functioning and reliability of machine learning modeling on different types of data it is very important to do variety of tests higher efficiency in training validation and testing phase does not mean that the model is superior sensitivity analysis is necessary to check the effectiveness of model it is used to check that the model is performing excellent and it is not merely a relation of outputs and inputs all the developed models are examined by sensitivity analysis to get more detail on the significance of the independent variables on the forecasted water quality parameters ec and tds the sensitivity importance r sens of the considered independent variables i k were calculated using the eq 2 ardakani and kordnaeij 2019 wang and yin 2020 2 r sens k 1 l m k n k k 1 l m k 2 k 1 l n k 2 in this equation n k is the estimated result of the projected models i e ec or tds whereas l denotes the number of readings which is equal to 360 r sens score whose value is from zero to one shows a relation between input and output when the value of r sens is 1 the input has a more effect on the output fig 11 a and 11 b signifies the sensitivity importance r sens of the input variables used for the estimation of mep ec and mep tds respectively all eight inputs greatly affect the predictive power of developed mep models chlorides sulphates and carbonates are the most sensitive and important qualities that effect the result of predicting output with sensitivity index above 0 5 zhang et al 2019 among all the least sensitive input is sodium content the sensitivity index of sodium is 0 53 and 0 51 in the mep ec and mep tds models respectively 3 5 uncertainty analysis of mep and rf models this research also included an uncertainty analysis of evolutionary mep and ensemble rf learning models model uncertainty is primarily defined via uncertainty in the independent variables of the model sharafati and pezeshki 2020 however because the same set of input variables considered for predicting water quality indicators therefore only the uncertainty of predictive models ec mep tds mep ec rf tds rf were evaluated in this work taşan et al 2022 the quantile regression qr approach was utilized to evaluate the uncertainty of two distinct ml approaches employed in the assessment of water quality indexes in this approach model residuals are undertaken to calculate uncertainty estimates for both mep and rf based ml models 95 confidence intervals were employed to estimate ec and tds in each dataset training validation and testing the prediction interval coverage probability picp was used to assess uncertainty furthermore picp percentage for all phases of each model as shown in table 8 it can be seen that the both the mep and rf models for ec and tds have almost similar picp between all the three phases indicating the robustness of predictive models however the picp for rf models is higher than mep models showing that the rf have comparatively lower uncertainty for ec mep and tds mep models the picp is greater than 85 in each set while the picp exceed 95 in case of rf in testing phase the picp for ec rf and tds rf is equals to 97 53 and 98 36 respectively indicating higher sensitivity and lower uncertainty in tree based random forest regression models for the prediction of water quality indices this is attributable to the bagging approach used in rf regression the rf based ensemble approach provides more accurate prediction by combining multiple regression trees into a single model 4 conclusion water pollution is a very serious problem that is very dangerous to humans environment and agriculture in the current study the evolutionary algorithm ea based multi expression programming mep models and ensemble learning algorithm ela based random forest rf regression models are suggested for forecasting the electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds using the most effective inputs eight i e water temperature 0c sodium content na bicarbonates hco3 calcium ca sulphate so4 magnesium mg power of hydron ions ph and chloride cl content various statistical tests were done to check the accuracy and efficiency of models using statistical indicators i e slope and determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute present error mape mean absolute error mae and root mean square logarithmic error rmsle from the evaluation of the performance indicators it is revealed that all models mep ec mep tds rf ec and rf tds gave very accurate results with r2 value than 0 95 and are reliable with least error statistics in the testing stage the mae and rmse were 11 22 us cm and 16 43 us cm 9 73 us cm and 13 54 us cm 8 27 ppm and 11 36 ppm and 5 45 ppm and 6 99 ppm for mep ec rf ec mep tds and rf tds model respectively for each model the rmsle is almost equals to zero reflecting the remarkable functioning of the developed models furthermore the mape of the mep models for both ec and tds falls below 10 and are classified as excellent in contrary the rf models have mape values below 5 in all three stages showing their exceptional performance also the sensitivity analysis showed that the all the eight input factors greatly affect the prediction of water quality with sensitivity index more than 0 5 all the models rf and mep have lower uncertainty based on the prediction interval coverage probability picp calculated using the quartile regression qr approach the picp of each model is greater than 85 in all three stages thus the established models are not just a correlation of inputs and output and can be confidently used for future prediction of ec and tds by the decision makers and practitioners eventually it will be more helpful for researchers because it will save the time and cost needed for inspecting the parameters of water quality 5 suggestions and recommendations the present research mainly focused on analysis of upper indus river basin after the analysis a detailed knowledge of challenges regarding water was provided this information can be used to check the quality of water and performance of machines learning algorithms results showed that predictions of both ensemble rf and evolutionary algorithms mep were strong and can be used for checking water quality it will be valuable for government researchers policy makers and designers it can also be used to save limited sources of water which will be beneficial for environment moreover it is very important to do more research to check new methods and to evaluate the performance of parameters used in calculating water quality metrics some new parameters of water must be taken into consideration as well when checking the prediction capacity a complete point of view and techniques that decrease the quality of water will be provided by spatiotemporal test credit authorship contribution statement ali aldrees conceptualization investigation writing original draft
