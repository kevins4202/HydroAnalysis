deficit the wild rocket benefited of azo and sw application which stimulated the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and antioxidant enzymes demonstrating the potential role in limiting water stress therefore the two biostimulants can represent a useful tool to improve the production of wild rocket and increase the water use efficiency keywords seaweed azoxystrobin diplotaxis tenuifolia gas exchange chlorophyll antioxidant enzymes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in italy the wild rocket diplotaxis tenuifolia l dc is an expanding leaf vegetable due to its qualitative peculiarities cavaiuolo and ferrante 2014 caruso et al 2019 it is among those vegetables that provides fast economic return since it is a fresh cut product whose market is constantly growing the main cultivation method is in open air or under plastic tunnels with a high plant density 1500 2500 m 2 plants to obtain a baby leaf product with harvesting at the stage of about 8 leaves schiattone 2018 fresh cut products require high quality standards that can be achieved by applying appropriate agronomic techniques timely and in the most adequate way the agronomic factors that have the greatest impact on yield and its quality include water and nutrition management especially nitrogen n as known water availability is one of the main production factors for all crops and in particular for leafy vegetables moreover the management of water and fertility is among the factors that have the greatest impact on the sustainability of production especially in terms of environmental impact water shortage occurs frequently in hot arid areas like southern italy which requires a smart management of water and nutrient inputs due to the risks of misuse by farmers and consequent negative impacts on the environment crop water stress decreases yield of many leafy vegetables as a consequence of the leaf number and size drop closely linked to the reduction of net assimilation bozkurt et al 2009 mahmood et al 2004 mirdad 2009 usually d tenuifolia grows wildly in poor soils under water shortage conditions it assumes a xeromorphic habitus that allows the survival and reproduction under water stress but inadequate to market purposes stable production of high yield quality for fresh cut products is instead obtained by ensuring an adequate water supply 100 of crop evapotranspiration during the whole growing season schiattone et al 2018b furthermore wild rocket like other leafy vegetables requires an adequate n supply to obtain high yield and excellent quality in fact the availability of n influences numerous qualitative parameters of leafy vegetables i e dry matter chlorophyll polyphenols ascorbic acid nitrates leaf color and brightness shelf life crunchiness de pascale et al 2013 considering the economic importance of wild rocket and the essential role of water and nitrogen availability during the growing cycle it is necessary to pay particular attention to the optimal management of water and nitrogen supply modern agriculture focusses on the optimization of resources use while decreasing the negative impacts on the environment and increasing quantity and quality of products and therefore economic benefits meeting these goals could be favoured by using natural products known as plant biostimulants colla and rouphael 2015 baltazar et al 2021 li et al 2022 plant biostimulants contain substance s and or microorganisms whose function when applied to plants or to rhizosphere is to stimulate natural processes that enhance nutrient uptake efficiency tolerance to abiotic stress and crop quality with no direct action on pests ebic 2013 among the numerous substances and organisms for which some biostimulating action has been proven du jardin 2015 reported the seaweed extract whose composition and bioactive components are not fully known furthermore numerous experimental findings showed a biostimulating action also by strobilurins compounds of natural origin commonly used as broad spectrum fungicides the promotion of plant growth by some seaweeds has been known for some time so that their use as organic fertilizers has become widespread craigie 2011 but since the 1950 s the use of whole seaweed has been progressively replaced by extracts of different species of seaweeds du jardin 2015 seaweed extracts contain inorganic and organic substances in varying quantities depending mainly on the seaweed species and the extraction method among the inorganic substances there are n p k ca fe mg zn na and s organic compounds include amino acids osmolytes e g mannitol betaines and betaine analogues secondary bioactive metabolites vitamins and vitamin precursors polysaccharides phenols phytohormones e g auxins cytokinins gibberellins abscisic acid acid acetic indole polyamines and brassinosteroids boukhari 2020 therefore the biological activity of the extracts can differ considerably in relation to the starting raw material and the extraction process khairy and el shafay 2013 kim 2012 puglisi et al 2020 however it is difficult to interpret the results obtained following of the use of these products and the attribution of any effects to one or the other of the components present in the extract boukhari et al 2020 there are numerous experimental findings that demonstrate a complementary biostimulating action of strobiluins at a metabolic and physiological level on different species which often leads to an improvement in yield and quality amaro et al 2020 boari et al 2019 candido et al 2020 schiattone et al 2021 strobilurins are substances of natural origin from which various structural variants have been synthesized e g azoxystrobin kresoxim methyl pyraclostrobin they are used in agriculture as fungicides and their spreading has been favored by their low toxicity to humans and the environment in nature these substances are produced by some basidiomycetes fungi e g oudemansiella mucida schrad ex fr hoehn and strobilurus tenacellus pers ex fr singer which cause the wood rot of some tree species balba 2007 bartlett et al 2002 in addition to the fungicidal action the application of strobilurins seems to lead to the increase in abscisic acid aba and some enzymes involved in oxidative stress as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod ascorbate peroxidase apx catalase cat boari et al 2019 liang et al 2018 lopes et al 2018 which can therefore positively influence assimilation rate transpiration stomatal conductance and water use efficiency wue cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2018 furthermore a positive action has been demonstrated on cell proliferation van dingenen et al 2017 n metabolism and n no3 accumulation probably due to the stimulating action of nitrate reductase activity amaro et al 2018 2020 joshi et al 2014 as observed on lettuce and spinach treated with azoxystrobin bonasia et al 2013 on which an increase in chlorophyll vitamin c and phenolic compounds was observed conversa et al 2014 in literature there are little experimental findings on the effects of biostimulants such as strobilurins and seaweed extracts on wild rocket therefore a study was carried out to verify the combined effect of water regime nitrogen level and two biostimulants azoxystrobin and seaweed extract on the performance of wild rocket during two growing cycles in particular this study reports the effects on some physiological parameters related to gas exchange and biochemical aspects chlorophyll content and some antioxidant enzymes strictly connected to the agronomic variables this knowledge can be of great use to optimize the application of resources and to improve the production performance of wild rocket while reducing the environmental impact of its cultivation 2 material and methods 2 1 characteristics of the experimental site the research was carried out at the mediterranean agronomic institute ciheam of bari italy 41 03 n 16 52 e 72 m a s l during the autumn winter 2016 2017 15 november 17 genuary and 18 genuary 28 february two crop cycles were carried out in an unheated greenhouse covered with ethylene vinyl acetate eva film 200 µm in thickness this area is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate the experiment was carried out using cylindrical pots 0 34 m in diameter and 0 3 m in height suitably equipped with saucers each containing 20 dm3 of soil type lithic ruptic inceptic haploxeralfs usda 2006 of good fertility taken in the same locality the soil of the most superficial layer 0 5 cm was mixed with perlite soil perlite ratio 5 1 v v to prevent compactation by irrigation water 2 2 climatic trend two growing cycles of wild rocket were characterized by daily minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperatures which fluctuated respectively between 2 1 and 16 9 c and between 1 4 and 23 5 c in particular during the first crop cycle in the first decade of january very low temperatures occurred with values of tmin for several days below 0 c and tmax that in the same days did not exceed 5 5 c during the second crop cycle tmax increased progressively until harvest oscillating around 16 c while tmin remained around 7 c data not shown the solar global radiation rg showed a steady trend around of 7 5 mj m 2 d 1 from transplantation until the end of january subsequently the trend of this parameter has been increasing up to about 14 mj m 2 d 1 in the days preceding the last collection data not shown 2 3 treatments experimental layout and crop management the following three experimental treatments were compared two watering regimes wr restoring 50 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc indicated respectively wr 50 and wr 100 three n levels nl 0 75 and 150 kg ha 1 n indicated respectively n0 n75 and n150 the application of two biostimulants bs based on azoxystrobin ortiva syngenta and seaweed extract bioproject sm23 foliar biokimia international srl indicated respectively azo and sw in addition to a untreated control c the experimental layout was a split split plot with three replications arranging wr in the main plots nl in the plots and bs in the sub plots each consisting of one pot fertilization was carried out as follows 3 34 and 1 25 g pot 1 of p2o5 19 superphosphate and k2o 51 potassium sulphate corresponding respectively to 70 kg ha 1 of both nutrients distributed before transplantation in all treatments and then buried at a depth of 5 10 cm furthermore treatments n75 and n150 were fertilized respectively with 1 73 and 3 46 g pot 1 of ammonium sulphate 21 40 and 80 kg ha 1 of n before transplantation and with 1 51 and 3 02 g pot 1 of the same fertilizer 35 and 70 kg ha 1 of n just after the first harvest weeds were manually eliminated a few days after emergence to avoid competition with wild rocket plants the transplant of wild rocket was performed on november 15th 2016 using seedlings at the 5th true leaf stage prepared in the nursery in 228 hole polystyrene alveolate trays in each pot 5 tufts of 3 seedlings each have been transplanted suitably spaced ortiva 1 5 ml l 1 and bioproject sm23 foliar 1 5 ml l 1 were sprayed 20 50 84 and 94 days after transplant dat for the pest and disease control only one insecticide confidor 200 sl bayer cropscience s r l italy containing imidacloprid 17 1 application was necessary to fight an initial attack of aphids myzus persicae during the first crop cycle evapotranspiration et was measured by the water balance method by weighing the pots every 4 5 days which were considered to be weighing lysimeters schiattone et al 2017 to meet the water needs of the wild rocket the water having an electrical conductivity of 0 5 ds m 1 was manually distributed on the surface of the pots watering was carried out when 45 of the available water aw ran out in the wr 100 treatment based on the threshold value p 45 of other brassicaceae allen et al 1998 any percolation water was collected in the saucers which was subsequently weighed and used for the subsequent watering of the same pot in order to recover any loss of nutrients due to leaching two crop cycles were carried out with harvests made on january 17th 63 dat and february 28th 105 dat 3 leaf chlorophyll content in some days 29 38 45 51 60 86 90 94 98 and 105 dat during the two growing cycles the leaf chlorophyll chl content was measured by a non destructive method using a chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta ramsey nj which provides the chl content in arbitrary units spad units for each pot the measurements were performed on three young fully expanded leaves randomly selected for each of five plants attributing to each pot the average value of fifteen leaves 4 gas exchange gas exchanges co2 assimilation rate a transpiration t stomatal conductance gs internal co2 concentration ci were measured using a portable li 6400 open system photosynthesis meter li cor lincoln nebraska usa with the light intensity of the leaf chamber parin provided by a red light diode source on the upper surface of the leaf set at 1800 µmol photon m 2 s 1 and the concentration of co2 provided by a reservoir of external co2 set at 400 μmol mol 1 intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated as a gs ratio measurements were made from 11 00 13 30 of two days 61 and 104 dat differing mainly in air temperature vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil water deficit in wr 50 treatment on each measurement date two apical leaves of two plants per pot were chosen fully expanded and well exposed to light the order followed for the measures of different treatments was completely random each measurement lasted about 2 5 min the measurements were performed under the following mean climatic conditions in the greenhouse par 861 μmol m 2 s 1 61 dat and 965 μmol m 2 s 1 104 dat air temperature 12 4 c 61 dat and 22 5 c 104 dat vapor pressure deficit vpd 1 5 61 dat and 2 8 kpa 104 dat furthermore in the same days the average water depletion wd in the soil was the following wd equal to about 20 of aw for wr 100 50 61 dat and 90 104 dat of aw for wr 50 4 1 antioxidant enzyme assay and protein determination at each harvest time the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod ascorbate peroxidase apx and catalase cat was determined a homogeneous sample of mature and healthy leaves was taken from each pot immediately closed in a black plastic bag and placed in a portable refrigerator at a temperature of 4 c the samples were then transported to the laboratory and analysed within two hours for the enzymes extraction 1 g of plant material was randomly taken from the main sample and homogenized in a cold mortar with 1 ml of specific buffer for sod 50 mm k phosphate ph 7 1 triton x 100 7 mm 2 mercaptoethanol for pod 100 mm na phosphate ph 7 3 for apx 100 mm na phosphate ph 7 containing 5 mm ascorbate and 1 mm edta for cat 50 mm k phosphate ph 7 1 pvp the homogenates were centrifuged 14 000 g 10 min 4 c and the resultant supernatants were collected to evaluate the enzyme activities for each enzyme three replicates were performed the enzymatic activities of sod pod apx and cat were assessed as previously described by sergio et al 2012 protein content was measured according to bradford 1976 using bsa as a standard 5 statistical analysis the datasets were tested according to the basic assumptions of analysis of variance anova the normal distribution of the experimental error was verified by shapiro wilk test while the common variance of the experimental error by bartlett s test the data collected in each crop cycle were subjected to the anova according to the split split plot experimental design with three replicates using the spss 17 software a three way anova procedure was performed considering all the factors as fixed while the replicates as random mean values were separated with the student newman keuls snk test p 0 05 6 results 6 1 leaf chlorophyll content the chlorophyll content determined with the spad did not show significant variations between the irrigation regimes during the trial while it differed among n levels and the biostimulant treatments fig 1 in general the trend of the spad index was increasing during each growing cycle with values that on average went from about 35 in mid december to about 50 at the first harvest and from 42 in the first ten days of february to about 49 to the second harvest fig 1 in terms of nl n1 and n2 presented values of 14 3 and 20 5 higher than n0 fig 1b respectively sw and azo resulted in an increase in the spad index of 6 1 and 9 1 respectively fig 1c in particular for sw the increase was more significant in january in the period preceding the harvest while during the second crop cycle the differences in respect to the control gradually decreased until they disappeared near the harvest also in the case of azo the most significant differences with respect to the control were detected in 15 days preceding the first harvest 6 2 gas exchange the gas exchanges of the wild rocket were measured in two representative days 61 dat and 104 dat which differed in the soil water deficit level in wr 100 on both days the water reserve was within the readily available water corresponding to deficit of about 20 of total available water taw however in wr 50 water deficit was equal to 50 and 90 of taw on 61 dat and 104 dat respectively overall different water deficit levels observed for the treatments influenced the parameters describing the gas exchange of wild rocket table 1 the lower water availability of wr 50 in respect to wr 100 caused a reduction of a t and gs by 11 1 25 6 and 23 9 and by 51 8 52 5 and 55 6 respectively on 61 and 104 dat which corresponded to a decrease in ci above all on 104 dat table 1 the a increased by 23 3 and 10 5 from n0 to n75 on 61 and 104 dat respectively while no further increase was found with the highest nl transpiration rised by 11 4 from n0 to n75 on both dates of measurement a further increase of nitrogen dose n150 caused a slight increase of a on 61 dat while on 104 dat this parameter was reduced by 6 8 the gs trend in relation to the nl was opposite for two dates of measurement the gs rised with the increase of nl on 61 dat whereas it was reduced on 104 dat the ci did not show variations in relation to nl on 61 dat while it decreased with the increase of nl on 104 dat the increase of nl exacerbated the negative effect of the water deficit on a and t wr x nl interaction fig 2 especially on 104 dat when water deficient plants have experienced longer and more severe water stress azo and sw on average increased a by 15 0 and 7 9 respectively furthermore azo reduced t by 10 6 on 104 dat and gs by 20 0 and 6 7 on 61 and 104 dat respectively the values of wuei varied significantly in relation to the compared treatments table 1 fig 3 when in wr 50 the water deficit was lower wd 50 of aw on 61 dat a 16 9 increase in wuei was recorded compared to wr 100 while under more severe water stress wd 90 of aw on 104 dat the positive effect of the water deficit on this parameter was smaller table 1 in addition the wuei increased progressively with the increase of nl the azo and sw resulted in an average increase of 15 0 and 33 1 in wuei respectively the increase of the latter parameter after the sprying of sw occurred mainly in conditions of water deficit wr x bs interaction fig 3 6 3 antioxidant enzymes sod pod apx cat four examined enzymes were affected to a different extent by the treatments fig 4 the enzymes were significantly affected by different wate regimes in particular their concentration was higher in wr 50 compared to wr 100 by 391 7 sod 374 2 pod 42 1 apx and 137 1 cat as the average of two harvests the nl did not affect any of studied enzymes sw and azo significantly stimulated the production of sod pod apx and cat whose values as the average of two harvests were respectively 395 4 160 5 155 0 and 333 9 and 489 5 112 4 192 9 and 335 9 higher than the control the differences between azo sw and control treatments were significantly more pronounced in conditions of water deficit than under optimal water supply wr x bs interaction fig 5 7 discussion 7 1 leaf chlorophyll content chlorophyll content of wild rocket increased by increasing n level and applying azoxystrobin or seaweed extract based biostimulants the increase in chlorophyll in relation to the rise in nl is consistent with the results obtained on wild rocket candido et al 2020 schiattone et al 2018b lettuce bonasia et al 2013 and spinach conversa et al 2014 as it would expect since nitrogen is one of the main constituents of the pigment taiz and zeiger 2002 the chlorophyll content of wild rocket leaves increased following the application of seaweed extract similarly puglisi et al 2020 reported a considerable increase in chlorophyll in lettuce leaves with the application of extracts of microalgae scenedesmus quadricauda just as the increase of this pigment has also been observed in corn leaves treated with extracts of different species of algae fayzi et al 2020 the increase in chlorophyll following the application of the seaweed extract can be attributed to increased availability of algal nutrients especially nitrogen and magnesium which are fundamental components of chlorophyll forming rahmawati et al 2015 furthermore the increase of chlorophyll content might also be explained by the decrease in degradation of this molecule caused in part by cytokinins and betaines known to be present in seaweed extract jannin et al 2013 balakumbahan and kavitha 2019 our study showed that azoxystrobin significantly increased the leaf chlorophyll content of wild rocket confirming the data of the literature in which it is reported that strobilurin favors the increase of chlorophyll during plant development bonasia et al 2013 liang et al 2018 this is attributable to its effect on the balance of some phytohormones grossmann and retzlaff 1997 in particular strobilurin would reduce the synthesis of ethylene a hormone notoriously involved in the processes of senescence and degradation of chlorophyll abeles et al 1992 on the other hand it would favor the increase of cytokinins involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll in the presence of light sundqvist et al 1980 7 2 gas exchange the compared treatments influenced the gas exchange parameters of wild rocket in particular the reduction in water availability reduced a t and gs which was accompanied by a decrease in ci especially when water stress was severe these results are in agreement with the literature where is widely reported that photosynthesis is among the first physiological processes negatively influenced by the reduction of water availability chaves 1991 it is well documented that under moderate water stress the reduction of a and gs is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in ci on the other hand under strong water stress the reduction of a and gs correspond to relatively higher values of ci wu et al 2008 this indicates that with moderate water stress gs is the main limiting factor of assimilation regardless of any metabolic alteration chaves and oliveira 2004 with strong water stress however the reduction in the mesophyll co2 availability caused by the closure of the stomata is not the main cause of the reduction in a but the reduction in the efficiency of carboxylation is involved rouhi et al 2007 hence in our case it can be deduced that for the wild rocket under water deficit at least in two measurement days 61 and 104 dat the stomatal limitation of photosynthesis prevailed the a increased from n0 to n75 while no further increase was found with the higher nl transpiration did not change on the first measurement date when the water stress in wr 50 was lower while on the second date this parameter decreased with the highest nl the trend of gs in relation to the nl was opposite in the two measurement dates in particular this parameter has shown the tendency to increase with the rise of nl 61 dat and then to diminish 104 dat on 61 dat the ci did not show variations in relation to the nl while on 104 dat it decreased with the increase in nl the increase in nl accentuated the negative effect of water limitation on a and t especially when the water stress to which the wr 50 treatment plants were subjected persisted for longer period and when it was more severe also wu et al 2008 reported that the response to water deficit of the parameters relating to gas exchanges is different in relation to n availability these authors observed that under optimal water supply a and gs were higher with high n levels on the other hand in conditions of water deficit the a of plants subjected to a high n intake was inhibited while no significant n effects on gs were observed the sw increased a schiattone et al 2018a this can be associated with the increase of leaf chlorophyll content as obtained in our research which confirms the findings of other authors fan et al 2013 jannin et al 2013 azo resulted in the increase of a which can be attributed to the combined effect of the rise in the leaf chlorophyll content and the improvement of the water status of the plant determined by the reduction of gs with regard to the gs control and therefore of the plant water status this aspect was not very evident in our study it might be explained by better physiological conditions of the plants treated with azoxystrobin which presented a greater stomatal opening experimental evidence in this sense was obtained on tomatoes treated with azoxystrobin giuliani et al 2011 or pyraclostrobin boari et al 2019 cantore et al 2016 in fact these authors observed that the application of strobilurin based products improved the plant water status and gas exchange these considerations are also supported by the findings of other authors who argue that strobilurins positively influence the endogenous concentration of aba which would help inhibit stomatal opening improving the water use especially when the plant is in water deficit conditions venancio et al 2003 in addition grossmann and retzlaff 1997 stated that strobilurins causes decreased respiration and consequently the change of the co2 compensation point and co2 net assimilation increase a limited water deficit led to an increase in wuei while with a more severe water deficit this effect was lower in fact in the presence of low water stress a small reduction in gs can have protective effects against stress allowing the plant to save water and consequently to improve the water use efficiency chaves et al 2009 the wuei increased progressively with the increase in nl many studies have well documented the photosynthetic response of the plant to the n availability and some of these highlighted the existence of a positive correlation between the photosynthetic capacity and the leaf nitrogen content suggesting that most of the nitrogen is used for the synthesis of compounds of the photosynthetic apparatus damatta et al 2002 makoto and koike 2007 such as chlorophyll maheswari et al 2008 both the lack of water and the increase in the n availability promote an increase in wuei in accordance with the results of yin et al 2006 and with the general theory that the limiting supply of a resource can improve the efficiency of use of other resources wu et al 2008 the sw increased wuei as a consequence of the increase in a without significant changes in t the increase in wuei after application of sw occurred mainly in conditions of water limitations confirming what is reported in the literature on the presence of osmotically active components in algae extract blunden et al 2009 mackinnon et al 2010 which can alleviate some abiotic stress such as water stress battacharyya et al 2015 neily et al 2008 the azo increased wuei this can be attributed to the combined effect of the increase in the leaf chlorophyll content and the improvement of the plant water status determined by the reduction of gs bonasia et al 2013 liang et al 2018 7 3 antioxidant enzymes sod pod apx cat the water deficit caused a significant increase in the enzymes involved in oxidative stress that were examined sod pod apx and cat these results agree with the literature in which the enzymatic response of plant to different biotic and abiotic stress is widely reported including water stress abd el baky et al 2016 sergio et al 2012 sofo et al 2005 in fact plants subject to water deficit undergo excessive reducing power due to the reduction of co2 assimilation which causes the increase in the levels of activated oxygen species ros and the accumulation of free radicals if the accumulation of ros exceeds the ability of the antioxidant system to remove them then the peroxidation of membrane lipids arises the destruction of photosynthetic pigments the inactivation of the enzymes involved in the reactions of co2 fixation and finally cell death møller 2001 sairam and tyagi 2004 the enzymatic defense system to eliminate ros adopted by plants includes sods which catalyze the conversion of superoxide into h2o2 together with cat pods and apx which eliminate the h2o2 produced sofo et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 the application of the seaweed based biostimulant resulted in a significant increase in four enzymes examined in both wr however to a greater extent in the presence of water stress the beneficial effects of seaweed exstracts on water stressed plants through the control of antioxidant enzymes are reported hasanuzzaman et al 2021 this result agrees with the observations of other authors on different species such as potato wheat and soybean treated with seaweed extract and subjected to water shortage abd el baky et al 2008 abd el baky et al 2016 shukla et al 2018 azoxystrobin also stimulated the production of antioxidant enzymes whose concentration in the aerial part of the wild rocket was significantly higher than in the control in the literature experimental findings in this sense were reported on barley crops where the application of pyraclostrobin would have inhibited the manifestation of the physiological leaf spot a physiopathy attributable to oxidative stress the response of barley to pyraclostrobin has been attributed to the doubling of the enzymatic activity of peroxidase köehle et al 2003 cantore et al 2015 reported an increase in sod pod apx and cat in tomato plants treated with pyraclostrobin which would have improved salinity tolerance while liang et al 2018 found a significant increase in the activity of the main antioxidant enzymes following the application of azoxystrobin on ginseng which would have favored the delay of leaf senescence 8 conclusions the interactive effect of irrigation regimes nitrogen level and the application of azoxystrobin fungicide belonging to the strobilurin class and bioproject sm23 foliar biostimulant based on seaweed extracts was studied in order to acquire usefull informations for improving some agricultural techniques irrigation and nitrogen management biostimulant application able to ensure economically viable production levels and high quality characteristics of wild rocket and to increase water use efficiency both azoxystrobin and the brown seaweed extract based biostimulant have proven effective in improving some physiological and biochemical parameters of wild rocket especially in conditions of severe and prolonged water deficit in particular the increase in the leaf chlorophyll content net assimilation and intrinsic water use efficiency was observed in addition both substances have stimulated the biosynthesis of the antioxidant enzymes sod pod apx and cat demonstrating the potential role in limiting water stress the information gained through the research provides useful indications for improving the production techniques of wild rocket and optimizing

the two biostimulants can represent a useful tool to improve the production of wild rocket and increase the water use efficiency keywords seaweed azoxystrobin diplotaxis tenuifolia gas exchange chlorophyll antioxidant enzymes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in italy the wild rocket diplotaxis tenuifolia l dc is an expanding leaf vegetable due to its qualitative peculiarities cavaiuolo and ferrante 2014 caruso et al 2019 it is among those vegetables that provides fast economic return since it is a fresh cut product whose market is constantly growing the main cultivation method is in open air or under plastic tunnels with a high plant density 1500 2500 m 2 plants to obtain a baby leaf product with harvesting at the stage of about 8 leaves schiattone 2018 fresh cut products require high quality standards that can be achieved by applying appropriate agronomic techniques timely and in the most adequate way the agronomic factors that have the greatest impact on yield and its quality include water and nutrition management especially nitrogen n as known water availability is one of the main production factors for all crops and in particular for leafy vegetables moreover the management of water and fertility is among the factors that have the greatest impact on the sustainability of production especially in terms of environmental impact water shortage occurs frequently in hot arid areas like southern italy which requires a smart management of water and nutrient inputs due to the risks of misuse by farmers and consequent negative impacts on the environment crop water stress decreases yield of many leafy vegetables as a consequence of the leaf number and size drop closely linked to the reduction of net assimilation bozkurt et al 2009 mahmood et al 2004 mirdad 2009 usually d tenuifolia grows wildly in poor soils under water shortage conditions it assumes a xeromorphic habitus that allows the survival and reproduction under water stress but inadequate to market purposes stable production of high yield quality for fresh cut products is instead obtained by ensuring an adequate water supply 100 of crop evapotranspiration during the whole growing season schiattone et al 2018b furthermore wild rocket like other leafy vegetables requires an adequate n supply to obtain high yield and excellent quality in fact the availability of n influences numerous qualitative parameters of leafy vegetables i e dry matter chlorophyll polyphenols ascorbic acid nitrates leaf color and brightness shelf life crunchiness de pascale et al 2013 considering the economic importance of wild rocket and the essential role of water and nitrogen availability during the growing cycle it is necessary to pay particular attention to the optimal management of water and nitrogen supply modern agriculture focusses on the optimization of resources use while decreasing the negative impacts on the environment and increasing quantity and quality of products and therefore economic benefits meeting these goals could be favoured by using natural products known as plant biostimulants colla and rouphael 2015 baltazar et al 2021 li et al 2022 plant biostimulants contain substance s and or microorganisms whose function when applied to plants or to rhizosphere is to stimulate natural processes that enhance nutrient uptake efficiency tolerance to abiotic stress and crop quality with no direct action on pests ebic 2013 among the numerous substances and organisms for which some biostimulating action has been proven du jardin 2015 reported the seaweed extract whose composition and bioactive components are not fully known furthermore numerous experimental findings showed a biostimulating action also by strobilurins compounds of natural origin commonly used as broad spectrum fungicides the promotion of plant growth by some seaweeds has been known for some time so that their use as organic fertilizers has become widespread craigie 2011 but since the 1950 s the use of whole seaweed has been progressively replaced by extracts of different species of seaweeds du jardin 2015 seaweed extracts contain inorganic and organic substances in varying quantities depending mainly on the seaweed species and the extraction method among the inorganic substances there are n p k ca fe mg zn na and s organic compounds include amino acids osmolytes e g mannitol betaines and betaine analogues secondary bioactive metabolites vitamins and vitamin precursors polysaccharides phenols phytohormones e g auxins cytokinins gibberellins abscisic acid acid acetic indole polyamines and brassinosteroids boukhari 2020 therefore the biological activity of the extracts can differ considerably in relation to the starting raw material and the extraction process khairy and el shafay 2013 kim 2012 puglisi et al 2020 however it is difficult to interpret the results obtained following of the use of these products and the attribution of any effects to one or the other of the components present in the extract boukhari et al 2020 there are numerous experimental findings that demonstrate a complementary biostimulating action of strobiluins at a metabolic and physiological level on different species which often leads to an improvement in yield and quality amaro et al 2020 boari et al 2019 candido et al 2020 schiattone et al 2021 strobilurins are substances of natural origin from which various structural variants have been synthesized e g azoxystrobin kresoxim methyl pyraclostrobin they are used in agriculture as fungicides and their spreading has been favored by their low toxicity to humans and the environment in nature these substances are produced by some basidiomycetes fungi e g oudemansiella mucida schrad ex fr hoehn and strobilurus tenacellus pers ex fr singer which cause the wood rot of some tree species balba 2007 bartlett et al 2002 in addition to the fungicidal action the application of strobilurins seems to lead to the increase in abscisic acid aba and some enzymes involved in oxidative stress as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod ascorbate peroxidase apx catalase cat boari et al 2019 liang et al 2018 lopes et al 2018 which can therefore positively influence assimilation rate transpiration stomatal conductance and water use efficiency wue cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2018 furthermore a positive action has been demonstrated on cell proliferation van dingenen et al 2017 n metabolism and n no3 accumulation probably due to the stimulating action of nitrate reductase activity amaro et al 2018 2020 joshi et al 2014 as observed on lettuce and spinach treated with azoxystrobin bonasia et al 2013 on which an increase in chlorophyll vitamin c and phenolic compounds was observed conversa et al 2014 in literature there are little experimental findings on the effects of biostimulants such as strobilurins and seaweed extracts on wild rocket therefore a study was carried out to verify the combined effect of water regime nitrogen level and two biostimulants azoxystrobin and seaweed extract on the performance of wild rocket during two growing cycles in particular this study reports the effects on some physiological parameters related to gas exchange and biochemical aspects chlorophyll content and some antioxidant enzymes strictly connected to the agronomic variables this knowledge can be of great use to optimize the application of resources and to improve the production performance of wild rocket while reducing the environmental impact of its cultivation 2 material and methods 2 1 characteristics of the experimental site the research was carried out at the mediterranean agronomic institute ciheam of bari italy 41 03 n 16 52 e 72 m a s l during the autumn winter 2016 2017 15 november 17 genuary and 18 genuary 28 february two crop cycles were carried out in an unheated greenhouse covered with ethylene vinyl acetate eva film 200 µm in thickness this area is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate the experiment was carried out using cylindrical pots 0 34 m in diameter and 0 3 m in height suitably equipped with saucers each containing 20 dm3 of soil type lithic ruptic inceptic haploxeralfs usda 2006 of good fertility taken in the same locality the soil of the most superficial layer 0 5 cm was mixed with perlite soil perlite ratio 5 1 v v to prevent compactation by irrigation water 2 2 climatic trend two growing cycles of wild rocket were characterized by daily minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperatures which fluctuated respectively between 2 1 and 16 9 c and between 1 4 and 23 5 c in particular during the first crop cycle in the first decade of january very low temperatures occurred with values of tmin for several days below 0 c and tmax that in the same days did not exceed 5 5 c during the second crop cycle tmax increased progressively until harvest oscillating around 16 c while tmin remained around 7 c data not shown the solar global radiation rg showed a steady trend around of 7 5 mj m 2 d 1 from transplantation until the end of january subsequently the trend of this parameter has been increasing up to about 14 mj m 2 d 1 in the days preceding the last collection data not shown 2 3 treatments experimental layout and crop management the following three experimental

azo and sw in addition to a untreated control c the experimental layout was a split split plot with three replications arranging wr in the main plots nl in the plots and bs in the sub plots each consisting of one pot fertilization was carried out as follows 3 34 and 1 25 g pot 1 of p2o5 19 superphosphate and k2o 51 potassium sulphate corresponding respectively to 70 kg ha 1 of both nutrients distributed before transplantation in all treatments and then buried at a depth of 5 10 cm furthermore treatments n75 and n150 were fertilized respectively with 1 73 and 3 46 g pot 1 of ammonium sulphate 21 40 and 80 kg ha 1 of n before transplantation and with 1 51 and 3 02 g pot 1 of the same fertilizer 35 and 70 kg ha 1 of n just after the first harvest weeds were manually eliminated a few days after emergence to avoid competition with wild rocket plants the transplant of wild rocket was performed on november 15th 2016 using seedlings at the 5th true leaf stage prepared in the nursery in 228 hole polystyrene alveolate trays in each pot 5 tufts of 3 seedlings each have been transplanted suitably spaced ortiva 1 5 ml l 1 and bioproject sm23 foliar 1 5 ml l 1 were sprayed 20 50 84 and 94 days after transplant dat for the pest and disease control only one insecticide confidor 200 sl bayer cropscience s r l italy containing imidacloprid 17 1 application was necessary to fight an initial attack of aphids myzus persicae during the first crop cycle evapotranspiration et was measured by the water balance method by weighing the pots every 4 5 days which were considered to be weighing lysimeters schiattone et al 2017 to meet the water needs of the wild rocket the water having an electrical conductivity of 0 5 ds m 1 was manually distributed on the surface of the pots watering was carried out when 45 of the available water aw ran out in the wr 100 treatment based on the threshold value p 45 of other brassicaceae allen et al 1998 any percolation water was collected in the saucers which was subsequently weighed and used for the subsequent watering of the same pot in order to recover any loss of nutrients due to leaching two crop cycles were carried out with

content was measured by a non destructive method using a chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta ramsey nj which provides the chl content in arbitrary units spad units for each pot the measurements were performed on three young fully expanded leaves randomly selected for each of five plants attributing to each pot the average value of fifteen leaves 4 gas exchange gas exchanges co2 assimilation rate a transpiration t stomatal conductance gs internal co2 concentration ci were measured using a portable li 6400 open system photosynthesis meter li cor lincoln nebraska usa with the light intensity of the leaf chamber parin provided by a red light diode source on the upper surface of the leaf set at 1800 µmol photon m 2 s 1 and the concentration of co2 provided by a reservoir of external co2 set at 400 μmol mol 1 intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated as a gs ratio measurements were made from 11 00 13 30 of two days 61 and 104 dat differing mainly in air temperature vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil water deficit in wr 50 treatment on each measurement date two apical leaves of two plants per pot were chosen fully expanded and well exposed to light the order followed for the measures of different treatments was completely random each measurement lasted about 2 5 min the measurements were performed under the following mean climatic conditions in the greenhouse par 861 μmol m 2 s 1 61 dat and 965 μmol m 2 s 1 104 dat air temperature 12 4 c 61 dat and 22 5 c 104 dat vapor pressure deficit vpd 1 5 61 dat and 2 8 kpa 104 dat furthermore in the same days the average water depletion wd in the soil was the following wd equal to about 20 of aw for wr 100 50 61 dat and 90 104 dat of aw for wr 50 4 1 antioxidant enzyme assay and protein determination at each harvest time the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod ascorbate peroxidase apx and catalase cat was determined a homogeneous sample of mature and healthy leaves was taken from each pot immediately closed in a black plastic bag and placed in a portable refrigerator at a temperature of 4 c the samples were then transported to the laboratory and analysed within two hours for the enzymes extraction 1 g of plant material was randomly taken from the main sample and homogenized in a cold mortar with 1 ml of specific buffer for sod 50 mm k phosphate ph 7 1 triton x 100 7 mm 2 mercaptoethanol for pod 100 mm na phosphate ph 7 3 for apx 100 mm na phosphate ph 7 containing 5 mm ascorbate and 1 mm edta for cat 50 mm k phosphate ph 7 1 pvp the homogenates were centrifuged 14 000 g 10 min 4 c and the resultant supernatants were collected to evaluate the enzyme activities for each enzyme three replicates were performed the enzymatic activities of sod pod apx and cat were assessed as previously described by sergio et al 2012 protein content was measured according to bradford 1976 using bsa as a standard 5 statistical analysis the datasets were tested according to the basic assumptions of analysis of variance anova the normal distribution of the experimental error was verified by shapiro wilk test while the common variance of the experimental error by bartlett s test the data collected in each crop cycle were subjected to the anova according to the split split plot experimental design with three replicates using the spss 17 software a three way anova procedure was performed considering all the factors as fixed while the replicates as random mean values were separated with the student newman keuls snk test p 0 05 6 results 6 1 leaf chlorophyll content the chlorophyll content determined with the spad did not show significant variations between the irrigation regimes during the trial while it differed among n levels and the biostimulant treatments fig 1 in general the trend of the spad index was increasing during each growing cycle with values that on average went from about 35 in mid december to about 50 at the first harvest and from 42 in the first ten days of february to about 49 to the second harvest fig 1 in terms of nl n1 and n2 presented values of 14 3 and 20 5 higher than n0 fig 1b respectively sw and azo resulted in an increase in the spad index of 6 1 and 9 1 respectively fig 1c in particular for sw the increase was more significant in january in the period preceding the harvest while during the second crop cycle the differences in respect to the control gradually decreased until they disappeared near the harvest also in the case of azo the most significant differences with respect to the control were detected in 15 days preceding the first harvest 6 2 gas exchange the gas exchanges of the wild rocket were measured in two representative days 61 dat and 104 dat which differed in the soil water deficit level in wr 100 on both days the water reserve was within the readily available water corresponding to deficit of about 20 of total available water taw however in wr 50 water deficit was equal to 50 and 90 of taw on 61 dat and 104 dat respectively overall different water deficit levels observed for the treatments influenced the parameters describing the gas exchange of wild rocket table 1 the lower water availability of wr 50 in respect to wr 100 caused a reduction of a t and gs by 11 1 25 6 and 23 9 and by 51 8 52 5 and 55 6 respectively on 61 and 104 dat which corresponded to a decrease in ci above all on 104 dat table 1 the a increased by 23 3 and 10 5 from n0 to n75 on 61 and 104 dat respectively while no further increase was found with the highest nl transpiration rised by 11 4 from n0 to n75 on both dates of measurement a further increase of nitrogen dose n150 caused a slight increase of a on 61 dat while on 104 dat this parameter was reduced by 6 8 the gs trend in relation to the nl was opposite for two dates of measurement the gs rised with the increase of nl on 61 dat whereas it was reduced on 104 dat the ci did not show variations in relation to nl on 61 dat while it decreased with the increase of nl on 104 dat the increase of nl exacerbated the negative effect of the water deficit on a and t wr x nl interaction fig 2 especially on 104 dat when water deficient plants have experienced longer and more severe water stress azo and sw on average increased a by 15 0 and 7 9 respectively furthermore azo reduced t by 10 6 on 104 dat and gs by 20 0 and 6 7 on 61 and 104 dat respectively the values of wuei varied significantly in relation to the compared treatments table 1 fig 3 when in wr 50 the water deficit was lower wd 50 of aw on 61 dat a 16 9 increase in wuei was recorded compared to wr 100 while under more severe water stress wd 90 of aw on 104 dat the positive effect of the water deficit on this parameter was smaller table 1 in addition the wuei increased progressively with the increase of nl the azo and sw resulted in an average increase of 15 0 and 33 1 in wuei respectively the increase of the latter parameter after the sprying of sw occurred mainly in conditions of water deficit wr x bs interaction fig 3 6 3 antioxidant enzymes sod pod apx cat four examined enzymes were affected to a different extent by the treatments fig 4 the enzymes were significantly affected by different wate regimes in particular their concentration was higher in wr 50 compared to wr 100 by 391 7 sod 374 2 pod 42 1 apx and 137 1 cat as the average of two harvests the nl did not affect any of studied enzymes sw and azo significantly stimulated the production of sod pod apx and cat whose values as the average of two harvests were respectively 395 4 160 5 155 0 and 333 9 and 489 5 112 4 192 9 and 335 9 higher than the control the differences between azo sw and control treatments were significantly more pronounced in conditions of water deficit than under optimal water supply wr x bs interaction fig 5 7 discussion 7 1 leaf chlorophyll content chlorophyll content of wild rocket increased by increasing n level and applying azoxystrobin or seaweed extract based biostimulants the increase in chlorophyll in relation to the rise in nl is consistent with the results obtained on wild rocket candido et al 2020 schiattone et al 2018b lettuce bonasia et al 2013 and spinach conversa et al 2014 as it would expect since nitrogen is one of the main constituents of the pigment taiz and zeiger 2002 the chlorophyll content of wild rocket leaves increased following the application of seaweed extract similarly puglisi et al 2020 reported a considerable increase in chlorophyll in lettuce leaves with the application of extracts of microalgae scenedesmus quadricauda just as the increase of this pigment has also been observed in corn leaves treated with extracts of different species of algae fayzi et al 2020 the increase in chlorophyll following the application of the seaweed extract can be attributed to increased availability of algal nutrients especially nitrogen and magnesium which are fundamental components of chlorophyll forming rahmawati et al 2015 furthermore the increase of chlorophyll content might also be explained by the decrease in degradation of this molecule caused in part by cytokinins and betaines known to be present in seaweed extract jannin et al 2013 balakumbahan and kavitha 2019 our study showed that azoxystrobin significantly increased the leaf chlorophyll content of wild rocket confirming the data of the literature in which it is reported that strobilurin favors the increase of chlorophyll during plant development bonasia et al 2013 liang et al 2018 this is attributable to its effect on the balance of some phytohormones grossmann and retzlaff 1997 in particular strobilurin would reduce the synthesis of ethylene a hormone notoriously involved in the processes of senescence and degradation of chlorophyll abeles et al 1992 on the other hand it would favor the increase of cytokinins involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll in the presence of light sundqvist et al 1980 7 2 gas exchange the compared treatments influenced the gas exchange parameters of wild rocket in particular the reduction in water availability reduced a t and gs which was accompanied by a decrease in ci especially when water stress was severe these results are in agreement with the literature where is widely reported that photosynthesis is among the first physiological processes negatively influenced by the reduction of water availability chaves 1991 it is well documented that under moderate water stress the reduction of a and gs is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in ci on the other hand under strong water stress the reduction of a and gs correspond to relatively higher values of ci wu et al 2008 this indicates that with moderate water stress gs is the main limiting factor of assimilation regardless of any metabolic alteration chaves and oliveira 2004 with strong water stress however the reduction in the mesophyll co2 availability caused by the closure of the stomata is not the main cause of the reduction in a but the reduction in the efficiency of carboxylation is involved rouhi et al 2007 hence in our case it can be deduced that for the wild rocket under water deficit at least in two measurement days 61 and 104 dat the stomatal limitation of photosynthesis prevailed the a increased from n0 to n75 while no further increase was found with the higher nl transpiration did not change on the first measurement date when the water stress in wr 50 was lower while on the second date this parameter decreased with the highest nl the trend of gs in relation to the nl was opposite in the two measurement dates in particular this parameter has shown the tendency to increase with the rise of nl 61 dat and then to diminish 104 dat on 61 dat the ci did not show variations in relation to the nl while on 104 dat it decreased with the increase in nl the increase in nl accentuated the negative effect of water limitation on a and t especially when the water stress to which the wr 50 treatment plants were subjected persisted for longer period and when it was more severe also wu et al 2008 reported that the response to water deficit of the parameters relating to gas exchanges is different in relation to n availability these authors observed that under optimal water supply a and gs were higher with high n levels on the other hand in conditions of water deficit the a of plants subjected to a high n intake was inhibited while no significant n effects on gs were observed the sw increased a schiattone et al 2018a this can be associated with the increase of leaf chlorophyll content as obtained in our research which confirms the findings of other authors fan et al 2013 jannin et al 2013 azo resulted in the increase of a which can be attributed to the combined effect of the rise in the leaf chlorophyll content and the improvement of the water status of the plant determined by the reduction of gs with regard to the gs control and therefore of the plant water status this aspect was not very evident in our study it might be explained by better physiological conditions of the plants treated with azoxystrobin which presented a greater stomatal opening experimental evidence in this sense was obtained on tomatoes treated with azoxystrobin giuliani et al 2011 or pyraclostrobin boari et al 2019 cantore et al 2016 in fact these authors observed that the application of strobilurin based products improved the plant water status and gas exchange these considerations are also supported by the findings of other authors who argue that strobilurins positively influence the endogenous concentration of aba which would help inhibit stomatal opening improving the water use especially when the plant is in water deficit conditions venancio et al 2003 in addition grossmann and retzlaff 1997 stated that strobilurins causes decreased respiration and consequently the change of the co2 compensation point and co2 net assimilation increase a limited water deficit led to an increase in wuei while with a more severe water deficit this effect was lower in fact in the presence of low water stress a small reduction in gs can have protective effects against stress allowing the plant to save water and consequently to improve the water use efficiency chaves et al 2009 the wuei increased progressively with the increase in nl many studies have well documented the photosynthetic response of the plant to the n availability and some of these highlighted the existence of a positive correlation between the photosynthetic capacity and the leaf nitrogen content suggesting that most of the nitrogen is used for the synthesis of compounds of the photosynthetic apparatus damatta et al 2002 makoto and koike 2007 such as chlorophyll maheswari et al 2008 both the lack of water and the increase in the n availability promote an increase in wuei in accordance with the results of yin et al 2006 and with the general theory that the limiting supply of a resource can improve the efficiency of use of other resources wu et al 2008 the sw increased wuei as a consequence of the increase in a without significant changes in t the increase in wuei after application of sw occurred mainly in conditions of water limitations confirming what is reported in the literature on the presence of osmotically active components in algae extract blunden et al 2009 mackinnon et al 2010 which can alleviate some abiotic stress such as water stress battacharyya et al 2015 neily et al 2008 the azo increased wuei this can be attributed to the combined effect of the increase in the leaf chlorophyll content and the improvement of the plant water status determined by the reduction of gs bonasia et al 2013 liang et al 2018 7 3 antioxidant enzymes sod pod apx cat the water deficit caused a significant increase in the enzymes involved in oxidative stress that were examined sod pod apx and cat these results agree with the literature in which the enzymatic response of plant to different biotic and abiotic stress is widely reported including water stress abd el baky et al 2016 sergio et al 2012 sofo et al 2005 in fact plants subject to water deficit undergo excessive reducing power due to the reduction of co2 assimilation which causes the increase in the levels of activated oxygen species ros and the accumulation of free radicals if the accumulation of ros exceeds the ability of the antioxidant system to remove them then the peroxidation of membrane lipids arises the destruction of photosynthetic pigments the inactivation of the enzymes involved in the reactions of co2 fixation and finally cell death møller 2001 sairam and tyagi 2004 the enzymatic defense system to eliminate ros adopted by plants includes sods which catalyze the conversion of superoxide into h2o2 together with cat pods and apx which eliminate the h2o2 produced sofo et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 the application of the seaweed based biostimulant resulted in a significant increase in four enzymes examined in both wr however to a greater extent in the presence of water stress the beneficial effects of seaweed exstracts on water stressed plants through the control of antioxidant enzymes are reported hasanuzzaman et al 2021 this result agrees with the observations of other authors on different species such as potato wheat and soybean treated with seaweed extract and subjected to water shortage abd el baky et al 2008 abd el baky et al 2016 shukla et al 2018 azoxystrobin also stimulated the production of antioxidant enzymes whose concentration in the aerial part of the wild rocket was significantly higher than in the control in the literature experimental findings in this sense were reported on barley crops where the application of pyraclostrobin would have inhibited the manifestation of the physiological leaf spot a physiopathy attributable to oxidative stress the response of barley to pyraclostrobin has been attributed to the doubling of the enzymatic activity of peroxidase köehle et al 2003 cantore et al 2015 reported an increase in sod pod apx and cat in tomato plants treated with pyraclostrobin which would have improved salinity tolerance while liang et al 2018 found a significant increase in the activity of the main antioxidant enzymes following the application of azoxystrobin on ginseng which would have favored the delay of leaf senescence 8 conclusions the interactive effect of irrigation regimes nitrogen level and the application of azoxystrobin fungicide belonging to the strobilurin class and bioproject sm23 foliar biostimulant based on seaweed extracts was studied in order to acquire usefull informations for improving some agricultural techniques irrigation and nitrogen management biostimulant application able to ensure economically viable production levels and high quality characteristics of wild rocket and to increase water use efficiency both azoxystrobin and the brown seaweed extract based biostimulant have proven effective in improving some physiological and biochemical parameters of wild rocket especially in conditions of severe and prolonged water deficit in particular the increase in the leaf chlorophyll content net assimilation and intrinsic water use efficiency was observed in addition both substances have stimulated the biosynthesis of the antioxidant enzymes sod pod apx and cat

9101,in this study a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp method is developed for planning the regional scale water energy food nexus wefn system the ficsp cannot only deal with uncertainties expressed as interval and random parameters but also handle the interdependence among correlated random variables moreover the multilevel factorial analysis embedded in ficsp is able to reflect the main and interactive effects among uncertain parameters the ifccp approach was then applied to planning the wefn system for the city of jinan shandong province china a ficsp wefn model has been established under consideration of various restrictions related to water and land availability food and vegetable demands and other environmental constraints the obtained results indicated that the surface water and groundwater availabilities would be highly correlated with their marginals fitted through the gaussian distribution and their dependence described by the gaussian copula under limited water resources the corn cultivation would be prioritized but the increase of water resources tends to increase the wheat cultivation and reduce corn planting under the advantageous conditions where sufficient water resources are available the additional water resources tend to be allocated to wheat and vegetables whilst corn cultivation would not be changed moreover the surface and recycled water would be first utilized for crop production with the remaining water requirements satisfied by groundwater the results from factorial analysis indicated that the system benefits would be increased under the demanding conditions through increasing the joint risk level and also the violation risk for surface water availability or decreasing the violation risk of groundwater availability nevertheless the increase in the violation risks under the advantageous conditions would not necessarily lead to increased system benefit implying that the crop cultivation patterns may be influenced by other restrictions rather than the water availability in general the developed ficsp method cannot only generate desired management strategies for wefn system under consideration of joint risks but also help track the factors that make dominant impacts on the wefn management practices keywords inexact programming random variables uncertainty water energy food nexus system decision making factorial analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are increasing demands for water energy and food to support socio economic development prosperous population and also decent living standards this is particularly true for some developing countries such as china which leads to an urgent request for efficient management for water energy and food systems however water energy and food systems are highly correlated among each other for instance the irrigation is required for agricultural planting which needs both water resources and energies e g diesel or electricity at the same time the effluents from farming will lead to pollution issues for the water systems consequently management of water energy food nexus wefn system is becoming attractive for administrators academic researchers and other relevant stakeholder liu et al 2015 keskinen et al 2016 shang et al 2018 owen et al 2018 nevertheless there are a number of challenges to develop efficient management strategies for water energy food nexus with various uncertainties being one of the major issues to be addressed there are generally extensive uncertainties in the water energy food nexus system which are embedded in different system components and also present different formats such as fuzzy interval and random variables yu et al 2020a ji et al 2020a b yan et al 2021 these uncertainties would interact among each other intensifying the complexities in managing the wefn system therefore it is desired to develop effective planning and management policies for water energy food nexus under consideration of various uncertainties recently there are amounts of studies to explore efficient management of water food nexus or water energy food nexus for instance salmoral and yan 2018 used the theory of virtual water and embedded energy to explore water and energy allocations in the economic system zhang and vesselinov 2017 developed an integrated model called wefo to address the trade off and support decisions for the nexus management of water energy and food resources moreover there are also some studies to develop inexact optimization approaches to reflect uncertainties in the water and food systems for instance sun et al 2019 developed a possibilistic flexible chance constrained programming approach to explore the impacts of irrigation efficiency on agricultural water land nexus system management in amu darya river basin central asia li et al 2019 developed an awefsm agricultural water energy food sustainable management model for the sustainable management of limited water energy food resource in an agricultural system ji et al 2020b proposed a multi stage stochastic fuzzy random programming msfrp model for wefn management under uncertainties for the various uncertainties in the wefn system many parameters are random in nature and some of them are highly correlated such as surface water and groundwater resources the chance constraint programming ccp approaches have been proposed to deal with random parameters in the wefn system for instance ma et al 2020 ever employed the chance constraint to reflect the randomness in water resources for managing the water food ecology nexus system chen et al 2020 used the ccp method to reflect the random electricity demand in planning the energy water environmental nexus through an integrated method however some parameter variables in the wefn system may be correlated among each other such as availabilities of different water resources supplies of water resources and energies and so on these correlated variables can hardly be well reflected through traditional ccp or joint ccp techniques especially when different variables are quantified by different probabilistic distributions the copula based stochastic programming approaches have recently been advanced to deal with the above challenge in which the copula method was adopted to reflect complex dependence structures among correlated variables parameters for instance yu et al 2020a coupled the two level programming and copula for optimizing energy water nexus system management at the henan province in which the correlation between water availability and electricity demand was quantified by the copula method zhang et al 2022 developed a generalized copula based chance constrained programming gcbcp approach to assess the composite risk of the water energy food nexus system among water energy and food shortage even though the copula based approaches are effective to tackle correlated random variables some issues still needs to be addressed i the copula based chance constraints are usually converted into linear constraints before solving the optimization model but such a conversion process has not been well elaborated ii in the copula based stochastic programming approaches there would be different risks including the risk for a single variable and the joint overall risk under consideration of parameter variable correlation but the individual and interactive effects of single and joint risks on the wefn system management have not been addressed consequently this study aims to develop a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp approach to support management of the water energy food nexus system under compound uncertainties the ficsp approach will be proposed through integrating the interval linear programming ilp method copula based stochastic programming fccp method and factorial analysis into a framework to i deal with uncertainties presented in interval and random formats ii tackle complex dependence among random variables parameters and iii investigate the individual and interactive effects of different risks the ficsp method will then be applied for developing management strategies for the water energy food nexus at the city of jinan china to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of the ficsp wefn model management of the water energy food nexus wefn system is complicated in which multiple uncertainties embedded in multiple components need to be well reflected moreover different requirements such as water and energy availabilities food demand and cultivation areas for different crops should be under consideration this implies that the decision maker would not only consider the overall profit of the water energy food nexus system but also balances the contradiction between agricultural production and water and energy availabilities consequently a water energy food nexus wefn model aims to provide support for efficient agricultural activities to achieve maximum system benefits under consideration of various constraints such as water and energy consumptions fertilizer and pesticide utilization in detail the agriculture profits include revenue of crops and the costs for the consumption of various resources e g water energy fertilizer and pesticides in addition the labor cost has not been taken into account therefore the objective of the wefn model can be formulated as 1a max f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 1 revenues of agricultural products 1b f 1 t 1 t v 1 v p a t v u w t v u p t v 2 cost for water supply 1c f 2 t 1 t i 1 i w s r t i w s t i 3 cost for water treatment 1d f 3 t 1 t i 1 i w s c t i w s t i 4 cost for fertilizer utilization 1e f 4 t 1 t v 1 v f c t f u t v p a t v 5 cost for pesticide utilization 1 f f 5 t 1 t v 1 v p c t p u t v p a t v 6 cost for energy consumption 1 g f 6 t 1 t v 1 v u d c t v u d p t u e c t v u e p t p a t v 7 cost for seeds 1 h f 7 t 1 t v 1 v s e d p t v p a t v based on the current situation and future development strategy the wefn model would consider multifaceted and comprehensive constraints e g limited farming areas for different crops water resources and energy availabilities the constraints can help plan the agricultural development alleviate the contradictions among the development of socio economic environmental protection and other aspects which will ultimately realize the sustainable development 1 arable land constraint the planting areas for different crops should be limited due to competitive land utilization among different sectors e g industrial commercial and residential and also requirements of environmental protection which can lead to constraints of cultivation restriction as follows 2a p a t v m i n p a t v p a t v m a x 2b v 1 v p a t v t p a t the minimum and maximum planting areas of crops are bounded in constraint 2a to prevent from remarkable price fluctuations for agricultural products in addition the total planting area cannot exceed the available arable land i e t p a t in planning periods as expressed in constraint 2b 2 food demand constraint the crop yield should satisfy local basic food requirements to guarantee food security firstly the constraint for the cereal demand is formulated as 3a 1 γ v v 1 2 p a t v u w t v λ f d t p t where f d t is cereal demand standard per person kg person at period t p t denotes population size at time period t γ v represents the food loss rate in production transportation and other processes for crop v λ denotes the food self sufficiency rate for the study area since the wheat and corn are the two major cereal crops only these two crops i e v 1 and 2 will be considered in eq 3a in addition the constraint for the vegetable demand can be similarly formulated as 3b 1 η p a t 3 u w t 3 λ v d t p t where η is the loss rate for vegetables production and v d t denotes the vegetable demand per person kg person at period t 3 water resources availability water irrigation is of great importance in the agricultural sector nevertheless the water availability for agricultural irrigation is generally limited for most areas due to increasing water consumption from other sectors consequently the constraint describing water irrigation can be formulated as follows 4a θ v 1 v p a t v i q t v i 1 i w s t i where θ is the reliability of irrigation which indicates the probability that the irrigation quota can be satisfied i q t v denotes the irrigation quota for different crops in different planning periods in addition to the irrigation constraints for different crops the water resource supply should not exceed the maximum available amounts from different water sources 4b pr w s t 1 a v w t 1 p 1 4c pr w s t 2 a v w t 2 p 2 4d c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p 4e w s t 3 a v w t 3 4 energy availability the energy used in food production mainly include the electricity consumption for irrigation and the fossil consumption for machinery operation which can be formulated as follows 5a v 1 v p a t v u e c t v t a e t 5b v 1 v p a t v u d c t v t a d t where u e c t v and u f c t v respectively represents the unit electricity consumption kwh ha and unit fossil consumption kg ha whilst t a e t and t a d t indicate the total availabilities for electricity and fossils allocated to agricultural production 5 restrictions for fertilizers and pesticides due to requirements on pollution control and greenhouse gas emission the utilization of fertilizers and pesticides would also be restricted in the proposed ficsp wefn model which can be formulated as follows 6a v 1 v p a t v f a t v t a f t 6b v 1 v p a t v p a t v t a p t where t a f t and t a p t respectively denotes the total availabilities for fertilizer and pesticide for agricultural production at time period t the proposed ficsp wefn model i e equations 1 6 are formulated through referring relevant studies e g li et al 2019 tang et al 2019 yu et al 2020a the system benefit is to be maximized taking into account for revenues of crop productions as well as costs for water energy and agricultural production conditions singh and panda 2012 miao et al 2014 simić et al 2017 consequently the crop cultivation patterns as well as the corresponding system benefit would be influenced and limited by the synthetic action of productive resources e g water energy food and land zuo et al 2021 thus the integrated consideration for restrictions on energy demand supply water resources supply and arable area availability flood guarantee and other production conditions can form an internal self regulating mechanism and optimize the wef nexus to some extent zhang and vesselinov 2017 zuo et al 2021 specifically even though the agricultural energy demand supply i e eqs 5a and 5b is only considered in the ficsp wefn model these constraints can reflect the impact of energy supply on the crop structure which can further imply whether the current energy consumption pattern such as the ratio of agricultural energy consumption needs to be adjusted the definitions for the variables and parameters used in the proposed wefn model are listed in table 1 in this study all parameters except the availabilities for surface and ground water are presented as intervals which would reflect uncertainties in future conditions such as crop price the interval parameters in the proposed wefn model are mainly used since it is easier to specify the boundaries of an interval parameter based on limited data availabilities moreover the groundwater and surface water availabilities are considered as random variables because i they are generally random in nature due to the main effect from local weather conditions and ii sufficient samples can be obtained through the local statistical yearbooks to quantify the probabilistic features for these two parameters it is straightforward that these two parameters are highly correlated which can be quantified by the copula method in addition to further explore the impact of parameter uncertainties on the resulting management strategies for the wefn system the factorial analysis method will be introduced into the proposed wefn model to reveal both individual and interactive effects from parameter uncertainties therefore a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp approach will be proposed for solving the above wefn model 2 2 solution process of the ficsp method the proposed ficsp integrates the interval mathematical programming imp joint chance constraint programming jccp and factorial analysis into a framework in detail the interval copula stochastic programming icsp approach would be first formulated based on imp jccp and copula functions to deal with interval and also correlated random parameters which is expressed as 7a m a x f j 1 n c j x j subject to 7b j 1 n a i j x j b i i 1 2 s 7c j 1 n a i j x j b i p i ω i s 1 m 7d c 1 p s 1 1 p s 2 1 p m 1 p 7e x j 0 in model 7 constraints 7b and 7c are generated through introduce the copula function c into the joint chance constraint pr j 1 n a i j x j b i ω i s 1 m 1 p to describe the dependence among random parameters b i ω b i p i ω f i 1 p i and f i 1 p i is the inverse of the cumulative probability function cdf for the random variable b i ω under a cdf value of p i a i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n b i i 1 2 s and c j are interval parameters presented in a general form as t t t t any t r x j are the decision variables to be generated in model 7 which can also be expressed as intervals in the icsp method the copula function is adopted to quantify the dependence among correlated random parameters and further convert the joint chance constraint into equivalent linear constraints the copula function c is able to join or couple one dimensional marginal distribution functions to a multivariate distribution function for the correlated random variables take two correlated random variables x 1 and x 2 as an example the joint probability distribution can be formulated through the copula function and their marginals as follows nelsen 2006 8 f x 1 x 2 c u 1 u 2 where c is the copula function u 1 u 2 0 1 u 1 f 1 x 1 and u 2 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 are the marginal distributions for the random variables x 1 and x 2 there are a number of copula functions applied in water and environmental studies favre et al 2004 bárdossy and hörning 2016 huang and fan 2021 fan et al 2020a b which are mainly classified into four categories archimedean extreme value elliptical and other miscellaneous families wong et al 2010 kong et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the proposed icsp approach can be solved through an interactive solution algorithm in which two submodels with deterministic coefficients are formulated respectively corresponding the lower and upper bounds of the objective function huang 1998 fan et al 2009 2012 li et al 2015 yu et al 2018 in detail the submodel for the upper bound of the objective corresponds to the optimistic advantageous conditions which is formulated as follows 9a max f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j subject to 9b j 1 k a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i i 1 2 s 9c j 1 k a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i p i i s 1 m 9d c 1 p s 1 1 p s 2 1 p m 1 p 9e x j 0 where c j 0 for j 1 2 k and c j 0 for j k 1 n p 0 1 is the overall risk for constraint violation whilst p i 0 1 is the violation risk for constraint i similar to the optimistic model the pessimistic submodel can be formulated as 10a max f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j subject to 10b j 1 k a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i i 1 2 s 10c j 1 k a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i p i i s 1 m 10d c 1 p s 1 1 p s 2 1 p m 1 p 10e 0 x j x j o p t j 1 2 k 10 f x j x j o p t j k 1 k 2 n where x j o p t j 1 2 k and x j o p t j k 1 n are the solutions obtained from the optimistic submodel i e model 9 based on submodels 9 and 10 the interval solutions for model 7 can be obtained as 11a f o p t f o p t f o p t 11b x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t since parameters in model 7 are presented either in intervals or probabilistic distributions it is desired to explore how both the individual and interactive effects of parameter uncertainties on the resulting solutions consequently a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp will be developed to integrate the icsp method into the factorial analysis framework to address the above issue factorial analysis is widely used to quantify the effect of uncertain parameters to reveal the hidden interrelationships and thereby provide decision makers with a comprehensive understanding regarding the effect of the variation of uncertain parameters on the responses of the model zhao et al 2022 in factorial analysis an experimental design is employed to account for all combinations of the levels of factors to help visualize the single effects of factors with discrete values or levels and their interactive effects on a response variable fan et al 2020b consider a system which has two factors a and b with each factor respectively having i and j levels the statistical effect from those two factors can be expressed as 12 y i j k μ α i β j α β i j ε i j k i 1 2 i j 1 2 j k 1 2 k where μ denotes the overall mean effect α i β j respectively indicate the main effect for factor a at the ith level and factor b at the jth level α β i j indicates the interaction between factors a and b ε ijk means the random error component the variability in y can be decomposed into its component parts as follows 13a s s t s s a s s b s s a b s s e and 13b s s t i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k y i j k 2 y

component the factors contribution is calculated as the ratio of the summation of their squares to the total summation of squares through integrating the icsp model into the factorial analysis framework the proposed ficsp model can be solved through the following steps step 1 formulate the icsp model presented in model 7 step 2 for the factors to be analyzed build their factorial design matrix with specified levels for each factor step 3 for each row in the factorial design matrix formulate the lower and upper bound submodels for model 7 here the factors to be addressed in factorial analysis would be considered as deterministic parameters and choose their specified values in the factorial design matrix step 4 specify the violation risk of p as well as m s 1 values of p i generate the last p i through solving eqs 9d and 10d step 5 solve the two submodels to get the corresponding solutions of f o p t f o p t f o p t and x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t step 6 repeat steps 3 5 for all the rows in the factorial design matrix and generate corresponding solutions step 7 calculate the total sum of squares and its components through equations 13 based on the lower and upper bounds of objective functions obtained through steps 3 6 step 8 calculate the main effects and their interactions of the addressed factors respectively on the lower and upper bounds of the model objective 3 case study 3 1 overview of the studied area the proposed ficsp approach will be applied for system management practices for the water energy food nexus at the city of jinan shandong province as the capital of shandong province the city of jinan is located in the central part of the province after merging the city of laiwu in 2019 the city of jinan is now covering an area of 10244 km2 and having a population of 8 90 million the gross domestic product gdp more than one thousand billion rmb with the growth rate of 7 4 in 2020 which is the second largest city of shandong jinan is experiencing prosperous growth for both population and economy leading to increasing demand for water and food there are several crops planted in the city of jinan such as wheat rice corn beans cottons vegetable and so on however wheat corn and vegetables are the three major crops planted in jinan for instance the sown areas for wheat corn and vegetables were 2 16 106 2 11 106 and 0 89 106 ha respectively making a respective contribution of 38 37 and 15 to the total sown area the total water demand is about 1 96 109 m3 in 2019 in which water demands for agricultural industrial municipal and environmental sectors are respectively 8 24 108 2 95 108 3 59 108 and 2 51 108 m3 shandong water department 2019 the water supply for jinan mainly come from surface water groundwater and recycled water in 2019 these three water sources contributed about 11 64 108 6 44 108 and 1 52 108 m3 to the total water supply shandong water department 2019 nevertheless the total water availability is limited especially for agriculture in the city of jinan due to uneven precipitation competitive water demands from other sectors such as environmental protection whilst there is an increasing demand for food supply as the enhancement of life standard moreover the increasing energy consumption especially after 2019 also implied remarkable deficits and serious competition for energy consumption between agricultural production and other sectors nie et al 2021 xu et al 2022 consequently it is desirable to develop effective management strategies for the water energy food nexus system at the city of jinan 3 2 data collection the whole planning horizon covers the next three years 2022 2026 which also assumed to have five planning periods many parameters are required in development the management strategies for the water energy food nexus system at the city of jinan such as demands for food and vegetables limits for sown areas of different plants water availability from different sources these data are collected from both provincial http tjj shandong gov cn col col6279 index html and local http jntj jinan gov cn col col27523 index html statistic yearbooks and also some relevant literatures ji et al 2020b ma et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 mei et al 2021 xu et al 2022 table 2 presents the agriculture related parameters including the unit products for different crops in different planning periods and the sown area limits for different crops obtained from the jinan statistical yearbook http jntj jinan gov cn col col27523 index html the prices of agricultural products fertilizers and pesticides as well as the unit utilization of fertilizer and pesticide for different crops are obtained from the cost benefit analysis of agricultural products national development and reform commission 2018 2019 the irrigation quotas as well as the corresponding reliabilities of irrigation for different crops are obtained from the local irrigation policy no db37 t 3772 2019 released by the shandong water resources department the costs for water supply and water treatment as presented in table 3 are adopted from relevant studies e g ji et al 2020b the water availability for different sources is dealt with different approaches the availabilities of surface water and groundwater are mainly affected by the weather conditions which are random in nature moreover the groundwater and surface water availabilities are highly correlated consequently the copula model would be adopted to reflect the probabilistic features of surface and ground water availabilities and their interdependence in comparison the recycled water would be generally controlled by technical and regulation factors and thus its availability is projected though regression methods based on historical water supplies from recycled water from 2011 to 2018 shandong water resources department 2019 the future demands for wheat and corn as well as the vegetables are presented in table 4 these parameters are adopted from the projections from china agricultural outlook 2020 2029 mara 2020 in table 4 the demands for wheat and corns consists of those directly applied for food production and also those indirectly used such as wheat or corns used for fodder for livestock 4 result analysis 4 1 dependence between groundwater and surface water availabilities since the availabilities of surface water and groundwater are generally random in nature their probabilistic features are quantified through some parametric distributions based on the historical data from 2000 to 2019 in this study the gamma pearson type iii i e p3 normal and lognormal distributions are employed to quantify the randomness for the surface water and groundwater availabilities fig 2 shows the comparison between the empirical cumulative probabilities and theoretical values obtained through the fitted distributions the results indicate that all the fitted distributions are agree well with the empirical probabilities which indicates that all the four distributions are applicable to characterize the probabilistic features for the surface water and groundwater availabilities to further evaluate the performances of the four distributions goodness of fit tests are performed through the anderson darling ad test root mean square error rmse and the akaike information criterion aic the detailed procedures for those three goodness of fit tests can be found in some literatures e g gabriel and fan 2022 table 5 presents the results for the goodness of fit tests the results suggest that all the distributions can pass the ad test which indicates their applicability for modelling the distributions of surface water and groundwater availabilities nevertheless based on the results of rmse and aic the normal distribution would perform best in describing the probabilistic features for both surface water and groundwater availabilities consequently the normal distribution would be adopted in this study to quantify the randomness for the two water availabilities the availabilities of surface water and groundwater are generally correlated among each other based on the historical data from 2000 to 2019 these two water resources have a pearson correlation of 0 78 and kendall s τ of 0 64 implying the high dependence between these two water availabilities consequently it is required to consider both the single and joint probabilistic features in developing the management strategies of water energy food nexus at the city of jinan the normal distribution has been demonstrated to best quantify the randomness for both water resources whilst the dependence between these two variables would be quantified through the copula method in this study the gaussian student t gumbel frank and joe copulas are adopted to quantify the dependence between surface water and groundwater availabilities with their detailed expressions and properties being referred to previous studies nelsen 2006 also the performances of different copulas are evaluated through the cramér von mises cvm test e g genest et al 2009 rmse and aic gabriel and fan 2022 table 6 shows the results of goodness of fit through different evaluation methods the results indicate that all the selected copulas are statistically applicable to model the dependence between surface water and groundwater availabilities with the p value of cvm test higher than 0 05 however the lowest rmse and aic values from the gaussian copula suggest the kind of copula function would be the best one to modeling the joint probabilistic features for these two water resource variables also the joint cdf function of surface water and groundwater availabilities based on the gaussian copula are presented fig 3 indicating the dependent probabilistic features between these two variables 4 2 solutions under a joint violation risk level of 0 1 through the developed ficsp wefn model the cultivation structures and water supply patterns can be generated under different single and joint risk levels in detail the risk level p in eq 4d represents the overall violation risk that the irrigation water needs cannot be satisfied by either the surface water or groundwater resources the risk level p 1 in eq 4b indicates with a predefined overall violation risk i e p in eq 4d the probability that the surface water supply for agricultural irrigation cannot be satisfied whilst p 2 in eq 4c represents the probability that the groundwater supply is not satisfied the overall risk level p can be predefined by the decision maker in this study p 0 1 is primarily specified through referring relevant studies yu et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 this means that the decision maker wants to ensure the surface and ground water supplies to irrigation can be satisfied with a probability of 90 such a risk level also implies that even for some drought conditions with relatively less water availabilities the obtained cultivation pattern would still be feasible when the joint violation risk level is set to be 0 1 i e p 0 1 there would be different options to specify the associated violation risk levels for surface water i e p 1 and groundwater i e p 2 availabilities i specify the risk level of groundwater availability and solve eq 4d to generate the risk level for surface water availability ii predefine the risk level for surface water and solve eq 4d to obtain the risk level for groundwater in this study both of these two options would be considered with the overall risk of 0 1 and the predefined risk of either groundwater or surface water being 0 09 0 07 0 05 table 7 presents the scenarios of risk levels of surface water and groundwater under an overall risk of 0 1 it can be concluded that for a specified joint risk level there would be different risk levels for individual constraints also due to the different risk levels for groundwater and surface water constraints there would be different availabilities for these two water resources and also the total water resources as presented in table 8 with different joint and single risk levels the proposed ficsp wefn model is to be converted to two submodels corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of the objective function based on the process described through submodels 9 and 10 each submodel is a linear programming model which is solved by lingo in this study with a computation time about 3 s table 9 presents the cultivation pattern and also water allocations under an overall risk level of 0 1 the results indicate that for the specified overall risk level there would be distinguishable crop planting structures and water allocation schemes under different combinations of single risk levels also under each risk combination the planting areas for different crops would vary in different planning periods due to the socioeconomic and environmental restrictions as well as the water resource availabilities under the risk scenario of p 0 1 overall risk p 1 0 035 surface water p 2 0 09 groundwater the planting area for corn would be 1 784 105 ha in period 1 and 2 318 105 ha in period 5 with an increasing rate of 30 under the demanding conditions in comparison cultivation area for wheat would be 1 89 10 5 ha for all the planning periods which is the upper bound of the minimum planting limit the results imply that with strict restrictions e g water resource availabilities the corn seems to be prioritized between corn and wheat in the planting structure to satisfy the cereal demand from local population more specifically as the cereal demand increases these demands would also be satisfied by corn and thus lead to an increasing trend for corn cultivation over the planning horizon in addition the cultivation area for vegetables would slightly increase from 0 921 1 204 105 ha in period 1 to 1 003 1 204 105 ha in period 5 with an increasing rate of 8 9 for the lower bound the increasing trend for vegetable cultivation under the demanding conditions i e lower bound may also be attributed to the increasing vegetable demand over the planning horizon however under the advantageous conditions where relative loose restrictions e g upper bound of water availability are adopted these additional resources tend to be allocated to wheat and vegetables whilst the corn cultivation would not be changed for instance with more resources available the upper bound of wheat and vegetable cultivation would respectively increase to 2 553 105 ha and 1 204 105 ha this may be due to the relative high benefits generated wheat and vegetable cultivation and thus additional resources would be allocated to these two crops in terms of water resource allocation the results in table 9 indicate that the surface water and recycled water would be used for agricultural irrigation with deterministic water allocations for these two water resources under both advantageous and demanding conditions for instance the water allocation amount from surface water would be 2 495 108 m3 for all the five planning periods under the risk scenarios of p 0 1 p 1 0 035 and p 2 0 09 whilst the water allocation amount would reach the lower bound of recycled water availability at each time period this may be due to the relative lower cost in water supply and water treatment for surface and recycled water in addition the remaining irrigation water requirement would be satisfied by the groundwater resource specifically under the advantageous conditions i e the upper bound of the objective function all groundwater resources i e 5 691 108 m3 would be utilized for agricultural production in the studied area this implies that under this risk scenario p 0 1 p 1 0 035 and p 2 0 09 the water availabilities would be a key factor to influence the crop cultivation structures in the studied area as indicated in table 7 there would be different risk levels for groundwater and surface water availabilities that satisfy the overall risk level of 0 1 under different single risk levels there are varied water availabilities from surface water and groundwater resources as presented in table 8 table 9 and fig 4 present the crop cultivation structures at the studied region over the planning horizon under different single risk combinations with an overall risk level of 0 1 it is apparent that different planting schemes especially for wheat and corn would be generally obtained from the ficsp wefn model with a predefined overall risk of 0 1 this is due to the different combinations of single risk level for surface water and groundwater availabilities under such an overall risk level for instance figs 4 a and 4 b show the crop cultivation patterns where the violation risk for surface water increases from 0 035 to 0 064 and the risk for groundwater decreases from 0 09 to 0 07 the results indicate that the corn cultivation tends to increase under both demanding and advantageous conditions while the planting area of wheat would keep consistency under demanding conditions but decrease under advantageous conditions over the planning horizon as shown in fig 4 a in comparison the planting area for corn would slightly decrease in the first four periods with minor increase for wheat cultivation as the same time as shown in fig 4 b the main reason for the differences of cultivation pattern between these two scenarios is due to the different water availabilities in these two scenarios similar features presented in fig 4 b can also be observed in figs 4 c 4 e where a decreasing trend for corn cultivation would be observed in the former planning periods whilst increase in wheat cultivation may occur at the same time the water allocation patterns from different water resources under different risk scenarios are presented in table 9 and fig 5 under advantageous and demanding conditions the water allocation patterns from different water resources under different risk scenarios are presented in table 9 and fig 5 under advantageous and demanding conditions deterministic water supplies are obtained for recycled and surface water resources for all six scenarios except some latter time periods in scenarios c and d these results indicate that the surface and recycled water would be utilized for crop production firstly in both demanding and advantageous conditions in comparison for groundwater it can be observed that there are significant fluctuation ranges between the lower and upper bounds of groundwater allocation a decreasing trend for would be generally observed for the lower bounds of groundwater supplies as presented in fig 5 specifically for some risk scenarios e g figs 5 c and 5 d the lower bounds of groundwater supply seem to be invisible which suggests that the water supplies from surface and recycled water can satisfy all water requirements for crop production fig 6 shows the total system benefits from the wefn model i e equations 11 16 under different risk scenarios listed in table 8 the results indicate that under a predefined overall system risk the variations in the single violation levels for surface water or groundwater availabilities would also influence the system benefits from the wefn model in general under the demanding conditions which corresponds to the lower bound of the objective function the variation trend in the system benefits would be consistent with the total water availabilities from surface water and groundwater for instance the lower bound of the system benefit would increase from scenario a i e rmb 7 017 1010 to scenario c i e rmb 7 303 1010 and then decrease from scenarios c to f correspondingly the total availability from surface water and groundwater as presented in table 8 also shows the same variation trend i e increase from a to c and then decrease from c to d with the trend in the lower bound of the system benefit this means that under the demanding conditions the water availability may be the critical factor that influence the crop planting patterns in the studied area however under the advantageous conditions where more water would be available the system benefit i e upper bound present a different variation trend from the trend in water availabilities for instance the highest system benefit under the advantageous conditions would be obtained at scenario a i e rmb 9 477 1010 whilst the availability from surface water and groundwater would be lowest i e 8 186 108 m3 in this scenario this implies that in addition to water availability the crop cultivation patterns may also be influenced by other restrictions which can also be concluded from the results in table 9 4 3 impacts of single and joint risks as elaborated in section 4 2 the variation in single violation risks in surface water and groundwater availabilities would influence the crop planting structures and also the resulting benefits from the wefn model however it is unclear that whether the joint overall risk level i e p in eq 4d would also influence the crop planting patterns and how the effects of single and joint risks would pose on the benefits of the wefn system to address the above challenges a factorial analysis was introduced into the ficsp wefn model to explore the individual and interactive effects of the single and joint risks in detail three levels are assigned respectively to the single and joint violation risks in which the three levels of 0 05 0 07 0 09 are given to the single violation risk for either surface water or groundwater availabilities and the three levels of 0 1 0 12 and 0 14 are set the overall joint violation risk moreover for the three risk levels i e p 1 for surface water availability p 2 for groundwater availability and p for the joint risk level presented in eqs 4b 4d the joint risk level p as well as one single risk level p 1 or p 2 can be predefined by decision makers with the other single risk level needs to be derived based on the copula function presented in eq 4d consequently two cases would be designed to reveal the effects of single and joint risk levels on the management strategies of wefn system at the studied region case 1 would consider the joint risk i e p and the risk of groundwater availability i e p 2 as the studied factors whilst case 2 would include p and p 1 as the studied factors in the factorial analysis table 10 present the design matrices for these two cases in the factorial analysis moreover for each case two responses will be considered including the lower and upper bounds of the system benefit which are presented in table 10 table 10 also shows the water availabilities from surface and groundwater corresponding to different joint and single risk levels fig 7 presents the main eﬀect and interaction plots for the single risk level of groundwater availability i e p 2 and the joint risk level p on the wefn system benefits under demanding and advantageous conditions it is noticed that the single and joint risk levels in case 1 pose different main and interactive effects on the wefn system under advantageous and demanding conditions more specifically for the same conditions e g lower bound or upper bound the main effects from single and joint risk levels present adverse variation trends for instance as presented in fig 7 a the system benefit would increase as the joint risk level increase from 0 10 to 0 14 whilst the benefit tends to decrease as the violation risk of groundwater availability increase from 0 05 to 0 09 this may be because that for the specified joint risk level the increase in p 2 would lead to decrease in the violation risk for surface water availability and also the total water availability as presented in scenarios a to c in table 8 this may finally lead to the decrease in the total system benefit in comparison system benefit under the advantageous conditions as presented in fig 7 b would slightly increase with the risk increase of groundwater availability i e p 2 and tend to decrease when the joint risk level increase from 0 10 to 0 12 this implies that under the advantageous conditions the system benefit would not necessarily increase with the increase of the joint risk level but such a benefit can be increased through increasing the violation risk for the groundwater availability for the interactive effects between the joint risk level and the violation risk of groundwater availability the results indicate that there would be significant interactions between p and p 2 when the joint risk p is set to be 0 1 if the joint risk level p increases from 0 12 to 0 14 there seem to be no interactions as indicated by the parallel interactive curves between the overall risk and the single risk level of groundwater availability the main reason for the no interactive effect when p 0 12 is that there would be sufficient water availabilities for a high joint risk level in this case as presented in table 10 the water availabilities from surface and groundwater would be larger than 9 86 108 m3 when the joint risk level p 0 12 while the maximum water availability under p 0 10 is about 9 53 108 m3 this implies that the wefn system would be mainly influenced by other factors rather than the water availabilities for a joint risk level higher than 0 12 which is also demonstrated by the system benefits presented in table 10 for case 2 where the joint risk level i e p and the risk of surface water availability i e p 1 are addressed fig 8 shows the man and interactive effects of these two factors under demanding and advantageous conditions for the demanding conditions as presented in fig 8 a the increases in both p and p 1 would lead to an increasing trend for the lower bound benefit of the wefn system and also the interactive curves are observed to be intersected at the three levels especially for p 1 increasing from 0 05 to 0 07 implying significant interactive eﬀects of these two risk levels on the resulting lower bound benefit these results may be because that the demanding conditions correspond to relative strict restrictions in which the water availability is one of the major factors affecting the crop planting structures for a specified p 1 the increases in p would lead to increasing water availabilities see table 10 and thus generate increased system benefits under the advantageous conditions where relative loose restrictions are adopted the main and interactive effects of p and p 1 present different features from their effects on the system benefit under the demanding conditions as presented in fig 8 b the main effect of the joint risk level i e p suggest that the upper bound of the system benefit tends to decrease with the increase in p whilst the benefit of the wefn system would decrease for p1 increasing from 0 05 to 0 07 and then increase for p 1 increasing from 0 07 to 0 09 for the interaction between p and p 1 the interactive curves indicate that p and p 1 would have significant interactions on the upper bound of wefn system benefit in detail the upper bound benefit would decrease with increasing p 1 from 0 05 to 0 07 and then slightly increase with increasing p 1 from 0 07 to 0 09 at p 0 10 and 0 12 in comparison at p 0 14 the upper bound benefit shows a slightly increasing trend with the increase in the risk level of surface water availability in summary the results of the multilevel factorial analysis suggest that the lower bound of the wefn system benefit would increase with the increase of water resource availability moreover the water availability can be increased through increasing the joint overall violation risk or the violation risk of surface water availability also the risk decrease in groundwater availability can also lead to increasing total water availability and thus generate increasing system benefit under the demanding conditions in comparison for the upper bound of the wefn system benefit corresponding relative loose restrictions increasing the violation risks would not necessarily lead to increased system benefit specifically the increase in the joint risk level may even lead to decreased system benefit for the advantageous conditions this may be because that there would be sufficient or even excessive water resources for irrigation requirement under the advantageous conditions and thus the wefn system benefit may be significantly influenced by other factors 5 conclusions in this study a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp method has been developed to generate management strategies for the complex water energy food nexus wefn system a ficsp wefn model has been formulated for planning farming practices in which the randomness of surface water and groundwater availabilities and their interdependence would be reflected through the copula method solutions of the planting areas for different crops within different periods can be generated through the model subject to various management requirements and different risk levels moreover the factorial analysis in ficsp would be further used to investigate the main and interactive effects of the single and joint risk levels on the wefn management strategies the developed ficsp approach was applied for the management of water energy food nexus system for the city of jinan at shandong province the obtained results indicated that the surface water and groundwater availabilities were highly correlated different marginal distributions and copula functions were adopted to model their probabilistic features and interdependence in which the gaussian distribution would perform best in reflecting the univariate randomness and the gaussian copula performed best in describing their dependence structure due to the interdependence among surface water and groundwater availabilities a joint violation risk on total water availability would lead to infinite combinations of single violation risk for surface or ground water availabilities and thus lead to different amounts of total water resources which would further lead to varied planting structures for the overall risk level of 0 1 six scenarios on the risk levels of surface water and groundwater availabilities were analyzed which led to the total water resources ranging within 8 186 9 531 108 m3 if limited water resources are available e g the demanding conditions under p 0 1 p 1 0 035 and p 2 0 09 the corn would be prioritized in the planting structure to satisfy the cereal demand from local population and the increasing cereal demand over the planning horizon would also be satisfied by the increasing planting areas of corn in comparison when sufficient water is available under the advantageous conditions those excessive water resources tend to be allocated to wheat and vegetables whilst the planting area of corn would not be changed moreover the increase of water availability resulting from adjustment of single risk levels would increase the wheat planting whilst decrease the planting areas for corn for the scheme on water resource allocation the surface and recycled water would generally be utilized for crop production first under the selected six scenarios for an overall risk of 0 1 all surface and recycled water would be utilized for crop irrigation under both demanding and advantageous conditions with the remaining irrigation water needs being satisfied by the groundwater the lower bound of the wefn system benefit showed the same variation trend with the water availabilities under different combinations of single risk levels implying the critical role of water availability in planning crop cultivation patterns under the demanding conditions in comparison under the advantageous conditions where sufficient water is available the crop cultivation patterns would be influenced by other restrictions and thus the upper bound of wefn system benefit showed a different variation trend with the water availabilities the factorial analysis included in ficsp have been further adopted to reveal the main and interactive effects of single and joint risk levels on wefn system management under both demanding and advantageous conditions the obtained results indicated that under demanding conditions the lower bound of the wefn system benefit would tend to increase with i the increase in the joint overall violation risk especially from 0 10 to 0 12 ii the increase in the violation risk of surface water availability especially from 0 05 to 0 07 or ii the decrease in the violation risk of groundwater availability especially from 0 09 to 0 07 in comparison the increase in the violation risks under the advantageous conditions would not necessarily lead to increased system benefit and even cause decreased system benefits for the increasing joint risk level the ficsp approach is able to deal with various uncertainties in the wefn system presented as random and interval variables in which the copula method is adopted in ficsp to reflect complex interdependence among correlated random variables the copula based joint chance constraints have been widely adopted to deal with dependent randomness in water and environmental systems as demonstrated in kong et al 2018 the inexact copula based stochastic programming icsp method can well reflect dependence including nonlinear dependence between random variables while in comparison traditional joint chance constraint method can only estimate joint probability through a linear approach weakening the interactions among random variables in this study the detailed procedures on converting the copula based joint chance constraints into deterministic constraints were elaborated making the icsp method to be more understandable for real applications moreover the factorial analysis has been introduced into ficsp to investigate the main and interactive effects from different risk levels on the wefn system management the developed ficsp method cannot only generate desired management strategies for wefn system under consideration of joint risks but also help track the factors that make dominant impacts on the wefn management practices the proposed ficsp method has been used for wefn management however some issues still need to be further addressed firstly the energy issues in the developed wefn model are limited in which the energy usage in agricultural production is considered moreover the future surface and ground water availabilities considered in the wefn model are random in future with their probabilistic distributions estimated by historical data this implies that the future water availabilities are stationary when compared to historical measurements however such an assumption has not been demonstrated especially under climate change consequently more research works are required to develop the wefn model to include full nexus among water energy and food systems and also project the surface and groundwater availabilities under climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this study is supported by the national natural science foundation of china 62073134 
9101,in this study a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp method is developed for planning the regional scale water energy food nexus wefn system the ficsp cannot only deal with uncertainties expressed as interval and random parameters but also handle the interdependence among correlated random variables moreover the multilevel factorial analysis embedded in ficsp is able to reflect the main and interactive effects among uncertain parameters the ifccp approach was then applied to planning the wefn system for the city of jinan shandong province china a ficsp wefn model has been established under consideration of various restrictions related to water and land availability food and vegetable demands and other environmental constraints the obtained results indicated that the surface water and groundwater availabilities would be highly correlated with their marginals fitted through the gaussian distribution and their dependence described by the gaussian copula under limited water resources the corn cultivation would be prioritized but the increase of water resources tends to increase the wheat cultivation and reduce corn planting under the advantageous conditions where sufficient water resources are available the additional water resources tend to be allocated to wheat and vegetables whilst corn cultivation would not be changed moreover the surface and recycled water would be first utilized for crop production with the remaining water requirements satisfied by groundwater the results from factorial analysis indicated that the system benefits would be increased under the demanding conditions through increasing the joint risk level and also the violation risk for surface water availability or decreasing the violation risk of groundwater availability nevertheless the increase in the violation risks under the advantageous conditions would not necessarily lead to increased system benefit implying that the crop cultivation patterns may be influenced by other restrictions rather than the water availability in general the developed ficsp method cannot only generate desired management strategies for wefn system under consideration of joint risks but also help track the factors that make dominant impacts on the wefn management practices keywords inexact programming random variables uncertainty water energy food nexus system decision making factorial analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are increasing demands for water energy and food to support socio economic development prosperous population and also decent living standards this is particularly true for some developing countries such as china which leads to an urgent request for efficient management for water energy and food systems however water energy and food systems are highly correlated among each other for instance the irrigation is required for agricultural planting which needs both water resources and energies e g diesel or electricity at the same time the effluents from farming will lead to pollution issues for the water systems consequently management of water energy food nexus wefn system is becoming attractive for administrators academic researchers and other relevant stakeholder liu et al 2015 keskinen et al 2016 shang et al 2018 owen et al 2018 nevertheless there are a number of challenges to develop efficient management strategies for water energy food nexus with various uncertainties being one of the major issues to be addressed there are generally extensive uncertainties in the water energy food nexus system which are embedded in different system components and also present different formats such as fuzzy interval and random variables yu et al 2020a ji et al 2020a b yan et al 2021 these uncertainties would interact among each other intensifying the complexities in managing the wefn system therefore it is desired to develop effective planning and management policies for water energy food nexus under consideration of various uncertainties recently there are amounts of studies to explore efficient management of water food nexus or water energy food nexus for instance salmoral and yan 2018 used the theory of virtual water and embedded energy to explore water and energy allocations in the economic system zhang and vesselinov 2017 developed an integrated model called wefo to address the trade off and support decisions for the nexus management of water energy and food resources moreover there are also some studies to develop inexact optimization approaches to reflect uncertainties in the water and food systems for instance sun et al 2019 developed a possibilistic flexible chance constrained programming approach to explore the impacts of irrigation efficiency on agricultural water land nexus system management in amu darya river basin central asia li et al 2019 developed an awefsm agricultural water energy food sustainable management model for the sustainable management of limited water energy food resource in an agricultural system ji et al 2020b proposed a multi stage stochastic fuzzy random programming msfrp model for wefn management under uncertainties for the various uncertainties in the wefn system many parameters are random in nature and some of them are highly correlated such as surface water and groundwater resources the chance constraint programming ccp approaches have been proposed to deal with random parameters in the wefn system for instance ma et al 2020 ever employed the chance constraint to reflect the randomness in water resources for managing the water food ecology nexus system chen et al 2020 used the ccp method to reflect the random electricity demand in planning the energy water environmental nexus through an integrated method however some parameter variables in the wefn system may be correlated among each other such as availabilities of different water resources supplies of water resources and energies and so on these correlated variables can hardly be well reflected through traditional ccp or joint ccp techniques especially when different variables are quantified by different probabilistic distributions the copula based stochastic programming approaches have recently been advanced to deal with the above challenge in which the copula method was adopted to reflect complex dependence structures among correlated variables parameters for instance yu et al 2020a coupled the two level programming and copula for optimizing energy water nexus system management at the henan province in which the correlation between water availability and electricity demand was quantified by the copula method zhang et al 2022 developed a generalized copula based chance constrained programming gcbcp approach to assess the composite risk of the water energy food nexus system among water energy and food shortage even though the copula based approaches are effective to tackle correlated random variables some issues still needs to be addressed i the copula based chance constraints are usually converted into linear constraints before solving the optimization model but such a conversion process has not been well elaborated ii in the copula based stochastic programming approaches there would be different risks including the risk for a single variable and the joint overall risk under consideration of parameter variable correlation but the individual and interactive effects of single and joint risks on the wefn system management have not been addressed consequently this study aims to develop a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp approach to support management of the water energy food nexus system under compound uncertainties the ficsp approach will be proposed through integrating the interval linear programming ilp method copula based stochastic programming fccp method and factorial analysis into a framework to i deal with uncertainties presented in interval and random formats ii tackle complex dependence among random variables parameters and iii investigate the individual and interactive effects of different risks the ficsp method will then be applied for developing management strategies for the water energy food nexus at the city of jinan china to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of the ficsp wefn model management of the water energy food nexus wefn system is complicated in which multiple uncertainties embedded in multiple components need to be well reflected moreover different requirements such as water and energy availabilities food demand and cultivation areas for different crops should be under consideration this implies that the decision maker would not only consider the overall profit of the water energy food nexus system but also balances the contradiction between agricultural production and water and energy availabilities consequently a water energy food nexus wefn model aims to provide support for efficient agricultural activities to achieve maximum system benefits under consideration of various constraints such as water and energy consumptions fertilizer and pesticide utilization in detail the agriculture profits include revenue of crops and the costs for the consumption of various resources e g water energy fertilizer and pesticides in addition the labor cost has not been taken into account therefore the objective of the wefn model can be formulated as 1a max f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 1 revenues of agricultural products 1b f 1 t 1 t v 1 v p a t v u w t v u p t v 2 cost for water supply 1c f 2 t 1 t i 1 i w s r t i w s t i 3 cost for water treatment 1d f 3 t 1 t i 1 i w s c t i w s t i 4 cost for fertilizer utilization 1e f 4 t 1 t v 1 v f c t f u t v p a t v 5 cost for pesticide utilization 1 f f 5 t 1 t v 1 v p c t p u t v p a t v 6 cost for energy consumption 1 g f 6 t 1 t v 1 v u d c t v u d p t u e c t v u e p t p a t v 7 cost for seeds 1 h f 7 t 1 t v 1 v s e d p t v p a t v based on the current situation and future development strategy the wefn model would consider multifaceted and comprehensive constraints e g limited farming areas for different crops water resources and energy availabilities the constraints can help plan the agricultural development alleviate the contradictions among the development of socio economic environmental protection and other aspects which will ultimately realize the sustainable development 1 arable land constraint the planting areas for different crops should be limited due to competitive land utilization among different sectors e g industrial commercial and residential and also requirements of environmental protection which can lead to constraints of cultivation restriction as follows 2a p a t v m i n p a t v p a t v m a x 2b v 1 v p a t v t p a t the minimum and maximum planting areas of crops are bounded in constraint 2a to prevent from remarkable price fluctuations for agricultural products in addition the total planting area cannot exceed the available arable land i e t p a t in planning periods as expressed in constraint 2b 2 food demand constraint the crop yield should satisfy local basic food requirements to guarantee food security firstly the constraint for the cereal demand is formulated as 3a 1 γ v v 1 2 p a t v u w t v λ f d t p t where f d t is cereal demand standard per person kg person at period t p t denotes population size at time period t γ v represents the food loss rate in production transportation and other processes for crop v λ denotes the food self sufficiency rate for the study area since the wheat and corn are the two major cereal crops only these two crops i e v 1 and 2 will be considered in eq 3a in addition the constraint for the vegetable demand can be similarly formulated as 3b 1 η p a t 3 u w t 3 λ v d t p t where η is the loss rate for vegetables production and v d t denotes the vegetable demand per person kg person at period t 3 water resources availability water irrigation is of great importance in the agricultural sector nevertheless the water availability for agricultural irrigation is generally limited for most areas due to increasing water consumption from other sectors consequently the constraint describing water irrigation can be formulated as follows 4a θ v 1 v p a t v i q t v i 1 i w s t i where θ is the reliability of irrigation which indicates the probability that the irrigation quota can be satisfied i q t v denotes the irrigation quota for different crops in different planning periods in addition to the irrigation constraints for different crops the water resource supply should not exceed the maximum available amounts from different water sources 4b pr w s t 1 a v w t 1 p 1 4c pr w s t 2 a v w t 2 p 2 4d c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p 4e w s t 3 a v w t 3 4 energy availability the energy used in food production mainly include the electricity consumption for irrigation and the fossil consumption for machinery operation which can be formulated as follows 5a v 1 v p a t v u e c t v t a e t 5b v 1 v p a t v u d c t v t a d t where u e c t v and u f c t v respectively represents the unit electricity consumption kwh ha and unit fossil consumption kg ha whilst t a e t and t a d t indicate the total availabilities for electricity and fossils allocated to agricultural production 5 restrictions for fertilizers and pesticides due to requirements on pollution control and greenhouse gas emission the utilization of fertilizers and pesticides would also be restricted in the proposed ficsp wefn model which can be formulated as follows 6a v 1 v p a t v f a t v t a f t 6b v 1 v p a t v p a t v t a p t where t a f t and t a p t respectively denotes the total availabilities for fertilizer and pesticide for agricultural production at time period t the proposed ficsp wefn model i e equations 1 6 are formulated through referring relevant studies e g li et al 2019 tang et al 2019 yu et al 2020a the system benefit is to be maximized taking into account for revenues of crop productions as well as costs for water energy and agricultural production conditions singh and panda 2012 miao et al 2014 simić et al 2017 consequently the crop cultivation patterns as well as the corresponding system benefit would be influenced and limited by the synthetic action of productive resources e g water energy food and land zuo et al 2021 thus the integrated consideration for restrictions on energy demand supply water resources supply and arable area availability flood guarantee and other production conditions can form an internal self regulating mechanism and optimize the wef nexus to some extent zhang and vesselinov 2017 zuo et al 2021 specifically even though the agricultural energy demand supply i e eqs 5a and 5b is only considered in the ficsp wefn model these constraints can reflect the impact of energy supply on the crop structure which can further imply whether the current energy consumption pattern such as the ratio of agricultural energy consumption needs to be adjusted the definitions for the variables and parameters used in the proposed wefn model are listed in table 1 in this study all parameters except the availabilities for surface and ground water are presented as intervals which would reflect uncertainties in future conditions such as crop price the interval parameters in the proposed wefn model are mainly used since it is easier to specify the boundaries of an interval parameter based on limited data availabilities moreover the groundwater and surface water availabilities are considered as random variables because i they are generally random in nature due to the main effect from local weather conditions and ii sufficient samples can be obtained through the local statistical yearbooks to quantify the probabilistic features for these two parameters it is straightforward that these two parameters are highly correlated which can be quantified by the copula method in addition to further explore the impact of parameter uncertainties on the resulting management strategies for the wefn system the factorial analysis method will be introduced into the proposed wefn model to reveal both individual and interactive effects from parameter uncertainties therefore a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp approach will be proposed for solving the above wefn model 2 2 solution process of the ficsp method the proposed ficsp integrates the interval mathematical programming imp joint chance constraint programming jccp and factorial analysis into a framework in detail the interval copula stochastic programming icsp approach would be first formulated based on imp jccp and copula functions to deal with interval and also correlated random parameters which is expressed as 7a m a x f j 1 n c j x j subject to 7b j 1 n a i j x j b i i 1 2 s 7c j 1 n a i j x j b i p i ω i s 1 m 7d c 1 p s 1 1 p s 2 1 p m 1 p 7e x j 0 in model 7 constraints 7b and 7c are generated through introduce the copula function c into the joint chance constraint pr j 1 n a i j x j b i ω i s 1 m 1 p to describe the dependence among random parameters b i ω b i p i ω f i 1 p i and f i 1 p i is the inverse of the cumulative probability function cdf for the random variable b i ω under a cdf value of p i a i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n b i i 1 2 s and c j are interval parameters presented in a general form as t t t t any t r x j are the decision variables to be generated in model 7 which can also be expressed as intervals in the icsp method the copula function is adopted to quantify the dependence among correlated random parameters and further convert the joint chance constraint into equivalent linear constraints the copula function c is able to join or couple one dimensional marginal distribution functions to a multivariate distribution function for the correlated random variables take two correlated random variables x 1 and x 2 as an example the joint probability distribution can be formulated through the copula function and their marginals as follows nelsen 2006 8 f x 1 x 2 c u 1 u 2 where c is the copula function u 1 u 2 0 1 u 1 f 1 x 1 and u 2 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 are the marginal distributions for the random variables x 1 and x 2 there are a number of copula functions applied in water and environmental studies favre et al 2004 bárdossy and hörning 2016 huang and fan 2021 fan et al 2020a b which are mainly classified into four categories archimedean extreme value elliptical and other miscellaneous families wong et al 2010 kong et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the proposed icsp approach can be solved through an interactive solution algorithm in which two submodels with deterministic coefficients are formulated respectively corresponding the lower and upper bounds of the objective function huang 1998 fan et al 2009 2012 li et al 2015 yu et al 2018 in detail the submodel for the upper bound of the objective corresponds to the optimistic advantageous conditions which is formulated as follows 9a max f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j subject to 9b j 1 k a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i i 1 2 s 9c j 1 k a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i p i i s 1 m 9d c 1 p s 1 1 p s 2 1 p m 1 p 9e x j 0 where c j 0 for j 1 2 k and c j 0 for j k 1 n p 0 1 is the overall risk for constraint violation whilst p i 0 1 is the violation risk for constraint i similar to the optimistic model the pessimistic submodel can be formulated as 10a max f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j subject to 10b j 1 k a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i i 1 2 s 10c j 1 k a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i p i i s 1 m 10d c 1 p s 1 1 p s 2 1 p m 1 p 10e 0 x j x j o p t j 1 2 k 10 f x j x j o p t j k 1 k 2 n where x j o p t j 1 2 k and x j o p t j k 1 n are the solutions obtained from the optimistic submodel i e model 9 based on submodels 9 and 10 the interval solutions for model 7 can be obtained as 11a f o p t f o p t f o p t 11b x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t since parameters in model 7 are presented either in intervals or probabilistic distributions it is desired to explore how both the individual and interactive effects of parameter uncertainties on the resulting solutions consequently a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp will be developed to integrate the icsp method into the factorial analysis framework to address the above issue factorial analysis is widely used to quantify the effect of uncertain parameters to reveal the hidden interrelationships and thereby provide decision makers with a comprehensive understanding regarding the effect of the variation of uncertain parameters on the responses of the model zhao et al 2022 in factorial analysis an experimental design is employed to account for all combinations of the levels of factors to help visualize the single effects of factors with discrete values or levels and their interactive effects on a response variable fan et al 2020b consider a system which has two factors a and b with each factor respectively having i and j levels the statistical effect from those two factors can be expressed as 12 y i j k μ α i β j α β i j ε i j k i 1 2 i j 1 2 j k 1 2 k

case study 3 1 overview of the studied area the proposed ficsp approach will be applied for system management practices for the water energy food nexus at the city of jinan shandong province as the capital of shandong province the city of jinan is located in the central part of the province after merging the city of laiwu in 2019 the city of jinan is now covering an area of 10244 km2 and having a population of 8 90 million the gross domestic product gdp more than one thousand billion rmb with the growth rate of 7 4 in 2020 which is the second largest city of shandong jinan is experiencing prosperous growth for both population and economy leading to increasing demand for water and food there are several crops planted in the city of jinan such as wheat rice corn beans cottons vegetable and so on however wheat corn and vegetables are the three major crops planted in jinan for instance the sown areas for wheat corn and vegetables were 2 16 106 2 11 106 and 0 89 106 ha respectively making a respective contribution of 38 37 and 15 to the total sown area the total water demand is about 1 96 109 m3 in 2019 in which water demands for agricultural industrial municipal and environmental sectors are respectively 8 24 108 2 95 108 3 59 108 and 2 51 108 m3 shandong water department 2019 the water supply for jinan mainly come from surface water groundwater and recycled water in 2019 these three water sources contributed about 11 64 108 6 44 108 and 1 52 108 m3 to the total water supply shandong water department 2019 nevertheless the total water availability is limited especially for agriculture in the city of jinan due to uneven precipitation competitive water demands from other sectors such as environmental protection whilst there is an increasing demand for food supply as the enhancement of life standard moreover the increasing energy consumption especially after 2019 also implied remarkable deficits and serious competition for energy consumption between agricultural production and other sectors nie et al 2021 xu et al 2022 consequently it is desirable to develop effective management strategies for the water energy food nexus system at the city of jinan 3 2 data collection the whole planning horizon covers the next three years 2022 2026 which also assumed to have five planning periods many parameters are required in development the management strategies for the water energy food nexus system at the city of jinan such as demands for food and vegetables limits for sown areas of different plants water availability from different sources these data are collected from both provincial http tjj shandong gov cn col col6279 index html and local http jntj jinan gov cn col col27523 index html statistic yearbooks and also some relevant literatures ji et al 2020b ma et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 mei et al 2021 xu et al 2022 table 2 presents the agriculture related parameters including the unit products for different crops in different planning periods and the sown area limits for different crops obtained from the jinan statistical yearbook http jntj jinan gov cn col col27523 index html the prices of agricultural products fertilizers and pesticides as well as the unit utilization of fertilizer and pesticide for different crops are obtained from the cost benefit analysis of agricultural products national development and reform commission 2018 2019 the irrigation quotas as well as the corresponding reliabilities of irrigation for different crops are obtained from the local irrigation policy no db37 t 3772 2019 released by the shandong water resources department the costs for water supply and water treatment as presented in table 3 are adopted from relevant studies e g ji et al 2020b the water availability for different sources is dealt with different approaches the availabilities of surface water and groundwater are mainly affected by the weather conditions which are random in nature moreover the groundwater and surface water availabilities are highly correlated consequently the copula model would be adopted to reflect the probabilistic features of surface and ground water availabilities and their interdependence in comparison the recycled water would be generally controlled by technical and regulation factors and thus its availability is projected though regression methods based on historical water supplies from recycled water from 2011 to 2018 shandong water resources department 2019 the future demands for wheat and corn as well as the vegetables are presented in table 4 these parameters are adopted from the projections from china agricultural outlook 2020 2029 mara 2020 in table 4 the demands for wheat and corns consists of those directly applied for food production and also those indirectly used such as wheat or corns used for fodder for livestock 4 result analysis 4 1 dependence between groundwater and surface water availabilities since the availabilities of surface water and groundwater are generally random in nature their probabilistic features are quantified through some parametric distributions based on the historical data from 2000 to 2019 in this study the gamma pearson type iii i e p3 normal and lognormal distributions are employed to quantify the randomness for the surface water and groundwater availabilities fig 2 shows the comparison between the empirical cumulative probabilities and theoretical values obtained through the fitted distributions the results indicate that all the fitted distributions are agree well with the empirical probabilities which indicates that all the four distributions are applicable to characterize the probabilistic features for the surface water and groundwater availabilities to further evaluate the performances of the four distributions goodness of fit tests are performed through the anderson darling ad test root mean square error rmse and the akaike information criterion aic the detailed procedures for those three goodness of fit tests can be found in some literatures e g gabriel and fan 2022 table 5 presents the results for the goodness of fit tests the results suggest that all the distributions can pass the ad test which indicates their applicability for modelling the distributions of surface water and groundwater availabilities nevertheless based on the results of rmse and aic the normal distribution would perform best in describing the probabilistic features for both surface water and groundwater availabilities consequently the normal distribution would be adopted in this study to quantify the randomness for the two water availabilities the availabilities of surface water and groundwater are generally correlated among each other based on the historical data from 2000 to 2019 these two water resources have a pearson correlation of 0 78 and kendall s τ of 0 64 implying the high dependence between these two water availabilities consequently it is required to consider both the single and joint probabilistic features in developing the management strategies of water energy food nexus at the city of jinan the normal distribution has been demonstrated to best quantify the randomness for both water resources whilst the dependence between these two variables would be quantified through the copula method in this study the gaussian student t gumbel frank and joe copulas are adopted to quantify the dependence between surface water and groundwater availabilities with their detailed expressions and properties being referred to previous studies nelsen 2006 also the performances of different copulas are evaluated through the cramér von mises cvm test e g genest et al 2009 rmse and aic gabriel and fan 2022 table 6 shows the results of goodness of fit through different evaluation methods the results indicate that all the selected copulas are statistically applicable to model the dependence between surface water and groundwater availabilities with the p value of cvm test higher than 0 05 however the lowest rmse and aic values from the gaussian copula suggest the kind of copula function would be the best one to modeling the joint probabilistic features for these two water resource variables also the joint cdf function of surface water and groundwater availabilities based on the gaussian copula are presented fig 3 indicating the dependent probabilistic features between these two variables 4 2 solutions under a joint violation risk level of 0 1 through the developed ficsp wefn model the cultivation structures and water supply patterns can be generated under different single and joint risk levels in detail the risk level p in eq 4d represents the overall violation risk that the irrigation water needs cannot be satisfied by either the surface water or groundwater resources the risk level p 1 in eq 4b indicates with a predefined overall violation risk i e p in eq 4d the probability that the surface water supply for agricultural irrigation cannot be satisfied whilst p 2 in eq 4c represents the probability that the groundwater supply is not satisfied the overall risk level p can be predefined by the decision maker in this study p 0 1 is primarily specified through referring relevant studies yu et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 this means that the decision maker wants to ensure the surface and ground water supplies to irrigation can be satisfied with a probability of 90 such a risk level also implies that even for some drought conditions with relatively less water availabilities the obtained cultivation pattern would still be feasible when the joint violation risk level is set to be 0 1 i e p 0 1 there would be different options to specify the associated violation risk levels for surface water i e p 1 and groundwater i e p 2 availabilities i specify the risk level of groundwater availability and solve eq 4d to generate the risk level for surface water availability ii predefine the risk level for surface water and solve eq 4d to obtain the risk level for groundwater in this study both of these two options would be considered with the overall risk of 0 1 and the predefined risk of either groundwater or surface water being 0 09 0 07 0 05 table 7 presents the scenarios of risk levels of surface water and groundwater under an overall risk of 0 1 it can be concluded that for a specified joint risk level there would be different risk levels for individual constraints also due to the different risk levels for groundwater and surface water constraints there would be different availabilities for these two water resources and also the total water resources as presented in table 8 with different joint and single risk levels the proposed ficsp wefn model is to be converted to two submodels corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of the objective function based on the process described through submodels 9 and 10 each submodel is a linear programming model which is solved by lingo in this study with a computation time about 3 s table 9 presents the cultivation pattern and also water allocations under an overall risk level of 0 1 the results indicate that for the specified overall risk level there would be distinguishable crop planting structures and water allocation schemes under different combinations of single risk levels also under each risk combination the planting areas for different crops would vary in different planning periods due to the socioeconomic and environmental restrictions as well as the water resource availabilities under the risk scenario of p 0 1 overall risk p 1 0 035 surface water p 2 0 09 groundwater the planting area for corn would be 1 784 105 ha in period 1 and 2 318 105 ha in period 5 with an increasing rate of 30 under the demanding conditions in comparison cultivation area for wheat would be 1 89 10 5 ha for all the planning periods which is the upper bound of the minimum planting limit the results imply that with strict restrictions e g water resource availabilities the corn seems to be prioritized between corn and wheat in the planting structure to satisfy the cereal demand from local population more specifically as the cereal demand increases these demands would also be satisfied by corn and thus lead to an increasing trend for corn cultivation over the planning horizon in addition the cultivation area for vegetables would slightly increase from 0 921 1 204 105 ha in period 1 to 1 003 1 204 105 ha in period 5 with an increasing rate of 8 9 for the lower bound the increasing trend for vegetable cultivation under the demanding conditions i e lower bound may also be attributed to the increasing vegetable demand over the planning horizon however under the advantageous conditions where relative loose restrictions e g upper bound of water availability are adopted these additional resources tend to be allocated to wheat and vegetables whilst the corn cultivation would not be changed for instance with more resources available the upper bound of wheat and vegetable cultivation would respectively increase to 2 553 105 ha and 1 204 105 ha this may be due to the relative high benefits generated wheat and vegetable cultivation and thus additional resources would be allocated to these two crops in terms of water resource allocation the results in table 9 indicate that the surface water and recycled water would be used for agricultural irrigation with deterministic water allocations for these two water resources under both advantageous and demanding conditions for instance the water allocation amount from surface water would be 2 495 108 m3 for all the five planning periods under the risk scenarios of p 0 1 p 1 0 035 and p 2 0 09 whilst the water allocation amount would reach the lower bound of recycled water availability at each time period this may be due to the relative lower cost in water supply and water treatment for surface and recycled water in addition the remaining irrigation water requirement would be satisfied by the groundwater resource specifically under the advantageous conditions i e the upper bound of the objective function all groundwater resources i e 5 691 108 m3 would be utilized for agricultural production in the studied area this implies that under this risk scenario p 0 1 p 1 0 035 and p 2 0 09 the water availabilities would be a key factor to influence the crop cultivation structures in the studied area as indicated in table 7 there would be different risk levels for groundwater and surface water availabilities that satisfy the overall risk level of 0 1 under different single risk levels there are varied water availabilities from surface water and groundwater resources as presented in table 8 table 9 and fig 4 present the crop cultivation structures at the studied region over the planning horizon under different single risk combinations with an overall risk level of 0 1 it is apparent that different planting schemes especially for wheat and corn would be generally obtained from the ficsp wefn model with a predefined overall risk of 0 1 this is due to the different combinations of single risk level for surface water and groundwater availabilities under such an overall risk level for instance figs 4 a and 4 b show the crop cultivation patterns where the violation risk for surface water increases from 0 035 to 0 064 and the risk for groundwater decreases from 0 09 to 0 07 the results indicate that the corn cultivation tends to increase under both demanding and advantageous conditions while the planting area of wheat would keep consistency under demanding conditions but decrease under advantageous conditions over the planning horizon as shown in fig 4 a in comparison the planting area for corn would slightly decrease in the first four periods with minor increase for wheat cultivation as the same time as shown in fig 4 b the main reason for the differences of cultivation pattern between these two scenarios is due to the different water availabilities in these two scenarios similar features presented in fig 4 b can also be observed in figs 4 c 4 e where a decreasing trend for corn cultivation would be observed in the former planning periods whilst increase in wheat cultivation may occur at the same time the water allocation patterns from different water resources under different risk scenarios are presented in table 9 and fig 5 under advantageous and demanding conditions the water allocation patterns from different water resources under different risk scenarios are presented in table 9 and fig 5 under advantageous and demanding conditions deterministic water supplies are obtained for recycled and surface water resources for all six scenarios except some latter time periods in scenarios c and d these results indicate that the surface and recycled water would be utilized for crop production firstly in both demanding and advantageous conditions in comparison for groundwater it can be observed that there are significant fluctuation ranges between the lower and upper bounds of groundwater allocation a decreasing trend for would be generally observed for the lower bounds of groundwater supplies as presented in fig 5 specifically for some risk scenarios e g figs 5 c and 5 d the lower bounds of groundwater supply seem to be invisible which suggests that the water supplies from surface and recycled water can satisfy all water requirements for crop production fig 6 shows the total system benefits from the wefn model i e equations 11 16 under different risk scenarios listed in table 8 the results indicate that under a predefined overall system risk the variations in the single violation levels for surface water or groundwater availabilities would also influence the system benefits from the wefn model in general under the demanding conditions which corresponds to the lower bound of the objective function the variation trend in the system benefits would be consistent with the total water availabilities from surface water and groundwater for instance the lower bound of the system benefit would increase from scenario a i e rmb 7 017 1010 to scenario c i e rmb 7 303 1010 and then decrease from scenarios c to f correspondingly the total availability from surface water and groundwater as presented in table 8 also shows the same variation trend i e increase from a to c and then decrease from c to d with the trend in the lower bound of the system benefit this means that under the demanding conditions the water availability may be the critical factor that influence the crop planting patterns in the studied area however under the advantageous conditions where more water would be available the system benefit i e upper bound present a different variation trend from the trend in water availabilities for instance the highest system benefit under the advantageous conditions would be obtained at scenario a i e rmb 9 477 1010 whilst the availability from surface water and groundwater would be lowest i e 8 186 108 m3 in this scenario this implies that in addition to water availability the crop cultivation patterns may also be influenced by other restrictions which can also be concluded from the results in table 9 4 3 impacts of single and joint risks as elaborated in section 4 2 the variation in single violation risks in surface water and groundwater availabilities would influence the crop planting structures and also the resulting benefits from the wefn model however it is unclear that whether the joint overall risk level i e p in eq 4d would also influence the crop planting patterns and how the effects of single and joint risks would pose on the benefits of the wefn system to address the above challenges a factorial analysis was introduced into the ficsp wefn model to explore the individual and interactive effects of the single and joint risks in detail three levels are assigned respectively to the single and joint violation risks in which the three levels of 0 05 0 07 0 09 are given to the single violation risk for either surface water or groundwater availabilities and the three levels of 0 1 0 12 and 0 14 are set the overall joint violation risk moreover for the three risk levels i e p 1 for surface water availability p 2 for groundwater availability and p for the joint risk level presented in eqs 4b 4d the joint risk level p as well as one single risk level p 1 or p 2 can be predefined by decision makers with the other single risk level needs to be derived based on the copula function presented in eq 4d consequently two cases would be designed to reveal the effects of single and joint risk levels on the management strategies of wefn system at the studied region case 1 would consider the joint risk i e p and the risk of groundwater availability i e p 2 as the studied factors whilst case 2 would include p and p 1 as the studied factors in the factorial analysis table 10 present the design matrices for these two cases in the factorial analysis moreover for each case two responses will be considered including the lower and upper bounds of the system benefit which are presented in table 10 table 10 also shows the water availabilities from surface and groundwater corresponding to different joint and single risk levels fig 7 presents the main eﬀect and interaction plots for the single risk level of groundwater availability i e p 2 and the joint risk level p on the wefn system benefits under demanding and advantageous conditions it is noticed that the single and joint risk levels in case 1 pose different main and interactive effects on the wefn system under advantageous and demanding conditions more specifically for the same conditions e g lower bound or upper bound the main effects from single and joint risk levels present adverse variation trends for instance as presented in fig 7 a the system benefit would increase as the joint risk level increase from 0 10 to 0 14 whilst the benefit tends to decrease as the violation risk of groundwater availability increase from 0 05 to 0 09 this may be because that for the specified joint risk level the increase in p 2 would lead to decrease in the violation risk for surface water availability and also the total water availability as presented in scenarios a to c in table 8 this may finally lead to the decrease in the total system benefit in comparison system benefit under the advantageous conditions as presented in fig 7 b would slightly increase with the risk increase of groundwater availability i e p 2 and tend to decrease when the joint risk level increase from 0 10 to 0 12 this implies that under the advantageous conditions the system benefit would not necessarily increase with the increase of the joint risk level but such a benefit can be increased through increasing the violation risk for the groundwater availability for the interactive effects between the joint risk level and the violation risk of groundwater availability the results indicate that there would be significant interactions between p and p 2 when the joint risk p is set to be 0 1 if the joint risk level p increases from 0 12 to 0 14 there seem to be no interactions as indicated by the parallel interactive curves between the overall risk and the single risk level of groundwater availability the main reason for the no interactive effect when p 0 12 is that there would be sufficient water availabilities for a high joint risk level in this case as presented in table 10 the water availabilities from surface and groundwater would be larger than 9 86 108 m3 when the joint risk level p 0 12 while the maximum water availability under p 0 10 is about 9 53 108 m3 this implies that the wefn system would be mainly influenced by other factors rather than the water availabilities for a joint risk level higher than 0 12 which is also demonstrated by the system benefits presented in table 10 for case 2 where the joint risk level i e p and the risk of surface water availability i e p 1 are addressed fig 8 shows the man and interactive effects of these two factors under demanding and advantageous conditions for the demanding conditions as presented in fig 8 a the increases in both p and p 1 would lead to an increasing trend for the lower bound benefit of the wefn system and also the interactive curves are observed to be intersected at the three levels especially for p 1 increasing from 0 05 to 0 07 implying significant interactive eﬀects of these two risk levels on the resulting lower bound benefit these results may be because that the demanding conditions correspond to relative strict restrictions in which the water availability is one of the major factors affecting the crop planting structures for a specified p 1 the increases in p would lead to increasing water availabilities see table 10 and thus generate increased system benefits under the advantageous conditions where relative loose restrictions are adopted the main and interactive effects of p and p 1 present different features from their effects on the system benefit under the demanding conditions as presented in fig 8 b the main effect of the joint risk level i e p suggest that the upper bound of the system benefit tends to decrease with the increase in p whilst the benefit of the wefn system would decrease for p1 increasing from 0 05 to 0 07 and then increase for p 1 increasing from 0 07 to 0 09 for the interaction between p and p 1 the interactive curves indicate that p and p 1 would have significant interactions on the upper bound of wefn system benefit in detail the upper bound benefit would decrease with increasing p 1 from 0 05 to 0 07 and then slightly increase with increasing p 1 from 0 07 to 0 09 at p 0 10 and 0 12 in comparison at p 0 14 the upper bound benefit shows a slightly increasing trend with the increase in the risk level of surface water availability in summary the results of the multilevel factorial analysis suggest that the lower bound of the wefn system benefit would increase with the increase of water resource availability moreover the water availability can be increased through increasing the joint overall violation risk or the violation risk of surface water availability also the risk decrease in groundwater availability can also lead to increasing total water availability and thus generate increasing system benefit under the demanding conditions in comparison for the upper bound of the wefn system benefit corresponding relative loose restrictions increasing the violation risks would not necessarily lead to increased system benefit specifically the increase in the joint risk level may even lead to decreased system benefit for the advantageous conditions this may be because that there would be sufficient or even excessive water resources for irrigation requirement under the advantageous conditions and thus the wefn system benefit may be significantly influenced by other factors 5 conclusions in this study a factorial inexact copula stochastic programming ficsp method has been developed to generate management strategies for the complex water energy food nexus wefn system a ficsp wefn model has been formulated for planning farming practices in which the randomness of surface water and groundwater availabilities and their interdependence would be reflected through the copula method solutions of the planting areas for different crops within different periods can be generated through the model subject to various management requirements and different risk levels moreover the factorial analysis in ficsp would be further used to investigate the main and interactive effects of the single and joint risk levels on the wefn management strategies the developed ficsp approach was applied for the management of water energy food nexus system for the city of jinan at shandong province the obtained results indicated that the surface water and groundwater availabilities were highly correlated different marginal distributions and copula functions were adopted to model their probabilistic features and interdependence in which the gaussian distribution would perform best in reflecting the univariate randomness and the gaussian copula performed best in describing their dependence structure due to the interdependence among surface water and groundwater availabilities a joint violation risk on total water availability would lead to infinite combinations of single violation risk for surface or ground water availabilities and thus lead to different amounts of total water resources which would further lead to varied planting structures for the overall risk level of 0 1 six scenarios on the risk levels of surface water and groundwater availabilities were analyzed which led to the total water resources ranging within 8 186 9 531 108 m3 if limited water resources are available e g the demanding conditions under p 0 1 p 1 0 035 and p 2 0 09 the corn would be prioritized in the planting structure to satisfy the cereal demand from local population and the increasing cereal demand over the planning horizon would also be satisfied by the increasing planting areas of corn in comparison when sufficient water is available under the advantageous conditions those excessive water resources tend to be allocated to wheat and vegetables whilst the planting area of corn would not be changed moreover the increase of water availability resulting from adjustment of single risk levels would increase the wheat planting whilst decrease the planting areas for corn for the scheme on water resource allocation the surface and recycled water would generally be utilized for crop production first under the selected six scenarios for an overall risk of 0 1 all surface and recycled water would be utilized for crop irrigation under both demanding and advantageous conditions with the remaining irrigation water needs being satisfied by the groundwater the lower bound of the wefn system benefit showed the same variation trend with the water availabilities under different combinations of single risk levels implying the critical role of water availability in planning crop cultivation patterns under the demanding conditions in comparison under the advantageous conditions where sufficient water is available the crop cultivation patterns would be influenced by other restrictions and thus the upper bound of wefn system benefit showed a different variation trend with the water availabilities the factorial analysis included in ficsp have been further adopted to reveal the main and interactive effects of single and joint risk levels on wefn system management under both demanding and advantageous conditions the obtained results indicated that under demanding conditions the lower bound of the wefn system benefit would tend to increase with i the increase in the joint overall violation risk especially from 0 10 to 0 12 ii the increase in the violation risk of surface water availability especially from 0 05 to 0 07 or ii the decrease in the violation risk of groundwater availability especially from 0 09 to 0 07 in comparison the increase in the violation risks under the advantageous conditions would not necessarily lead to increased system benefit and even cause decreased system benefits for the increasing joint risk level the ficsp approach is able to deal with various uncertainties in the wefn system presented as random and interval variables in which the copula method is adopted in ficsp to reflect complex interdependence among correlated random variables the copula based joint chance constraints have been widely adopted to deal with dependent randomness in water and environmental systems as demonstrated in kong et al 2018 the inexact copula based stochastic programming icsp method can well reflect dependence including nonlinear dependence between random variables while in comparison traditional joint chance constraint method can only estimate joint probability through a linear approach weakening the interactions among random variables in this study the detailed procedures on converting the copula based joint chance constraints into deterministic constraints were elaborated making the icsp method to be more understandable for real applications moreover the factorial analysis has been introduced into ficsp to investigate the main and interactive effects from different risk levels on the wefn system management the developed ficsp method cannot only generate desired management strategies for wefn system under consideration of joint risks but also help track the factors that make dominant impacts on the wefn management practices the proposed ficsp method has been used for wefn management however some issues still need to be further addressed firstly the energy issues in the developed wefn model are limited in which the energy usage in agricultural production is considered moreover the future surface and ground water availabilities considered in the wefn model are random in future with their probabilistic distributions estimated by historical data this implies that the future water availabilities are stationary when compared to historical measurements however such an assumption has not been demonstrated especially under climate change consequently more research works are required to develop the wefn model to include full nexus among water energy and food systems and also project the surface and groundwater availabilities under climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this study is supported by the national natural science foundation of china 62073134

assessing agriculture water supply risk which has comprehensive advanced and efficient features the correlation between the precipitation in bia and runoff from upstream is weak which can lead to a

activities in the water source rivers and the irrigation district the wetness dryness encounter of precipitation in the irrigation area and upstream runoff has shown strong randomness which can contribute the uncertainty of agriculture water supply and bring the water supply risks for reservoir operation guo et al 2022 li et al 2016 wu et al 2019a therefore it is essential to integrate the wetness dryness encounter uncertainty of precipitation and runoff into reservoir s optimal operation and agriculture water supply risk analysis in the irrigation areas which can provide the scientific guidance for water resources planning and management under different water supply conditions and effectively deal with drought risk and support the sustainable development of irrigation areas and food security the growing water deficit in the irrigation area indicates that it is necessary to analyze the not only the complex relationship of the water supply and demand but also the wetness dryness encounter relationship of multi water sources of agriculture water supply ahmadi et al 2018 du et al 2019 wu et al 2019b zhao et al 2021 the encounter of effective precipitation and crop water requirements are employed to analyze the natural agriculture water shortage risk zhang et al 2022 2021c zhao et al 2021 li et al 2021b analysis the joint occurrence probabilities of runoff and et 0 combinations to explore the uncertainties in water supply and demand zhang et al 2017 researched water shortage risks under the contexts of natural water supply and demand by the joint probability distribution of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration however they focus only on the impact of the wetness dryness encounter of different water supply such as precipitation and runoff and demand on the relationship of agriculture water supply and demand the wetness dryness encounter relationship of precipitation and runoff as multi water sources tended to be neglected in agriculture water supply and the joint occurrence probabilities of the precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream did not be explored in the agriculture water supply risk research the encounter scenarios of precipitation and runoff with different occurrence probability can reflect the uncertainty of agriculture water supply feng et al 2010 liu et al 2015 the wetness dryness encounter relationship of precipitation and runoff is essentially a multivariable joint probability problem many methods have been used to analyze the encounter of hydrological variables such as empirical frequency method multivariate normal distribution method moran method fgm method bayesian network theory method and set pair analysis method feng et al 2010 kang et al 2010 zhang et al 2021d however these methods mentioned above cannot effectively deal with the internal relationship of the interdependent hydrological variables in hydrological processes and most of these multivariate probability distribution methods require that variables follow a same marginal distribution to overcome these issues the copulas method is introduced into the multivariate hydrological variables analysis ahmadi et al 2018 du et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2019 tahroudi et al 2020 the copula method has the advantage of that it can describe the dependence structures among the variables more accurately and is not assume marginals to be normal or independent any marginal distribution can be connected by copula to form a joint distribution which contains all the information of variables wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 therefore constructing the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff by the copula can comprehensively describe the uncertainty of the agriculture water supply at present abundant research achievements have been made on the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching gu et al 2012 guo et al 2013 gu et al 2008 established a reservoir dispatching model with the maximum water supply as the objective to analyze the water supply risk based on the uncertainty of incoming water and water use bai et al 2021 researched the risk of reservoir water supply dispatching caused by the uncertainty of water demand process in the water receiving area however these studies mentioned above only focused on the water supply risk of the whole system and ignored that the subsystems of reservoir water supply are inseparably interrelated which have significant effects on water resource allocation chen et al 2020 qiu et al 2021 hence on the basis stablishing the reservoir multi objective optimization dispatching model with agricultural irrigation economic benefit and ecological environment as objectives it is necessary to emphasize the synergy between each target in dispatching process it is expected to clarify the trade off relationship of each objective and contribute to the water supply risk analysis of reservoir dispatching reservoir multi objective optimal dispatching is a high dimensional nonlinear and multi stage combinatorial optimization problem there are many non inferior solution sets in multi objective optimization problems and multi criteria decision making mcdm is the frequently used method to solve these problems dong et al 2021b there is some decision making methods in the field of reservoir operation such as topsis ahp etc guo et al 2013 yang et al 2020 2021 however each method has its own application scope the vikor method was developed as a multicriteria decision making method to solve a discrete decision problem with noncommensurable and conflicting criteria opricovic and tzeng 2004 2007 it has the advantages of simple principles and can objectively reflect the real gap between decision schemes and the preponderance of vikor over the topsis method is that the compromise scheme obtained by the vikor method has priority and is closer to the ideal scheme in addition the crux to the application of vikor is to determine the indices weight rationally and the comprehensive empowerment of cooperative game cecg method is expected to effectively coordinate the game competition among agricultural economic and ecological objectives chi et al 2008 li et al 2022 thus a potential way is to apply the cecg method to vikor that way could assist decision makers in minimizing the interest conflicts among stakeholders in the water resources distribution system and provides a scientific and available method for select reservoir multi objective dispatch results in summary to attack the above problems with advantage this study is the first attempt to propose a comprehensive model framework by coupling copula joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the reservoir multi objective optimal operation model and multicriteria decision making cecg vikor method the copula joint distribution could comprehensively obtain the wetness dryness encounter variation rule of hydrological variables the reservoir optimal dispatching model could efficiently harmonize the irrigation economic and ecological objectives and the optimal dispatching results can be quickly and effectively selected finally evaluating the water supply risks of reservoir dispatching concerning the encounter uncertainty of precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream from a new inclination that is expected to achieve the sustainable development and food security of bia under different water supply conditions therefore this study aims to 1 construct joint distribution of precipitation and runoff by copula functions and calculate the joint distribution probability of different wetness dryness encountering scenarios 2 set up dispatching schemes according to encounter situations establish reservoir multi objective optimal dispatching model and solve it with nsga iii de 3 analyze the interaction among dispatching objectives and propose a cecg vikor model to realize the decision of optimal scheduling results 4 construct the risk evaluation indices system and the vikor model is employed to explore the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching under the encounter uncertainty of precipitation and runoff and the research is expected to provide a theoretical basis for reservoir dispatching management in irrigation areas 2 methodology this section develops a reservoir optimal operation and water supply risk assessment method considering the uncertainty of precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream entailing three main parts 1 description of joint uncertainty of precipitation and runoff 2 reservoir multi objective optimal operation and mcdm of operation results 3 water supply risk assessment of reservoir operation under uncertain water supply conditions the overall framework of this method is shown in fig 1 and the details description of each step is shown in the following sections 2 1 combined uncertainty of precipitation and runoff describing the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff was one of the cores of the water supply risk research for reservoir dispatching guo et al 2022 that could be embodied by the encounter scenarios with different probabilities of the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff in this study copula function is used to construct the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the theoretical advantage of copula function is that it can flexibly construct the joint distribution of any marginal distribution and accurately describe the correlation between multiple variables liu et al 2021 common copula functions include gaussian t copula clayton gumbel and frank the basic theory of copula is sklar theorem which constructs multi dimensional joint distribution by marginal distribution and correlation structure feng and li 2013 assume that x and y are continuous random variables and their marginal distribution functions are f x f y the unique bivariable joint distribution based on the copula function c x y can be expressed as 1 c x y c θ f x x f y y where c x y copula function and θ parameter to be determined since the overall distributions of f x x and f y y may be uncertain the empirical distributions of samples are calculated using nonparametric nuclear density estimation as an approximation of the distribution of population random variables multi variate copula functions of the archimedean family are often applied in the hydrology field and their binary copula functions are as follows gumbel hougaard copula 2 c x y exp lnu 1 θ lnu 2 θ 1 θ θ 1 clayton copula 3 c x y u 1 θ u 2 θ 1 θ θ 0 frank copula 4 c x y 1 θ i n 1 exp θ u 1 1 exp θ u 2 1 exp θ 1 θ r where u and v refer to the marginal distribution probability on the interval 0 1 respectively u 1 f x x u 2 f y y the maximum likelihood estimation mle is used to determine the parameters of the above three copula functions according to the empirical joint probability and theoretical joint probability of two dimensional variables the square euclidean distance ρ 2 ordinary least square ols regression and akaike information criterion aic are applied to evaluate the goodness of fit of the copula function cao et al 2021 eloranta et al 2018 2 2 multi objective optimal dispatching model of reservoir the upper plateau water supply system of the bia is composed of the linjiacun canal head reservoir and five reservoirs in the irrigation area since the multi objective dispatching of reservoir groups is a high dimensional and complex problem which is difficult to resolve thus it can be simplified as a single reservoir problem by the aggregation decomposition method pan et al 2020 in which the five reservoirs in the irrigation area can be aggregated into a virtual reservoir by the aggregation method only need to consider the linjiacun reservoir together with the attributes of storage capacity inflow and outflow in the virtual reservoir when establishing the model besides for the bia agricultural irrigation water should be considered first and then the economic benefits and ecological health also should be paid attention to therefore the minimum agricultural irrigation water shortage the maximum economic benefits and the minimum ecological water spill and shortage are taken as the objectives of the operation model since the main function of reservoirs in the bia is irrigation and there is no runoff be introduced into the water plant to supply domestic and industrial water thus the domestic and industrial water in the irrigation area is not considered in reservoir dispatching model and that will not affect the dispatching of reservoir operation model based on this the reservoir multi objective operation model in bia is established 2 2 1 objective function agricultural

ecological water demand satisfaction etc ecological water spill and shortage i e the amount of water discharged from river after reservoir dispatching outside the range of ecological water spill and

is an optimization algorithm for solving high dimensional multi objective problems nsga iii algorithm adds a method based on reference point to nsga ii to deal with high dimensional multi objective optimization problems which can make the population have good distribution the nsga iii de algorithm in the framework of the geatpy genetic algorithm replaces the generation method of the nsga iii progeny population with the mutation operator de rand 1 bin in the differential evolution algorithm which can enrich the diversity of the progeny population ensure a more accurate global search ability and significantly improve the calculation efficiency of optimization opara and arabas 2019 2 3 multi criteria decision making model by coupling comprehensive empowerment of cooperative game cecg with vikor 2 3 1 comprehensive empowerment of cooperative game cecg comprehensive empowerment of cooperative game cecg is a weighting method which combines multiple weights to determine comprehensive weights cooperative game is a cooperative way which is a thought to analyze the mutual competition and coordination among evaluation objects according to the cooperative game theory the results of total subjective weight ahp and objective weight entropy weight can be obtained it can reduce the one sided impact of the single weight method on the weight and thoroughly and scientifically determine the weight of each objective value in the reservoir dispatching model the steps to determine the weight are as follows 1 l methods are used to weight the indicators and construct the initial weight set u k u k 1 u k 2 u km k 1 2 l 15 u k 1 l α k u k t α k 0 u is a possible weight vector based on the initial weight set the l linear combination coefficients in the eq 15 are optimized with the goal of minimizing the deviation between u and u k 16 min j 1 l α j u j t u i i 1 2 l 2 normalized α 1 α 2 α l is obtained by optimizing the first derivative condition of eq 16 that is the required comprehensive weight 2 3 2 the cecg vikor model as outlined above the comprehensive weight in cecg can be expanded to many forms and provide chances to utilize it in conjunction with mcdm models therefore we construct the cecg vikor model by coupling comprehensive weight in cecg and vikor the vikor method was developed for multi criteria decision making problems of complex systems opricovic and tzeng 2004 sari 2021 this method introduces the multicriteria ranking indices based on the particular measure of closeness to the ideal solution and focuses on ranking and selecting from a set of alternatives in the presence of conflicting criteria it determines compromise solutions for a problem with conflicting criteria which can help the decision makers to reach a final decision here the compromise solution is a feasible solution which is the closest to the ideal and a compromise means an agreement established by mutual concessions opricovic and tzeng 2007 simsek et al 2022 taking the values of aiws eb and ewss in the pareto solution set of the reservoir optimal dispatching model as the decision criteria the vikor method is used to obtain the comprehensive optimal operation result in the solution set the compromise ranking method vikor has the following steps 1 assume that there are m dispatching results and n indices to form the initial matrix x ij x ij n m the decision matrix y ij y ij n m is created as follows 17 y i j x i j min j x i j max j x i j min j x i j j i 1 max j x i j x i j max j x i j min j x i j j i 2 where i 1 2 n j 1

maximum group utility and the minimum r i refers to the individual regret of the opponent w j is the weight value of the jth indices which is determined by the cecg compute the values q i 21 q i v s i min s i max s i min s i 1 v r i min r i max r i min r i where v is introduced as a weight for the strategy of maximum group utility rank the alternatives sorting by the values s r and q in decreasing order the results are three ranking lists 3 study area and data baojixia irrigation area bia located in the western part of guanzhong plain shaanxi province china was selected as study area fig 2 the total area of the bia is approximately 2355 km2 the bia was divided into two parts the upper part and the lower part this study only focuses on the upper part the effective irrigation area of the bia is about 1202 km2 it belongs to the middle reaches of the weihe river the irrigation water source in the upper irrigation area comes from the runoff of the weihe river in addition the annual precipitation in bia is approximately 551 4 mm mainly from june to october while that in upstream watershed of bia is 405 3 mm such greatly variation is caused by the influence of the different microclimatic conditions complicated underlying surface and intense human activities in the water source rivers and the irrigation district thus there are large uncertainties of the precipitation in bia and runoff from the weihe river which could bring many water supply risks for reservoir dispatching of irrigation area the irrigation area now has six medium sized reservoirs from west to east along the upper trunk channel of the plateau which are linjiacun reservoir wangjiaya reservoir xinyigou reservoir dabeigou reservoir ganhe reservoir and second ganhe reservoir in turn the main functions of linjiacun reservoir are irrigation water supply taking into account power generation flood control and water storage with normal storage water level 636 00 m dead water level 626 00 m total storage capacity 50 million m3 beneficial reservoir capacity 38 million m3 installed capacity 8000 kw other reservoirs are mainly irrigation reservoirs with comprehensive functions of flood control and aquaculture the monthly runoff data measured at linjiacun hydrological station are from the yellow river basin hydrological yearbook 1980 2017 and the precipitation data 1980 2017 of bia including baoji fufeng meixian jingyang liquan qianxian wugong xingping xianyang are from shaanxi meteorological bureau daily meteorological data from 1980 to 2017 were from the china meteorological data sharing service network http data cma cn including precipitation p sunshine duration n average temperature t maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m above the ground u2 the crop pattern and irrigation water utilization coefficient of irrigation area is from the annual report of baojixia irrigation area 2010 2017 the crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated by food and agriculture organization fao 56 penman monteith method and the monthly irrigation water demand of bia was further determined 4 results and discussion 4 1 joint uncertainty of precipitation and runoff based on copula 4 1 1 correlation analysis of precipitation and runoff this section aimed to estimate the correlation of the precipitation in irrigation area and the runoff from the upstream of the wei river by employing the copula approach among precipitation in irrigation area is the average precipitation at 9 stations runoff from the upstream of the wei river is from linjiacun station which refers to the reservoir inflow calculating the correlation coefficient between precipitation and runoff precipitation and runoff exhibited a weak linear relationship with the kendall rank correlation coefficient and spearman correlation coefficient of 0 266 and 0 3794 it indicated that the encounter of precipitation and runoff was highly random and uncertainty existed in the process of water supply and demand for reservoir dispatching water supply risk might exist in the bia bia located in the arid area of northwest china is the largest irrigation area in shaanxi province the irrigation water source of the bia is mainly the runoff from upstream of the weihe river however the upstream weihe river belongs to mountainous rivers and the bia is located in guanzhong plain therefore the spatiotemporal differences of meteorological and hydrological variables are quite large from the upstream to downstream within the watershed which results in a weak correlation between the precipitation in irrigation area and the runoff from upstream of wei river there is uncertainty for agricultural water supply in irrigation areas under the natural and irrigation water sources which would lead to a potential agriculture water supply risk 4 1 2 the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the copula function with the best goodness of fit was selected from gumbel hougaard frank and clayton copula to show the joint probability distribution of precipitation and runoff in order to select the best copula the comparison between different copulas and empirical copulas were used the results were shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the fitting accuracy of the joint distribution based on the three copula functions was high enough where the fitting of clayton copula r2 0 9921 was close to that of gumbel hougaard copula r2 0 9927 consequently to accurately determine the copula function with a better goodness of fit according to the empirical joint probability and theoretical joint probability of two dimensional variables the square euclidean distance ρ 2 ordinary least squares ols and akaike information criterion aic were utilized to estimate the copula functions the estimated parameters and goodness of fit test of copula functions are given in table 1 as noted in table 1 the clayton copula had the lowest ρ 2 ols and aic with values of 0 0201 0 0230 and 284 74 respectively therefore the clayton copula was employed to construct the joint probability distribution of precipitation and runoff series the joint distribution function and contour plot based on clayton copula of precipitation and runoff were shown in fig 4 similar to the above results huang and ochoa 2022 applied clayton copula to establish a connection between the two indices based on simple constructions and stable properties of clayton copula in addition clayton copula also has good adaptability to fitting flood and drought variables eskandaripour and soltaninia 2022 gabriel and fan 2022 therefore the strong performance of clayton copula can establish the connection between precipitation and runoff with effect which is conducive to the description of uncertainty between them later 4 1 3 encounter uncertainty of precipitation and runoff according to the frequency the precipitation and runoff were classified into 3 states as wet p 37 5 normal 37 5 p 62 5 and dry p 62 5 chinese national standard gb t 50095 98 assuming w n and d were wet normal and dry flow states x and y represented precipitation and runoff series respectively the description of the nine situations and their joint distribution probability jdp was given in table 2 in addition to verify that the copula joint distribution of precipitation and runoff is reasonable it needs to be compared with the actual situation the historical precipitation and runoff series 1980 2017 could be divided into 9 encounter situations fig 5 according to the set rules and the empirical frequency of precipitation and runoff series over the years based on this the actual encounter probability aep of precipitation and runoff can be obtained the aep refers to the actual occurrence probability of wetness dryness encounter classification of the historical precipitation and runoff from 1980 to 2017 which could reflect the actual wetness dryness encounter characteristics of precipitation and runoff in the historical series at bia the precondition for analyzing the water supply risk under the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff was to compute the occurrence probability of different situations according to eq 1 and fig 5 the jdp and aep of precipitation and runoff were calculated and it could be divided into two situations the synchronous and asynchronous encounter probability table 3 the results in the table 3 showed that the asynchronous jdp of the situation2 w n was equal to the asynchronous jdp of the situation4 n w with the value of 10 15 the asynchronous jdp of the situation3 w d was equal to the asynchronous jdp of the situation7 d w with the value of 6 56 and the asynchronous jdp of the situation6 n d was equal to the asynchronous jdp of the situation8 d n with the value of 7 44 likewise asynchronous aep also has three equal pairs of situations however the synchronous jdp of the situation9 d d was 23 50 which was the largest among all situations in the jdp the synchronous aep of the situation1 w w was equal to situation9 d d with the largest value of 18 42 moreover in arid northwest china water scarcity usually occurred due to small amount of water resource zhang et al 2022 the situation9 d d referred to a shortage of natural and irrigated agriculture water supply which was the most disadvantageous situation for water resource allocation in irrigation areas the results indicated that two agriculture water supply was unstable and water supply risks most likely exist in the bia previous studies have tended to study water supply risk in the context of natural water supply and demand by using copula functions to establish a joint distribution of precipitation and crop water demand zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2021c developed a model by integrating the monte carlo copula and markov process and constructed the joint distribution of crop water requirements et c and effective precipitation p e to analyze agricultural water shortages risk that model provided a more secure and reliable result of assessing the agricultural water shortage risk which had an important theoretical guidance for further agricultural risk decision making in addition the research of zhao et al 2021 was also consistent with described above a copula based risk analysis of agricultural water shortage under natural precipitation conditions in the guanzhong plain was taken it showed that there was a large probability of an unfavorable water balance situation under the natural supply condition in the bia therefore the combination of copula distribution and wetness dryness encounter analysis can be a good way to analyze the uncertainty risk of regional water supply and demand however as the irrigated agriculture water supply runoff was an indispensable water source in the irrigation area was neglected hence the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff was constructed for researching the encounter characteristics of two agriculture water supply in addition the jdp and aep of asynchronous encounter was 48 3 and 52 63 and that of synchronous was 51 7 and 47 37 respectively there was a little relative error between the jdp based on copula function and aep in the 9 encounter situations of precipitation and runoff thus considering that the jdp of precipitation and runoff described by copula function could approximately represent the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff in the study area 4 2 multi objective optimization dispatching results 4 2 1 scheme setting agricultural water demand in irrigation areas was supplied by both natural and irrigated agricultural water supplies that is precipitation and runoff the irrigation water requirement calculated based on etc depended on the amount of effective precipitation the more effective precipitation the less irrigation water demand the irrigation water demand is satisfied by the reservoir dispatching and irrigation available water supply of reservoir depends on runoff namely the variation of incoming water and water demand during reservoir operation corresponds to the change of rainfall in irrigation area and runoff from upstream therefore according to the 9 encounter situations of precipitation and runoff showed in the section 4 1 3 the 9 design representative years could be chosen reservoir dispatching complied with irrigation water demand and water supply in representative years assuming p p and p r are the precipitation and runoff frequency respectively the 9 reservoir dispatching schemes were set up in the light of 9 situations in table 2 considering the precipitation status the scheme can be divided into three categories a precipitation state is wet bia has abundant precipitation and little irrigation water demand and water demand process is monthly water demand in year with p p 37 5 b precipitation state is n bia has medium precipitation and irrigation water demand and water demand process is monthly water demand in year with 37 5 p p 62 5 and c precipitation state is d precipitation in bia is scarce and irrigation water demand is large and water demand process is monthly water demand in year with 62 5 p p each type of these schemes has three situations of wet normal or dry incoming water from the river reservoir operation schemes are set as follows a1 water inflow process is runoff process in year with p p 37 5 p r 37 5 a2 water inflow process is runoff process in year with p p 37 5 37 5 p r 62 5 a3 water inflow process is runoff process in year with p p 37 5 62 5 p r b1 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 37 5 p p 62 5 p r 37 5 b2 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 37 5 p p 62 5 37 5 p r 62 5 b3 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 37 5 p p 62 5 62 5 p r c1 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 62 5 p p p r 37 5 c2 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 62 5 p p 37 5 p r 62 5 and c3 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 62 5 p p 62 5 p r 4 2 2 model establishment and solution the multi objective dispatching model of the reservoir in bia introduced in section 2 2 was constructed among ten day was the calculation step in flood season june october and a month was the calculation step in other periods the number of dispatching periods t in eq 5 was 22 the grid price of linjiacun reservoir a t in eq 6 was 0 3 yuan kw h comprehensive output coefficient of power plant k 8 the elasticity of water resource output γ in eq 7 was 0 087 coefficient of technological progress λ 0 319 year series m 38 the decision variable was water level of reservoir in each period according to the nsga iii de model was optimized based on the 9 schemes mentioned in section 4 2 1 where population size was 120 the crossover probability was 0 7 the mutation rate was 0 5 and the number of iterations was 200 the pareto solution of the multi objective optimization dispatching problem and its projection on the two dimensional plane was shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 the pareto front is approximately distributed on a spatial curve in schemes a1 a2 b1 and c1 the aiws of each scheme tends to be a fixed value and they are increased with the decrease of water inflow and increase of water demand moreover the two dimensional projections of aiws and eb and aiws and ewss are two lines parallel to the symmetric axis so it can be seen that aiws hardly changes with eb and ewss the reason for this is that aiws increases with the decrease of available water resources and in these schemes the available water resources are relatively sufficient and irrigation water consumption does not conflict with the other two objectives the distribution of the pareto front of scheme b2 is very uniform in contrast pareto front of schemes a3 b3 c2 and c3 is more centralized and there is an obvious compatible relationship between aiws and eb with the reduction of aiws eb exhibits an increasing trend all of which tend to distribute water to reduce aiwb while obtaining higher eb however eb and ewss restrict each other and the increase in eb is proportional to the increase of ewss which indicates that there is a contradiction between the economic development of irrigation areas and downstream ecological protection benefit an unreasonable water distribution scheme may result in a triple deficit of irrigation water supply inadequate power generation water supply and poor ecological conditions for reservoir operation model with multiple operation objectives it contains a series of complex constraints and requires multi criteria decision making li et al 2017 a certain amount of water needs to be maintained under each individual function which leads to a series of potential water conflicts multi objective optimization methods can provide desired results through tradeoff analysis among such competing objectives asadzadeh et al 2014 tariku et al 2021 used a stochastic dual dynamic programming sddp algorithm and a hydro economic model to optimize hydropower production and irrigated agriculture uen et al 2018 explored synergistic benefits of water food energy nexus through multi objective reservoir optimization scheme the results provided a scientific basis for planning similarly the reservoir multi objective optimization dispatching model with agricultural irrigation economic benefit and ecological environment as objectives is expected to emphasize the relationship of mutual feedback between each target therefore we need to coordinate the relationship among the three and adopt the following methods to select the optimal scheduling results 4 2 3 the cecg vikor model for mcdm in this study we run the cecg vikor model introduced in section 2 3 to find the most superior expected reservoir scheduling solution among the cecg vikor model the subjective weighting method ahp gave higher subjective weight to aiws according to the actual situation that irrigation was the main water consumption in the irrigation area combining with the objective weighting method entropy weight method the comprehensive weights of balanced subjective and objective factors were calculated by the eq 15 and eq 16 the comprehensive weighting results were shown in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the weight of aiws increases with the decrease of available water resources and increase of water demand in addition the weight of ewss accounts for the largest proportion the main reason is that among the three objectives the values of aiws and eb have a relatively small gap with the results of the same dispatching scheme while the gap between the values of ewss in the results of the same dispatching scheme is larger than that of aiws and eb which plays a more obvious role in the comparison and selection of schemes as described in section 2 1 1 three objectives including aiws eb and ewss are selected as the decision criteria these criteria are comprised of benefit and cost criteria among which eb belongs to benefit criteria while aiws and ewss are cost criteria i e the smaller represents the better according to eqs 17 21 s r and q of 120 dispatching results of each dispatching scheme are calculated and ranked the decision coefficient v 0 5 on the basis of the analysis results obtained by the vikor the ranking of the best alternatives for each reservoir dispatching scheme is presented in table 5 the q rankings of schemes a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 c1 c2 and c3 are shown in table 5 according to this the optimal scheduling results of each scheme are r104 r116 r66 r95 r5 r28 r117 r89 and r110 the position of the optimal scheduling results in the pareto solution of each scheme is shown in fig 6 where the optimal scheduling results selected by each scheme are in the middle and lower part of the solution set which belongs to the region with large aiws and small eb and ewss the result indicted that the optimal scheduling results selected by the model sacrifice the benefits of aiws and eb in exchange for the benefits of ewss to a certain extent while emphasizing agricultural and economic development ecological protection must not be slackened due to the baojixia water diversion works have direct impacts on river hydrology wu et al 2012 in recent years many studies have shown that vikor model is preferred for multicriteria decision making pourebrahim et al 2014 simsek et al 2022 that is profited from the vikor method has the advantages of simple principles and can objectively reflect the real gap between decision schemes in addition the cecg is also one of the cores of coordinating the game competition among agricultural economic and ecological objectives after the cecg combined the vikor model it become a way to effectively select the optimal dispatching results from the pareto solution of the multi objective optimization dispatching 4 2 4 comparison with actual conditions the framework of the uncertainty based reservoir dispatching model that is developed in this study regards the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff process connects reservoir multi objective optimal scheduling that is the encounter situation of precipitation and runoff is the input basis of the reservoir operation model under different schemes to verify the rationality of the nine representative schemes set in this study the actual variation ranges of reservoir dispatching objective values in nine encounter situations can be obtained according to the reservoir dispatching results each year from 1980 to 2017 and the classification results shown in fig 5 this paper compares the dispatching results of the developed framework under nine schemes with actual conditions in nine encounter situations all the comparisons are calculated on the same baseline that is they share the same parameters for calculation the optimal scheduling solution and the actual variation range of reservoir dispatching objective values were shown in table 6 and table 7 respectively as shown in tables 6 and 7 most of the aiws and eb in scheme a are close to its actual variation range in addition ecological water spill accounts for the majority of the ewss in each scheme but the main concern is whether the ecological water shortage accords with the actual variation range for water supply risk analysis while the ecological water shortage conforms to the actual variation range in class a schemes this indicted that the optimal scheduling solution of reservoir operation tally with the actual situation of this type of scheme that is similar to the result of scheme b objective values that fit the actual variation range account for the vast majority besides in scheme c aiws is slightly higher than the upper limit of the actual variation range and other values are approximately within their actual variation ranges the reason may be that inevitable randomness still exists in actual hydrological phenomena the degree of agricultural water shortage varies from crop to crop and available water is distributed unevenly within a year zhao et al 2021 however which can help decision makers make appropriate decisions under extreme conditions therefore as a whole the settings of the nine schemes can fully show the changes in different precipitation and runoff encounter situations this study considers that the scheme settings are reasonable and can be used to further study the water supply risk of reservoir operation under uncertain conditions 4 3 risk analysis of water supply for reservoir dispatching under uncertainty conditions 4 3 1 water supply risk analysis reservoir operation risk indices was constructed for specific risk problems faced by reservoir operation this study carried out a risk assessment of reservoir dispatching water supply for problems such as water resources shortage outstanding contradiction between water supply and demand and reduction of ecological flow li et al 2016 irrigation water supply risk was commonly measured by probability of irrigation but it could only indicate the reliability of water supply and could not express the adequacy of water supply guo et al 2013 moreover the economic benefits and ecological health loss risks faced by the reservoir dispatching scheme when the water supply is insufficient also need to be evaluated therefore the monthly probability of irrigation mpi and total water deficient ratio of irrigation twdi were selected to report the reliability and adequacy of irrigation water supply as well as the risk rates of insufficient economic benefit rieb and risk rates of insufficient ecological basic flow rief were chosen the risk indices were calculated according to the optimal scheduling solution of each scheme table 8 among the rieb refers to the probability of loss caused by the economic benefit not reaching the expected target produced by reservoir operation it can be expressed by the ratio of the period in which the economic benefit does not reach a certain proportion of the expected total economic benefit to the total period this paper takes the proportion as 20 the rief refers to the ratio between the period when the ecological flow is less than the minimum discharging ecological flow and the total period the minimum discharging flow of the linjiacun section is 5 4 m³ s in this study zhang et al 2011 according to table 8 the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching can be analyzed by the risk indices it can be seen from table 8 that the mpi decreases from 100 to 50 with a downward trend the twdi increases from 0 to 49 01 with an obvious upward trend and the rief also tends to increase significantly in the three types of schemes a b and c respectively the rieb remained stable at 45 45 in schemes a and b and increased from 31 82 to 40 91 in schemes c according to their changing trend it can be demonstrated that agricultural water supply risk is most sensitive to changes in water supply and demand followed by ecological water supply risk in addition under the same conditions of precipitation in the three types of a b and c schemes the variation trend of all risk indices is the same as above as the runoff becomes dry among the scheme a1 experience zero agricultural irrigation and ecological health water supply risk while the scheme c3 is in the highest water supply risk generally hence it should be emphasized that c3 the extreme water shortage scheme with the least water inflow and the most water demand has mpi twdi and rief of 50 40 29 and 18 18 respectively the greatest risk among the c3 schemes indicates that both agricultural irrigation water supply and ecological health are facing high risks under extreme water shortage scenarios in general the results indicate that the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching increases gradually with the decrease of available water and the increase of water demand gao et al 2018 concluded that the scale of the agricultural shortage is significantly correlated with uncertain water availability which was in line with our conclusions and agricultural water shortages are inevitable especially in arid regions davidsen et al 2015 gao et al 2018 therefore according to precipitation and runoff encounter scenarios classified by different agricultural water supply degrees it is necessary to determine the response rule of water supply risk of reservoir dispatching to water supply uncertainty and carry out risk assessment research under uncertain conditions as follows 4 3 2 risk level assessment of water supply under uncertainty conditions this study aimed to assess the water supply risk level of reservoir dispatching based on the uncertainty of downstream precipitation and upstream runoff which could further understand the variation law of water supply risk of reservoir dispatching in irrigation areas under uncertainty disturbance therefore it is necessary to assess the risk level of the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching by the risk indices evaluation standard the water supply risk level of the reservoir dispatching scheme can be divided into five levels i v li et al 2016 a lower water supply risk level i means the system has a better tolerance of water supply risk table 9 classifies evaluation indices factors water supply risk under uncertainty conditions can be obtained by the jdp of different encounter scenarios and the water supply risk level of reservoir dispatching the jdp of precipitation and runoff is introduced as one of the evaluation criteria it is better to assume that the higher the jdp when the precipitation or runoff state is wet the smaller the jdp when the precipitation or runoff state is dry and the mpi belongs to benefit criteria the smaller represents the better while the twdi rieb and rief are cost criteria i e the smaller represents the better based on the water supply risk level and jdp of precipitation and runoff of each scheme the comprehensive risk level of each scheme is divided by vikor method fig 7 and table 8 shows the final evaluation results as noted in fig 7 and table 8 the a1 scheme with a water supply risk of level ⅰ corresponds to w w encounter scenario and the jdp is 20 80 this scheme has the least water demand and the most available water is the lowest risk scheme the a2 a3 and b1 schemes belong to w n w d and d w situations respectively they have the same risk level ⅱ in which the jdp of a2 and b1 are equal to 10 15 slightly higher than 6 56 of a3 the water supply risk of b2 b3 and c1 schemes is level ⅲ corresponding to d d d n and n w situations and their jdp is 7 40 7 44 and 6 56 the c2 scheme and c3 have the same risk level in mpi twdi rieb and rief but the jdp of c3 is 23 50 more than that of c2 7 44 therefore the risk of c2 scheme is level ⅳ while the c3 scheme have the highest risk of level ⅴ in addition the c3 scheme is determined by d d situation which is an extreme water shortage scenario and the jdp of c3 is the highest effective risk management measures should be taken first for that scenario in general it can be seen that water supply risk levels of each dispatching scheme are mostly less than or equal to level iii and risk level i and risk level ii mostly occurring in situations with less water demand and more water supply as a whole bia is still in the category of acceptable risks or brink risks for water supply of reservoir dispatching zhao et al 2021 had a likeness conclusion as described the results can demonstrate that the water supply risk level for reservoir dispatching increases with the decrease of water available for a certain water demand level the water supply risk is significantly affected by the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff as two sources of agricultural water supply that is similar to result of li et al 2016 and gao et al 2018 therefore it is of great significance to take reasonable engineering measures to adjust water consumption and made full use of water resources to solve local imbalance between supply and demand in the bia due to the influence of uncertainty in precipitation and runoff 5 conclusions in this study a novel integrated modeling framework was proposed by coupling copula joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the reservoir multi objective operation model and the cecg vikor model to evaluate the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching considering the encounter uncertainty of precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream the main novelties of this study are 1 the clayton copula joint distribution is employed to thoroughly and effectively describe the wetness dryness encounter uncertainty of the precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream which reflect the wetness dryness encounter relationship of the natural and irrigated agricultural water sources 2 the optimal reservoir operation model has underlined the synergy between agriculture economy and ecology operation objectives and is efficiently solved by nsga iii de 3 the cecg vikor model is proposed to harmonize the trade off relationship between each objective and choose the optimal scheduling results from 120 solutions of each scheme 4 the proposed integrated modeling framework enables a deep analysis of water supply risk under various agricultural water supply conditions and has exhaustive progressive systematic and efficient features the application of the developed framework in the bia in arid areas of northwest china demonstrates its feasibility and applicability the conclusions are as follows 1 the integrated modeling framework is an important approach for assessing agriculture water supply risk which has comprehensive advanced and efficient features 2 weak correlation between precipitation and runoff results in uncertainty of water supply conditions the clayton copula was found to be more suitable to estimate the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the jdp of the situation9 d d was 23 50 which was the largest among all situations in the jdp and indicated that there was a large probability of an unfavorable water balance situation in the bia 3 there was an obvious compatible relationship between aiws and eb while eb and ewss restrict each other the optimal scheduling results of the 9 schemes were r104 r116 r66 r95 r5 r28 r117 r89 and r110 respectively setting of reservoir dispatching scheme was reasonable 4 an evaluation indices system of agricultural water supply risk in bia was established which composed of the monthly probability of irrigation mpi total water deficient ratio of irrigation twdi risk rates of insufficient economic benefit rieb and risk rates of insufficient ecological basic flow rief 5 among the results of 9 scheduling schemes the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching in bia increased gradually with the decrease of available water supply and the increase of water demand and below middle and middle water supply risk were mainly faced by the scheme a and b with an occurrence probability of 62 47 while the scheme c had a high risk with an occurrence probability of 37 53 in bia among the scheme c3 was extreme water shortage with the highest jdp 23 50 and the greatest water supply risk level ⅴ 6 the integrated modeling framework combines the evolution of hydrological process and regional optimum allocation of water resources and can help decision makers learn the water supply risk under uncertainty of precipitation and runoff that framework is expected to be well used in risk analysis of water supply in irrigation areas under uncertainty condition in order to improve the capacity of the reservoir dispatching water supply risk assessment model framework to solve practical problems under uncertainty it is also necessary to select different irrigation areas to confirm and enhance this paper focuses on the uncertainty analysis of precipitation and runoff but does not consider all the factors that will affect the reservoir dispatching process for the bia especially the potential evapotranspiration which better reflects the water demand for agricultural irrigation therefore when both precipitation runoff and potential evapotranspiration are considered in the uncertainty analysis the more complex uncertainty risk problem is also worth further

9102,the precipitation in irrigation area and the runoff from upstream can reflect the natural and irrigated agriculture water supply situations the wetness dryness encounter uncertainty of precipitation and runoff affected by the different microclimate in the basin can lead to the potential water supply risk of reservoir dispatching which poses a threat to food security this study develops an innovative integrated modeling framework by coupling copula joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the reservoir multi objective optimal operation model and multi criteria decision making cecg vikor method to assess agriculture water supply risk in the baojixia irrigation area bia of northwest china the results indicated that the integrated methodology is an important tool for assessing agriculture water supply risk which has comprehensive advanced and efficient features the correlation between the precipitation in bia and runoff from upstream is weak which can lead to a high uncertainty of the natural and irrigated agriculture water supply conditions the clayton copula was more suitable for estimating the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff and there was a large probability of an unfavorable water balance situation in the bia with the extreme water shortage encounter condition of precipitation and runoff had the maximum joint distribution probability of 23 50 the 9 scheduling schemes were set up according to encounter scenarios and whose optimal scheduling results are r104 r116 r66 r95 r5 r28 r117 r89 and r110 respectively among the 9 optimal scheduling results the water supply risk in bia increased with the decrease of available water supply and the increase of water demand below middle and middle water supply risk were mainly faced by scheme a and b with an occurrence probability of 62 47 while scheme c had a high risk with an occurrence probability of 37 53 in bia the research results can provide a scientific basis for reservoir dispatching risk research and new ideas for making dispatching plans keywords reservoir dispatching water supply risk copula method multi objective optimal baojixia irrigation area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the water shortage has prominently restricted the sustainable development of the social economy and ecological environment especially in irrigation agriculture districts in arid northwest china chang et al 2016 li et al 2021a li et al 2016 li et al 2021b zhang et al 2021b zhao et al 2021 reservoir dispatching as an effective way to realize the spatial temporal redistribution of water resources is of paramount importance for alleviating the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources and the sustainable development of irrigation areas bai et al 2021 dariane et al 2021 dong et al 2021a zhang et al 2021a agriculture water supply is the dominant user of the world s fresh water which feeds the world s growing population li et al 2021b the precipitation in the irrigation area and the runoff from the upstream can reflect the natural and irrigated agriculture water supply situations gong et al 2020 maleki et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b however as the meteorological and hydrological elements are affected by the different microclimate complicated underlying surface and intense human activities in the water source rivers and the irrigation district the wetness dryness encounter of precipitation in the irrigation area and upstream runoff has shown strong randomness which can contribute the uncertainty of agriculture water supply and bring the water supply risks for reservoir operation guo et al 2022 li et al 2016 wu et al 2019a therefore it is essential to integrate the wetness dryness encounter uncertainty of precipitation and runoff into reservoir s optimal operation and agriculture water supply risk analysis in the irrigation areas which can provide the scientific guidance for water resources planning and management under different water supply conditions and effectively deal with drought risk and support the sustainable development of irrigation areas and food security the growing water deficit in the irrigation area indicates that it is necessary to analyze the not only the complex relationship of the water supply and demand but also the wetness dryness encounter relationship of multi water sources of agriculture water supply ahmadi et al 2018 du et al 2019 wu et al 2019b zhao et al 2021 the encounter of effective precipitation and crop water requirements are employed to analyze the natural agriculture water shortage risk zhang et al 2022 2021c zhao et al 2021 li et al 2021b analysis the joint occurrence probabilities of runoff and et 0 combinations to explore the uncertainties in water supply and demand zhang et al 2017 researched water shortage risks under the contexts of natural water supply and demand by the joint probability distribution of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration however they focus only on the impact of the wetness dryness encounter of different water supply such as precipitation and runoff and demand on the relationship of agriculture water supply and demand the wetness dryness encounter relationship of precipitation and runoff as multi water sources tended to be neglected in agriculture water supply and the joint occurrence probabilities of the precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream did not be explored in the agriculture water supply risk research the encounter scenarios of precipitation and runoff with different occurrence probability can reflect the uncertainty of agriculture water supply feng et al 2010 liu et al 2015 the wetness dryness encounter relationship of precipitation and runoff is essentially a multivariable joint probability problem many methods have been used to analyze the encounter of hydrological variables such as empirical frequency method multivariate normal distribution method moran method fgm method bayesian network theory method and set pair analysis method feng et al 2010 kang et al 2010 zhang et al 2021d however these methods mentioned above cannot effectively deal with the internal relationship of the interdependent hydrological variables in hydrological processes and most of these multivariate probability distribution methods require that variables follow a same marginal distribution to overcome these issues the copulas method is introduced into the multivariate hydrological variables analysis ahmadi et al 2018 du et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2019 tahroudi et al 2020 the copula method has the advantage of that it can describe the dependence structures among the variables more accurately and is not assume marginals to be normal or independent any marginal distribution can be connected by copula to form a joint distribution which contains all the information of variables wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 therefore constructing the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff by the copula can comprehensively describe the uncertainty of the agriculture water supply at present abundant research achievements have been made on the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching gu et al 2012 guo et al 2013 gu et al 2008 established a reservoir dispatching model with the maximum water supply as the objective to analyze the water supply risk based on the uncertainty of incoming water and water use bai et al 2021 researched the risk of reservoir water supply dispatching caused by the uncertainty of water demand process in the water receiving area however these studies mentioned above only focused on the water supply risk of the whole system and ignored that the subsystems of reservoir water supply are inseparably interrelated which have significant effects on water resource allocation chen et al 2020 qiu et al 2021 hence on the basis stablishing the reservoir multi objective optimization dispatching model with agricultural irrigation economic benefit and ecological environment as objectives it is necessary to emphasize the synergy between each target in dispatching process it is expected to clarify the trade off relationship of each objective and contribute to the water supply risk analysis of reservoir dispatching reservoir multi objective optimal dispatching is a high dimensional nonlinear and multi stage combinatorial optimization problem there are many non inferior solution sets in multi objective optimization problems and multi criteria decision making mcdm is the frequently used method to solve these problems dong et al 2021b there is some decision making methods in the field of reservoir operation such as topsis ahp etc guo et al 2013 yang et al 2020 2021 however each method has its own application scope the vikor method was developed as a multicriteria decision making method to solve a discrete decision problem with noncommensurable and conflicting criteria opricovic and tzeng 2004 2007 it has the advantages of simple principles and can objectively reflect the real gap between decision schemes and the preponderance of vikor over the topsis method is that the compromise scheme obtained by the vikor method has priority and is closer to the ideal scheme in addition the crux to the application of vikor is to determine the indices weight rationally and the comprehensive empowerment of cooperative game cecg method is expected to effectively coordinate the game competition among agricultural economic and ecological objectives chi et al 2008 li et al 2022 thus a potential way is to apply the cecg method to vikor that way could assist decision makers in minimizing the interest conflicts among stakeholders in the water resources distribution system and provides a scientific and available method for select reservoir multi objective dispatch results in summary to attack the above problems with advantage this study is the first attempt to propose a comprehensive model framework by coupling copula joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the reservoir multi objective optimal operation model and multicriteria decision making cecg vikor method the copula joint distribution could comprehensively obtain the wetness dryness encounter variation rule of hydrological variables the reservoir optimal dispatching model could efficiently harmonize the irrigation economic and ecological objectives and the optimal dispatching results can be quickly and effectively selected finally evaluating the water supply risks of reservoir dispatching concerning the encounter uncertainty of precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream from a new inclination that is expected to achieve the sustainable development and food security of bia under different water supply conditions therefore this study aims to 1 construct joint distribution of precipitation and runoff by copula functions and calculate the joint distribution probability of different wetness dryness encountering scenarios 2 set up dispatching schemes according to encounter situations establish reservoir multi objective optimal dispatching model and solve it with nsga iii de 3 analyze the interaction among dispatching objectives and propose a cecg vikor model to realize the decision of optimal scheduling results 4 construct the risk evaluation indices system and the vikor model is employed to explore the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching under the encounter uncertainty of precipitation and runoff and the research is expected to provide a theoretical basis for reservoir dispatching management in irrigation areas 2 methodology this section develops a reservoir optimal operation and water supply risk assessment method considering the uncertainty of precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream entailing three main parts 1 description of joint uncertainty of precipitation and runoff 2 reservoir multi objective optimal operation and mcdm of operation results 3 water supply risk assessment of reservoir operation under uncertain water supply conditions the overall framework of this method is shown in fig 1 and the details description of each step is shown in the following sections 2 1 combined uncertainty of precipitation and runoff describing the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff was one of the cores of the water supply risk research for reservoir dispatching guo et al 2022 that could be embodied by the encounter scenarios with different probabilities of the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff in this study copula function is used to construct the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the theoretical advantage of copula function is that it can flexibly construct the joint distribution of any marginal distribution and accurately describe the correlation between multiple variables liu et al 2021 common copula functions include gaussian t copula clayton gumbel and frank the basic theory of copula is sklar theorem which constructs multi dimensional joint distribution by marginal distribution and correlation structure feng and li 2013 assume that x and y are continuous random variables and their marginal distribution functions are f x f y the unique bivariable joint distribution based on the copula function c x y can be expressed as 1 c x y c θ f x x f y y where c x y copula function and θ parameter to be determined since the overall distributions of f x x and f y y may be uncertain the empirical distributions of samples are calculated using nonparametric nuclear density estimation as an approximation of the distribution of population random variables multi variate copula functions of the archimedean family are often applied in the hydrology field and their binary copula functions are as follows gumbel hougaard copula 2 c x y exp lnu 1 θ lnu 2 θ 1 θ θ 1 clayton copula 3 c x y u 1 θ u 2 θ 1 θ θ 0 frank copula 4 c x y 1 θ i n 1 exp θ u 1 1 exp θ u 2 1 exp θ 1 θ r where u and v refer to the marginal distribution probability on the interval 0 1 respectively u 1 f x x u 2 f y y the maximum likelihood estimation mle is used to determine the parameters of the above three copula functions according to the empirical joint probability and theoretical joint probability of two dimensional variables the square euclidean distance ρ 2 ordinary least square ols regression and akaike information criterion aic are applied to evaluate the goodness of fit of the copula function cao et al 2021 eloranta et al 2018 2 2 multi objective optimal dispatching model of reservoir the upper plateau water supply system of the bia is composed of the linjiacun canal head reservoir and five reservoirs in the irrigation area since the multi objective dispatching of reservoir groups is a high dimensional and complex problem which is difficult to resolve thus it can be simplified as a single reservoir problem by the aggregation decomposition method pan et al 2020 in which the five reservoirs in the irrigation area can be aggregated into a virtual reservoir by the aggregation method only need to consider the linjiacun reservoir together with the attributes of storage capacity inflow and outflow in the virtual reservoir when establishing the model besides for the bia agricultural irrigation water should be considered first and then the economic benefits and ecological health also should be paid attention to therefore the minimum agricultural irrigation water shortage the maximum economic benefits and the minimum ecological water spill and shortage are taken as the objectives of the operation model since the main function of reservoirs in the bia is irrigation and there is no runoff be introduced into the water plant to supply domestic and industrial water thus the domestic and industrial water in the irrigation area is not considered in reservoir dispatching model and that will not affect the dispatching of reservoir operation model based on this the reservoir multi objective operation model in bia is established 2 2 1 objective function agricultural

is an optimization algorithm for solving high dimensional multi objective problems nsga iii algorithm adds a method based on reference point to nsga ii to deal with high dimensional multi objective optimization problems which can make the population have good distribution the nsga iii de algorithm in the framework of the geatpy genetic algorithm replaces the generation method of the nsga iii progeny population with the mutation operator de rand 1 bin in the differential evolution algorithm which can enrich the diversity of the progeny population ensure a more accurate global search ability and significantly improve the calculation efficiency of optimization opara and arabas 2019 2 3 multi criteria decision making model by coupling comprehensive empowerment of cooperative game cecg with vikor 2 3 1 comprehensive empowerment of cooperative game cecg comprehensive empowerment of cooperative game cecg is a weighting method which combines multiple weights to determine comprehensive weights cooperative game is a cooperative way which is a thought to analyze the mutual competition and coordination among evaluation objects according to the cooperative game theory the results of total subjective weight ahp and objective weight entropy weight can be obtained it can reduce the one sided impact of the single weight method on the weight and thoroughly and scientifically determine the weight of each objective value in the reservoir dispatching model the steps to determine the weight are as follows 1 l methods are used to weight the indicators and construct the initial weight set u k u k 1 u k 2 u km k 1 2 l 15 u k 1 l α k u k t α k 0 u is a possible weight vector based on the initial weight set the l linear combination coefficients in the eq 15 are optimized with the goal of minimizing the deviation between u and u k 16 min j 1 l α j u j t u i i 1 2 l 2 normalized α 1 α 2 α l is obtained by optimizing the first derivative condition of eq 16 that is the required comprehensive weight 2 3 2 the cecg vikor model as outlined above the comprehensive weight in cecg can be expanded to many forms and provide chances to utilize it in conjunction with mcdm models therefore we construct the cecg vikor model by coupling comprehensive weight in cecg and vikor the vikor method was developed for multi criteria decision making problems of complex systems opricovic and tzeng 2004 sari 2021 this method introduces the multicriteria ranking indices based on the particular measure of closeness to the ideal solution and focuses on ranking and selecting from a set of alternatives in the presence of conflicting criteria it determines compromise solutions for a problem with conflicting criteria which can help the decision makers to reach a final decision here the compromise solution is a feasible solution which is the closest to the ideal and a compromise means an agreement established by mutual concessions opricovic and tzeng 2007 simsek et al 2022 taking the values of aiws eb and ewss in the pareto solution set of the reservoir optimal dispatching model as the decision criteria the vikor method is used to obtain the comprehensive optimal operation result in the solution set the compromise ranking method vikor has the following steps 1 assume that there are m dispatching results and n indices to form the initial matrix x ij x ij n m the decision matrix y ij y ij n m is created as follows 17 y i j x i j min j x i j max j x i j min j x i j j i 1 max j x i j x i j max j x i j min j x i j j i 2 where i 1 2 n j 1

maximum group utility and the minimum r i refers to the individual regret of the opponent w j is the weight value of the jth indices which is determined by the cecg compute the values q i 21 q i v s i

order the results are three ranking lists 3 study area and data baojixia irrigation area bia located in the western part of guanzhong plain shaanxi province china was selected as study area fig 2 the total area of the bia is approximately 2355 km2 the bia was divided into two parts the upper part and the lower part this study only focuses on the upper part the effective irrigation area of the bia is about 1202 km2 it belongs to the middle reaches of the weihe river the irrigation water source in the upper irrigation area comes from the runoff of the weihe river in addition the annual precipitation in bia is approximately 551 4 mm mainly from june to october while that in upstream watershed of bia is 405 3 mm such greatly variation is caused by the influence of the different microclimatic conditions complicated underlying surface and intense human activities in the water source rivers and the irrigation district thus there are large uncertainties of the precipitation in bia and runoff from the weihe river which could bring many water supply risks for reservoir dispatching of irrigation area the irrigation area now has six medium sized reservoirs from west to east along the upper trunk channel of the plateau which are linjiacun reservoir wangjiaya reservoir xinyigou reservoir dabeigou reservoir ganhe reservoir and second ganhe reservoir in turn the main functions of linjiacun reservoir are irrigation water supply taking into account power generation flood control and water storage with normal storage water level 636 00 m dead water level 626 00 m total storage capacity 50 million m3 beneficial reservoir capacity 38 million m3 installed capacity 8000 kw other reservoirs are mainly irrigation reservoirs with comprehensive functions of flood control and aquaculture the monthly runoff data measured at linjiacun hydrological station are from the yellow river basin hydrological yearbook 1980 2017 and the precipitation data 1980 2017 of bia including baoji fufeng meixian jingyang liquan qianxian wugong xingping xianyang are from shaanxi meteorological bureau daily meteorological data from 1980 to 2017 were from the china meteorological data sharing service network http data cma cn including precipitation p sunshine duration n average temperature t maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m above the ground u2 the crop pattern and irrigation water utilization coefficient of irrigation area is from the annual report of baojixia irrigation area 2010 2017 the crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated by food and agriculture organization fao 56 penman monteith method and the monthly irrigation water demand of bia was further determined 4 results and discussion 4 1 joint uncertainty of precipitation and runoff based on copula 4 1 1 correlation analysis of precipitation and runoff this section aimed to estimate the correlation of the precipitation in irrigation area and the runoff from the upstream of the wei river by employing the copula approach among precipitation in irrigation area is the average precipitation at 9 stations runoff from the upstream of the wei river is from linjiacun station which refers to the reservoir inflow calculating the correlation coefficient between precipitation and runoff precipitation and runoff exhibited a weak linear relationship with the kendall rank correlation coefficient and spearman correlation coefficient of 0 266 and 0 3794 it indicated that the encounter of precipitation and runoff was highly random and uncertainty existed in the process of water supply and demand for reservoir dispatching water supply risk might exist in the bia bia located in the arid area of northwest china is the largest irrigation area in shaanxi province the irrigation water source of the bia is mainly the runoff from upstream of the weihe river however the upstream weihe river belongs to mountainous rivers and the bia is located in guanzhong plain therefore the spatiotemporal differences of meteorological and hydrological variables are quite large from the upstream to downstream within the watershed which results in a weak correlation between the precipitation in irrigation area and the runoff from upstream of wei river there is uncertainty for agricultural water supply in irrigation areas under the natural and irrigation water sources which would lead to a potential agriculture water supply risk 4 1 2 the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the copula function with the best goodness of fit was selected from gumbel hougaard frank and clayton copula to show the joint probability distribution of precipitation and runoff in order to select the best copula the comparison between different copulas and empirical copulas were used the results were shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the fitting accuracy of the joint distribution based on the three copula functions was high enough where the fitting of clayton copula r2 0 9921 was close to that of gumbel hougaard copula r2 0 9927 consequently to accurately determine the copula function with a better goodness of fit according to the empirical joint probability and theoretical joint probability of two dimensional variables the square euclidean distance ρ 2 ordinary least squares ols and akaike information criterion aic were utilized to estimate the copula functions the estimated parameters and goodness of fit test of copula functions are given in table 1 as noted in table 1 the clayton copula had the lowest ρ 2 ols and aic with values of 0 0201 0 0230 and 284 74 respectively therefore the clayton copula was employed to construct the joint probability distribution of precipitation and runoff series the joint distribution function and contour plot based on clayton copula of precipitation and runoff were shown in fig 4 similar to the above results huang and ochoa 2022 applied clayton copula to establish a connection between the two indices based on simple constructions and stable properties of clayton copula in addition clayton copula also has good adaptability to fitting flood and drought variables eskandaripour and soltaninia 2022 gabriel and fan 2022 therefore the strong performance of clayton copula can establish the connection between precipitation and runoff with effect which is conducive to the description of uncertainty between them later 4 1 3 encounter uncertainty of precipitation and runoff according to the frequency the precipitation and runoff were classified into 3 states as wet p 37 5 normal 37 5 p 62 5 and dry p 62 5 chinese national standard gb t 50095 98 assuming w n and d were wet normal and dry flow states x and y represented precipitation and runoff series respectively the description of the nine situations and their joint distribution probability jdp was given in table 2 in addition to verify that the copula joint distribution of precipitation and runoff is reasonable it needs to be compared with the actual situation the historical precipitation and runoff series 1980 2017 could be divided into 9 encounter situations fig 5 according to the set rules and the empirical frequency of precipitation and runoff series over the years based on this the actual encounter probability aep of precipitation and runoff can be obtained the aep refers to the actual occurrence probability of wetness dryness encounter classification of the historical precipitation and runoff from 1980 to 2017 which could reflect the actual wetness dryness encounter characteristics of precipitation and runoff in the historical series at bia the precondition for analyzing the water supply risk under the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff was to compute the occurrence probability of different situations according to eq 1 and fig 5 the jdp and aep of precipitation and runoff were calculated and it could be divided into two situations the synchronous and asynchronous encounter probability table 3 the results in the table 3 showed that the asynchronous jdp of the situation2 w n was equal to the asynchronous jdp of the situation4 n w with the value of 10 15 the asynchronous jdp of the situation3 w d was equal to the asynchronous jdp of the situation7 d w with the value of 6 56 and the asynchronous jdp of the situation6 n d was equal to the asynchronous jdp of the situation8 d n with the value of 7 44 likewise asynchronous aep also has three equal pairs of situations however the synchronous jdp of the situation9 d d was 23 50 which was the largest among all situations in the jdp the synchronous aep of the situation1 w w was equal to situation9 d d with the largest value of 18 42 moreover in arid northwest china water scarcity usually occurred due to small amount of water resource zhang et al 2022 the situation9 d d referred to a shortage of natural and irrigated agriculture water supply which was the most disadvantageous situation for water resource allocation in irrigation areas the results indicated that two agriculture water supply was unstable and water supply risks most likely exist in the bia previous studies have tended to study water supply risk in the context of natural water supply and demand by using copula functions to establish a joint distribution of precipitation and crop water demand zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2021c developed a model by integrating the monte carlo copula and markov process and constructed the joint distribution of crop water requirements et c and effective precipitation p e to analyze agricultural water shortages risk that model provided a more secure and reliable result of assessing the agricultural water shortage risk which had an important theoretical guidance for further agricultural risk decision making in addition the research of zhao et al 2021 was also consistent with described above a copula based risk analysis of agricultural water shortage under natural precipitation conditions in the guanzhong plain was taken it showed that there was a large probability of an unfavorable water balance situation under the natural supply condition in the bia therefore the combination of copula distribution and wetness dryness encounter analysis can be a good way to analyze the uncertainty risk of regional water supply and demand however as the irrigated agriculture water supply runoff was an indispensable water source in the irrigation area was neglected hence the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff was constructed for researching the encounter characteristics of two agriculture water supply in addition the jdp and aep of asynchronous encounter was 48 3 and 52 63 and that of synchronous was 51 7 and 47 37 respectively there was a little relative error between the jdp based on copula function and aep in the 9 encounter situations of precipitation and runoff thus considering that the jdp of precipitation and runoff described by copula function could approximately represent the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff in the study area 4 2 multi objective optimization dispatching results 4 2 1 scheme setting agricultural water demand in irrigation areas was supplied by both natural and irrigated agricultural water supplies that is precipitation and runoff the irrigation water requirement calculated based on etc depended on the amount of effective precipitation the more effective precipitation the less irrigation water demand the irrigation water demand is satisfied by the reservoir dispatching and irrigation available water supply of reservoir depends on runoff namely the variation of incoming water and water demand during reservoir operation corresponds to the change of rainfall in irrigation area and runoff from upstream therefore according to the 9 encounter situations of precipitation and runoff showed in the section 4 1 3 the 9 design representative years could be chosen reservoir dispatching complied with irrigation water demand and water supply in representative years assuming p p and p r are the precipitation and runoff frequency respectively the 9 reservoir dispatching schemes were set up in the light of 9 situations in table 2 considering the precipitation status the scheme can be divided into three categories a precipitation state is wet bia has abundant precipitation and little irrigation water demand and water demand process is monthly water demand in year with p p 37 5 b precipitation state is n bia has medium precipitation and irrigation water demand and water demand process is monthly water demand in year with 37 5 p p 62 5 and c precipitation state is d precipitation in bia is scarce and irrigation water demand is large and water demand process is monthly water demand in year with 62 5 p p each type of these schemes has three situations of wet normal or dry incoming water from the river reservoir operation schemes are set as follows a1 water inflow process is runoff process in year with p p 37 5 p r 37 5 a2 water inflow process is runoff process in year with p p 37 5 37 5 p r 62 5 a3 water inflow process is runoff process in year with p p 37 5 62 5 p r b1 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 37 5 p p 62 5 p r 37 5 b2 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 37 5 p p 62 5 37 5 p r 62 5 b3 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 37 5 p p 62 5 62 5 p r c1 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 62 5 p p p r 37 5 c2 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 62 5 p p 37 5 p r 62 5 and c3 water inflow process is runoff process in year with 62 5 p p 62 5 p r 4 2 2 model establishment and solution the multi objective dispatching model of the reservoir in bia introduced in section 2 2 was constructed among ten day was the calculation step in flood season june october and a month was the calculation step in other periods the number of dispatching periods t in eq 5 was 22 the grid price of linjiacun reservoir a t in eq 6 was 0 3 yuan kw h comprehensive output coefficient of power plant k 8 the elasticity of water resource output γ in eq 7 was 0 087 coefficient of technological progress λ 0 319 year series m 38 the decision variable was water level of reservoir in each period according to the nsga iii de model was optimized based on the 9 schemes mentioned in section 4 2 1 where population size was 120 the crossover probability was 0 7 the mutation rate was 0 5 and the number of iterations was 200 the pareto solution of the multi objective optimization dispatching problem and its projection on the two dimensional plane was shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 the pareto front is approximately distributed on a spatial curve in schemes a1 a2 b1 and c1 the aiws of each scheme tends to be a fixed value and they are increased with the decrease of water inflow and increase of water demand moreover the two dimensional projections of aiws and eb and aiws and ewss are two lines parallel to the symmetric axis so it can be seen that aiws hardly changes with eb and ewss the reason for this is that aiws increases with the decrease of available water resources and in these schemes the available water resources are relatively sufficient and irrigation water consumption does not conflict with the other two objectives the distribution of the pareto front of scheme b2 is very uniform in contrast pareto front of schemes a3 b3 c2 and c3 is more centralized and there is an obvious compatible relationship between aiws and eb with the reduction of aiws eb exhibits an increasing trend all of which tend to distribute water to reduce aiwb while obtaining higher eb however eb and ewss restrict each other and the increase in eb is proportional to the increase of ewss which indicates that there is a contradiction between the economic development of irrigation areas and downstream ecological protection benefit an unreasonable water distribution scheme may result in a triple deficit of irrigation water supply inadequate power generation water supply and poor ecological conditions for reservoir operation model with multiple operation objectives it contains a series of complex constraints and requires multi criteria decision making li et al 2017 a certain amount of water needs to be maintained under each individual function which leads to a series of potential water conflicts multi objective optimization methods can provide desired results through tradeoff analysis among such competing objectives asadzadeh et al 2014 tariku et al 2021 used a stochastic dual dynamic programming sddp algorithm and a hydro economic model to optimize hydropower production and irrigated agriculture uen et al 2018 explored synergistic benefits of water food energy nexus through multi objective reservoir optimization scheme the results provided a scientific basis for planning similarly the reservoir multi objective optimization dispatching model with agricultural irrigation economic benefit and ecological environment as objectives is expected to emphasize the relationship of mutual feedback between each target therefore we need to coordinate the relationship among the three and adopt the following methods to select the optimal scheduling results 4 2 3 the cecg vikor model for mcdm in this study we run the cecg vikor model introduced in section 2 3 to find the most superior expected reservoir scheduling solution among the cecg vikor model the subjective weighting method ahp gave higher subjective weight to aiws according to the actual situation that irrigation was the main water consumption in the irrigation area combining with the objective weighting method entropy weight method the comprehensive weights of balanced subjective and objective factors were calculated by the eq 15 and eq 16 the comprehensive weighting results were shown in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the weight of aiws increases with the decrease of available water resources and increase of water demand in addition the weight of ewss accounts for the largest proportion the main reason is that among the three objectives the values of aiws and eb have a relatively small gap with the results of the same dispatching scheme while the gap between the values of ewss in the results of the same dispatching scheme is larger than that of aiws and eb which plays a more obvious role in the comparison and selection of schemes as described in section 2 1 1 three objectives including aiws eb and ewss are selected as the decision criteria these criteria are comprised of benefit and cost criteria among which eb belongs to benefit criteria while aiws and ewss are cost criteria i e the smaller represents the better according to eqs 17 21 s r and q of 120 dispatching results of each dispatching scheme are calculated and ranked the decision coefficient v 0 5 on the basis of the analysis results obtained by the vikor the ranking of the best alternatives for each reservoir dispatching scheme is presented in table 5 the q rankings of schemes a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 c1 c2 and c3 are shown in table 5 according to this the optimal scheduling results of each scheme are r104 r116 r66 r95 r5 r28 r117 r89 and r110 the position of the optimal scheduling results in the pareto solution of each scheme is shown in fig 6 where the optimal scheduling results selected by each scheme are in the middle and lower part of the solution set which belongs to the region with large aiws and small eb and ewss the result indicted that the optimal scheduling results selected by the model sacrifice the benefits of aiws and eb in exchange for the benefits of ewss to a certain extent while emphasizing agricultural and economic development ecological protection must not be slackened due to the baojixia water diversion works have direct impacts on river hydrology wu et al 2012 in recent years many studies have shown that vikor model is preferred for multicriteria decision making pourebrahim et al 2014 simsek et al 2022 that is profited from the vikor method has the advantages of simple principles and can objectively reflect the real gap between decision schemes in addition the cecg is also one of the cores of coordinating the game competition among agricultural economic and ecological objectives after the cecg combined the vikor model it become a way to effectively select the optimal dispatching results from the pareto solution of the multi objective optimization dispatching 4 2 4 comparison with actual conditions the framework of the uncertainty based reservoir dispatching model that is developed in this study regards the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff process connects reservoir multi objective optimal scheduling that is the encounter situation of precipitation and runoff is the input basis of the reservoir operation model under different schemes to verify the rationality of the nine representative schemes set in this study the actual variation ranges of reservoir dispatching objective values in nine encounter situations can be obtained according to the reservoir dispatching results each year from 1980 to 2017 and the classification results shown in fig 5 this paper compares the dispatching results of the developed framework under nine schemes with actual conditions in nine encounter situations all the comparisons are calculated on the same baseline that is they share the same parameters for calculation the optimal scheduling solution and the actual variation range of reservoir dispatching objective values were shown in table 6 and table 7 respectively as shown in tables 6 and 7 most of the aiws and eb in scheme a are close to its actual variation range in addition ecological water spill accounts for the majority of the ewss in each scheme but the main concern is whether the ecological water shortage accords with the actual variation range for water supply risk analysis while the ecological water shortage conforms to the actual variation range in class a schemes this indicted that the optimal scheduling solution of reservoir operation tally with the actual situation of this type of scheme that is similar to the result of scheme b objective values that fit the actual variation range account for the vast majority besides in scheme c aiws is slightly higher than the upper limit of the actual variation range and other values are approximately within their actual variation ranges the reason may be that inevitable randomness still exists in actual hydrological phenomena the degree of agricultural water shortage varies from crop to crop and available water is distributed unevenly within a year zhao et al 2021 however which can help decision makers make appropriate decisions under extreme conditions therefore as a whole the settings of the nine schemes can fully show the changes in different precipitation and runoff encounter situations this study considers that the scheme settings are reasonable and can be used to further study the water supply risk of reservoir operation under uncertain conditions 4 3 risk analysis of water supply for reservoir dispatching under uncertainty conditions 4 3 1 water supply risk analysis reservoir operation risk indices was constructed for specific risk problems faced by reservoir operation this study carried out a risk assessment of reservoir dispatching water supply for problems such as water resources shortage outstanding contradiction between water supply and demand and reduction of ecological flow li et al 2016 irrigation water supply risk was commonly measured by probability of irrigation but it could only indicate the reliability of water supply and could not express the adequacy of water supply guo et al 2013 moreover the economic benefits and ecological health loss risks faced by the reservoir dispatching scheme when the water supply is insufficient also need to be evaluated therefore the monthly probability of irrigation mpi and total water deficient ratio of irrigation twdi were selected to report the reliability and adequacy of irrigation water supply as well as the risk rates of insufficient economic benefit rieb and risk rates of insufficient ecological basic flow rief were chosen the risk indices were calculated according to the optimal scheduling solution of each scheme table 8 among the rieb refers to the probability of loss caused by the economic benefit not reaching the expected target produced by reservoir operation it can be expressed by the ratio of the period in which the economic benefit does not reach a certain proportion of the expected total economic benefit to the total period this paper takes the proportion as 20 the rief refers to the ratio between the period when the ecological flow is less than the minimum discharging ecological flow and the total period the minimum discharging flow of the linjiacun section is 5 4 m³ s in this study zhang et al 2011 according to table 8 the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching can be analyzed by the risk indices it can be seen from table 8 that the mpi decreases from 100 to 50 with a downward trend the twdi increases from 0 to 49 01 with an obvious upward trend and the rief also tends to increase significantly in the three types of schemes a b and c respectively the rieb remained stable at 45 45 in schemes a and b and increased from 31 82 to 40 91 in schemes c according to their changing trend it can be demonstrated that agricultural water supply risk is most sensitive to changes in water supply and demand followed by ecological water supply risk in addition under the same conditions of precipitation in the three types of a b and c schemes the variation trend of all risk indices is the same as above as the runoff becomes dry among the scheme a1 experience zero agricultural irrigation and ecological health water supply risk while the scheme c3 is in the highest water supply risk generally hence it should be emphasized that c3 the extreme water shortage scheme with the least water inflow and the most water demand has mpi twdi and rief of 50 40 29 and 18 18 respectively the greatest risk among the c3 schemes indicates that both agricultural irrigation water supply and ecological health are facing high risks under extreme water shortage scenarios in general the results indicate that the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching increases gradually with the decrease of available water and the increase of water demand gao et al 2018 concluded that the scale of the agricultural shortage is significantly correlated with uncertain water availability which was in line with our conclusions and agricultural water shortages are inevitable especially in arid regions davidsen et al 2015 gao et al 2018 therefore according to precipitation and runoff encounter scenarios classified by different agricultural water supply degrees it is necessary to determine the response rule of water supply risk of reservoir dispatching to water supply uncertainty and carry out risk assessment research under uncertain conditions as follows 4 3 2 risk level assessment of water supply under uncertainty conditions this study aimed to assess the water supply risk level of reservoir dispatching based on the uncertainty of downstream precipitation and upstream runoff which could further understand the variation law of water supply risk of reservoir dispatching in irrigation areas under uncertainty disturbance therefore it is necessary to assess the risk level of the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching by the risk indices evaluation standard the water supply risk level of the reservoir dispatching scheme can be divided into five levels i v li et al 2016 a lower water supply risk level i means the system has a better tolerance of water supply risk table 9 classifies evaluation indices factors water supply risk under uncertainty conditions can be obtained by the jdp of different encounter scenarios and the water supply risk level of reservoir dispatching the jdp of precipitation and runoff is introduced as one of the evaluation criteria it is better to assume that the higher the jdp when the precipitation or runoff state is wet the smaller the jdp when the precipitation or runoff state is dry and the mpi belongs to benefit criteria the smaller represents the better while the twdi rieb and rief are cost criteria i e the smaller represents the better based on the water supply risk level and jdp of precipitation and runoff of each scheme the comprehensive risk level of each scheme is divided by vikor method fig 7 and table 8 shows the final evaluation results as noted in fig 7 and table 8 the a1 scheme with a water supply risk of level ⅰ corresponds to w w encounter scenario and the jdp is 20 80 this scheme has the least water demand and the most available water is the lowest risk scheme the a2 a3 and b1 schemes belong to w n w d and d w situations respectively they have the same risk level ⅱ in which the jdp of a2 and b1 are equal to 10 15 slightly higher than 6 56 of a3 the water supply risk of b2 b3 and c1 schemes is level ⅲ corresponding to d d d n and n w situations and their jdp is 7 40 7 44 and 6 56 the c2 scheme and c3 have the same risk level in mpi twdi rieb and rief but the jdp of c3 is 23 50 more than that of c2 7 44 therefore the risk of c2 scheme is level ⅳ while the c3 scheme have the highest risk of level ⅴ in addition the c3 scheme is determined by d d situation which is an extreme water shortage scenario and the jdp of c3 is the highest effective risk management measures should be taken first for that scenario in general it can be seen that water supply risk levels of each dispatching scheme are mostly less than or equal to level iii and risk level i and risk level ii mostly occurring in situations with less water demand and more water supply as a whole bia is still in the category of acceptable risks or brink risks for water supply of reservoir dispatching zhao et al 2021 had a likeness conclusion as described the results can demonstrate that the water supply risk level for reservoir dispatching increases with the decrease of water available for a certain water demand level the water supply risk is significantly affected by the uncertainty of precipitation and runoff as two sources of agricultural water supply that is similar to result of li et al 2016 and gao et al 2018 therefore it is of great significance to take reasonable engineering measures to adjust water consumption and made full use of water resources to solve local imbalance between supply and demand in the bia due to the influence of uncertainty in precipitation and runoff 5 conclusions in this study a novel integrated modeling framework was proposed by coupling copula joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the reservoir multi objective operation model and the cecg vikor model to evaluate the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching considering the encounter uncertainty of precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream the main novelties of this study are 1 the clayton copula joint distribution is employed to thoroughly and effectively describe the wetness dryness encounter uncertainty of the precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream which reflect the wetness dryness encounter relationship of the natural and irrigated agricultural water sources 2 the optimal reservoir operation model has underlined the synergy between agriculture economy and ecology operation objectives and is efficiently solved by nsga iii de 3 the cecg vikor model is proposed to harmonize the trade off relationship between each objective and choose the optimal scheduling results from 120 solutions of each scheme 4 the proposed integrated modeling framework enables a deep analysis of water supply risk under various agricultural water supply conditions and has exhaustive progressive systematic and efficient features the application of the developed framework in the bia in arid areas of northwest china demonstrates its feasibility and applicability the conclusions are as follows 1 the integrated modeling framework is an important approach for assessing agriculture water supply risk which has comprehensive advanced and efficient features 2 weak correlation between precipitation and runoff results in uncertainty of water supply conditions the clayton copula was found to be more suitable to estimate the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff the jdp of the situation9 d d was 23 50 which was the largest among all situations in the jdp and indicated that there was a large probability of an unfavorable water balance situation in the bia 3 there was an obvious compatible relationship between aiws and eb while eb and ewss restrict each other the optimal scheduling results of the 9 schemes were r104 r116 r66 r95 r5 r28 r117 r89 and r110 respectively setting of reservoir dispatching scheme was reasonable 4 an evaluation indices system of agricultural water supply risk in bia was established which composed of the monthly probability of irrigation mpi total water deficient ratio of irrigation twdi risk rates of insufficient economic benefit rieb and risk rates of insufficient ecological basic flow rief 5 among the results of 9 scheduling schemes the water supply risk of reservoir dispatching in bia increased gradually with the decrease of available water supply and the increase of water demand and below middle and middle water supply risk were mainly faced by the scheme a and b with an occurrence probability of 62 47 while the scheme c had a high risk with an occurrence probability of 37 53 in bia among the scheme c3 was extreme water shortage with the highest jdp 23 50 and the greatest water supply risk level ⅴ 6 the integrated modeling framework combines the evolution of hydrological process and regional optimum allocation of water resources and can help decision makers learn the water supply risk under uncertainty of precipitation and runoff that framework is expected to be well used in risk analysis of water supply in irrigation areas under uncertainty condition in order to improve the capacity of the reservoir dispatching water supply risk assessment model framework to solve practical problems under uncertainty it is also necessary to select different irrigation areas to confirm and enhance this paper focuses on the uncertainty analysis of precipitation and runoff but does not consider all the factors that will affect the reservoir dispatching process for the bia especially the potential evapotranspiration which better reflects the water demand for agricultural irrigation therefore when both precipitation runoff and potential evapotranspiration are considered in the uncertainty analysis the more complex uncertainty risk problem is also worth further

water deficit fertilization wild rocket data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years the cultivation of some leafy vegetables harvested as baby leaf has become very widespread because they are highly appreciated for marketing as fresh cut products whose market trend is constantly growing among these species the wild rocket diplotaxis tenuifolia l dc is one of the most used because of its organoleptic and nutritional characteristics caruso et al 2019 in fact it has a bitter and sometimes pungent taste deriving from the presence of glucosinolates halkier and gershenzon 2006 and is also rich in fiber iron vitamin c and phenols barillari et al 2005 cavaiuolo and ferrante 2014 the wild rocket grows spontaneously in all italian regions up to 1000 m of altitude and its cultivation was started about two decades ago the wild rocket is a very rustic species that grows in harsh conditions e g water deficit poor soils however to obtain high uniform and good quality production suited to the market demand it is necessary to apply appropriately agronomic practices in particular the crop requires an adequate water regime as it suffers from both an excess of water and even a moderate water deficit in the latter case a decrease in production quality may occur due to the increase in fibrousness and nitrate content despite some beneficial compounds for health as phenols and antioxidant activity can increase schiattone 2018 as with many brassicas whose family also includes the wild rocket good levels of nitrogen in the soil are required to ensure good quality production however the excessive presence of this nutrient can give rise to some drawbacks such as increased sensitivity to some fungal diseases enticement due to the presence of low fiber tissues and an increase in nitrate content schiattone 2018 in addition high nitrogen level increase the risk of aquifer pollution hammad et al 2017 among the agronomic tools that could improve the quality standard we can include biostimulating compounds whose availability on the market is growing these compounds can also help limiting the negative effects of any situations of water deficit and inadequate nitrogen availability colla et al 2015 li et al 2022 the application of biostimulants is a part of modern strategies that have been spreading in recent years to improve the sustainability of production systems in agriculture biostimulants represent a promising tool capable of improving the quality parameters of various plant products nutritional efficiency and tolerance

azoxystrobin kresoxim methyl pyraclostrobin and whose fungicidal action is widely exploited in the phytosanitary defense of many crops numerous studies have been published that also demonstrate a

documents in which the effect of water regime nitrogen level and biostimulants based on seaweed extracts or azoxystrobin on wild rocket has been studied consequently this research is focused on evaluating the interactive effect of these factors on yield and some qualitative characteristics of the wild rocket grown for two crop cycles in an unheated greenhouse it is expected to support

just after the first harvest weed control was performed by hand few days after their emergence to minimize competition with wild rocket plants wild rocket was planted on november 15th 2016 and exploiting the regrowth capacity of this species after harvest two growth cycles were carried out the first one ended on january 17th while the second on february 28th seedlings at the 5th true leaf

the number of days elapsed between the two weighings the biomass increases between the two weighings were considered negligible ghaemi and rafiee 2016 so they were not considered in the et calculation procedure to meet the water needs of the wild rocket fresh water was supplied over soil surface by hand avoiding wetting of leaves based on the threshold value p 45 of other brassicaceae allen et al 1998 irrigation was carried out when 45 of the available water aw ran out in the wr 100 treatment any percolation water was collected in the saucers which was subsequently weighed and used for the subsequent watering of the same pot to recover any loss of nutrients due to leaching 2 4 yield and biometric features of plants harvests were performed on 63 and 105 dat respectively for the first and second growth cycle at the first harvest two of the five tufts of plants were uprooted with the roots instead the other three tufts of plants were cut about 2 cm above the collar with a knife after removing the soil under running water and drying with absorbent paper the plants were placed in numbered plastic bags and protected from light with a black plastic film once the samples were transferred to the laboratory the roots and the corresponding epigeal part were weighed separately for the calculation of the yield and the average weight of the plants all five tufts of plants present in the pots were considered of course only three of the five initial plant tufts were present in the second growth cycle when harvested the latter were uprooted with the entire root system after washing and drying the epigeal part was separated from the roots for the subsequent weighing at each harvest total marketable and waste yellowed necrotic leaves or damaged by insects or pathogens yield were assessed the number of leaves per plant was assessed on five plants per pot the leaf area was determined by measuring by means of the lai meter li cor 3100 lincoln nebraska usa the area of the entire sample collected from each pot and then to relating it to the number of plants and the average number of leaves per plant above ground dry biomass agdb and root dry biomass rdb were assessed by multiplying the total yield by the percentage of leaf dry matter and root fresh weight by their percentage of dry matter average leaf length and width the ratio of leaf lamina length to total leaf length lamina petiole were determined on a sample of ten leaves per each pot 2 5 qualitative parameters on the marketable product the following qualitative parameters were determined

1986 the measurements were made with a colorimeter cr 400 konica minolta osaka japan using spectra magic nx software in the apical part of the upper surface of the leaf blade avoiding the central rib leaf and root dry matter for the determination of dml a sample of marketable product of approximately 150 g was used while for the dmr a smaller amount 20 40 g was used the vegetable material after weighing was placed in a thermo ventilated oven at a temperature of 60 c until reaching steady weight about 48 h the dml and dmr obtained were expressed as a percentage to fresh total phenols antioxidant activity for each treatment about 20 g of fresh marketable product were homogenized and subjected to reflux extraction on a water bath 2 times per hour with methanol 1 5 w v after filtration through a whatmann filter paper the methanolic extract was concentrated under vacuum and then used for the determination of total phenols and antioxidant activity the total phenols were determined spectrophotometrically by the folin ciocalteu method singleton et al 1999 as described by sergio et al 2020 and expressed as mg of caffeic acid equivalent cae per gram of dry matter taa was determined by means of the analysis of the radical cations abts 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazolin 6 sulfonic as described by sergio et al 2021 and expressed as g trolox 100 g 1 dm nitrates a sample of about 10 g of dry leaves has been finely ground by means of a mill ika labortechnik staufen germany fitted with a 1 mm sieve analyses were performed on a 0 5 g sub sample with ion chromatography dionex dx120 dionex corporation sunnyvale ca with a conductivity detector using an ionpack ag14 pre column and an ionpack separation column as14 bonasia et al 2008 the nitrate concentration was determined based on standards prepared with sodium nitrate nano3 total chlorophyll total carotenoids for each treatment a sample of about 30 g of leaf blades was finely chopped in a mortar after adding liquid nitrogen and then stored at 20 c to carry out the extraction this material was homogenized with 80 acetone 0 2 g ml 1 kept in a dark cold chamber at 4 c for 24 h and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14 000 rpm three spectrophotometric readings at 662 646 and 470 nm were performed on the recovered supernatant the method is based on the property of chlorophyll to absorb light in the red zone of the visible spectrum the absorbance values obtained were then used to calculate tch and tca concentrations according to wellburn 1994 all extraction procedures were performed in low light conditions 2 6 statistical analysis the data collected in each growth cycle were subjected to the analysis of variance anova according to the split split plot experimental design using the spss 17 software mean values were separated with the student newman keuls snk test p 0 05 3 results crop evapotranspiration et did not differ significantly among nitrogen levels and biostimulating treatments while variations were observed between irrigation regimes during the two growth cycles the daily et presented a sinusoidal trend mainly due to a drastic change in the leaf area that occurred after the first harvest fig 2a in wr 100 the et went from about 1 0 mm d 1 in the first days after transplantation to about 2 5 mm d 1 at the end of december in the first ten days of january the coldest period this parameter fluctuated around 1 mm d 1 and then rose again up to about 2 mm d 1 of the harvest period this was followed by a reduction and therefore a rapid increase as the leaf area and the air temperature raised up to 5 mm d 1 a few days before the second harvest in the wr 50 daily et presented the same trend found in wr 100 with values on average 37 lower because of the water limitation regime fig 2a the total value of the et was 57 5 and 50 9 mm wr 50 and 84 4 and 92 0 mm wr 100 respectively for the first and second growth cycle fig 2b the soil water reserve was also not significantly affected by nitrogen levels and biostimulant treatments while it varied in relation to water regimes in the wr 100 treatment during the growth cycles this parameter was maintained above the readily available water raw with periodic fluctuations between 0 and 44 of the available water aw resulting from waterings in wr 50 the water reserve was always lower than that found in wr 100 falling below raw from the first decade of december and remaining in this condition for almost the entire duration of the wild rocket growth cycles with fluctuations between 12 and 80 of the aw fig 3 obviously the irrigation volumes supplied during 19 waterings were also different between the irrigation regimes with seasonal irrigation volume total of the two growth cycles equal to 85 and 168 5 mm for wr 50 and wr 100 respectively the application of different management practices affected the wild rocket production and related parameters in a diverse way and magnitude the marketable yield on average was equal to about 834 and 627 g m 2 respectively in the first and second harvest table 1 the main biometric parameters showed a variable behavior in both growth cycles in particular between the first and second harvest as an average of all treatments i the leaf area decreased from 11 0 to 5 4 cm2 leaf 1 ii the plant weight and the leaf number varied respectively from 3 7 g plant 1 and 8 5 n plant 1 to 3 5 g plant 1 and 15 7 n plant 1 iii the length of the leaf blade and the total leaf length have been reduced respectively from 10 5 and 17 6 cm to 9 4 and 13 8 cm with a percentage ratio between the two parameters which ranged from 59 6 to 69 2 iv the leaf width decreased from 2 5 to 1 5 cm v the ratio between root biomass and total biomass root shoot increased from 17 3 to 24 3 the water supply 50 lower than the optimal water requirement resulted in a 26 3 and 35 8 yield decline in the first and second growth cycle respectively the differences in yield between the water regimes were mainly determined by the variations in leaf size and to a lesser extent by the leaf number per plant table 2 in wr 50 the root weight as average of two harvests was reduced by 17 5 but the root biomass total biomass ratio increased by 11 3 the yield of wild rocket raised with the increase of nitrogen intake in n150 it was 112 and 333 higher than in n0 respectively in the first and second growth cycle however in both growth cycles there was a harmful effect of the higher nitrogen dose on yield of the less watered plants wr 50 wr x nl interaction fig 4 as happened for the water regime the nl effect was also determined to a greater extent by the variation in leaf morphology especially the leaf area and secondly by the leaf number per plant the root biomass also raised in relation to the increase in the n level with an average rise of 35 observed in the two harvests passing from n0 to n150 the percentage ratio of root biomass total biomass decreased significantly by increasing n dose on average by 43 between n0 and n150 the application of the seaweed extract based biostimulant resulted in 10 3 average yield increase compared to the control while with azoxystrobin yield raised by 16 9 for sw yield increase was mainly determined by the greater leaf number per plant and secondly by the greater leaf area azoxystrobin on the other hand caused the increase in the leaf area to a greater extent and to a lesser extent the increase in the leaf number the negative effect on yield previously described of the greater nitrogen intake in water deficit conditions did not occur in the azoxystrobin treated plants wr x nl x bs interaction table 1 fig 5 a significant interaction was also observed for the leaf size table 1 in the first harvest sw increased root biomass and root biomass total biomass ratio of 29 2 and 7 2 respectively while in the second harvest the effect was not significant with the application of azoxystrobin on the other hand there was a tendency towards a reduction in root biomass in particular for the root biomass total biomass ratio which was reduced by 21 3 and 13 1 respectively in the first and second harvest the examined qualitative parameters were influenced by treatments compared table 3 the leaf dry matter dml on average was 9 5 higher in water deficit conditions furthermore this parameter has undergone a progressive reduction with the increase of the n level in particular going from n0 to n150 the dml values on average dropped by 15 5 the sw did not have a significant effect on the dml while az caused a reduction of 10 2 in the first harvest only total phenol content and total antioxidant activity showed the same trend as dm these parameters increased under water deficit and lower nitrogen intake in fact tp and taa were 10 4 and 18 7 higher in wr 50 than in wr 100 and decreased respectively by 16 2 and 21 4 between n0 and n150 furthermore a positive effect of the application of sw and az was found on these last two parameters in fact tp and taa compared to the control increased on average by 8 8 and 13 1 with the application of sw and by 10 8 and 19 7 with the application of az respectively the chlorophyll content decreased by 5 3 under water deficit and increased by 32 5 from n0 to n150 furthermore the application of sw and azo resulted in an average increase of this parameter by 10 2 and 16 0 respectively the water and nitrogen deficit favored the accumulation of carotenoids in fact the total carotenoids in wr 50 were 12 0 higher than in wr 100 and decreased progressively with the increase in the n level reaching 31 in n150 compared to n0 furthermore the application of sw and az favored the accumulation of the latter compounds with an average increase compared to the control of 23 8 and 35 6 respectively the examination of leaf color parameters values highlights the effect of wr and nl on l and of all the treatments compared on a and b the greater availability of water and nitrogen made the leaves brighter as evidenced by the l values which were 10 7 higher in wr 100 compared to wr 50 and 9 2 in n150 compared to n0 the greater availability of water and n and the application of sw and az have made the leaves greener because of the higher chlorophyll content as was also highlighted by the spad values detected during the growth cycles candido et al 2022 and the tch measured at harvest in fact the value of a on average was lower more negative by 13 9 in wr 100 compared to wr 50 by 41 6 in n150 compared to n0 by 26 3 and 19 8 in sw and az compared to control the b values on the other hand were 11 8 higher in wr 50 than in wr 100 while they decreased by 17 4 between n0 and n150 furthermore in the first harvest the application of sw reduced this last parameter by 15 3 compared to the control in both harvests the leaf nitrate content varied between about 800 and 4700 mg kg 1 fm the water deficit increased ni on average by 35 5 in addition the ni raised considerably with the increase in nl in fact compared to n0 this parameter increased by 99 1 and 288 3 respectively in n75 and n150 sw and az resulted in a reduction in ni of 21 5 and 36 8 respectively 4 discussion the soil water regime has proved to be one of the main factors that affects yield and quality of wild rocket the decrease in yield due to water shortage occurred because of concomitant reduction in leaf size and leaf number per plant as observed by other authors on wild rocket lettuce and spinach bozkurt et al 2009 mahmood et al 2004 mirdad 2009 the reduction of transpiring area that occurs under water deficit is one of the strategies implemented by plants to cope with these situations and represents an adaptation to xeric environments parolin 2001 taiz and zeiger 2002 these morphological variations occur especially when water shortage is prolonged in fact the first consequence of the water deficit is the reduction of stomatal conductance and assimilation rate as has been observed in this trial data not shown which leads to a lower biomass production flexas et al 2006 hammad et al 2018 romero aranda et al 2001 furthermore the water deficit has changed the allocation of assimilates between the aerial part and roots resulting in a greater root biomass than aboveground biomass this behavior confirms the capability of plant to adapt to the lower availability of resources which the root system absorbs and transfers to the aerial part liu and stützel 2004 these results agree with the literature in which it is reported that plants subjected to prolonged water deficit tend to allocate a greater quantity of assimilates in the roots than in the aerial part and that the alteration of the relationship between aerial part and roots derives from either the increase in root growth or the reduction of growth of the aerial part compared to the root franco 2011 kerbiriou et al 2013 the higher nitrogen doses resulted in an increase in yield of over 100 and 300 compared to the non fertilized control in the first and second harvest respectively a notable difference between two harvests is attributable to the fact that in the first growth cycle wild rocket of the unfertilized control treatment benefited from the nitrogen reserve in the soil nevertheless in the second growth cycle the plants experienced greater n deficiency since most of the nitrogen reserve had been already depleted the positive effect of nitrogen on yield was observed in a greater extent by the increase in the leaf number and secondarily by the leaf size this result agrees with the findings reported by schiattone et al 2018 on wild rocket and with observations made on other leafy vegetables wang and li 2004 zhang et al 2015 or other species awais et al 2017 rahman et al 2021 however the increase in nitrogen intake caused a detrimental effect on yield under water deficit as already observed on wild rocket by schiattone et al 2018 similarly liu et al 2012 reported that the high nitrogen intake causes an increase in leaf sensitivity to water stress that led to a decrease of growth and yield in fact water scarcity in addition to directly limiting the growth process and plant survival indirectly influences the plant s response to nutrients song et al 2010 hence it can be affirmed that a supply of n commensurates with the water regime to which the crop is expected to be subjected would help to improve its response to water shortage arora et al 2001 the increase in the nitrogen level in addition to the increase of aboveground biomass also led to a greater development of root biomass however the ratio between root biomass and total biomass presented very high values in the non fertilized control and decreased with the increase in nitrogen supply as well as for the water deficit in the case of n deficiency the plants change the allocation of assimilates in favor of the roots whose greater growth supports the plant s capacity for the absorption of nutrients similar conclusions are reported in literature for different species demonstrating the important role of root growth in balancing any lack of nutrients and or water bonifas et al 2005 hammad et al 2017 the application of the seaweed extract based biostimulant resulted in an increase of yield in accordance with the rise of net assimilation data not shown the increase of photosynthesis is attributable to the higher content of chlorophyll whose biosynthesis was probably stimulated by the biostimulant jannin et al 2013 the root biomass has also increased with the application of seaweed extract based biostimulant such as the ratio between roots and aerial part therefore a better water and nutrient absorption efficiency may have contributed to improve yield of plants treated with the biostimulants the biostimulating effect of seaweed extracts are well documented on a large number of species baltazar et al 2021 however the causes are not yet well known some authors have attributed some of the biostimulating effects to the presence of phytohormones ertani et al 2018 however this hypothesis has been rejected by other studies that have highlighted the irrelevant content of phytohormones in seaweed extracts also taking into account the even lower quantity of extract that is distributed on the vegetation stirk et al 2014 instead other authors have shifted the attention to various polysaccharides found in considerable concentrations in the extracts shekhar sharma et al 2014 some biostimulating and abiotic stress mitigation effects could be attributed to them baltazar et al 2021 azoxystrobin also resulted in a significant increase in yield which as for the seaweed extract based biostimulant is the direct consequence of the positive effect of this substance on net assimilation data not shown the higher leaf chlorophyll content could be the main cause of the increased photosynthesis as well as the improvement of the water status of the plant due to the control exerted on the stomatal conductance by the phytohormones whose production seems to be stimulated by azoxystrobin grossmann and retzlaff 1997 venancio et al 2003 another factor that could contribute to the increased yield following the application of azoxystrobin is the stimulation of nitrate reductase activity amaro et al 2018 barbosa et al 2011 ishikawa et al 2012 in fact this enzyme plays a fundamental role in the nitrogen organication process which leads to the formation of new organic molecules such as nucleotides and amino acids köehle et al 2002 the greater tolerance to water deficit of plants treated with azoxystrobin can be attributed to the effect on the biosynthesis of the phytohormones involved in stomatal regulation and therefore on the plant s water status boari et al 2017 cantore et al 2016 contrary to the seaweed extract based biostimulant in the case of azoxystrobin there was a reduction in the roots aerial part ratio the higher production levels were obtained because of the greater net assimilation as well as a different economy in the allocation of assimilates the leaf dry matter increased in conditions of water deficit and decreased with the increase in the nitrogen level similarly bonasia et al 2017 and schiattone et al 2017 reported a rise in the leaf dry matter of diplotaxis genotypes subjected to salt stress in the case of low to moderate salinity the effects are attributable to the consequences of water shortage induced by salinity an increase in dry matter following the water deficit was also found on lettuce and cabbage karam et al 2002 xu and leskovar 2014 while for spinach the same parameter was inversely correlated to the nitrogen dose provided liphadzi et al 2006 water deficit led to a reduction in the leaf chlorophyll content and an increase in carotenoids as shown by the spad data and color characteristics these results agree with the findings reported by schiattone et al 2017 on wild rocket on various leafy vegetables luoh et al 2014 reported contrasting effects of water deficit on carotenoid content while misra and srivastava 2000 observed a reduction in two parameters chlorophyll raised with the increase of nitrogen level while an opposite effect on carotenoids was observed in literature conflicting results are reported on the effects of n availability on these parameters kopsell et al 2007 reported that the increase in the n level does not affect chlorophyll and carotenoids in the fresh tissues of cabbage leaves but for the latter parameter the trend is reversed if the value is expressed on the dry matter basis in our case phenols and antioxidant activity increased under water and nitrogen deficit as also reported by other authors koyama et al 2012 luoh et al 2014 the application of the seaweed extract based biostimulant and azoxystrobin increased chlorophyll and carotenoids in accordance with results reported on wild rocket by candido et al 2022 and schiattone et al 2021 similarly kulkarni et al 2019 observed chlorophyll and carotenoids increase in spinach after seaweed extract application jannin et al 2013 reported that biostimulating compounds based on seaweed extracts favor the biosynthesis of chloroplasts and the reduction of chlorophyll degradation strobilurins also favor the increase in chlorophyll as observed by other authors bonasia et al 2013 liang et al 2018 which can be attributed to the reduction of the synthesis of ethylene a hormone known to be involved in the processes of senescence and degradation of chlorophyll abeles et al 1992 and the increase of cytokinins involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll sundqvist et al 1980 the azoxystrobin and the biostimulant based on seaweed extract resulted in an increase in total phenols and antioxidant activity notoriously this last parameter is closely related to the phenolic content since phenols are among the main antioxidant compounds present in the plant the experimental findings confirmed the increase in phenols as a response to the application of seaweed extracts battacharyya et al 2015 as for example on spinach rouphael et al 2018 cherry correia et al 2020 gonçalves et al 2020 soybean do rosário rosa et al 2021 common bean kocira et al 2020 and cucumber trejo valencia et al 2018 following the application of azoxystrobin conversa et al 2014 observed an increase in phenols on baby leaf spinach while bonasia et al 2013 did not observe any effects leaf nitrate content was below the limits imposed by the eu reg ue n 1258 2011 in all treatments this confirms the results obtained on wild rocket by schiattone et al 2017 and demonstrates that in the climatic conditions of southern italy even in greenhouse where the light intensity is reduced the problem of high nitrate content is more limited compared to the northern latitudes in these environments the scarce availability of light and the low air temperature slow down the nitrogen metabolism favouring the increase of nitrates in plant bonasia et al 2017 weightman et al 2012 among the treatments studied the water deficit and the increase in nitrogen level favored a greater accumulation of nitrates in the leaves of the wild rocket this is consistent with the literature data according to which the water deficit reduces the activity of nitrate reductase santamaria et al 1999 weightman et al 2012 as well as the higher n content in the rhizosphere favors its absorption by the roots and therefore its accumulation in the aerial part chen et al 2004 devienne barret et al 2000 weightman et al 2012 the application of the seaweed extract based biostimulant and azoxystrobin reduced the leaf nitrates this can be attributed to the better physiological conditions of the treated plants which had a greater photosynthetic activity in the case of azoxystrobin the results of this study agree with several other studies that attribute to azoxiytrobin a stimulating action of nitrato reductase activity bonasia et al 2013 conversa et al 2014 joshi et al 2014 5 conclusions the research focused on the biostimulating effect of seaweed extract sw and azoxystrobin az in combination with two irrigation regimes and three nitrogen levels to improve the production of wild rocket as it was expected the water deficit negatively affected yield of wild rocket however improving some qualitative features such as phenols carotenoids and antioxidant activity worsening others such as dry matter and nitrates yield increased with the raise in the n level but the latter worsened the effects of the water deficit and some qualitative parameters such as phenols antioxidant activity carotenoids and nitrate content the tested biostimulants showed good efficacy on yield for increasing the number of leaves sw or their size az furthermore they reduced the negative effects of water and nitrogen deficit the application of two biostimulants has improved the quality of wild rocket for the increase of phenols antioxidant activity carotenoids and chlorophyll and the reduction of nitrates biostimulating products based on azoxystrobin or seaweed extracts can be a beneficial strategy for wild rocket growers to increase yield improve quality and limit the negative effects of water deficit it should be emphasized that azoxystrobin is a pesticide already marketed for the fight against various fungal diseases therefore its use can be promoted as an alternative to other fungicides given the complementary biostimulating action further research is desirable to evaluate the optimal doses and methods

9103,wild rocket is an expanding vegetable crop especially as a fresh cut product that requires high quality standards these can be achieved through appropriate management of agronomic practices such as water supply and nitrogen nutrition in combination with emerging techniques such as the application of biostimulating substances hence this study is focused on evaluating the response of the wild

water deficit fertilization wild rocket data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years the cultivation of some leafy vegetables harvested as baby leaf has become very widespread because they are highly appreciated for marketing as fresh cut products whose market trend is constantly growing among these species the wild rocket diplotaxis tenuifolia l dc is one of the most used because of its organoleptic and nutritional characteristics caruso et al 2019 in fact it has a bitter and sometimes pungent taste deriving from the presence of glucosinolates halkier and gershenzon 2006 and is also rich in fiber iron vitamin c and phenols barillari et al 2005 cavaiuolo and ferrante 2014 the wild rocket grows spontaneously in all italian regions up to 1000 m of altitude and its cultivation was started about two decades ago the wild rocket is a very rustic species that grows in harsh conditions e g water deficit poor soils however to obtain high uniform and good quality production suited to the market demand it is necessary to apply appropriately agronomic practices in particular the crop requires an adequate water regime as it suffers from both an excess of water and even a moderate water deficit in the latter case a decrease in production quality may occur due to the increase in fibrousness and nitrate content despite some beneficial compounds for health as phenols and antioxidant activity can increase schiattone 2018 as with many brassicas whose family also includes the wild rocket good levels of nitrogen in the soil are required to ensure good quality production however the excessive presence of this nutrient can give rise to some drawbacks such as increased sensitivity to some fungal diseases enticement due to the presence of low fiber tissues and an increase in nitrate content schiattone 2018 in addition high nitrogen level increase the risk of aquifer pollution hammad et al 2017 among the agronomic tools that could improve the quality standard we can include biostimulating compounds whose availability on the market is growing these compounds can also help limiting the negative effects of any situations of water deficit and inadequate nitrogen availability colla et al 2015 li et al 2022 the application of biostimulants is a part of modern strategies that have been spreading in recent years to improve the sustainability of production systems in agriculture biostimulants represent a promising tool capable of improving the quality parameters of various plant products nutritional efficiency and tolerance to abiotic stress colla et al 2015 khan et al 2018 biostimulants are compounds of different origin humic and fulvic acids protein hydrolysates and other compounds containing n chitosan and other biopolymers inorganic compounds seaweed extracts ketones etc in which there are one or more bioactive molecules that can influence the physiological and metabolic processes of the plant by increasing their production performances also helping to limit the damage produced by abiotic stress du jardin 2015 there are several types of seaweed based biostimulants containing inorganic and organic substances in variable quantities in relation to the species of algae and the extraction method inorganic compounds including n p k fe mg zn ca na and s some organic compounds including osmolytes e g

boukhari et al 2020 among the substances with a biostimulating action we can also include strobilurins the compounds of natural origin from which various structural variants have been synthesized e g azoxystrobin kresoxim methyl pyraclostrobin and whose fungicidal action is widely exploited in the phytosanitary defense of many crops numerous studies have been published that also demonstrate a complementary biostimulating action on different species amaro et al 2020 boari et al 2019 candido et al 2020 cantore et al 2016 schiattone et al 2021 in the scientific literature there are few documents in which the effect of water regime nitrogen level and biostimulants based on seaweed extracts or azoxystrobin on wild rocket has been studied consequently this research is focused on evaluating the interactive effect of these factors on yield and some qualitative characteristics of the wild rocket grown for two crop cycles in an unheated greenhouse it is expected to support farmers with useful information for the agronomic management of the crop that ensures high quality standards and low environmental impact 2 material and methods 2 1 characteristics of experimental

just after the first harvest weed control was performed by hand few days after their emergence to minimize competition with wild rocket plants wild rocket was planted on november 15th 2016 and exploiting the regrowth capacity of this species after harvest two growth cycles were carried out the first one ended on january 17th while the second on february 28th seedlings at the 5th true leaf stage prepared in the nursery in 228 hole polystyrene alveolate trays were used for the transplant in each pot 5 tufts of 3 seedlings each have been transplanted suitably spaced ortiva 1 5 ml l 1 and

application was required confidor 200 sl bayer cropscience s r l italy to fight an initial attack of aphids myzus persicae during the first growth cycle evapotranspiration et was measured by the water balance method weighing the pots every 4 5 days which were considered to be weighing lysimeters and using the following equation schiattone et al 2017 et w n w n m w i w dp ρ w x 1 n d where et is the daily evapotranspiration l wn and wn m are two consecutive weights kg of the pot wi is the supplied water kg wdp is the drained water kg ρw is the specific weight of the water 1 kg l 1 nd represents the number of days elapsed between the two weighings the biomass increases between the two weighings were considered negligible ghaemi and rafiee 2016 so they were not considered in the et calculation procedure to meet the water needs of the wild rocket fresh water was supplied over soil surface by hand avoiding wetting of leaves based on the threshold value p 45 of other brassicaceae allen et al 1998 irrigation was carried out when 45 of the available water aw ran out in the wr 100 treatment any percolation water was collected in the saucers which was subsequently weighed and used for the subsequent watering of the same pot to recover any loss of nutrients due to leaching 2 4 yield and biometric features of plants harvests were performed on 63 and 105 dat respectively for the first and second growth cycle at the first harvest two of the five tufts of plants were uprooted with the roots instead the other three tufts of plants were cut about 2 cm above the collar with a knife after removing the soil under running water and drying with absorbent paper the plants were placed in numbered plastic bags and protected from light with a black plastic film once the samples were transferred to the laboratory the roots and the corresponding epigeal part were weighed separately for the calculation of the yield and the average weight of the plants all five tufts of plants present in the pots were considered of course only three of the five initial plant tufts were present in the second growth cycle when harvested the latter were uprooted with the entire root system after washing and drying the epigeal part was separated from the roots for the subsequent weighing at each harvest total marketable and waste yellowed necrotic leaves or damaged by insects or pathogens yield were assessed the number of leaves per plant was assessed on five plants per pot the leaf area was determined by measuring by means of the lai meter li cor 3100 lincoln nebraska usa the area of the entire sample collected from each pot and then to relating it to the number of plants and the average number of leaves per plant above ground dry biomass agdb and root dry biomass rdb were assessed by multiplying the total yield by the percentage of leaf dry matter and root fresh weight by their percentage of dry matter average leaf length and width the ratio of leaf lamina length to total leaf length lamina petiole were determined on a sample of ten leaves per each pot 2 5 qualitative parameters on the marketable product the following qualitative parameters were determined chromatic features leaf dml and root dmr dry matter total chlorophyll tch total carotenoids tca total phenols tp total antioxidant activity taa nitrates ni chromatic features for each experimental unit just after harvesting ten representative leaves were selected and the chromatic parameters l a and b measured l represents the brightness a and b the chromatic coordinates indicating respectively the red green and yellow blue components values of a indicate the direction of red redness a the direction of green greenness b the direction of yellow yellowness b the direction of blue blueness cie 1986 the measurements were made with a colorimeter cr 400 konica minolta osaka japan using spectra magic nx software in the apical part of the upper surface of the leaf blade avoiding the central rib leaf and root dry matter for the determination of dml a sample of marketable product of approximately 150 g was used while for the dmr a smaller amount 20 40 g was used the vegetable material after weighing was placed in a thermo ventilated oven at a temperature of 60 c until reaching steady weight about 48 h the dml and dmr obtained were expressed as a percentage to fresh total phenols antioxidant activity for each treatment about 20 g of fresh marketable product were homogenized and subjected to reflux extraction on a water bath 2 times per hour with methanol 1 5 w v after filtration through a whatmann filter paper the methanolic extract was concentrated under vacuum and then used for the determination of total phenols and antioxidant activity the total phenols were determined spectrophotometrically by the folin ciocalteu method singleton et al 1999 as described by sergio et al 2020 and expressed as mg of caffeic acid equivalent cae per gram of dry matter taa was determined by means of the analysis of the radical cations abts 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazolin 6 sulfonic as described by sergio et al 2021 and expressed as g trolox 100 g 1 dm nitrates a sample of about 10 g of dry leaves has been finely ground by means of a mill ika labortechnik staufen germany fitted with a 1 mm sieve analyses were performed on a 0 5 g sub sample with ion chromatography dionex dx120 dionex corporation sunnyvale ca with a conductivity detector using an ionpack ag14 pre column and an ionpack separation column as14 bonasia et al 2008 the nitrate concentration was determined based on standards prepared with sodium nitrate nano3 total chlorophyll total carotenoids for each treatment a sample of about 30 g of leaf blades was finely chopped in a mortar after adding liquid nitrogen and then stored at 20 c to carry out the extraction this material was homogenized with 80 acetone 0 2 g ml 1 kept in a dark cold chamber at 4 c for 24 h and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14 000 rpm three spectrophotometric readings at 662 646 and 470 nm were performed on the recovered supernatant the method is based on the property of chlorophyll to absorb light in the red zone of the visible spectrum the absorbance values obtained were then used to calculate tch and tca concentrations according to wellburn 1994 all extraction procedures were performed in low light conditions 2 6 statistical analysis the data collected in each growth cycle were subjected to the analysis of variance anova according to the split split plot experimental design using the spss 17 software mean values were separated with the student newman keuls snk test p 0 05 3 results crop evapotranspiration et did not differ significantly among nitrogen levels and biostimulating treatments while variations were observed between irrigation regimes during the two growth cycles the daily et presented a sinusoidal trend mainly due to a drastic change in the leaf area that occurred after the first harvest fig 2a in wr 100 the et went from about 1 0 mm d 1 in the first days after transplantation to about 2 5 mm d 1 at the end of december in the first ten days of january the coldest period this parameter fluctuated around 1 mm d 1 and then rose again up to about 2 mm d 1 of the harvest period this was followed by a reduction and therefore a rapid increase as the leaf area and the air temperature raised up to 5 mm d 1 a few days before the second harvest in the wr 50 daily et presented the same trend found in wr 100 with values on average 37 lower because of the water limitation regime fig 2a the total value of the et was 57 5 and 50 9 mm wr 50 and 84 4 and 92 0 mm wr 100 respectively for the first and second growth cycle fig 2b the soil water reserve was also not significantly affected by nitrogen levels and biostimulant treatments while it varied in relation to water regimes in the wr 100 treatment during the growth cycles this parameter was maintained above the readily available water raw with periodic fluctuations between 0 and 44 of the available water aw resulting from waterings in wr 50 the water reserve was always lower than that found in wr 100 falling below raw from the first decade of december and remaining in this condition for almost the entire duration of the wild rocket growth cycles with fluctuations between 12 and 80 of the aw fig 3 obviously the irrigation volumes supplied during 19 waterings were also different between the irrigation regimes with seasonal irrigation volume total of the two growth cycles equal to 85 and 168 5 mm for wr 50 and wr 100 respectively the application of different management practices affected the wild rocket production and related parameters in a diverse way and magnitude the marketable yield on average was equal to about 834 and 627 g m 2 respectively in the first and second harvest table 1 the main biometric parameters showed a variable behavior in both growth cycles in particular between the first and second harvest as an average of all treatments i the leaf area decreased from 11 0 to 5 4 cm2 leaf 1 ii the plant weight and the leaf number varied respectively from 3 7 g plant 1 and 8 5 n plant 1 to 3 5 g plant 1 and 15 7 n plant 1 iii the length of the leaf blade and the total leaf length have been reduced respectively from 10 5 and 17 6 cm to 9 4 and 13 8 cm with a percentage ratio between the two parameters which ranged from 59 6 to 69 2 iv the leaf width decreased from 2 5 to 1 5 cm v the ratio between root biomass and total biomass root shoot increased from 17 3 to 24 3 the water supply 50 lower than the optimal water requirement resulted in a 26 3 and 35 8 yield decline in the first and second growth cycle respectively the differences in yield between the water regimes were mainly determined by the variations in leaf size and to a lesser extent by the leaf number per plant table 2 in wr 50 the root weight as average of two harvests was reduced by 17 5 but the root biomass total biomass ratio increased by 11 3 the yield of wild rocket raised with the increase of nitrogen intake in n150 it was 112 and 333 higher than in n0 respectively in the first and second growth cycle however in both growth cycles there was a harmful effect of the higher nitrogen dose on yield of the less watered plants wr 50 wr x nl interaction fig 4 as happened for the water regime the nl effect was also determined to a greater extent by the variation in leaf morphology especially the leaf area and secondly by the leaf number per plant the root biomass also raised in relation to the increase in the n level with an average rise of 35 observed in the two harvests passing from n0 to n150 the percentage ratio of root biomass total biomass decreased significantly by increasing n dose on average by 43 between n0 and n150 the application of the seaweed extract based biostimulant resulted in 10 3 average yield increase compared to the control while with azoxystrobin yield raised by 16 9 for sw yield increase was mainly determined by the greater leaf number per plant and secondly by the greater leaf area azoxystrobin on the other hand caused the increase in the leaf area to a greater extent and to a lesser extent the increase in the leaf number the negative effect on yield previously described of the greater nitrogen intake in water deficit conditions did not occur in the azoxystrobin treated plants wr x nl x bs interaction table 1 fig 5 a significant interaction was also observed for the leaf size table 1 in the first harvest sw increased root biomass and root biomass total biomass ratio of 29 2 and 7 2 respectively while in the second harvest the effect was not significant with the application of azoxystrobin on the other hand there was a tendency towards a reduction in root biomass in particular for the root biomass total biomass ratio which was reduced by 21 3 and 13 1 respectively in the first and second harvest the examined qualitative parameters were influenced by treatments compared table 3 the leaf dry matter dml on average was 9 5 higher in water deficit conditions furthermore this parameter has undergone a progressive reduction with the increase of the n level in particular going from n0 to n150 the dml values on average dropped by 15 5 the sw did not have a significant effect on the dml while az caused a reduction of 10 2 in the first harvest only total phenol content and total antioxidant activity showed the same trend as dm these parameters increased under water deficit and lower nitrogen intake in fact tp and taa were 10 4 and 18 7 higher in wr 50 than in wr 100 and decreased respectively by 16 2 and 21 4 between n0 and n150 furthermore a positive effect of the application of sw and az was found on these last two parameters in fact tp and taa compared to the control increased on average by 8 8 and 13 1 with the application of sw and by 10 8 and 19 7 with the application of az respectively the chlorophyll content decreased by 5 3 under water deficit and increased by 32 5 from n0 to n150 furthermore the application of sw and azo resulted in an average increase of this parameter by 10 2 and 16 0 respectively the water and nitrogen deficit favored the accumulation of carotenoids in fact the total carotenoids in wr 50 were 12 0 higher than in wr 100 and decreased progressively with the increase in the n level reaching 31 in n150 compared to n0 furthermore the application of sw and az favored the accumulation of the latter compounds with an average increase compared to the control of 23 8 and 35 6 respectively the examination of leaf color parameters values highlights the effect of wr and nl on l and of all the treatments compared on a and b the greater availability of water and nitrogen made the leaves brighter as evidenced by the l values which were 10 7 higher in wr 100 compared to wr 50 and 9 2 in n150 compared to n0 the greater availability of water and n and the application of sw and az have made the leaves greener because of the higher chlorophyll content as was also highlighted by the spad values detected during the growth cycles candido et al 2022 and the tch measured at harvest in fact the value of a on average was lower more negative by 13 9 in wr 100 compared to wr 50 by 41 6 in n150 compared to n0 by 26 3 and 19 8 in sw and az compared to control the b values on the other hand were 11 8 higher in wr 50 than in wr 100 while they decreased by 17 4 between n0 and n150 furthermore in the first harvest the application of sw reduced this last parameter by 15 3 compared to the control in both harvests the leaf nitrate content varied between about 800 and 4700 mg kg 1 fm the water deficit increased ni on average by 35 5 in addition the ni raised considerably with the increase in nl in fact compared to n0 this parameter increased by 99 1 and 288 3 respectively in n75 and n150 sw and az resulted in a reduction in ni of 21 5 and 36 8 respectively 4 discussion the soil water regime has proved to be one of the main factors that affects yield and quality of wild rocket the decrease in yield due to water shortage occurred because of concomitant reduction in leaf size and leaf number per plant as observed by other authors on wild rocket lettuce and spinach bozkurt et al 2009 mahmood et al 2004 mirdad 2009 the reduction of transpiring area that occurs under water deficit is one of the strategies implemented by plants to cope with these situations and represents an adaptation to xeric environments parolin 2001 taiz and zeiger 2002 these morphological variations occur especially when water shortage is prolonged in fact the first consequence of the water deficit is the reduction of stomatal conductance and assimilation rate as has been observed in this trial data not shown which leads to a lower biomass production flexas et al 2006 hammad et al 2018 romero aranda et al 2001 furthermore the water deficit has changed the allocation of assimilates between the aerial part and roots resulting in a greater root biomass than aboveground biomass this behavior confirms the capability of plant to adapt to the lower availability of resources which the root system absorbs and transfers to the aerial part liu and stützel 2004 these results agree with the literature in which it is reported that plants subjected to prolonged water deficit tend to allocate a greater quantity of assimilates in the roots than in the aerial part and that the alteration of the relationship between aerial part and roots derives from either the increase in root growth or the reduction of growth of the aerial part compared to the root franco 2011 kerbiriou et al 2013 the higher nitrogen doses resulted in an increase in yield of over 100 and 300 compared to the non fertilized control in the first and second harvest respectively a notable difference between two harvests is attributable to the fact that in the first growth cycle wild rocket of the unfertilized control treatment benefited from the nitrogen reserve in the soil nevertheless in the second growth cycle the plants experienced greater n deficiency since most of the nitrogen reserve had been already depleted the positive effect of nitrogen on yield was observed in a greater extent by the increase in the leaf number and secondarily by the leaf size this result agrees with the findings reported by schiattone et al 2018 on wild rocket and with observations made on other leafy vegetables wang and li 2004 zhang et al 2015 or other species awais et al 2017 rahman et al 2021 however the increase in nitrogen intake caused a detrimental effect on yield under water deficit as already observed on wild rocket by schiattone et al 2018 similarly liu et al 2012 reported that the high nitrogen intake causes an increase in leaf sensitivity to water stress that led to a decrease of growth and yield in fact water scarcity in addition to directly limiting the growth process and plant survival indirectly influences the plant s response to nutrients song et al 2010 hence it can be affirmed that a supply of n commensurates with the water regime to which the crop is expected to be subjected would help to improve its response to water shortage arora et al 2001 the increase in the nitrogen level in addition to the increase of aboveground biomass also led to a greater development of root biomass however the ratio between root biomass and total biomass presented very high values in the non fertilized control and decreased with the increase in nitrogen supply as well as for the water deficit in the case of n deficiency the plants change the allocation of assimilates in favor of the roots whose greater growth supports the plant s capacity for the absorption of nutrients similar conclusions are reported in literature for different species demonstrating the important role of root growth in balancing any lack of nutrients and or water bonifas et al 2005 hammad et al 2017 the application of the seaweed extract based biostimulant resulted in an increase of yield in accordance with the rise of net assimilation data not shown the increase of photosynthesis is attributable to the higher content of chlorophyll whose biosynthesis was probably stimulated by the biostimulant jannin et al 2013 the root biomass has also increased with the application of seaweed extract based biostimulant such as the ratio between roots and aerial part therefore a better water and nutrient absorption efficiency may have contributed to improve yield of plants treated with the biostimulants the biostimulating effect of seaweed extracts are well documented on a large number of species baltazar et al 2021 however the causes are not yet well known some authors have attributed some of the biostimulating effects to the presence of phytohormones ertani et al 2018 however this hypothesis has been rejected by other studies that have highlighted the irrelevant content of phytohormones in seaweed extracts also taking into account the even lower quantity of extract that is distributed on the vegetation stirk et al 2014 instead other authors have shifted the attention to various polysaccharides found in considerable concentrations in the extracts shekhar sharma et al 2014 some biostimulating and abiotic stress mitigation effects could be attributed to them baltazar et al 2021 azoxystrobin also resulted in a significant increase in yield which as for the seaweed extract based biostimulant is the direct consequence of the positive effect of this substance on net assimilation data not shown the higher leaf chlorophyll content could be the main cause of the increased photosynthesis as well as the improvement of the water status of the plant due to the control exerted on the stomatal conductance by the phytohormones whose production seems to be stimulated by azoxystrobin grossmann and retzlaff 1997 venancio et al 2003 another factor that could contribute to the increased yield following the application of azoxystrobin is the stimulation of nitrate reductase activity amaro et al 2018 barbosa et al 2011 ishikawa et al 2012 in fact this enzyme plays a fundamental role in the nitrogen organication process which leads to the formation of new organic molecules such as nucleotides and amino acids köehle et al 2002 the greater tolerance to water deficit of plants treated with azoxystrobin can be attributed to the effect on the biosynthesis of the phytohormones involved in stomatal regulation and therefore on the plant s water status boari et al 2017 cantore et al 2016 contrary to the seaweed extract based biostimulant in the case of azoxystrobin there was a reduction in the roots aerial part ratio the higher production levels were obtained because of the greater net assimilation as well as a different economy in the allocation of assimilates the leaf dry matter increased in conditions of water deficit and decreased with the increase in the nitrogen level similarly bonasia et al 2017 and schiattone et al 2017 reported a rise in the leaf dry matter of diplotaxis genotypes subjected to salt stress in the case of low to moderate salinity the effects are attributable to the consequences of water shortage induced by salinity an increase in dry matter following the water deficit was also found on lettuce and cabbage karam et al 2002 xu and leskovar 2014 while for spinach the same parameter was inversely correlated to the nitrogen dose provided liphadzi et al 2006 water deficit led to a reduction in the leaf chlorophyll content and an increase in carotenoids as shown by the spad data and color characteristics these results agree with the findings reported by schiattone et al 2017 on wild rocket on various leafy vegetables luoh et al 2014 reported contrasting effects of water deficit on carotenoid content while misra and srivastava 2000 observed a reduction in two parameters chlorophyll raised with the increase of nitrogen level while an opposite effect on carotenoids was observed in literature conflicting results are reported on the effects of n availability on these parameters kopsell et al 2007 reported that the increase in the n level does not affect chlorophyll and carotenoids in the fresh tissues of cabbage leaves but for the latter parameter the trend is reversed if the value is expressed on the dry matter basis in our case phenols and antioxidant activity increased under water and nitrogen deficit as also reported by other authors koyama et al 2012 luoh et al 2014 the application of the seaweed extract based biostimulant and azoxystrobin increased chlorophyll and carotenoids in accordance with results reported on wild rocket by candido et al 2022 and schiattone et al 2021 similarly kulkarni et al 2019 observed chlorophyll and carotenoids increase in spinach after seaweed extract application jannin et al 2013 reported that biostimulating compounds based on seaweed extracts favor the biosynthesis of chloroplasts and the reduction of chlorophyll degradation strobilurins also favor the increase in chlorophyll as observed by other authors bonasia et al 2013 liang et al 2018 which can be attributed to the reduction of the synthesis of ethylene a hormone known to be involved in the processes of senescence and degradation of chlorophyll abeles et al 1992 and the increase of cytokinins involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll sundqvist et al 1980 the azoxystrobin and the biostimulant based on seaweed extract resulted in an increase in total phenols and antioxidant activity notoriously this last parameter is closely related to the phenolic content since phenols are among the main antioxidant compounds present in the plant the experimental findings confirmed the increase in phenols as a response to the application of seaweed extracts battacharyya et al 2015 as for example on spinach rouphael et al 2018 cherry correia et al 2020 gonçalves et al 2020 soybean do rosário rosa et al 2021 common bean kocira et al 2020 and cucumber trejo valencia et al 2018 following the application of azoxystrobin conversa et al 2014 observed an increase in phenols on baby leaf spinach while bonasia et al 2013 did not observe any effects leaf nitrate content was below the limits imposed by the eu reg ue n 1258 2011 in all treatments this confirms the results obtained on wild rocket by schiattone et al 2017 and demonstrates that in the climatic conditions of southern italy even in greenhouse where the light intensity is reduced the problem of high nitrate content is more limited compared to the northern latitudes in these environments the scarce availability of light and the low air temperature slow down the nitrogen metabolism favouring the increase of nitrates in plant bonasia et al 2017 weightman et al 2012 among the treatments studied the water deficit and the increase in nitrogen level favored a greater accumulation of nitrates in the leaves of the wild rocket this is consistent with the literature data according to which the water deficit reduces the activity of nitrate reductase santamaria et al 1999 weightman et al 2012 as well as the higher n content in the rhizosphere favors its absorption by the roots and therefore its accumulation in the aerial part chen et al 2004 devienne barret et al 2000 weightman et al 2012 the application of the seaweed extract based biostimulant and azoxystrobin reduced the leaf nitrates this can be attributed to the better physiological conditions of the treated plants which had a greater photosynthetic activity in the case of azoxystrobin the results of this study agree with several other studies that attribute to azoxiytrobin a stimulating action of nitrato reductase activity bonasia et al 2013 conversa et al 2014 joshi et al 2014 5 conclusions the research focused on the biostimulating effect of seaweed extract sw and azoxystrobin az in combination with two irrigation regimes and three nitrogen levels to improve the production of wild rocket as it was expected the water deficit negatively affected yield of wild rocket however improving some qualitative features such as phenols carotenoids and antioxidant activity worsening others such as dry matter and nitrates yield increased with the raise in the n level but the latter worsened the effects of the water deficit and some qualitative parameters such as phenols antioxidant activity carotenoids and nitrate content the tested biostimulants showed good efficacy on yield for increasing the number of leaves sw or their size az furthermore they reduced the negative effects of water and nitrogen deficit the application of two biostimulants has improved the quality of wild rocket for the increase of phenols antioxidant activity carotenoids and chlorophyll and the reduction of nitrates biostimulating products based on azoxystrobin or seaweed extracts can be a beneficial strategy for wild rocket growers to increase yield improve quality and limit the negative effects of water deficit it should be emphasized that azoxystrobin is a pesticide already marketed for the fight against various fungal diseases therefore its use can be promoted as an alternative to other fungicides given the complementary biostimulating action further research is desirable to evaluate the optimal doses and methods of application of the two biostimulants tested in addition further studies should be carried out to identify the active compound s of the seaweed extract declaration of competing interest the authors

9104,crop resilience refers to the adaptive ability of crops to resist drought at a certain level when the degree of drought stress did not exceed the resilience range of the crop the crop could recover even exceed normal growth after rehydration however the assessment of crop resilience lacks considerations on mechanisms focusing on the suitable maize planting areas in china this study took relative soil humidity rsh as the index to screen drought and rehydration events identified the resilience mechanism of maize under drought and rehydration conditions and determined the correlation between resilience and rsh the results shown that the strongest resilience were found in the northern part of the north china plain nncp the central part of the north china plain cncp the central eastern part of the north china plain encp and the north anhui plain nap followed by the guanzhong plain gp and the central sichuan hills csh and the songnen plain sp had the weakest resilience based on the relationship analysis between rsh and the resilience of maize under drought stress maize had resilience when 34 rsh 54 and the resilience increased with the decreasing rsh when rsh 34 the drought stress exceeded the resilience of maize maize cannot resume normal growth after rehydration therefore bases on the resilience mechanism of maize to drought and combined with the monitoring of rsh irrigation in an appropriate period can maximize water saving which provides supports for drought risk response and efficient utilization of water resources keywords drought and rehydration relative soil humidity arx model irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction droughts floods high temperature are the main external disturbance factors in crop growth and development gupta et al 2020 raza et al 2019 drought is a complicated phenomenon influenced by meteorological factors and related to soil moisture and surface conditions in the early stage agricultural water use and food production are seriously threatened by drought drought risk response is still a major research focus song et al 2020 webber et al 2018 although drought stress has serious threats to crops some scholars believe that rehydration can compensate for the losses of biomass and yields of crops caused by drought stress at a certain level for that deficit irrigation and other agricultural water management strategies can improve irrigation efficiency and crop yields li et al 2019b wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021a thus this phenomenon indicates that crops have the resilience to resist drought and can recover even exceed normal growth after rehydration under a certain degree of drought stress which is called crop resilience maize one of the most important crops in the world is especially sensitive to drought stress severe drought can reduce maize yield or even fail to harvest jagermeyr and frieler 2018 simpkins 2020 webber et al 2018 drought will cause a maize yield loss by 41 and a higher risk of drought in the mid latitudes under 1 5 global warming from 2021 to 2055 yin et al 2021 in addition extreme drought caused up to 37 of u s maize yield losses from 1981 to 2016 li et al 2019a likewise from 1980 to 2018 maize yields were reduced by 30 50 in northeast china under different levels of drought conditions li et al 2022 and drought in both the planting tasseling and tasseling physiological maturity periods of summer maize showed an increasing trend in most of the huang huai hai plain of china from 1961 to 2015 wu et al 2021 it can be better illustrated that drought stress poses serious threats to maize yield and it is essential to improve the irrigation water use efficiency under drought stress the assessment on the resilience of maize can support the development of management strategies for agricultural water use and food production under drought stress many scholars have qualitatively analyzed the drought resistance of maize by studying the organs photosynthesis osmotic regulation reactive oxygen species metabolism hormone regulation gene expression under drought stress li et al 2019c 2020b nikolaeva et al 2017 renwick et al 2021 voronin et al 2019 waititu et al 2021 some studies have found maize leaves reduce water loss by adjusting leaf reflection and stomatal opening ma et al 2021 sun et al 2018 additionally coordinated changes in chlorophyll content gas exchange and fluorescence parameters possibly contributed to the enhanced maize resilience under drought conditions qi et al 2021 abscisic acid aba plays an active role in maize photosynthesis oxidative phosphorylation and other signaling pathways inducing transcription factors and regulating the expression of stress responsive genes transcription factors regulate the expression levels of target stress responsive genes independently or interact with other transcription factors furthermore it participates in the growth of maize and improves the comprehensive resistance of maize to various environmental stimuli leng and zhao 2020 zhao et al 2016 these studies imply that these traits confer resistance in maize under drought stress indeed the maize growth mechanism also has closely interaction with the growth environment ullah et al 2021 under certain drought stress soil biological physical and chemical properties change over time altering filed capacity and affecting maize resistance indirectly he et al 2017 mannan et al 2021 patel et al 2021 soil texture plays a significant role in water uptake by maize plants in different soil types maize has various water absorption capacities and resistance cai et al 2021 likewise soil bacteria can increase resistance in maize for example arbuscular fungi can enrich soil fertility protein and improve the drought resistance of maize chandra et al 2021 samiappan et al 2021 it can be seen that a favorable growth environment can enhance maize resistance under drought stress in addition to resistance maize also has a certain resilience which can improve the adaptive ability of maize to a certain degree of drought stress however there are still few researches in this aspect at present this study clarified the theoretical mechanism of maize resilience and established a correlation relationship between maize resilience and rsh taking the typical suitable planting areas in china as the object we screened the typical drought and rehydration events of different degrees in different regions correspondingly we analyzed the maize normalized difference vegetation index ndvi under different conditions on this basis we assessed the resilience of maize in each region under different conditions the functional relationship between the resilience of maize and rsh was established under drought condition in suitable planting areas in china which helps to judge the most appropriate irrigation time for maize this study can provide theoretical supports for irrigation management 2 materials and methods 2 1 maize resilience theoretical basis a certain degree of drought stress can stimulate the ability of maize to resist drought i e the maize has the resilience fig 1a describes the resilience mechanism of maize the green line in fig 1a reveals that maize can resist drought on its own resistance and return to the normal growth status after rehydration under light drought stress cai et al 2020 the red line in fig 1a shows that maize can recover or exceed the normal growth status after rehydration through the resilience of maize under severe drought stress armanhi et al 2021 peterson et al 2018 at a certain drought level crop resilience is the ability of crops to exceed their normal growth conditions however due to the limited resilience of maize the blue line in fig 1a points out that maize is unable to resume the normal growth status after rehydration under more severe drought stress which exceeds the resilience of maize sun et al 2016 vetterlein et al 2022 drought level exceeds a certain range drought has a destructive effect on the growth of maize based on the resilience mechanism of maize the theoretical relationship between the growth ability of maize and rsh was further explored as shown in fig 1b when rsh rshb the growth ability of maize is equal to its own growth ability when rshm rsh rshb the growth ability of maize is equal to the sum of its own growth ability and resilience when rsh rshm the growth ability of maize is equal to the sum of its own growth ability and the maximum resilience under drought stress when rsh rshm maize exceeds the limit of resilience and cannot return to normal growth status 2 2 study area comprehensively seven typical research areas were selected on considering the classification results of suitable maize planting areas in china the red box line in fig 2a b c surface relief degree fig 2a climate fig 2b and soil type fig 2c he and zhou 2011 the research areas contain the songnen plain sp the northern part of the north china plain nncp the central part of the north china plain cncp the central eastern part of the north china plain encp the northern anhui plain nap the guanzhong plain gp and the central sichuan hilly region csh the black box lines in fig 2a c were multiple meteorological station areas divided by the thiessen polygon method the geographic coordinates of meteorological stations were obtained from the national meteorological science data center http data cma cn the calculation of the meteorological station areas was to eliminate the influence of uneven precipitation in the same period of time on the accuracy of the results other characteristics of each typical research areas were counted in table 1 2 3 data 2 3 1 soil volumetric water content data era5 climate reanalysis data the fifth generation of european centre for medium range weather forecasts is the latest data created by the copernicus climate change service https cds climate copernicus eu zandler et al 2020 era5 land dataset is part of era5 climate reanalysis data evaluated with in situ soil moisture observations from agrometeorological stations this dataset was suitable for various surface applications such as drought or flood prediction beck et al 2021 where in drought monitoring the era5 land soil volumetric water content subsurface dataset 7 28 cm could better reflect drought conditions than the surface 0 7 cm beck et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b the era5 is superior than era interim in most regions of china li and huang 2021 the extreme value of soil moisture is estimated well and have been applied in other regions of china chen and yuan 2020 thus the era5 land soil volumetric water content subsurface dataset was selected in this study zha et al 2022 we download the daily grib format data of this dataset in each typical study area the time horizon for this dataset was daily 8 00 a m from march to october between 2001 and 2020 the horizontal resolution for this dataset was 0 1 by 0 1 2 3 2 remote sensing data in this study mod09ga daily products was derived from nasa laads daac version 6 0 and 6 1 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis datasets https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov these products had a spatial resolution of 500 m including seven albedo bands and corresponding quality control data time series of this data corresponded to the time series of drought and rehydration events screened out in the study in addition land use data obtained from the resource and environmental science and data center of the institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn default aspx the three phase land use data in 2005 2010 and 2015 were downloaded from this website which had a spatial resolution of 1 km the type data of cultivated dry land was extracted in this study 2 4 drought and rehydration events identification 2 4 1 identification index in this study the classification standard of drought was used as the classification standard of drought and rehydration events the rsh in china s standards of drought situations sl424 2008 was used as the evaluation index the calculation equation was as follows bi et al 2020 1 rsh θ f c 100 θ was the soil average weight moisture was calculated from the ratio of soil volumetric water content to soil bulk density f c was the field capacity drought and rehydration events are divided into five degrees that is when rsh 60 means no drought rsh is within 50 60 indicating light drought and rehydration rsh is within 40 50 indicating moderate drought and rehydration rsh is within 30 40 indicating severe drought and rehydration rsh 30 indicating extreme drought and rehydration the rsh of daily time horizon same as soil volumetric water content datasets was calculated for each station area in each study area taking the calculation of a single station as an example first converting the original data of soil volumetric water content in grib format into tiff format then the soil volumetric water content of cultivated dryland was extracted using the land use data secondly the daily soil volumetric water content was extracted according to the thiessen polygon range of the station then the soil volumetric water content of every eight days from march 5 was calculated by the maximum synthesis method third the average soil volumetric water content of every eight days was calculated by the station area statistics finally rsh per 8d was calculated based on eq 1 2 4 2 identification principle this study used relative soil humidity rsh as a threshold to identify long sequence drought and rehydration events at each station in every study area referring to the run theoretic method of drought event identification jingfang et al 2022 the identification rules of drought and rehydration events were shown in fig 3 1 the onset of drought and rehydration events is defined as the moment when rsh drops to 60 which is the beginning of the drought gx immediately rsh continues to fall to the lowest point rsh0 which is the starting of the rehydration period px after that rsh continues to rise to 60 which is the end of the dry period fx then rsh continues increasing when rsh starts to fall again it is the end of the drought and rehydration event f0 2 the interval between the start and the end time of a drought and rehydration event is the duration of the drought and rehydration event tx1 tx2 tx3 tx1 and tx2 are the drought period tx2 and tx3 are the rehydration period considering that the short duration cannot characterize the growth status of maize this study mainly considers drought and rehydration events that last no less than six weeks 3 according to the classification standard of drought and rehydration events the grade of each drought and rehydration event is judged by rsh0 2 5 resilience model 2 5 1 calculation of normalized vegetation index the ndvi of cultivated dry land was selected to reflected the change process of maize growth huang et al 2016 the equation for calculating ndvi is as follows 2 ndvi band 2 band 1 ban d 2 band 1 band1 is the red light band band2 is the near red light band in this study the time series of ndvi was corresponded to the typical drought and rehydration events in each study area taking the calculation of a single event as an example the detail steps for the calculation of ndvi were as follows first the band1 and band2 in the original data were extracted and processed into tiff format data then the daily ndvi was calculated by eq 2 secondly ndvi dryland of cultivated dryland was extracted from the land use data according to the thiessen polygon range of the station of this drought and rehydration event the daily ndvi dryland were extracted meanwhile the time series matching the drought and rehydration events were calculated then using the maximum synthesis method the per 8d ndvi dryland was calculated thirdly the average value of 8d ndvi drought was calculated by the station area statistics and then converted the data into excel format of these the maximum synthesis method could eliminate some interferences caused by sensor degradation and cloud cover huang et al 2016 2 5 2 method of the resilience model to explore the resilience of maize under drought stress this study established an autoregressive mathematical model arx model the arx model can infer the variables changing according to the time series de keersmaecker et al 2015 li et al 2020a using arx model can calculate the change of ndvi so as to determine the crop resilience the rsh and abnormal history of maize ndvi was established to simulate the resilience of maize in this study the formula is as follows 3 ndvi t α ndvi t 1 β rsh t ε t ndvi t is the ndvi at time t rsh t is the relative soil humidity at time t ε t is a random white noise sequence with mean of 0 α β are the coefficient of the model α represents the recovery of maize β represents the resilience of maize the larger the β indicates the stronger the resilience of maize and vice versa the selected drought and rehydration events were individually fitted to the model eq 3 the selection criteria of the optimal model were based on the lowest schwartz criterion that was the optimal model was chosen by residual based root mean square error rmse if rmse 0 9 the model was considered to fit well then a series of β were fitted if the β 1 indicated that the system returns to equilibrium in an oscillating manner which would cause errors in the optimal fitting results of the model therefore the interference of outliers needed to be excluded in this study after excluding outliers the relationship between β and rsh0 was established and the equation was fitted the correlation between the resilience of maize and rsh was further constructed 2 6 data analysis and statistics in this study arcgis and mrt software were used to uniformly process soil volumetric water content and modis data into tiff format data in the same geographic coordinate system using python and r programming the rsh and ndvi per 8d of the cultivated dryland at each station in each study area were calculated statistically the rsh was calculated in microsoft office excel2013 using python programming different degrees of drought and rehydration events were identified at each station in each study area the arx model in matlab software was used to analyze the resilience of maize under drought and rehydration conditions in each study area and the rmse was calculated to judge the model s fit the average duration and frequency of drought and rehydration events of different degrees were statistically analyzed in each study area were analyzed with the boxplot and pie chart in origin2021 typical drought and rehydration events of different levels were screened concerning the average duration frequency of occurrence and planting time 3 results 3 1 characteristic of drought and rehydration events and typical events screening this study considered the duration frequency and planting time to screen typical drought and rehydration events of different degrees in each study area therefore the duration and frequency characteristics of drought and rehydration events at all stations in each study area were statistically analyzed the boxplot in fig 4 plotted that the average duration of drought and rehydration events at different degrees in each study area overall the average duration of the light drought and rehydration dr1 the moderate drought and rehydration dr2 and the severe drought and rehydration dr3 were 54d 62d and 75d respectively under the condition of dr1 the encp and gp lasted longer than 54d the nap sp csh and cncp lasted less than 54d the nncp did not happen dr1 under the condition of dr2 the nncp sp and nap lasted longer than 62d the cncp encp gp and csh lasted less than 62d sp and nncp did not happen dr3 excepted for these two regions under conditions of dr3 the gp and nap lasted 75 days and more the encp csh and cncp lasted less than 75 days the pie chart in fig 4 described the frequency of drought and rehydration events at different degrees in each study area generally the frequency of dr1 and dr2 were higher and the frequency of dr3 was lower the sp was shown as the highest frequency under dr1 of 63 6 the nncp encp nap and csh presented the highest frequency under dr2 of 100 52 8 36 5 and 44 1 respectively the cncp and gp had the highest frequency under dr3 of 60 56 1 respectively the typical drought and rehydration events of different degrees in each study areas were selected and the no drought events of the same station corresponding to each event were also selected the screening results were shown in table 2 3 2 analysis of maize growth rate during drought and rehydration period to verify the theoretical curve of fig 1a we analyzed the variation trend of δndvi under drought and rehydration conditions in fig 5 in general the overall variation trend of δndvi was parabolic in the most study areas consistent with the theoretical curve that was to say after the drought started the ndvi basically shown a downward trend after rehydration the ndvi gradually increased when rsh returned to no drought the ndvi was higher than 0 it indicated that maize had resilience if maize could adapt a stronger degree of drought and recover or exceed normal growth after rehydration it indicated that the resilience of maize was stronger as shown in fig 5 for each study area after the drought started the δndvi of maize shown an approximately trend of decrease increase decrease under dr1 and dr2 in the sp when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi decreased to 0 04 and 0 11 respectively these trends elucidated that maize unable to recover normal growth in the sp under the degree of drought stress exceeded the resilience of maize however in the encp maize had resilience under dr1 and dr2 conditions after the drought started the ndvi shown an approximately trend of decrease increase when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi increased to 0 14 0 08 under dr1 and dr2 in the encp respectively meanwhile the δndvi increased to 0 14 under dr2 in the nncp likewise after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of decreased increase under dr1 dr2 and dr3 in the cncp and nap when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 05 0 3 and 0 19 under dr1 dr2 and dr3 in the cncp respectively and δndvi changed to 0 28 0 12 and 0 16 under dr1 dr2 and dr3 in the nap respectively it shed light on that maize had stronger resilience in the encp nncp cncp and nap region in the csh after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of decrease increase under dr1 when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 09 however after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of decrease increase decrease under dr2 and dr3 when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 03 and 0 25 respectively similarly in the gp after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of decrease increase under dr1 and dr3 when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 04 and 0 06 however after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of increase decrease increase under dr2 but when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 04 it shown that maize had resilience in the csh and gp region but it was weaker than that in the encp nncp cncp and nap region 3 3 analysis of relationship between maize resilience and relative soil humidity the β of each arx model was extracted details were shown in table 3 after excluding outliers β 1 extracting the β of each region and the corresponding rsh0 in each rsh then the relationship between resilience β and rsh0 was established the dark blue dotted curve shown in fig 6 an exponential function could be identified that was to say between β and rsh0 shown a more obvious exponential function relationship under drought stress which verified the reasonableness of the theoretical curve in fig 1b when rsh0 55 β approached 0 when rsh0 34 β would increase in fact if rsh0 34 maize was unable to recover normal growth in the study therefore when rsh0 34 β was same as that when rsh0 34 the mathematical relationship between β and rsh could be further established as follows 4 β 0 rsh 54 8 0068 exp 10 16 r 34 rsh 54 0 34 rsh 34 under drought conditions when rsh 54 the own growth ability of maize could resist the influence of drought at this time the resilience of maize was 0 when 34 rsh 54 the maize had resilience the growth ability of maize was equaled to the sum of its own growth ability and the resilience when rsh 34 the growth ability of maize was equaled to the sum of its own growth ability and the maximum resilience 4 discussion 4 1 drought and rehydration events unlike long term drought drought and rehydration events were the complete process of soil drought that was to say after a period of continuous drought the soil was replenished with water precipitation irrigation groundwater to restore it to no drought conditions in addition to accurately assess the impact of drought severity on maize growth the classification standard used here was the same one for drought we compared the characteristics of drought and rehydration events in some study areas with those described in others researches this study shown that the frequency of dr1 occurred in the sp region was the highest and no occurrence of dr3 this result was consistent with the analysis of drought and flood disasters in northwest jilin with higher frequency of light drought wang et al 2019 additionally no occurrence of dr3 might be explained by farmers planting habits during severe droughts farmers might use water or irrigation equipment to supply water thus the evaluation results of this study might be impacted and the nncp region had a similar reason moreover in nncp the duration of dr1 was relatively short so the dr1 event did not occur the dr3 frequency was the highest in the gp and cncp consistent with the previous research results those researches pointed out that the eastern and southern parts of shaanxi province were respectively maize high and sub highly vulnerable areas and the southern hebei eastern shijiazhuang western hengshui and northeastern xingtai were the aridest areas liqin et al 2020 wang et al 2020b the above comparisons could be illustrated that evaluating drought and rehydration events by relative soil humidity index was more accurate 4 2 resilience of typical maize planting areas by comparing and analyzing the changing trend of the ndvi under different degrees of drought and rehydration in each area we could identify the resilience mechanism of maize although maize had short term resilience in the sp it still could not resist the negative effects caused by drought stress so maize could not resume normal growth compared with other regions the resilience of maize in the sp region was the weakest this result was consistent with the increase of crop drought risk in northeast china song et al 2020 in the encp nncp cncp and nap region maize had the strongest resilience meanwhile in the gp and csh region maize had the second strongest resilience the trends of δndvi were consistent with the theoretical curve of fig 1a in this study in these trends of δndvi we also could see that the growth rate of maize under dr3 was higher than that under dr2 in the nap region however the growth rate of maize under dr3 was lower than that under dr2 in the cncp region the reasons might be related to the duration of drought thus this study further shown that under the same drought degree a certain drought duration may affect the resilience of maize in the csh region the trends of δndvi were the same under the dr1 and dr2 conditions but it was different from that under the dr3 condition the trends of δndvi were the same under the dr2 and dr3 conditions in the gp region but it was different from that under the dr1 condition the main reason was that maize with the same trend variations was in the same growth period in other words in the same growth period even if the degree of drought stress on maize was different the variation trend was the same this phenomenon may further illustrate that different growth periods may have the different resilience of maize in addition due to the limitation of existing data there may be certain errors in the calculation results but the overall trend is not affected 4 3 maize resilience and rsh this study quantified the resilience of maize and its relationship with relative soil humidity it aimed to determine the most suitable water saving irrigation time for maize under drought stress it would be to determine appropriate irrigation through the monitoring of relative soil humidity index rather than the actual growth status of maize when rsh 54 the drought degrees were light or no drought its own growth ability of maize could adapt growth under drought stress at this situation maize might not be irrigated when rsh was between 34 and 54 the resilience of maize gradually increased under drought conditions this was the best time for water saving irrigation when rsh 34 the degree of drought stress exceeded the resilience of maize and the plant would be destructively affected falling to recover normal growth therefore suitable irrigation is significant to agricultural water use efficiency under drought conditions the exponential relationship between β and rsh in this study r2 was relatively low the situation reveals that the growth of maize was not only affected by relative soil humidity but might be affected by other parameters in addition there was no dr3 situation in some areas in this study the main reason was that due to insufficient irrigation data the influence of irrigation water on the calculation of rsh could not be ruled out moreover due to data limitations this study did not carry out a detailed analysis of crops in different growth periods but it will not affect the overall trend of crop growth change therefore future research still needs to combine field experiments to refine further the calculation method of maize resilience and the setting of drought stress scenarios 5 conclusion this study enriched the theory and connotation of maize resilience and established the theoretical relationship between maize growth ability and relative soil humidity further taking seven typical maize suitable planting areas in the china as objects we identified the characteristics of drought and rehydration events and analyzed the resilience of maize in different regions the relationship between the resilience of maize and rsh was established the results showed that maize could not recover normal growth after rewatering under dr1 and dr2 in the sp maize had the weakest resilience in the csh maize could not recover normal growth after rewatering under dr2 and dr3 and maize could not recover normal growth after rewatering under dr2 in the gp it indicated that maize had the second strongest resilience maize could recover normal growth after rewatering under dr1 dr2 and dr3 in the nncp cncp encp and nap and had the strongest resilience under drought conditions when 34 rsh 54 maize had resilience which increased with the decreasing of rsh this period is the most suitable water saving irrigation period these results basically verified our theory hypothesis and could provide a basis

9104,crop resilience refers to the adaptive ability of crops to resist drought at a certain level when the degree of drought stress did not exceed the resilience range of the crop the crop could recover even exceed normal growth after rehydration however the assessment of crop resilience lacks considerations on mechanisms focusing on the suitable maize planting areas in china this study took relative soil humidity rsh as the index to screen drought and rehydration events identified the resilience mechanism of maize under drought and rehydration conditions and determined the correlation between resilience and rsh the results shown that the strongest resilience were found in the northern part of the north china plain nncp the central part of the north china plain cncp the central eastern part of the north china plain encp and the north anhui plain nap followed by the guanzhong plain gp and the central sichuan hills csh and the songnen plain sp had the weakest resilience based on the relationship analysis between rsh and the resilience of maize under drought stress maize had resilience when 34 rsh 54 and the resilience increased with the decreasing rsh when rsh 34 the drought stress exceeded the resilience of maize maize cannot resume normal growth after rehydration therefore bases on the resilience mechanism of maize to drought and combined with the monitoring of rsh irrigation in an appropriate period can maximize water saving which provides supports for drought risk response and efficient utilization of water resources keywords drought and rehydration relative soil humidity arx model irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction droughts floods high temperature are the main external disturbance factors in crop growth and development gupta et al 2020 raza et al 2019 drought is a complicated phenomenon influenced by meteorological factors and related to soil moisture and surface conditions in the early stage agricultural water use and food production are seriously threatened by drought drought risk response is still a major research focus song et al 2020 webber et al 2018 although drought stress has serious threats to crops some scholars believe that rehydration can compensate for the losses of biomass and yields of crops caused by drought stress at a certain level for that deficit irrigation and other agricultural water management strategies can improve irrigation efficiency and crop yields li et al 2019b wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021a thus this phenomenon indicates that crops have the resilience to resist drought and can recover even exceed normal growth after rehydration under a certain degree of drought stress which is called crop resilience maize one of the most important crops in the world is especially sensitive to drought stress severe drought can reduce maize yield or even fail to harvest jagermeyr and frieler 2018 simpkins 2020 webber et al 2018 drought will cause a maize yield loss by 41 and a higher risk of drought in the mid latitudes under 1 5 global warming from 2021 to 2055 yin et al 2021 in addition extreme drought caused up to 37 of u s maize yield losses from 1981 to 2016 li et al 2019a likewise from 1980 to 2018 maize yields were reduced by 30 50 in northeast china under different levels of drought conditions li et al 2022 and drought in both the planting tasseling and tasseling physiological maturity periods of summer maize showed an increasing trend in most of the huang huai hai plain of china from 1961 to 2015 wu et al 2021 it can be better illustrated that drought stress poses serious threats to maize yield and it is essential to improve the irrigation water use efficiency under drought stress the assessment on the resilience of maize can support the development of management strategies for agricultural water use and food production under drought stress many scholars have qualitatively analyzed the drought resistance of maize by studying the organs photosynthesis osmotic regulation reactive oxygen species metabolism hormone regulation gene expression under drought stress li et al 2019c 2020b nikolaeva et al 2017 renwick et al 2021 voronin et al 2019 waititu et al 2021 some studies have found maize leaves reduce water loss by adjusting leaf reflection and stomatal opening ma et al 2021 sun et al 2018 additionally coordinated changes in chlorophyll content gas exchange and fluorescence parameters possibly contributed to the enhanced maize resilience under drought conditions qi et al 2021 abscisic acid aba plays an active role in maize photosynthesis oxidative phosphorylation and other signaling pathways inducing transcription factors and regulating the expression of stress responsive genes transcription factors regulate the expression levels of target stress responsive genes independently or interact with other transcription factors furthermore it participates in the growth of maize and improves the comprehensive resistance of maize to various environmental stimuli leng and zhao 2020 zhao et al 2016 these studies imply that these traits confer resistance in maize under drought stress indeed the maize growth mechanism also has closely interaction with the growth environment ullah et al 2021 under certain drought stress soil biological physical and chemical properties change over time altering filed capacity and affecting maize resistance indirectly he et al 2017 mannan et al 2021 patel et al 2021 soil texture plays a significant role in water uptake by maize plants in different soil types maize has various water absorption capacities and resistance cai et al 2021 likewise soil bacteria can increase resistance in maize for example arbuscular fungi can enrich soil fertility protein and improve the drought resistance of maize chandra et al 2021 samiappan et al 2021 it can be seen that a favorable growth environment can enhance maize resistance under drought stress in addition to resistance maize also has a certain resilience which can improve the adaptive ability of maize to a certain degree of drought stress however there are still few researches in this aspect at present this study clarified the theoretical mechanism of maize resilience and established a correlation relationship between maize resilience and rsh taking the typical suitable planting areas in china as the object we screened the typical drought and rehydration events of different degrees in different regions correspondingly we analyzed the maize normalized difference vegetation index ndvi under different conditions on this basis we assessed the resilience of maize in each region under different conditions the functional relationship between the resilience of maize and rsh was established under drought condition in suitable planting areas in china which helps to judge the most appropriate irrigation time for maize this study can provide theoretical supports for irrigation management 2 materials and methods 2 1 maize resilience theoretical basis a certain degree of drought stress can stimulate the ability of maize to resist drought i e the maize has the resilience fig 1a describes the resilience mechanism of maize the green line in fig 1a reveals that maize can resist drought on its own resistance and return to the normal growth status after rehydration under light drought stress cai et al 2020 the red line in fig 1a shows that maize can recover or exceed the normal growth status after rehydration through the resilience of maize under severe drought stress armanhi et al 2021 peterson et al 2018 at a certain drought level crop resilience is the ability of crops to exceed their normal growth conditions however due to the limited resilience of maize the blue line in fig 1a points out that maize is unable to resume the normal growth status after rehydration under more severe drought stress which exceeds the resilience of maize sun et al 2016 vetterlein et al 2022 drought level exceeds a certain range drought has a destructive effect on the growth of maize based on the resilience mechanism of maize the theoretical relationship between the growth ability of maize and rsh was further explored as shown in fig 1b when rsh rshb the growth ability of maize is equal to its own growth ability when rshm rsh rshb the growth ability of maize is equal to the sum of its own growth ability and resilience when rsh rshm the growth ability of maize is equal to the sum of its own growth ability and the maximum resilience under drought stress when rsh rshm maize exceeds the limit of resilience and cannot return to normal growth status 2 2 study area comprehensively seven typical research areas were selected on considering the classification results of suitable maize planting areas in china the red box line in fig 2a b c surface relief degree fig 2a climate fig 2b and soil type fig 2c he and zhou 2011 the research areas contain the songnen plain sp

gp and the central sichuan hilly region csh the black box lines in fig 2a c were multiple meteorological station areas divided by the thiessen polygon method the geographic coordinates of meteorological stations were obtained from the national meteorological science data center http data cma cn the calculation of the meteorological station areas was to eliminate the influence of uneven precipitation in the same period of time on the accuracy of the results other characteristics of each typical research areas were counted in table 1 2 3 data 2 3 1 soil volumetric water content data era5 climate reanalysis data the fifth generation of european centre for medium range weather forecasts is the latest data created by the copernicus climate change service https cds climate copernicus eu zandler et al 2020 era5 land dataset is part of era5 climate reanalysis data evaluated with in situ soil moisture observations from agrometeorological stations this dataset was suitable for various surface applications such as drought or flood prediction beck et al 2021 where in drought monitoring the era5 land soil volumetric water content subsurface dataset 7 28 cm could better reflect drought conditions than the surface 0 7 cm beck et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b the era5 is superior than era interim in most regions of china li and huang 2021 the extreme value of soil moisture is estimated well and have been applied in other regions of china chen and yuan 2020 thus the era5 land soil volumetric water content subsurface dataset was selected in this study zha et al 2022 we download the daily grib format data of this dataset in each typical study area the time horizon for this dataset was daily 8 00 a m from march to october between 2001 and 2020 the horizontal resolution for this dataset was 0 1 by 0 1 2 3 2 remote sensing data in this study mod09ga daily products was derived from nasa laads daac version 6 0 and 6 1 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis datasets https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov these products had a spatial resolution of 500 m including seven albedo bands and corresponding quality control data time series of this data corresponded to the time series of drought and rehydration events screened out in the study in addition land use data obtained from the resource and environmental science and data center of the institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn default aspx the three phase land use data in 2005 2010 and 2015 were downloaded from this website which had a spatial resolution of 1 km the type data of cultivated dry land was extracted in this study 2 4 drought and rehydration events identification 2 4 1 identification index in this study the classification standard of drought was used as the classification standard of drought and rehydration events the rsh in china s standards of drought situations sl424 2008 was used as the evaluation index the calculation equation was as follows bi et al 2020 1 rsh θ f c 100 θ was the soil average weight moisture was calculated from the ratio of soil volumetric water content to soil bulk density f c was the field capacity drought and rehydration events are divided into five degrees that is when rsh 60 means no drought rsh is within 50 60 indicating light drought and rehydration rsh is within 40 50 indicating moderate drought and rehydration rsh is within 30 40 indicating severe drought and rehydration rsh 30 indicating extreme drought and rehydration the rsh of daily time horizon same as soil volumetric water content datasets was calculated for each station area in each study area taking the calculation of a single station as an example first converting the original data of soil volumetric water content in grib format into tiff format then the soil volumetric water content of cultivated dryland was extracted using the land use data secondly the daily soil volumetric water content was extracted according to the thiessen polygon range of the station then the soil volumetric water content of every eight days from march 5 was calculated by the maximum synthesis method third the average soil volumetric water content of every eight days was calculated by the station area statistics finally rsh per 8d was calculated based on eq 1 2 4 2 identification principle this study used relative soil humidity rsh as a threshold to identify long sequence drought and rehydration events at each station in every study area referring to the run theoretic method of drought event identification jingfang et al 2022 the identification rules of drought and rehydration events were shown in fig 3 1 the onset of drought and rehydration events is defined as the moment when rsh drops to 60 which is the beginning of the drought gx immediately rsh continues to fall to the lowest point rsh0 which is the starting of the rehydration period px after that rsh continues to rise to 60 which is the end of the dry period fx then rsh continues increasing when rsh starts to fall again it is the end of the drought and rehydration event f0 2 the interval between the start and the end time of a drought and rehydration event is the duration of the drought and rehydration event tx1 tx2 tx3 tx1 and tx2 are the drought period tx2 and tx3 are the rehydration period considering that the short duration cannot characterize the growth status of maize this study mainly considers drought and rehydration events that last no less than six weeks 3 according to the classification standard of drought and rehydration events the grade of each drought and rehydration event is judged by rsh0 2 5 resilience model 2 5 1 calculation of normalized vegetation index the ndvi of cultivated dry land was selected to reflected the change process of maize growth huang et al 2016 the equation for calculating ndvi is as follows 2 ndvi band 2 band 1 ban d 2 band 1 band1 is the red light band band2 is the near red light band in this study the time series of ndvi was corresponded to the typical drought and rehydration events in each study area taking the calculation of a single event as an example the detail steps for the calculation of ndvi were as follows first the band1 and band2 in the original data were extracted and processed into tiff format data then the daily ndvi was calculated by eq 2 secondly ndvi dryland of cultivated dryland was extracted from the land use data according to the thiessen polygon range of the station of this drought and rehydration event the daily ndvi dryland were extracted meanwhile the time series matching the drought and rehydration events were calculated then using the maximum synthesis method the per 8d ndvi dryland was calculated thirdly the average value of 8d ndvi drought was calculated by the station area statistics and then converted the data into excel format of these the maximum synthesis method could eliminate some interferences caused by sensor degradation and cloud cover huang et al 2016 2 5 2 method of the resilience model to explore the resilience of maize under drought stress this study established an autoregressive mathematical model arx model the arx model can infer the variables changing according to the time series de keersmaecker et al 2015 li et al 2020a using arx model can calculate the change of ndvi so as to determine the crop resilience the rsh and abnormal history of maize ndvi was established to simulate the resilience of maize in this study the formula is as follows 3 ndvi t α ndvi t 1 β rsh t ε t ndvi t is the ndvi at time t rsh t is the relative soil humidity at time t ε t is a random white noise sequence with mean of 0 α β are the coefficient of the model α represents the recovery of maize β represents the resilience of maize the larger the β indicates the stronger the resilience of maize and vice versa the selected drought and rehydration events were individually fitted to the model eq 3 the selection criteria of the optimal model were based on the lowest schwartz criterion that was the optimal model was chosen by residual based root mean square error rmse if rmse 0 9 the model was considered to fit well then a series of β were fitted if the β 1 indicated that the system returns to equilibrium in an oscillating manner which would cause errors in the optimal fitting results of the model therefore the interference of outliers needed to be excluded in this study after excluding outliers the relationship between β and rsh0 was established and the equation was fitted the correlation between the resilience of maize and rsh was further constructed 2 6 data analysis and statistics in this study arcgis and mrt software were used to uniformly process soil volumetric water content and modis data into tiff format data in the same geographic coordinate system using python and r programming the rsh and ndvi per 8d of the cultivated dryland at each station in each study area were calculated statistically the rsh was calculated in microsoft office excel2013 using python programming different degrees of drought and rehydration events were identified at each station in each study area the arx model in matlab software was used to analyze the resilience of maize under drought and rehydration conditions in each study area and the rmse was calculated to judge the model s fit the average duration and frequency of drought and rehydration events of different degrees were statistically analyzed in each study area were analyzed with the boxplot and pie chart in origin2021 typical drought and rehydration events of different levels were screened concerning the average duration frequency of occurrence and planting time 3 results 3 1 characteristic of drought and rehydration events and typical events screening this study considered the duration frequency and planting time to screen typical drought and rehydration events of different degrees in each study area therefore the duration and frequency characteristics of drought and rehydration events at all stations in each study area were statistically analyzed the boxplot in fig 4 plotted that the average duration of drought and rehydration events at different degrees in each study area overall the average duration of the light drought and rehydration dr1 the moderate drought and rehydration dr2 and the severe drought and rehydration dr3 were 54d 62d and 75d respectively under the condition of dr1 the encp and gp lasted longer than 54d the nap sp csh and cncp lasted less than 54d the nncp did not happen dr1 under the condition of dr2 the nncp sp and nap lasted longer than 62d the cncp encp gp and csh lasted less than 62d sp and nncp did not happen dr3 excepted for these two regions under conditions of dr3 the gp and nap lasted 75 days and more the encp csh and cncp lasted less than 75 days the pie chart in fig 4 described the frequency of drought and rehydration events at different degrees in each study area generally the frequency of dr1 and dr2 were higher and the frequency of dr3 was lower the sp was shown as the highest frequency under dr1 of 63 6 the nncp encp nap and csh presented the highest frequency under dr2 of 100 52 8 36 5 and 44 1 respectively the cncp and gp had the highest frequency under dr3 of 60 56 1 respectively the typical drought and rehydration events of different degrees in each study areas were selected and the no drought events of the same station corresponding to each event were also selected the screening results were shown in table 2 3 2 analysis of maize growth rate during drought and rehydration period to verify the theoretical curve of fig 1a we analyzed the variation trend of δndvi under drought and rehydration conditions in fig 5 in general the overall variation trend of δndvi was parabolic in the most study areas consistent with the theoretical curve that was to say after the drought started the ndvi basically shown a downward trend after rehydration the ndvi gradually increased when rsh returned to no drought the ndvi was higher than 0 it indicated that maize had resilience if maize could adapt a stronger degree of drought and recover or exceed normal growth after rehydration it indicated that the resilience of maize was stronger as shown in fig 5 for each study area after the drought started the δndvi of maize shown an approximately trend of decrease increase decrease under dr1 and dr2 in the sp when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi decreased to 0 04 and 0 11 respectively these trends elucidated that maize unable to recover normal growth in the sp under the degree of drought stress exceeded the resilience of maize however in the encp maize had resilience under dr1 and dr2 conditions after the drought started the ndvi shown an approximately trend of decrease increase when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi increased to 0 14 0 08 under dr1 and dr2 in the encp respectively meanwhile the δndvi increased to 0 14 under dr2 in the nncp likewise after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of decreased increase under dr1 dr2 and dr3 in the cncp and nap when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 05 0 3 and 0 19 under dr1 dr2 and dr3 in the cncp respectively and δndvi changed to 0 28 0 12 and 0 16 under dr1 dr2 and dr3 in the nap respectively it shed light on that maize had stronger resilience in the encp nncp cncp and nap region in the csh after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of decrease increase under dr1 when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 09 however after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of decrease increase decrease under dr2 and dr3 when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 03 and 0 25 respectively similarly in the gp after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of decrease increase under dr1 and dr3 when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 04 and 0 06 however after the drought started the δndvi shown an approximately trend of increase decrease increase under dr2 but when rsh returned to no drought the δndvi changed to 0 04 it shown that maize had resilience in the csh and gp region but it was weaker than that in the encp nncp cncp and nap region 3 3 analysis of relationship between maize resilience and relative soil humidity the β of each arx model was extracted details were shown in table 3 after excluding outliers β 1 extracting the β of each region and the corresponding rsh0 in each rsh then the relationship between resilience β and rsh0 was established the dark blue dotted curve shown in fig 6 an exponential function could be identified that was to say between β and rsh0 shown a more obvious exponential function relationship under drought stress which verified the reasonableness of the theoretical curve in fig 1b when rsh0 55 β approached 0 when rsh0 34 β would increase in fact if rsh0 34 maize was unable to recover normal growth in the study therefore when rsh0 34 β was same as that when rsh0 34 the mathematical relationship between β and rsh could be further established as follows 4 β 0 rsh 54 8 0068 exp 10 16 r 34 rsh 54 0 34 rsh 34 under drought conditions when rsh 54 the own growth ability of maize could resist the influence of drought at this time the resilience of maize was 0 when 34 rsh 54 the maize had resilience the growth ability of maize was equaled to the sum of its own growth ability and the resilience when rsh 34 the growth ability of maize was equaled to the sum of its own growth ability and the maximum resilience 4 discussion 4 1 drought and rehydration events unlike long term drought drought and rehydration events were the complete process of soil drought that was to say after a period of continuous drought the soil was replenished with water precipitation irrigation groundwater to restore it to no drought conditions in addition to accurately assess the impact of drought severity on maize growth the classification standard used here was the same one for drought we compared the characteristics of drought and rehydration events in some study areas with those described in others researches this study shown that the frequency of dr1 occurred in the sp region was the highest and no occurrence of dr3 this result was consistent with the analysis of drought and flood disasters in northwest jilin with higher frequency of light drought wang et al 2019 additionally no occurrence of dr3 might be explained by farmers planting habits during severe droughts farmers might use water or irrigation equipment to supply water thus the evaluation results of this study might be impacted and the nncp region had a similar reason moreover in nncp the duration of dr1 was relatively short so the dr1 event did not occur the dr3 frequency was the highest in the gp and cncp consistent with the previous research results those researches pointed out that the eastern and southern parts of shaanxi province were respectively maize high and sub highly vulnerable areas and the southern hebei eastern shijiazhuang western hengshui and northeastern xingtai were the aridest areas liqin et al 2020 wang et al 2020b the above comparisons could be illustrated that evaluating drought and rehydration events by relative soil humidity index was more accurate 4 2 resilience of typical maize planting areas by comparing and analyzing the changing trend of the ndvi under different degrees of drought and rehydration in each area we could identify the resilience mechanism of maize although maize had short term resilience in the sp it still could not resist the negative effects caused by drought stress so maize could not resume normal growth compared with other regions the resilience of maize in the sp region was the weakest this result was consistent with the increase of crop drought risk in northeast china song et al 2020 in the encp nncp cncp and nap region maize had the strongest resilience meanwhile in the gp and csh region maize had the second strongest resilience the trends of δndvi were consistent with the theoretical curve of fig 1a in this study in these trends of δndvi we also could see that the growth rate of maize under dr3 was higher than that under dr2 in the nap region however the growth rate of maize under dr3 was lower than that under dr2 in the cncp region the reasons might be related to the duration of drought thus this study further shown that under the same drought degree a certain drought duration may affect the resilience of maize in the csh region the trends of δndvi were the same under the dr1 and dr2 conditions but it was different from that under the dr3 condition the trends of δndvi were the same under the dr2 and dr3 conditions in the gp region but it was different from that under the dr1 condition the main reason was that maize with the same trend variations was in the same growth period in other words in the same growth period even if the degree of drought stress on maize was different the variation trend was the same this phenomenon may further illustrate that different growth periods may have the different resilience of maize in addition due to the limitation of existing data there may be certain errors in the calculation results but the overall trend is not affected 4 3 maize resilience and rsh this study quantified the resilience of maize and its relationship with relative soil humidity it aimed to determine the most suitable water saving irrigation time for maize under drought stress it would be to determine appropriate irrigation through the monitoring of relative soil humidity index rather than the actual growth status of maize when rsh 54 the drought degrees were light or no drought its own growth ability of maize could adapt growth under drought stress at this situation maize might not be irrigated when rsh was between 34 and 54 the resilience of maize gradually increased under drought conditions this was the best time for water saving irrigation when rsh 34 the degree of drought stress exceeded the resilience of maize and the plant would be destructively affected falling to recover normal growth therefore suitable irrigation is significant to agricultural water use efficiency under drought conditions the exponential relationship between β and rsh in this study r2 was relatively low the situation reveals that the growth of maize was not only affected by relative soil humidity but might be affected by other parameters in addition there was no dr3 situation in some areas in this study the main reason was that due to insufficient irrigation data the influence of irrigation water on the calculation of rsh could not be ruled out moreover due to data limitations this study did not carry out a detailed analysis of crops in different growth periods but it will not affect the overall trend of crop growth change therefore future research still needs to combine field experiments to refine further the calculation method of maize resilience and the setting of drought stress scenarios 5 conclusion this study enriched the theory and connotation of maize resilience and established the theoretical relationship between maize growth ability and relative soil humidity further taking seven typical maize suitable planting areas in the china as objects we identified the characteristics of drought and rehydration events and analyzed the resilience of maize in different regions the relationship between the resilience of maize and rsh was established the results showed that maize could not recover normal growth after rewatering under dr1 and dr2 in the sp maize had the weakest resilience in the csh maize could not recover normal growth after rewatering under dr2 and dr3 and maize could not recover normal growth after rewatering under dr2 in the gp it indicated that maize had the second strongest resilience maize could recover normal growth after rewatering under dr1 dr2 and dr3 in the nncp cncp encp and nap and had the strongest resilience under drought conditions when 34 rsh 54 maize had resilience which increased with the decreasing of rsh this period is the most suitable water saving irrigation period these results basically verified our theory hypothesis and could provide a basis for formulating agricultural water management strategies in the future it is still necessary to consider the duration of drought and the period of occurrence of drought to refine the calculation of the resilience of maize combine with the experimental field data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
