16630,tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps is an emerging brominated flame retardant bfr that can cause endocrinological abnormalities in aquatic species and is neurotoxic and cytotoxic to humans herein we investigated the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated peroxymonosulfate pms in aqueous solution results show that pms was capable of oxidizing tbbps without activation and the transformation of tbbps was ph dependent interestingly the unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps exhibited an autocatalytic behavior radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analyzes ruled out the involvement of hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radical so4 as reactive species while the generation of singlet oxygen 1o2 was confirmed in pms solution it was also not responsible for tbbps oxidation the bromine substituents are believed to be responsible for the autocatalysis observed during pms oxidation we propose that the initial oxidation of tbbps by pms resulted in the release of bromide ions br via debromination which could be rapidly oxidized to hypobromous acid hobr 3 5 dimethyl 1h pyrazole dmpz trapping coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis evidenced the formation of hobr in pms tbbps system therefore the presence of br albeit at trace level could significantly accelerate the oxidation of tbbps in pms solution via hobr formation the intermediate products of tbbps were identified by solid phase extraction spe coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms was likely initiated through a single electron transfer mechanism and the transformation pathways included β scission debromination and cross coupling reactions further oxidation and ring opening of the intermediates yielded three brominated disinfection byproducts br dbps including bromoform chbr3 mono and di bromoacetic acids mbaa and dbaa as quantified by gas chromatography gc the presence of natural organic matter nom inhibited the oxidation of tbbps and reduced the yields of br dbps our results indicate that unactivated pms was efficient in the abatement of tbbps in aqueous solution due to the accelerated oxidation by bromine catalysis however the formation of brominated intermediate products and br dbps should be scrutinized due to their potential carcinogenicity and mutagenicity graphic abstract

introduction tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps is an emerging brominated flame retardant bfr that has been increasingly used as a substitute for tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa due to its superior flame retardancy qu et al 2016 tbbps has been frequently added to commercial products including plastics electronic devices and textiles to reduce the rate of fire spread covaci et al 2011 the manufacturing storage and application of bfr containing materials can release tbbps leading to its occurrence and accumulation in the environment choi et al 2009 liu et al 2016 long term exposure to tbbps can cause hepatotoxicity and carcinogenic diseases in non target organisms yang et al 2020a this chemical may also cause endocrinological abnormalities in aquatic species and is known to be neurotoxic and cytotoxic to humans liang et al 2019 włuka et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to develop cost effective and environmentally friendly water treatment techniques to remove tbbps in aqueous solutions in the past two decades peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely applied for the remediation of environmental contamination due to their ability to generate reactive sulfate radicals so4 under activation by heat alkalis uv light transition metals and catalysts anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 furman et al 2010 guan et al 2011 ghanbari and moradi 2017 so4 with a redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v is capable of oxidizing many organic contaminants by means of electron transfer hydrogen extraction and addition elimination reactions with second order rate constants ranging from 106 to 1010 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 george et al 2001 while these aops have been implicated in the abatement of contaminants such technologies indeed possess some intrinsic drawbacks ghanbari and moradi 2017 for instance the scavenging of so4 by water constituents such as natural organic matter nom and inorganic ions e g halides and nitrite leads to decreased removal efficiency and formation of toxic derivatives such as halogenated and nitrated byproducts yang et al 2014 ji et al 2017 ma et al 2018 more recently studies have revealed that unactivated pms has the potential to directly oxidize some electron rich organic pollutants such as anilines and phenolic compounds zhou et al 2017 2018a yang et al 2018 ding et al 2021 in particular the unactivated pms oxidation process is less affected by naturally occurring constituents this is because unactivated pms oxidation is mainly driven by nonradical species such as pms and singlet oxygen 1o2 1δg the latter is derived from the decomposition of pms yang et al 2018 organic contaminants susceptible to unactivated pms oxidation include amino acids ruiz et al 2019 antibiotics such as sulfonamides ji et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 fluoroquinolones zhou et al 2018b 2021 β lactams chen et al 2018 and trimethoprim yang et al 2021a as well as some phenolic compounds li et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 since the involved reactive species are different the kinetics and mechanisms are quite distinct for activated and unactivated pms processes jiang et al 2018 observed that pms alone could directly oxidize the aniline moiety of sulfamethazine smz leading to the formation of a nitro derivative 4 nitro smz while activated pms process co2 pms oxidized smz predominantly through smiles type rearrangement and s n bond cleavage in general the unactivated pms process is more selective for oxidation of contaminants as compared to activated pms process however the former is particularly sensitive to some inorganic ions for instance when halides x are present in waters the quenching reactions between pms and x can produce reactive halogen species rhs such as hypohalous acids hox li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018a these secondary reactive species will affect the removal efficiencies and product distributions of target compounds li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018a wang et al 2018 reported that the presence of br greatly promoted the transformation of chlorophenols by unactivated pms resulting in the formation of a series of brominated chlorophenols with greater ecological risks as an oxidant pms has been implicated in a variety of water treatment practices including disinfecting pathogenic microorganisms in swimming pools bleaching lignin in papermaking wastewater etc springer and mcsweeny 1993 anipsitakis et al 2008 oxidation of halogenated phenolic compounds by pms has been proved to be technically feasible due to their electron rich properties and lower oxidation potentials li and hoffman 1999 wang et al 2018 for example chlorophenols including 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp could be efficiently oxidized by pms li et al 2019 tbbps and tbbpa are polybrominated phenolic compounds studies on the oxidation of tbbpa by hypochlorous acid hocl permanganate kmno4 and ferrate fe vi revealed the extensive debromination and formation of less brominated intermediate products pang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 han et al 2018 on the other hand the debromination during oxidative and photochemical transformation of bfrs would release bromide ion br as an inorganic product xu et al 2021 it is well known that pms is capable of oxidizing br leading to the formation of reactive bromine species rbs such as free bromine br2 or hypobromous acid hobr the rbs can react with phenols and nom through electrophilic substitution addition elimination or electron transfer reactions heeb et al 2014 criquet et al 2015 zhou et al 2018a reported that br could catalyze pms to oxidize 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 an endocrine disrupting chemical edc giving rise to brominated intermediates including 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 and 2 4 dibr ee2 we therefore speculate that when pms is applied for treating tbbps containing wastewaters the released br may be oxidized by the residual pms to form rbs which possibly accelerates the transformation of parent compound zhou et al 2018a wu et al 2020 however kinetic and mechanistic insights into the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms process are still lacking up to now which limits the design and optimization of the engineering treatment unit for the removal of tbbps our previous study demonstrated that co2 pms process could mediate the debromination of tbbpa and the resulting rbs were responsible for the generation of polybrominated intermediates such as 2 4 6 tribromophenol ji et al 2016 further oxidation of intermediate products by rbs e g hobr could result in ring opening and formation of brominated disinfection byproducts br dbps such as bromoform chbr3 and bromoacetic acids wang et al 2017 2018 therefore it is worthy for us to scrutinize the formation of br dbps during unactivated pms process considering their carcinogenicity mutagenicity and potential human health risks in the present study we investigated the transformation of tbbps in aqueous solution by unactivated pms particular attention was paid to the catalytic role of br derived from the debromination as well as the formation of intermediate products and br dbps the main objectives of this contribution are 1 to explore the kinetics of unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps and study the effects of solution ph 2 to identify the reactive species and elucidate its catalytic role in the accelerated transformation of tbbps 3 to identify the intermediate products of tbbps and propose the underlying mechanisms and transformation pathways and 4 to quantify the formation potential of br

acidic ph which was adjusted by 0 1 m h2so4 was adjusted with 10 mm phosphate buffer to desired values it should be noted that phosphate ions are inert toward direct pms oxidation ji et al 2018 to

experiments using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents were also performed to justify the involvement of radical species and 1o2

analytic parameters for the identification of 4 br dmpz are illustrated in text s6 si in addition trace level br 1 and 15 μm was added into the reaction solutions to confirm its catalytic role 2 6 quantification of br dbps to evaluate the formation potential of br dbps a series of 43 ml epa vials were spiked with reaction solutions containing 15 μm tbbps and 2 mm pms in the presence or absence

daphnia at 48 h the octanol water partition coefficients log k ow of target compounds were predicted by the quantitative structure activity relationships qsar based epi suite software 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics the oxidation of tbbps 15 μm by unactivated pms 2 mm was investigated under various ph conditions as can be seen from fig 1 a the concentrations of tbbps decreased over a time course of 2 5 h indicating that pms was capable of transforming tbbps no hydrolysis and adsorption of tbbps were observed data not shown meanwhile the decay of tbbps was appreciably accelerated with decreased solution ph since pms has two pk a values pk a1 0 pk a2 9 4 rastogi et al 2009 the monoanionic form hso5 dominated within the ph range investigated 4 9 on the other hand tbbps with pk a1 4 74 and pk a2 5 35 would gradually transfer from the dianionic form tbbps2 to the neutral form tbbps as the ph decreased xu et al 2021 due to the higher electron density the phenolate form is generally more reactive with pms than the undissociated phenol form li et al 2019 the enhanced degradation of tbbps observed at acidic ph implies that its transformation mechanism differed from other phenolic compounds see detailed discussion below interestingly the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms exhibited an autocatalytic characteristic with the degradation rate being gradually accelerated over a time period fig 1a moreover the autocatalytic performance was observed to be ph dependent as the promoting effect was more obvious under basic conditions autocatalytic reaction generally consists of an induction stage and an acceleration stage and reactive species accumulating in the first stage can subsequently promote the reaction in the second stage zhou et al 2017 2021 therefore certain reactive species was likely to be generated during the unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps which in turn promoted the transformation of parent compound in addition the transformation of tbbps did not follow the pseudo first order reaction kinetics due to the autocatalysis a spectrophotometric method was used to determine the consumption of pms during the oxidation of tbbps at ph 4 7 and 9 wacławek et al 2015 fig s1of si shows that under all tested conditions the consumption of pms was less than 15 after 2 5 h of reaction implying that pms was in excess for oxidizing tbbps the observed autocatalytic behavior of tbbps may be associated with its unique molecular structure featuring four bromine substituents a comparative experiment shows that unactivated pms oxidation of bps the nonbrominated analogue of tbbps followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics fig 1b in addition the transformation of bps increased with increasing ph consistent with other phenolic compounds zhou et al 2017 li et al 2019 this finding provides evidence that the unique autocatalytic oxidation of tbbps was indeed related to the bromine substituents extensive debromination was observed when tbbpa was treated by oxidants such as ferrate fe vi hypochlorous acid hocl and permanganate kmno4 pang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 han et al 2018 our recent study also showed that bromine substituents readily broke off during the photochemical decomposition of tbbps as evidenced by the detection of less brominated intermediates and br xu et al 2021 on the basis of these demonstrations we preliminarily speculate that some bromine substituents would be detached from tbbps molecule as well during pms oxidation due to its relatively higher redox potential 1 82 v pms is capable of oxidizing br to form hobr 1 338 v with a second order rate constant of 0 7 m 1s 1 lente et al 2009 the resulting hobr is a potent electrophilic species that can react with phenols via addition elimination electrophilic substitution or electron transfer reaction heeb et al 2014 criquet et al 2015 therefore the observed autocatalytic behavior of tbbps is likely a result of debromination followed by formation of hobr via pms oxidation of br further supports in favor of the formation of hobr as a critical reactive species are provided by additional experiments as detailed in following sections 3 2 reactive species 3 2 1 ho and so4 quenching experiments were firstly conducted to explore the reactive species involved in the unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps herein etoh and tba were used as scavengers to verify the involvement of ho and so4 etoh reacts with ho and so4 at second order rate constants of 1 2 2 8 109 and 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 respectively while tba reacts with ho and so4 at second order rate constants of 3 8 7 6 108 and 4 9 1 105 m 1s 1 respectively neta et al 1988 fig 2 a clearly shows that the addition of excessive etoh 20 mm and tba 10 mm did not affect the degradation of tbbps arguing against ho and so4 as reactive species the lack of involvement of ho and so4 is further supported by epr analysis using dmpo as a trapping agent fig 2b the above results imply that the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms proceeded through a nonradical pathway 3 2 2 singlet oxygen the spontaneous decomposition of pms in aqueous solution can lead to the formation of 1o2 ball and edwards 1956 our attempt to identify 1o2 was implemented by quenching experiments with excessive ffa 10 mm as a scavenger 1 2 108 m 1s 1 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 yang et al 2018 fig 2a suggests that the degradation of tbbps was inhibited in the presence of ffa and the inhibition was intensified with increasing concentration of ffa moreover epr analysis using temp as a trapping agent clearly shows three lines with equal intensity which is the characteristic signal of temp 1o2 adduct fig 2c yang et al 2021a overall the results of quenching and epr experiments suggest that 1o2 was actually generated in the pms system to further determine whether 1o2 can mediate the oxidation of tbbps we monitored the decay of tbbps in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 and 1 mm na2moo4 it is well known that moo4 2 catalyzes h2o2 to generate 1o2 under ambient temperature boehme and brauer 1992 interestingly no changes in tbbps concentration were observed in the h2o2 na2moo4 system data not shown the inertness between tbbps and 1o2 is consistent with our photochemical study in which the presence of deuterium oxide d2o did not promote the degradation of tbbps xu et al 2021 these results suggest that the decomposition of pms indeed produced 1o2 however it was not responsible for the transformation of tbbps 3 2 3 role of hobr according to the kinetic results vide supra and literature reports zhou et al 2018a wu et al 2020 we reasonably speculate that the br generated by debromination might be involved in the autocatalysis of tbbps to further elucidate the catalytic role of bromine trace level br 1 and 15 μm were intentionally added into the reaction solutions it was found that approximately 77 and 81 of tbbps were degraded in the presence of 1 and 15 μm br respectively while only 35 of tbbps was removed in the absence of br fig s2 si this result confirms the important role of br in the autocatalysis of tbbps rbs includes bromine radicals e g br br2 broh etc and free bromine e g hobr the bromine radicals can be generated by radical chain reactions involving br and reactive radicals such as ho and so4 von gunten and oliveras 1998 yang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 lu et al 2015 since ho and so4 were not present in the unactivated pms system vide supra the contributions of bromine radicals to the transformation of tbbps can be safely ruled out r1 to confirm whether the autocatalysis resulted from the formation of hobr we adopted a novel analytic method using dmpz trapping followed by lc ms analysis méndez díaz et al 2014 hobr can be efficiently captured by dmpz 2 7 105 m 1 s 1 giving rise to 4 br dmpz as the sole product reaction 1 méndez díaz et al 2014 lu et al 2019 note that dmpz reacts with halogen radicals by one electron oxidation rather than 4 halogenation therefore this analytic method is highly selective and sensitive detection limit can be as low as several pm for probing nonradical rhs production for example this method has been successfully applied for detection of trace level hobr photochemically produced in seawaters méndez díaz et al 2014 it should be emphasized that while the n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine dpd spectrophotometric method has been widely used for quantification of hobr liu et al 2015 lu et al 2015 such approach appeared to be unsuitable in this work due to the strong interference from the residual pms experiments were carried out with 50 ml aqueous solution ph 7 containing 15 μm tbbps 2 mm pms and 50 μm dmpz the solution was concentrated by spe after 2 5 h of reaction and the concentrate was analyzed by lc ms a product was clearly observed on the chromatogram with a retention time of 8 0 min which was consistent with the authentic standard of 4 br dmpz data not shown the mass to charge ratio m z of this product was 172 9 174 9 m h with an isotope abundance ratio of 1 1 thus confirming the assignment of 4 br dmpz fig s3 si méndez díaz et al 2014 therefore the dmpz trapping coupled with lc ms analysis unequivocally confirms the generation of hobr during unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps unfortunately our ion chromatography ic failed to detect any br during the oxidation of tbbps data not shown probably due to its quick conversion in the presence of excess pms because the concentration of hobr was comparatively low further quantification was not carried out nevertheless trace level hobr is capable of oxidizing tbbps efficiently as evidenced by our additional experiments amened with 1 and 15 μm br vide supra so far we have known that unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps can be autocatalytically accelerated due to the in situ formation of hobr in addition the higher reactivity of hobr pk a 9 4 relative to its dissociated form obr means that the autocatalysis of tbbps should be more remarkable under acidic conditions which is coincided with our experimental results vide supra 3 3 intermediate products to identify the intermediate products the tbbps solution oxidized by pms was enriched by spe using hlb cartridges and then analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms fig 3 shows the total ion chromatogram tic for an spe concentrated degradation sample as seen several intermediate products labeled as p1 to p10 were generated during the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms bromine has two isotopes 79br and 81br with a natural abundance ratio of 50 69 and 49 31 respectively brand et al 2014 the isotope abundance of bromo compounds follows a distribution law stipulated by the expansion of binomial a b n where a and b represent the natural abundance ratio of 79br and 81br respectively and n represents the number of bromine atoms present in the molecule thus the isotope distribution patterns can be used as diagnostic fingerprints for the identification of bromine containing compounds in mass spectrum ji et al 2016 xu et al 2021 for example tbbps contains four bromine atomsfeaturing a molecular ion cluster of m z 560 66 562 66 564 66 566 66 568 66 in mass spectrum with an isotope abundance ratio of 1 4 6 4 1 overall ten brominated intermediates were temporarily identified by means of their isotope distribution patterns and m z of molecular ions m h table s1 of si displays the retention times m z of molecular ions isotope distribution patterns and the proposed molecular structures of the intermediate products briefly p1 having m z 328 81 330 81 332 81 with an isotope abundance ratio of 1 2 1 is proposed to be the c s bond cleaving product 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid p2 that has m z 344 81 346 81 348 80 with an isotope abundance ratio of 1 2 1 is assigned as the hydroxylated product of p1 since its mass is 16 da higher than that of p1 p3 m z 264 85 266 85 268 85 1 2 1 is supposed to be 2 6 dibromohydroquinone p4 with m z 810 56 812 56 814 56 816 55 818 55 820 55 1 5 10 10 5 1 is proposed to be a coupling product m p1 br p5 m z 576 66 578 66 580 66 582 65 584 65 1 4 6 4 1 is proposed as a coupling product of p1 with 2 6 dibromophenol a similar product has previously been identified in the oxidation of tbbpa by kmno4 and hocl pang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 p6 m z 482 75 484 75 486 75 488 75 1 3 3 1 and p8 404 84 406 84 408 84 1 2 1 are suggested to be tri and dibromobisphenol s respectively particularly two different peaks appeared in the extraction ion chromatogram of p8 indicating the presence of isomers p7 m z 326 77 328 76 330 76 332 76 1 3 3 1 is unequivocally identified as 2 4 6 tribromophenol as compared with an authentic standard cas 118 79 6 the relatively large molecular ion clusters of p9 and p10 corroborate the fact that both of them contain 6 br and have longer retention times p9 962 49 964 49 966 49 968 48 970 48 972 48 974 48 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 appears to be a dioxin like derivative possibly formed through self cross coupling reaction as previously reported in the photochemical transformation of triclosan erickson et al 2012 p10 m z 808 51 810 51 812 51 814 51 816 51 818 51 820 51 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 is proposed as a coupling product of tbbps with 2 6 dibromophenol detailed mass spectra of all intermediate products can be found in fig s4 of si 3 4 underlying mechanisms and transformation pathways based on the identified intermediate products and the reactivities of pms and hobr possible pathways for unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps are proposed fig 4 as can be seen the transformation pathways involve β scission debromination and cross coupling reactions we propose that the initial reaction between pms and tbbps was triggered by single electron transfer leading to the formation of a phenyl radical cation r1 further transformation of r1 via different pathways could result in the formation of various intermediate products for example r1 underwent β scission to generate 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzenesulfon cation r2 and 2 6 dibromophenol radical r3 r2 was likely subjected to hydrolysis to form p1 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid further oxidation of p1 by pms could generate a hydroxylated product p2 on the other hand the electrophilic attack of r2 on p3 molecule could give rise to p5 another intermediate r3 generated by β scission of r1 could further generate intermediate r4 2 6 dibromophenol through hydrogen abstraction reaction the further oxidation of r4 by pms or hobr could lead to the formation of p3 2 6 dibromohydroquinone and p7 2 4 6 tribromophenol respectively it should be noted that the bromine in the para position of p7 must be originated from tbbps per se which implies that debromination and rebromination reactions occurred during the oxidation of tbbps ji et al 2017 on the other hand the phenyl radical cation r1 could rapidly deprotonate and lead to the formation of long lived phenoxyl radical r5 which could resonate to form a stable carbon centered radical r6 subsequently the combination between different radicals could generate various products for example the radical coupling between r5 and r3 could form p10 in addition the cleavage of the c br bond of r6 formed p6 tribromobisphenol s which underwent further debromination to obtain p8 dibromobisphenol s furthermore r6 could also couple with p1 or its own to form coupling products p4 and p9 respectively 3 5 ecotoxicity of intermediate products the acute toxicity of tbbps and its intermediate products generated by unactivated pms oxidation was assessed by ecosar program which has been widely applied to predict the ecotoxicity of contaminants in water treatments yang et al 2021b as shown in table 1 all the compounds fall into four toxicity categories e g not harmful harmful toxic and very toxic compared with tbbps the intermediate products p1 p2 p3 p6 p7 and p8 have increased polarity and reduced toxicity while the cross coupling products p4 p5 p9 and p10 have reduced polarity and increased toxicity the high toxicity of coupling products highlights the need to monitor their formation during unactivated pms oxidation process and to evaluate their potential environmental risks 3 6 effects of nom 3 6 1 tbbps oxidation in the presence of nom naturally occurring species such as nom may have pronounced impacts on the removal of contaminants by unactivated pms ji et al 2018 fig s5 of si clearly shows that the presence of srnom as a representative of aquatic nom inhibited the degradation of tbbps and the inhibitory effect was exacerbated with increasing concentration of srnom nom is a complex mixture of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon structures attached with various functional groups leenheer and croué 2003 it is well known that electron rich moieties of nom such as phenolic groups are capable of consuming pms and hobr efficiently westerhoff et al 2004 fig s5 also shows that the autocatalytic effect was more explicit at low concentration of srnom 1 mg l 1 this can be rationalized by the fact that only a small amount of hobr was generated in the tbbps pms system and hobr could be largely consumed by srnom at high concentrations 3 6 2 br dbps formation in the absence and presence of nom further oxidation and ring opening of the brominated intermediates could generate low molecule weight br dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and bromoacetic acids haas wang et al 2014 epidemiological studies have shown that the risks of bladder and rectal cancer were closely associated with thms levels and haas were teratogenic in mice embryos and rats richardson et al 2007 in addition dbps may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight and spontaneous abortion richardson et al 2007 therefore due to their potential cytotoxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity these dbps are stringently regulated in the water treatment processes richardson 2003 moreover nom is an important precursor of dbps during chlorine disinfection heeb et al 2014 wang et al 2014 we therefore attempted to evaluate the formation potential of br dbps during the oxidation of tbbps by pms in the presence and absence of srnom a total of three br dbps including bromoform chbr3 monobromoacetic acid mbaa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa were detected by gc analysis these br dbps can be regarded as the deep oxidation products of tbbps thus their formation is expected to be slower than the degradation of tbbps this is evidenced by fig 5 a showing that br dbps were not identified in the initial 8 h after that the yields of br dbps increased gradually over time as seen the formation potential of br dbps followed an order of chbr3 dbaa mbaa suggesting that thms were preferentially generated during the oxidation process the higher yield of chbr3 is consistent with previous studies on the bromination of other phenolic compounds including phenol resorcinol and salicylic acid boyce and hornig 1983 wang et al 2014 the mechanisms of br dbps formation have been reported in some previous studies wang et al 2014 we propose that further oxidation of the tbbps intermediate products by either pms or hobr would result in ring cleaving generating various aliphatic acids containing oxygen groups such as c o and cooh yang et al 2020b these aliphatic acids in particular α or β keto acids favor rapid halogenation with hox due to the presence of enolizable methylene groups deborde and von gunten 2008 further hydrolysis decarboxylation followed with oxidation will give rise to chbr3 dbaa and mbaa wang et al 2014 interestingly the concentrations of br dbps generated in the presence of srnom were comparatively lower fig 5b d in addition the yields of br dbps were decreased with increasing concentration of srnom most notably no chbr3 was detected within 48 h in the presence of 5 and 10 mg l 1 srnom the consumption of pms by srnom likely inhibited the debromination of tbbps which in turn suppressed the formation of hobr on the other hand electron rich moieties of srnom such as phenolic groups could efficiently quench hobr especially when the concentrations of srnom are high criquet et al 2015 these results taken together could inhibit the deep oxidation of tbbps intermediates thus reducing the formation of keto acids which consequently decreased the yields of br dbps it is noteworthy that although nom is an important precursor of dbps during halogenation hobr at low concentrations prefers to ring incorporation to produce brominated intermediates rather than ring opening to form br dbps westerhoff et al 2004 criquet et al 2015 therefore the yields of br dbps decreased as the concentration of srnom increased 4 conclusions and implications for water treatment the results of this study can be summarized as follows i unactivated pms could efficiently mediate the transformation of tbbps the oxidation of tbbps exhibited an autocatalytic performance and was accelerated with decreasing ph the presence of srnom inhibited the transformation of tbbps and the inhibitory effects were intensified with increasing srnom concentration ii ho so4 and 1o2 were not involved in the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms instead hobr was identified as the critical reactive species responsible for the autocatalytic oxidation of tbbps iii br detached from tbbps molecule can be rapidly oxidized by the residual pms leading to the formation of hobr trace level hobr significantly accelerated the oxidation of tbbps iv the transformation of tbbps by unactivated pms was proposed to be initiated by single electron transfer followed by β scission debromination and cross coupling reactions leading to the formation of a series of intermediate products v three br dbps including chbr3 dbaa and mbaa were detected within 48 h of reaction the presence of srnom reduced the yields of br dbps and the yields decreased with increasing concentration of srnom our results also have implications for water and wastewater treatment using pms as an oxidant for example the autocatalytic behavior of hobr formed in situ can greatly accelerate the transformation of brominated organic contaminants e g bfrs by pms oxidation however the potential formation of br dbps should be scrutinized due to their carcinogenicity

16630,tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps is an emerging brominated flame retardant bfr that can cause endocrinological abnormalities in aquatic species and is neurotoxic and cytotoxic to humans herein we investigated the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated peroxymonosulfate pms in aqueous solution results show that pms was capable of oxidizing tbbps without activation and the transformation of tbbps was ph dependent interestingly the unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps exhibited an autocatalytic behavior radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analyzes ruled out the involvement of hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radical so4 as reactive species while the generation of singlet oxygen 1o2 was confirmed in pms solution it was also not responsible for tbbps oxidation the bromine substituents are believed to be responsible for the autocatalysis observed during pms oxidation we propose that the initial oxidation of tbbps by pms resulted in the release of bromide ions br via debromination which could be rapidly oxidized to hypobromous acid hobr 3 5 dimethyl 1h pyrazole dmpz trapping coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis evidenced the formation of hobr in pms tbbps system therefore the presence of br albeit at trace level could significantly accelerate the oxidation of tbbps in pms solution via hobr formation the intermediate products of tbbps were identified by solid phase extraction spe coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms was likely initiated through a single electron transfer mechanism and the transformation pathways included β scission debromination and cross coupling reactions further oxidation and ring opening of the intermediates yielded three brominated disinfection byproducts br dbps including bromoform chbr3 mono and di bromoacetic acids mbaa and dbaa as quantified by gas chromatography gc the presence of natural organic matter nom inhibited the oxidation of tbbps and reduced the yields of br dbps our results indicate that unactivated pms was efficient in the abatement of tbbps in aqueous solution due to the accelerated oxidation by bromine catalysis however the formation of brominated intermediate products and br dbps should be scrutinized due to their potential carcinogenicity and mutagenicity graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords autocatalysis brominated disinfection byproducts brominated flame retardants hypobromous acid tetrabromobisphenol s unactivated peroxymonosulfate oxidation 1 introduction tetrabromobisphenol s tbbps is an emerging brominated flame retardant bfr that has been increasingly used as a substitute for tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa due to its superior flame retardancy qu et al 2016 tbbps has been frequently added to commercial products including plastics electronic devices and textiles to reduce the rate of fire spread covaci et al 2011 the manufacturing storage and application of bfr containing materials can release tbbps leading to its occurrence and accumulation in the environment choi et al 2009 liu et al 2016 long term exposure to tbbps can cause hepatotoxicity and carcinogenic diseases in non target organisms yang et al 2020a this chemical may also cause endocrinological abnormalities in aquatic species and is known to be neurotoxic and cytotoxic to humans liang et al 2019 włuka et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to develop cost effective and environmentally friendly water treatment techniques to remove tbbps in aqueous solutions in the past two decades peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely applied for the remediation of environmental contamination due to their ability to generate reactive sulfate radicals so4 under activation by heat alkalis uv light transition metals and catalysts anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 furman et al 2010 guan et al 2011 ghanbari and moradi 2017 so4 with a redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v is capable of oxidizing many organic contaminants by means of electron transfer hydrogen extraction and addition elimination reactions with second order rate constants ranging from 106 to 1010 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 george et al 2001 while these aops have been implicated in the abatement of contaminants such technologies indeed possess some intrinsic drawbacks ghanbari and moradi 2017 for instance the scavenging of so4 by water constituents such as natural organic matter nom and inorganic ions e g halides and nitrite leads to decreased removal efficiency and formation of toxic derivatives such as halogenated and nitrated byproducts yang et al 2014 ji et al 2017 ma et al 2018 more recently studies have revealed that unactivated pms has the potential to directly oxidize some electron rich organic pollutants such as anilines and phenolic compounds zhou et al 2017 2018a yang et al 2018 ding et al 2021 in particular the unactivated pms oxidation process is less affected by naturally occurring constituents this is because unactivated pms oxidation is mainly driven by nonradical species such as pms and singlet oxygen 1o2 1δg the latter is derived from the decomposition of pms yang et al 2018 organic contaminants susceptible to unactivated pms oxidation include amino acids ruiz et al 2019 antibiotics such as sulfonamides ji et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 fluoroquinolones zhou et al 2018b 2021 β lactams chen et al 2018 and trimethoprim yang et al 2021a as well as some phenolic compounds li et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 since the involved reactive species are different the kinetics and mechanisms are quite distinct for activated and unactivated pms processes jiang et al 2018 observed that pms alone could directly oxidize the aniline moiety of sulfamethazine smz leading to the formation of a nitro derivative 4 nitro smz while activated pms process co2 pms oxidized smz predominantly through smiles type rearrangement and s n bond cleavage in general the unactivated pms process is more selective for oxidation of contaminants as compared to activated pms process however the former is particularly sensitive to some inorganic ions for instance when halides x are present in waters the quenching reactions between pms and x can produce reactive halogen species rhs such as hypohalous acids hox li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018a these secondary reactive species will affect the removal efficiencies and product distributions of target compounds li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018a wang et al 2018 reported that the presence of br greatly promoted the transformation of chlorophenols by unactivated pms resulting in the formation of a series of brominated chlorophenols with greater ecological risks as an oxidant pms has been implicated in a variety of water treatment practices including disinfecting pathogenic microorganisms in swimming pools bleaching lignin in papermaking wastewater etc springer and mcsweeny 1993 anipsitakis et al 2008 oxidation of halogenated phenolic compounds by pms has been proved to be technically feasible due to their electron rich properties and lower oxidation potentials li and hoffman 1999 wang et al 2018 for example chlorophenols including 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp could be efficiently oxidized by pms li et al 2019 tbbps and tbbpa are polybrominated phenolic compounds studies on the oxidation of tbbpa by hypochlorous acid hocl permanganate kmno4 and ferrate fe vi revealed the extensive debromination and formation of less brominated intermediate products pang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 han et al 2018 on the other hand the debromination during oxidative and photochemical transformation of bfrs would release bromide ion br as an inorganic product xu et al 2021 it is well known that pms is capable of oxidizing br leading to the formation of reactive bromine species rbs such as free bromine br2 or hypobromous acid hobr the rbs can react with phenols and nom through electrophilic substitution addition elimination or electron transfer reactions heeb et al 2014 criquet et al 2015 zhou et al 2018a reported that br could catalyze pms to oxidize 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 an endocrine disrupting chemical edc giving rise to brominated intermediates including 2 br ee2 4 br ee2 and 2 4 dibr ee2 we therefore speculate that when pms is applied for treating tbbps containing wastewaters the released br may be oxidized by the residual pms to form rbs which possibly accelerates the transformation of parent compound zhou et al 2018a wu et al 2020 however kinetic and mechanistic insights into the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms process are still lacking up to now which limits the design and optimization of the engineering treatment unit for the removal of tbbps our previous study demonstrated that co2 pms process could mediate the debromination of tbbpa and the resulting rbs were responsible for the generation of polybrominated intermediates such as 2 4 6 tribromophenol ji et al 2016 further oxidation of intermediate products by rbs e g hobr could result in ring opening and formation of brominated disinfection byproducts br dbps such as bromoform chbr3 and bromoacetic acids wang et al 2017 2018 therefore it is worthy for us to scrutinize the formation of br dbps during unactivated pms process considering their carcinogenicity mutagenicity and potential human health risks in the present study we investigated the transformation of tbbps in aqueous solution by unactivated pms particular attention was paid to the catalytic role of br derived from the debromination as well as the formation of intermediate products and br dbps the main objectives of this contribution are 1 to explore the kinetics of unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps and study the effects of solution ph 2 to identify the reactive species and elucidate its catalytic role in the accelerated transformation of tbbps 3 to identify the intermediate products of tbbps and propose the underlying mechanisms and transformation pathways and 4 to quantify the formation potential of br

acidic ph which was adjusted by 0 1 m h2so4 was adjusted with 10 mm phosphate buffer to desired values it should be noted that phosphate ions are inert toward direct pms oxidation ji et al 2018 to explore the effects of nom different concentrations of srnom 1 to 15 mg l 1 were added into reaction solutions an appropriate amount of pms e g 2 mm was spiked into tbbps solutions to initiate the

experiments using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents were also performed to justify the involvement of radical species and 1o2

analytic parameters for the identification of 4 br dmpz are illustrated in text s6 si in addition trace level br 1 and 15 μm was added into the reaction solutions to confirm its catalytic role 2 6 quantification of br dbps to evaluate the formation potential of br dbps a series of 43 ml epa vials were spiked with reaction solutions containing 15 μm tbbps and 2 mm pms in the presence or absence of srnom 1 to 15 mg l 1 the vials were headspace free during 48 h reaction period at every 8 h intervals a vial was withdrawn quenched with excess na2s2o3 20 mm and kept in a 4 c refrigerator until further treatment br dbps were quantified according to the usepa standard methods 551 1 and 552 2 respectively thms were enriched with liquid extraction using mtbe as the solvent and then analyzed by

were assessed using the ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar class program v 1 11 program acute toxicity was evaluated using half lethal concentration lc50 for fish at 96 h and daphnia at 48 h the octanol water partition coefficients log k ow of target compounds were predicted by the quantitative structure activity relationships qsar based epi suite software 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics the oxidation of tbbps 15 μm by unactivated pms 2 mm was investigated under various ph conditions as can be seen from fig 1 a the concentrations of tbbps decreased over a time course of 2 5 h indicating that pms was capable of transforming tbbps no hydrolysis and adsorption of tbbps were observed data not shown meanwhile the decay of tbbps was appreciably accelerated with decreased solution ph since pms has two pk a values pk a1 0 pk a2 9 4 rastogi et al 2009 the monoanionic form hso5 dominated within the ph range investigated 4 9 on the other hand tbbps with pk a1 4 74 and pk a2 5 35 would gradually transfer from the dianionic form tbbps2 to the neutral form tbbps as the ph decreased xu et al 2021 due to the higher electron density the phenolate form is generally more reactive with pms than the undissociated phenol form li et al 2019 the enhanced degradation of tbbps observed at acidic ph implies that its transformation mechanism differed from other phenolic compounds see detailed discussion below interestingly the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms exhibited an autocatalytic characteristic with the degradation rate being gradually accelerated over a time period fig 1a moreover the autocatalytic performance was observed to be ph dependent as the promoting effect was more obvious under basic conditions autocatalytic reaction generally consists of an induction stage and an acceleration stage and reactive species accumulating in the first stage can subsequently promote the reaction in the second stage zhou et al 2017 2021 therefore certain reactive species was likely to be generated during the unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps which in turn promoted the transformation of parent compound in addition the transformation of tbbps did not follow the pseudo first order reaction kinetics due to the autocatalysis a spectrophotometric method was used to determine the consumption of pms during the oxidation of tbbps at ph 4 7 and 9 wacławek et al 2015 fig s1of si shows that under all tested conditions the consumption of pms was less than 15 after 2 5 h of reaction implying that pms was in excess for oxidizing tbbps the observed autocatalytic behavior of tbbps may be associated with its unique molecular structure featuring four bromine substituents a comparative experiment shows that unactivated pms oxidation of bps the nonbrominated analogue of tbbps followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics fig 1b in addition the transformation of bps increased with increasing ph consistent with other phenolic compounds zhou et al 2017 li et al 2019 this finding provides evidence that the unique autocatalytic oxidation of tbbps was indeed related to the bromine substituents extensive debromination was observed when tbbpa was treated by oxidants such as ferrate fe vi hypochlorous acid hocl and permanganate kmno4 pang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 han et al 2018 our recent study also showed that bromine substituents readily broke off during the photochemical decomposition of tbbps as evidenced by the detection of less brominated intermediates and br xu et al 2021 on the basis of these demonstrations we preliminarily speculate that some bromine substituents would be detached from tbbps molecule as well during pms oxidation due to its relatively higher redox potential 1 82 v pms is capable of oxidizing br to form hobr 1 338 v with a second order rate constant of 0 7 m 1s 1 lente et al 2009 the resulting hobr is a potent electrophilic species that can react with phenols via addition elimination electrophilic substitution or electron transfer reaction heeb et al 2014 criquet et al 2015 therefore the observed autocatalytic behavior of tbbps is likely a result of debromination followed by formation of hobr via pms oxidation of br further supports in favor of the formation of hobr as a critical reactive species are provided by additional experiments as detailed in following sections 3 2 reactive species 3 2 1 ho and so4 quenching experiments were firstly conducted to explore the reactive species involved in the unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps herein etoh and tba were used as scavengers to verify the involvement of ho and so4 etoh reacts with ho and so4 at second order rate constants of 1 2 2 8 109 and 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 respectively while tba reacts with ho and so4 at second order rate constants of 3 8 7 6 108 and 4 9 1 105 m 1s 1 respectively neta et al 1988 fig 2 a clearly shows that the addition of excessive etoh 20 mm and tba 10 mm did not affect the degradation of tbbps arguing against ho and so4 as reactive species the lack of involvement of ho and so4 is further supported by epr analysis using dmpo as a trapping agent fig 2b the above results imply that the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms proceeded through a nonradical pathway 3 2 2 singlet oxygen the spontaneous decomposition of pms in aqueous solution can lead to the formation of 1o2 ball and edwards 1956 our attempt to identify 1o2 was implemented by quenching experiments with excessive ffa 10 mm as a scavenger 1 2 108 m 1s 1 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 yang et al 2018 fig 2a suggests that the degradation of tbbps was inhibited in the presence of ffa and the inhibition was intensified with increasing concentration of ffa moreover epr analysis using temp as a trapping agent clearly shows three lines with equal intensity which is the characteristic signal of temp 1o2 adduct fig 2c yang et al 2021a overall the results of quenching and epr experiments suggest that 1o2 was actually generated in the pms system to further determine whether 1o2 can mediate the oxidation of tbbps we monitored the decay of tbbps in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 and 1 mm na2moo4 it is well known that moo4 2 catalyzes h2o2 to generate 1o2 under ambient temperature boehme and brauer 1992 interestingly no changes in tbbps concentration were observed in the h2o2 na2moo4 system data not shown the inertness between tbbps and 1o2 is consistent with our photochemical study in which the presence of deuterium oxide d2o did not promote the degradation of tbbps xu et al 2021 these results suggest that the decomposition of pms indeed produced 1o2 however it was not responsible for the transformation of tbbps 3 2 3 role of hobr according to the kinetic results vide supra and literature reports zhou et al 2018a wu et al 2020 we reasonably speculate that the br generated by debromination might be involved in the autocatalysis of tbbps to further elucidate the catalytic role of bromine trace level br 1 and 15 μm were intentionally added into the reaction solutions it was found that approximately 77 and 81 of tbbps were degraded in the presence of 1 and 15 μm br respectively while only 35 of tbbps was removed in the absence of br fig s2 si this result confirms the important role of br in the autocatalysis of tbbps rbs includes bromine radicals e g br br2 broh etc and free bromine e g hobr the bromine radicals can be generated by radical chain reactions involving br and reactive radicals such as ho and so4 von gunten and oliveras 1998 yang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 lu et al 2015 since ho and so4 were not present in the unactivated pms system vide supra the contributions of bromine radicals to the transformation of tbbps can be safely ruled out r1 to confirm whether the autocatalysis resulted from the formation of hobr we adopted a novel analytic method using dmpz trapping followed by lc ms analysis méndez díaz et al 2014 hobr can be efficiently captured by dmpz 2 7 105 m 1 s 1 giving rise to 4 br dmpz as the sole product reaction 1 méndez díaz et al 2014 lu et al 2019 note that dmpz reacts with halogen radicals by one electron oxidation rather than 4 halogenation therefore this analytic method is highly selective and sensitive detection limit can be as low as several pm for probing nonradical rhs production for example this method has been successfully applied for detection of trace level hobr photochemically produced in seawaters méndez díaz et al 2014 it should be emphasized that while the n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine dpd spectrophotometric method has been widely used for quantification of hobr liu et al 2015 lu et al 2015 such approach appeared to be unsuitable in this work due to the strong interference from the residual pms experiments were carried out with 50 ml aqueous solution ph 7 containing 15 μm tbbps 2 mm pms and 50 μm dmpz the solution was concentrated by spe after 2 5 h of reaction and the concentrate was analyzed by lc ms a product was clearly observed on the chromatogram with a retention time of 8 0 min which was consistent with the authentic standard of 4 br dmpz data not shown the mass to charge ratio m z of this product was 172 9 174 9 m h with an isotope abundance ratio of 1 1 thus confirming the assignment of 4 br dmpz fig s3 si méndez díaz et al 2014 therefore the dmpz trapping coupled with lc ms analysis unequivocally confirms the generation of hobr during unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps unfortunately our ion chromatography ic failed to detect any br during the oxidation of tbbps data not shown probably due to its quick conversion in the presence of excess pms because the concentration of hobr was comparatively low further quantification was not carried out nevertheless trace level hobr is capable of oxidizing tbbps efficiently as evidenced by our additional experiments amened with 1 and 15 μm br vide supra so far we have known that unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps can be autocatalytically accelerated due to the in situ formation of hobr in addition the higher reactivity of hobr pk a 9 4 relative to its dissociated form obr means that the autocatalysis of tbbps should be more remarkable under acidic conditions which is coincided with our experimental results vide supra 3 3 intermediate products to identify the intermediate products the tbbps solution oxidized by pms was enriched by spe using hlb cartridges and then analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms fig 3 shows the total ion chromatogram tic for an spe concentrated degradation sample as seen several intermediate products labeled as p1 to p10 were generated during the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms bromine has two isotopes 79br and 81br with a natural abundance ratio of 50 69 and 49 31 respectively brand et al 2014 the isotope abundance of bromo compounds follows a distribution law stipulated by the expansion of binomial a b n where a and b represent the natural abundance ratio of 79br and 81br respectively and n represents the number of bromine atoms present in the molecule thus the isotope distribution patterns can be used as diagnostic fingerprints for the identification of bromine containing compounds in mass spectrum ji et al 2016 xu et al 2021 for example tbbps contains four bromine atomsfeaturing a molecular ion cluster of m z 560 66 562 66 564 66 566 66 568 66 in mass spectrum with an isotope abundance ratio of 1 4 6 4 1 overall ten brominated intermediates were temporarily identified by means of their isotope distribution patterns and m z of molecular ions m h table s1 of si displays the retention times m z of molecular ions isotope distribution patterns and the proposed molecular structures of the intermediate products briefly p1 having m z 328 81 330 81 332 81 with an isotope abundance ratio of 1 2 1 is proposed to be the c s bond cleaving product 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid p2 that has m z 344 81 346 81 348 80 with an isotope abundance ratio of 1 2 1 is assigned as the hydroxylated product of p1 since its mass is 16 da higher than that of p1 p3 m z 264 85 266 85 268 85 1 2 1 is supposed to be 2 6 dibromohydroquinone p4 with m z 810 56 812 56 814 56 816 55 818 55 820 55 1 5 10 10 5 1 is proposed to be a coupling product m p1 br p5 m z 576 66 578 66 580 66 582 65 584 65 1 4 6 4 1 is proposed as a coupling product of p1 with 2 6 dibromophenol a similar product has previously been identified in the oxidation of tbbpa by kmno4 and hocl pang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 p6 m z 482 75 484 75 486 75 488 75 1 3 3 1 and p8 404 84 406 84 408 84 1 2 1 are suggested to be tri and dibromobisphenol s respectively particularly two different peaks appeared in the extraction ion chromatogram of p8 indicating the presence of isomers p7 m z 326 77 328 76 330 76 332 76 1 3 3 1 is unequivocally identified as 2 4 6 tribromophenol as compared with an authentic standard cas 118 79 6 the relatively large molecular ion clusters of p9 and p10 corroborate the fact that both of them contain 6 br and have longer retention times p9 962 49 964 49 966 49 968 48 970 48 972 48 974 48 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 appears to be a dioxin like derivative possibly formed through self cross coupling reaction as previously reported in the photochemical transformation of triclosan erickson et al 2012 p10 m z 808 51 810 51 812 51 814 51 816 51 818 51 820 51 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 is proposed as a coupling product of tbbps with 2 6 dibromophenol detailed mass spectra of all intermediate products can be found in fig s4 of si 3 4 underlying mechanisms and transformation pathways based on the identified intermediate products and the reactivities of pms and hobr possible pathways for unactivated pms oxidation of tbbps are proposed fig 4 as can be seen the transformation pathways involve β scission debromination and cross coupling reactions we propose that the initial reaction between pms and tbbps was triggered by single electron transfer leading to the formation of a phenyl radical cation r1 further transformation of r1 via different pathways could result in the formation of various intermediate products for example r1 underwent β scission to generate 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzenesulfon cation r2 and 2 6 dibromophenol radical r3 r2 was likely subjected to hydrolysis to form p1 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid further oxidation of p1 by pms could generate a hydroxylated product p2 on the other hand the electrophilic attack of r2 on p3 molecule could give rise to p5 another intermediate r3 generated by β scission of r1 could further generate intermediate r4 2 6 dibromophenol through hydrogen abstraction reaction the further oxidation of r4 by pms or hobr could lead to the formation of p3 2 6 dibromohydroquinone and p7 2 4 6 tribromophenol respectively it should be noted that the bromine in the para position of p7 must be originated from tbbps per se which implies that debromination and rebromination reactions occurred during the oxidation of tbbps ji et al 2017 on the other hand the phenyl radical cation r1 could rapidly deprotonate and lead to the formation of long lived phenoxyl radical r5 which could resonate to form a stable carbon centered radical r6 subsequently the combination between different radicals could generate various products for example the radical coupling between r5 and r3 could form p10 in addition the cleavage of the c br bond of r6 formed p6 tribromobisphenol s which underwent further debromination to obtain p8 dibromobisphenol s furthermore r6 could also couple with p1 or its own to form coupling products p4 and p9 respectively 3 5 ecotoxicity of intermediate products the acute toxicity of tbbps and its intermediate products generated by unactivated pms oxidation was assessed by ecosar program which has been widely applied to predict the ecotoxicity of contaminants in water treatments yang et al 2021b as shown in table 1 all the compounds fall into four toxicity categories e g not harmful harmful toxic and very toxic compared with tbbps the intermediate products p1 p2 p3 p6 p7 and p8 have increased polarity and reduced toxicity while the cross coupling products p4 p5 p9 and p10 have reduced polarity and increased toxicity the high toxicity of coupling products highlights the need to monitor their formation during unactivated pms oxidation process and to evaluate their potential environmental risks 3 6 effects of nom 3 6 1 tbbps oxidation in the presence of nom naturally occurring species such as nom may have pronounced impacts on the removal of contaminants by unactivated pms ji et al 2018 fig s5 of si clearly shows that the presence of srnom as a representative of aquatic nom inhibited the degradation of tbbps and the inhibitory effect was exacerbated with increasing concentration of srnom nom is a complex mixture of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon structures attached with various functional groups leenheer and croué 2003 it is well known that electron rich moieties of nom such as phenolic groups are capable of consuming pms and hobr efficiently westerhoff et al 2004 fig s5 also shows that the autocatalytic effect was more explicit at low concentration of srnom 1 mg l 1 this can be rationalized by the fact that only a small amount of hobr was generated in the tbbps pms system and hobr could be largely consumed by srnom at high concentrations 3 6 2 br dbps formation in the absence and presence of nom further oxidation and ring opening of the brominated intermediates could generate low molecule weight br dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and bromoacetic acids haas wang et al 2014 epidemiological studies have shown that the risks of bladder and rectal cancer were closely associated with thms levels and haas were teratogenic in mice embryos and rats richardson et al 2007 in addition dbps may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight and spontaneous abortion richardson et al 2007 therefore due to their potential cytotoxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity these dbps are stringently regulated in the water treatment processes richardson 2003 moreover nom is an important precursor of dbps during chlorine disinfection heeb et al 2014 wang et al 2014 we therefore attempted to evaluate the formation potential of br dbps during the oxidation of tbbps by pms in the presence and absence of srnom a total of three br dbps including bromoform chbr3 monobromoacetic acid mbaa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa were detected by gc analysis these br dbps can be regarded as the deep oxidation products of tbbps thus their formation is expected to be slower than the degradation of tbbps this is evidenced by fig 5 a showing that br dbps were not identified in the initial 8 h after that the yields of br dbps increased gradually over time as seen the formation potential of br dbps followed an order of chbr3 dbaa mbaa suggesting that thms were preferentially generated during the oxidation process the higher yield of chbr3 is consistent with previous studies on the bromination of other phenolic compounds including phenol resorcinol and salicylic acid boyce and hornig 1983 wang et al 2014 the mechanisms of br dbps formation have been reported in some previous studies wang et al 2014 we propose that further oxidation of the tbbps intermediate products by either pms or hobr would result in ring cleaving generating various aliphatic acids containing oxygen groups such as c o and cooh yang et al 2020b these aliphatic acids in particular α or β keto acids favor rapid halogenation with hox due to the presence of enolizable methylene groups deborde and von gunten 2008 further hydrolysis decarboxylation followed with oxidation will give rise to chbr3 dbaa and mbaa wang et al 2014 interestingly the concentrations of br dbps generated in the presence of srnom were comparatively lower fig 5b d in addition the yields of br dbps were decreased with increasing concentration of srnom most notably no chbr3 was detected within 48 h in the presence of 5 and 10 mg l 1 srnom the consumption of pms by srnom likely inhibited the debromination of tbbps which in turn suppressed the formation of hobr on the other hand electron rich moieties of srnom such as phenolic groups could efficiently quench hobr especially when the concentrations of srnom are high criquet et al 2015 these results taken together could inhibit the deep oxidation of tbbps intermediates thus reducing the formation of keto acids which consequently decreased the yields of br dbps it is noteworthy that although nom is an important precursor of dbps during halogenation hobr at low concentrations prefers to ring incorporation to produce brominated intermediates rather than ring opening to form br dbps westerhoff et al 2004 criquet et al 2015 therefore the yields of br dbps decreased as the concentration of srnom increased 4 conclusions and implications for water treatment the results of this study can be summarized as follows i unactivated pms could efficiently mediate the transformation of tbbps the oxidation of tbbps exhibited an autocatalytic performance and was accelerated with decreasing ph the presence of srnom inhibited the transformation of tbbps and the inhibitory effects were intensified with increasing srnom concentration ii ho so4 and 1o2 were not involved in the oxidation of tbbps by unactivated pms instead hobr was identified as the critical reactive species responsible for the autocatalytic oxidation of tbbps iii br detached from tbbps molecule can be rapidly oxidized by the residual pms leading to the formation of hobr trace level hobr significantly accelerated the oxidation of tbbps iv the transformation of tbbps by unactivated pms was proposed to be initiated by single electron transfer followed by β scission debromination and cross coupling reactions leading to the formation of a series of intermediate products v three br dbps including chbr3 dbaa and mbaa were detected within 48 h of reaction the presence of srnom reduced the yields of br dbps and the yields decreased with increasing concentration of srnom our results also have implications for water and wastewater treatment using pms as an oxidant for example the autocatalytic behavior of hobr formed in situ can greatly accelerate the transformation of brominated organic contaminants e g bfrs by pms oxidation however the potential formation of br dbps should be scrutinized due to their carcinogenicity

16631,the uv monochloramine uv nh2cl process has attracted increasing attention in water treatment in which hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive nitrogen species rns are produced this study investigated the effects of water matrices including halides natural organic matter nom alkalinity and ph on the degradation kinetic of a variety of micropollutants and radical chemistry in the uv nh2cl process the presence of chloride blunted ho and cl impacts but enhanced cl2 effect on micropollutants reactive toward cl2 the presence of 30 μm bromide led to an 82 decrease in the specific pseudo first order rate constants k by ho k ho and significantly diminished rcs efficacy reactive bromine species rbs were formed in the presence of bromide while the contribution could not compensate for the decrease of ho and rcs due to their lower reactivity toward micropollutants iodide rapidly transformed to hoi via reacting with nh2cl which resulted in a 59 decrease of k ho and 12 100 decreases of k by reactive halogen species rhs and rns k rhs rns for most micropollutants nevertheless k of phenolic compounds such as paracetamol bisphenol a and salbutamol increased in the presence of iodide by 78 360 and 130 respectively due to the roles of hoi and reactive iodine species ris bicarbonate decreased the contributions of ho and rcs but enhanced that of co3 for micropollutants reactive toward co3 the presence of 1 mg l nom scavenged over half the amount of ho and also consumed rcs and rns resulting in significantly decreased removal of micropollutants high ph value witnessed enhanced degradation for those micropollutants reactive toward rcs and rns through deprotonation the degradation of most micropollutants was inhibited in real drinking water and in the coexistence of halides this study provides a better understanding of radical chemistry in the uv nh2cl process under a practical water treatment condition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords the uv nh2cl process advanced oxidation process hydroxyl radicals halogen radicals water treatment 1 introduction the uv monochloramine uv nh2cl process is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop and has gained increasing attention in water treatment chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2018 wu et al 2019 in fact coexposure of ultraviolet uv and chloramine is also present in real water treatment for example during uv based aop treatment following microfiltration and reverse osmosis in potable water reuse uv chlorine treatment of ammonia containing water and uv treatment of chlorinated swimming pool water chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 bu et al 2018 li et al 2018 patton et al 2018 sun et al 2019 many studies have reported that uv nh2cl effectively degraded micropollutants in water treatment such as 1 4 dioxane carbamazepine benzoate triclosan estradiol sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen and naproxen chuang et al 2017 bu et al 2018 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 nh2cl photolysis due to uv exposure initially produces amidogen radicals nh2 and chlorine atoms cl eq 1 li and blatchley iii 2009 soltermann et al 2013 and subsequently forms secondary radicals such as cl2 cloh ho and reactive nitrogen species rns i e no and no2 eqs 2 8 wu et al 2019 ho reacts with most micropollutants rapidly following second order reaction kinetics with rate constants k higher than 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2020 while reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl and cl2 are selective oxidants preferentially targeting compounds containing electron rich groups with k values ranging 108 1010 m 1 s 1 hasegawa and neta 1978 alfassi et al 1989 lei et al 2019 no and no2 as rns prefer to react with organic molecules containing electron rich groups such as phenolic groups anilines phenothiazines and thiols the k values of no2 vary widely from 103 to 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 huie 1994 huang et al 2018 these reactive species result in efficient removal of micropollutants in the uv nh2cl process chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 however the diverse radicals are probably involved in the degradation of different micropollutants which depends on the structure of specific micropollutant for example in the uv nh2cl process the degradation of carbamazepine is primarily attributed to rcs bu et al 2018 ho is the dominant radical for ethinylestradiol elimination sun et al 2019 and estradiol reacts with ho rcs and rns significantly sun et al 2019 however these previous studies investigated micropollutants at much higher concentrations μm level than those occurred in real water and the micropollutants tested were limited it is necessary to investigate the degradation of structurally diverse micropollutants in uv nh2cl under environmentally relevant conditions 1 nh2cl hv nh2 cl φ 0 1 0 3 2 cl h2o cloh h k 4 5 103 m 1 s 1 3 cl oh cloh k 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 4 cloh ho cl k 6 1 109s 1 6 cl cl cl2 k 6 5 109 m 1

chloride bromide and iodide affect the radical chemistry of uv nh2cl specifically chloride reacts with ho and cl to form cloh and cl2 respectively nist 2020 a previous study reported that cl is transformed to cl2 when the chloride concentration increased in the uv nh2cl system resulting in decreased carbamazepine decay and increased ethinylestradiol decay while the changes in the degradation rates of triclosan and sulfamethoxazole were minimal sun et al 2019 bromide reacts with ho or cl to generate reactive bromine species rbs such as br broh br2 and clbr nist 2020 similar to rcs rbs are selective oxidants reacting with phenolic compounds aniline thioether and n acetylmethionine rapidly with k values of 108 1010 m 1 s 1 qin et al 1985 neta et al 1988 alfassi et al 1990 scaiano et al 1993 merenyi and lind 1994 parker and mitch 2016 as for iodide its role is more complicated on the one hand hoi is rapidly formed in the oxidation of iodide by nh2cl wang et al 2018 which has high reactivity toward phenolic compounds and carbonyl compounds and also reacts quickly with ho zhao et al 2017 li et al 2020 nist 2020 on the other hand the simultaneous uv photolysis of iodide generates reactive iodine species ris such as i and i2 and hydrated electrons sun et al 2017 it was reported that ris leads to fast reactions of phenolic compounds that contain a substituent group in the para position of phenolic hydroxyl with k values of 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2020 thus halides are expected to dramatically change the radical chemistry of the uv nh2cl process while their effects on the radicals for micropollutant abatement are largely unknown moreover bromide and iodide effects on the performance of the uv nh2cl process have not been investigated yet natural organic matter nom and bicarbonate hco3 are widely present in natural water which can compete with micropollutants to consume radicals such as ho cl and cl2 fang et al 2014 lei et al 2021 ho and cl react with hco3 to produce co3 which can contribute to the removal of compounds containing anilines phenolic hydroxyl groups or naphthalene rings such as sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine salbutamol propranolol and naproxen zhou et al 2020 additionally an abundance of phenolic moieties is present in nom molecules which could also promote rns consumption yang et al 2019 for example previous studies showed that the abatement rates of carbamazepine triclosan sulfamethoxazole estradiol ethinylestradiol ibuprofen and naproxen significantly decreased in the presence of nom during uv nh2cl treatment while hco3 enhanced the degradation rates of carbamazepine estradiol ethinylestradiol and naproxen due to the generation of co3 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 thus the effects of nom and hco3 on the radical chemistry and the degradation of structurally diverse micropollutants need to be further investigated this study aimed to figure out the research gaps indicated above the uv nh2cl process efficiency in the removal of thirty six micropollutants with structural discrepancies was systematically investigated table s1 due to their typical structures and frequent occurrence in aquatic environments the effects of water matrices including halides nom and hco3 and different ph values on the degradation kinetics of these contaminants were tested the corresponding radical chemistry was then scrutinized 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all of the micropollutants were obtained from sigma aldrich and toronto research chemicals trc co usa stock solutions of the micropollutants were prepared following the method described in literature guo et al 2017 sodium hypochlorite naocl solution available chlorine 4 00 4 99 nitrobenzene nb 99 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solution available h2o2 35 were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa sodium bicarbonate nahco3 99 8 sodium chloride nacl 99 99 sodium bromide nabr 99 99 sodium hydroxide naoh 97 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 99 potassium iodide ki 99 and ammonium chloride nh4cl 99 8 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china suwannee river nom cat no 2r101n was obtained from the international humic substances society high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol acetonitrile and o phosphoric acid were obtained from fisher scientific a fresh nh2cl solution was prepared daily by adding naocl solution into a nh4cl solution to reach a chlorine to ammonia n mass ratio of 4 1 following rapid stirring for over 40 min the nh4cl solution ph was adjusted to 8 5 using naoh shang and blatchley 1999 a tap water sample was collected from a laboratory of east campus of sun yat sen university guangzhou china 2 2 experimental procedures photochemical experiments were conducted in a 700 ml magnetically stirred cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor with a quartz sleeve in the center where a low pressure mercury lamp heraeus gph 212t5l 4 10 w was placed the uv lamp was turned on for warming up at least 30 min prior to the experiments the temperature of each experiment was kept constant at 25 0 2 c using a water circulating system uv photon flux i0 was determined to be 0 67 μe s 1 by iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2011 the effective path length l was determined to be 2 29 cm by measuring the kinetics of h2o2 photolysis in a dilute solution fig s1 garoma and gurol 2005 the corresponding average uv fluence rate ep0 was 1 03 mw cm 2 a 700 ml working solution containing 1 µg l of each micropollutant buffered at ph 7 with 2 mm phosphate was dosed with 10 µm nh2cl and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation samples were collected at predetermined time and quenched with na2s2o3 the effects of halide ions 5 mm cl 30 µm br 1 µm i and 5 mm cl 30 µm br nom 1 mg l alkalinity 1 mm hco3 ph 6 7 and 8 4 and tap water were investigated the test solutions at ph 6 7 and 8 4 were all adjusted with phosphate buffer control test to evaluate uv irradiation only was conducted in a similar manner but in the absence of nh2cl while the same way was followed to evaluate nh2cl oxidation in the absence of uv light note that the nh2cl dosage of 10 µm was relevant to that used in practical application to investigate the degradation kinetics of micropollutants by uv nh2cl in water treatment and it gradually decayed to 6 2 μμ within 10 min and the gradually slow alteration did not affect the steady state concentrations of the radicals over the reaction time fig s1 all tests were conducted at least twice the error bars in all plots shown afterwards represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data obtained from duplicate runs 2 3 analytical methods the micropollutants were quantified by an ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc agilent 1290 system coupled with a triple quadrupole mass system with an electrospray ionization source ab sciex 5500 operating in negative or positive mode a c18 column poroshell 4 6 50 mm 2 7 μm was used to separate the micropollutants the mobile phase for negative mode consisted of pure water and acetonitrile acn at a flow rate of 0 35 ml min and 0 1 formic acid was added to replace the pure water for positive mode the gradient elution of acn water v v kept at 5 95 for 2 min then gradually increased to 95 5 from 2 to 6 min and held for 1 min the mass conditions can be found in table s2 an online solid phase extraction spe system spark was used before uhplc a spark infinity flexible cube was employed for online spe following the method described in literature guo et al 2017 the concentration of nb was determined by an hplc system equipped with a diode array detector agilent 1260 usa and a pfp column poroshell 120 4 6 150 mm 4 μm the mobile phase consisting of water a and acetonitrile b with a gradient elution of a b v v was held at 70 30 for 10 min and then gradually changed to 20 80 during 10 to 13 min at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min the concentration of nh2cl was determined using the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 ph was measured using a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo 2 4 modeling simulation the concentrations of radicals were simulated using kintecus ianni 2015 nearly three hundred reactions table s3 obtained from the literatures were considered in the model grebel et al 2010 fang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 nist 2020 to examine model sensitivity to variations in a particular rate constant average normalized square of residuals between the original control model output and the perturbed model output was calculated according to the method reported by rose and waite 2002 sensitivity analysis was undertaken by varying the rate constant of a particular reaction while keeping the other rate constants unchanged to simulate the change in radical concentrations the change in model output was considered at the magnitude level increasing or decreasing certain rate constant by an order of magnitude then the sensitivity of a specific radical to the reaction can be calculated using the radical concentrations 2 5 qsar analysis to explore the relationship between the structures of aromatic micropollutants and their reactivity toward different radicals a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar was employed hammett σ constants were calculated to represent electron withdrawing with a large positive value and electron donating with a large negative value properties of substituents in aromatic micropollutant molecules 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of micropollutants in the uv nh2cl process fig 1 a shows the pseudo first order rate constants k of micropollutant degradation by uv nh2cl alone and uv nh2cl at ph 7 in pure water nh2cl alone was not effective for most micropollutants except nalidixic acid norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin with k nh2cl values of 10 4 s 1 direct photolysis at 254 nm was not effective either for most micropollutants while some degradation was observed with k values varying from 1 0 10 3 to 2 4 10 3 s 1 the uv nh2cl process was much more efficient for all of the micropollutants with k from 0 0011 to 0 010 s 1 indicating significant roles of radicals in the degradation of micropollutants to quantitatively differentiate individual effects of reactive species i e ho rcs and rns on micropollutant degradation in the uv nh2cl process nb was used as a radical probe to determine the steady state concentration of ho this is because nb reacts with ho rapidly k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 while it is resistant to nh2cl uv rcs and rns huang et al 2018 yin et al 2020 the specific k of micropollutant degradation contributed by uv k uv ho k ho and other radicals i e rcs and rns k rcs rns were determined following the method described by the literature chen et al 2021 as shown in fig 1a k uv k ho and k rcs rns were obviously different in terms of different micropollutants to facilitate the discussion the micropollutants were grouped according to relative contributions of ho and rcs rns to the overall k 1 micropollutants degraded primarily by ho k ho k rcs rns 2 were designated as group i including ibuprofen gemfibrozil cyclophosphamide diethyltoluamide chloramphenicol naproxen clofibric acid dimetridazole metronidazole ornidazole tinidazole atrazine primidone caffeine nalidixic acid carbamazepine bezafibrate trimethoprim flumequine theophylline metoprolol and atenolol compared with wu et al 2019 the species of radicals i e ho rcs rns responsible for the degradation of ibuprofen and naproxen were the same while the specific contributions were not completely consistent due to the different experimental conditions 2 micropollutants decomposed primarily due to rcs rns attack k ho k rcs rns 0 5 were defined as group ii which included sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole ofloxacin norfloxacin ciprofloxacin paracetamol and mecoprop 3 the rest of micropollutants were categorized in group iii including ronidazole venlafaxine bisphenol a salbutamol propranolol sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline ho rcs and rns all took comparable contributions to micropollutants in group iii 0 5 k ho k rcs rns 2 note that the grouping of some micropollutants was not consistent with previous study in uv chlorine guo et al 2017 for example the degradation of carbamazepine caffeine gemfibrozil naproxen and trimethoprim was primarily ascribed to rcs in uv chlorine while ho played a dominant role in their degradation in uv nh2cl this was mainly because clo plays a significant role in the degradation of these micropollutants in uv chlorine but not in uv nh2cl note that clo is generated from the reactions between radicals and hocl ocl but hocl ocl is negligible from the hydrolysis of nh2cl with a low rate constant 3 78 10 7 m 1 s 1 in uv nh2cl schreiber and mitch 2005 the micropollutants behaved differently toward radicals mainly because of different functional groups they had it is obvious that the k rcs rns values were relatively high for the micropollutants containing aromatic rings with electron rich functional groups in order to better portray the reactivity of ho rcs and rns to aromatic micropollutants a qsar analysis was performed using the micropollutants with available hammett constants the results are shown in fig 1b it can be seen that as the hammett constants decreased rcs and rns reacted with the micropollutants more rapidly at the reaction rates significantly increasing while the reaction rates for ho kept almost stable this result indicates that the reactivity of rcs and rns with aromatic micropollutants relies on electron donating properties of substituents on the aromatic ring and ho is less selective to electron rich compounds compared to rcs and rns 3 2 effects of halide ions on the radical chemistry of micropollutant degradation figs 2 4 present how halide ions cl br and i affected specific k values of micropollutant treated by uv alone ho and other radicals i e reactive halogen species rhs together with rns in the uv nh2cl process interestingly k ho of all micropollutants decreased in the presence of any kind of halide ions while the effects of cl br and i on the overall k showed significant difference cl had a slight effect on the overall k values for most micropollutants but br and i significantly decreased most k values 3 2 1 effect of chloride the presence of 5 mm cl altered relative proportions of different reactive species leading to inhibited k ho values and enhanced k rcs rns values for most micropollutants fig 2a specifically k ho was observed to decrease by 17 in the presence of 5 mm cl for all subjects contrarily k rcs rns increased by 6 600 in most cases among them micropollutants containing electron rich structures e g 5 member heterocycles alkoxy benzenes anilines and phenols coincided with apparently increased k rcs rns values for example the k rcs rns values of naproxen and propranolol increased from 0 9 10 3 to 1 8 10 3 s 1 and from 5 8 10 3 to 9 7 10 3 s 1 respectively therefore the overall k of all micropollutants changed less than 0 2 in theory radical concentrations change with the presence of different chloride concentrations sensitivity analysis was conducted to verify this phenomenon with the results shown in fig 2b when cl is present in the uv nh2cl system the higher sensitivity values 0 3 1 9 for the reaction between cl and cl eq 6 to ho cl and cl2 indicating that the consumption of cl by cl primarily contributes to the changes of their concentrations meanwhile cloh and cl2 are formed when ho reacts with cl eqs 9 10 however the sensitivity values for eqs 9 10 to ho cl and cl2 were found as low as 0 0008 0 006 fig 2b indicating that direct consumption of ho and cloh by cl was not important therefore as compared to a system without cl 5 mm cl was the main contributor to cl consumption through the reaction shown in eq 6 with a rate constant of 4 25 107 s 1 which resulted in a decrease of cl concentration table s4 accordingly the concentration of ho that was formed from the reactions between cl and h2o oh eqs 2 4 decreased because the rate constant between cl with h2o oh 2 52 105 s 1 was lower than that with cl 9 cl ho cloh k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 k 6 1 109 s 1 10 cl cloh cl2 oh k 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 k 4 5 107 m 1 s 1 thereby according to the model the predicted concentration of ho decreased by 64 in the presence of 5 mm cl table s4 resulting in the decrease of k ho for micropollutant degradation at the same time the simulated cl2 concentration increased dramatically by 20 times as cl increased to 5 mm table s4 which was 1 3 times and 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of ho and cl respectively in the absence of cl cl2 prefers to react with compounds containing 5 member heterocycles alkoxy benzenes anilines and phenols with rate constants as high as 108 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2019 table s1 which are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than ho and cl table s1 therefore the increase in k rcs rns for some micropollutants such as naproxen and propranolol was mainly attributable to the increased formation of cl2 which compensated for the decrease of cl contribution 3 2 2 effect of bromide the presence of 30 μm br decreased the overall k values of all micropollutants fig 3a specifically the overall k values of micropollutants in groups i and iii decreased most significantly by 47 92 and those of micropollutants in group ii decreased relatively less by 38 55 k ho of all micropollutants decreased significantly by 82 while k rhs rns of different micropollutants showed different trends in variation fig 3a for example k rhs rns of micropollutants in group i changed slightly while those of micropollutants in groups ii and iii decreased significantly by 27 97 similar to the effect of cl br is a major scavenger of cl eq 11 with a sensitivity value of 0 78 fig 3b this resulted in a 59 decrease of cl in the presence of 30 μm br table s5 which further inhibited the formation of ho due to that is promoted by cl meanwhile br reacts with ho actively to form broh eq 12 an intermediate that further produces br and br2 guo et al 2020 the reaction between br and ho was important for ho consumption according to a sensitivity value of 0 67 in the presence of 30 μm br fig 3b the forward reaction of br with cl2 to form clbr eq 13 is a rate governing step for the consumption of cl2 with a sensitivity value of 1 27 excess br transforms clbr to generate br2 rapidly with a rate constant of 8 0 109 m 1 s 1 eq 14 guo et al 2020 also br reacts with cloh eq 15 which inhibits the reformation of ho from cloh guo et al 2020 therefore the simulated concentrations of ho and cl2 decreased by 39 and 86 table s5 respectively meanwhile rbs such as br br2 and clbr were formed at concentration levels of 10 12 10 10 and 10 13 m respectively which were 1 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of rcs in the uv nh2cl process table s5 11 br cl clbr k 1 2 1010m 1 s 1 k 1 9 103 s 1 12 br ho broh k 1 1 1010m 1 s 1 k 3 3 107 s 1 13 br cl2 clbr cl k 4 0 109m 1 s 1 k 1 1 102m 1 s 1 14 br clbr br2 cl k 8 0 109m 1 s 1 k 4 3 106m 1 s 1 15 br cloh clbr oh k 1 0 109m 1 s 1 k 3 0 106m 1 s 1 the reaction rate constants of rbs e g br and br2 with micropollutants including phenolic compounds anilines thioether and n acetylmethionine are as high as 108 1010 m 1 s 1 qin et al 1985 neta et al 1988 alfassi et al 1990 scaiano et al 1993 merenyi and lind 1994 parker and mitch 2016 clbr was reported to play an important role in the degradation of caffeine by uv chlorine when both cl and br were present wu et al 2017 therefore the slight effect of br on the k rhs rns for most micropollutants in group i was likely because the low contributions of rbs were similar to rcs the significant decrease of k rhs rns for micropollutants in groups ii and iii in the presence of br was mainly due to their lower reactivities toward rbs than rcs resulting in the increased contribution of k rbs insufficient to compensate for the decreased k rcs note that the transformation of nh2cl to nh2br in the presence of br is slow with k of 0 28 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 trofe et al 1980 thus the effect of br on the concentration of nh2cl was negligible in the reaction time scale of 10 min in uv nh2cl 3 2 3 effect of iodide as shown in fig 4 the presence of 1 μm i significantly decreased the overall k of most micropollutants by 16 65 while those of paracetamol in group ii and bisphenol a and salbutamol in group iii increased by 78 360 and 130 respectively for the specific k by ho and rhs rns 1 μm i scavenged 59 ho in the uv nh2cl process while the k rhs rns of phenols i e paracetamol bisphenol a and salbutamol and sulfonamides e g sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline significantly increased by 35 440 meanwhile the specific k by the oxidation of nh2cl k nh2cl for bisphenol a salbutamol and paracetamol significantly increased from 0 to 0 014 s 1 from 0 to 0 004 s 1 and from 0 to 0 001 s 1 respectively in the presence of i note that since many reactions related to reactive iodine species are not available the modeling simulation was not conducted in the presence of i the reaction rate constant of i with nh2cl was reported to be 2 4 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 eq 16 bichsel and von gunten 1999 indicating that i rapidly transforms to hoi in the presence of nh2cl at the same time hoi reacts with ho quickly with a second order rate constant of 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 eq 17 nist 2020 therefore k ho was inhibited due to direct consumption of ho by hoi and decreased production of cl from nh2cl photolysis which then decreased the formation of ho it is known that hoi reacts rapidly with phenolic compounds including phenol p methoxyphenol p iodophenol p cyanophenol p nitrophenol and para hydroxylbenzoic acid methylparaben bisphenol a bisphenol s and bisphenol af with k hoi from 26 m 1 s 1 to 3 1 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 or 8 li et al 2020 therefore the significant increases of k nh2cl for bisphenol a k hoi 1 6 105 m 1 s 1 salbutamol and paracetamol were attributable to the contribution of hoi which further enhanced their overall k values in the presence of i during the uv nh2cl treatment note that the photolysis of hoi should also happen and might alter the radical mechanisms for the micropollutant degradation which needs further investigation besides the reactions discussed above i photolysis generates i and hydrated electrons eaq eq 18 jortner et al 1964 eaq is consumed by dissolved oxygen quickly with a rate constant of 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2020 while i reacts with i to form i2 eq 19 rahn 1997 nist 2020 i and i2 react with phenolic compounds rapidly at k of 108 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2020 resulting in significant increases in k rhs rns of bisphenol a salbutamol and paracetamol meanwhile the increases in k rhs rns for sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline suggest that ris reacts with sulfonamides selectively the significant contributions of other reactive species mainly ris and small amount of eaq to the degradation of bisphenol a paracetamol sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline in the uv i system fig s2 also indicated the important roles of ris in their abatement 16 nh2cl i h h2o hoi cl nh4 k 2 4 103 m 1 s 1 17 hoi ho io h2o k 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 18 i hv i ctts i eaq 19 i i i2 k 0 76 2 0 1010 m 1 s 1 3 3 effects of alkalinity and nom on the radical chemistry of micropollutant degradation the presence of hco3 decreased the overall k values of most micropollutants by 7 7 76 except sulfonamides i e sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline ofloxacin and propranolol whose k values increased by 11 54 fig 5 specifically the presence of 1 mm hco3 decreased k ho for all micropollutants by 67 however k rcs rns co3 of sulfonamides ofloxacin and propranolol increased significantly by 53 240 in the presence of 1 mm hco3 resulting in their overall k values going up hco3 consumes ho cl and cl2 to form co3 with k of 8 5 106 2 2 108 and 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 respectively grebel et al 2010 nist 2020 therefore the modeling concentrations of ho cl and cl2 decreased by 73 52 and 78 table s6 respectively resulting in decreased k ho and k rcs however the simulated concentration of co3 increased by 15 times in the presence of 1 mm hco3 table s6 which was 4 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of ho cl and cl2 co3 was reported to react with compounds containing anilines phenolic hydroxyl groups and naphthalene rings preferentially zhou et al 2020 therefore the significant enhancement of k rcs rns co3 of sulfonamides ofloxacin and propranolol was mainly due to their high reaction rates with co3 108 m 1 s 1 table s1 the presence of 1 mg l nom decreased k ho values for all micropollutants by 56 meanwhile k rcs rns values of micropollutants in groups ii and iii were also significantly decreased by 30 90 in the presence of 1 mg l nom while those of most micropollutants in group i changed slightly thus the overall k values were observed to decrease by 38 74 for all micropollutants in uv nh2cl fig 6 the molar absorption coefficient of nom at 254 nm is 3 15 mg l 1 m 1 thus 8 2 of uv light was calculated to be blocked by 1 mg l nom in this system resulting in the inhibition of k uv for micropollutants the k for nom reacting with ho cl and cl2 were reported to be 3 0 108 mc 1 s 1 3 71 108 mc 1 s 1 and 1 71 107 mc 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 lei et al 2021 thus the simulated ho cl and cl2 concentrations decreased by 74 11 and 12 in the presence of 1 mg l nom table s7 this indicates that nom significantly inhibited the degradation of micropollutants by consuming ho and rcs a similar effect of nom could be also present on rns consumption because of high richness of phenolic moieties in nom molecules yang et al 2019 although the reaction rate constants of nom with rns were not available to perform modelling work 3 4 effects of ph fig 7 shows the effect of ph on the degradation of micropollutants by uv nh2cl the overall k values slightly changed with ph increasing from 6 to 8 4 for all micropollutants in group i sulfamethoxazole and mecoprop in group ii and ronidazole and venlafaxine in group iii however the overall k values for rest micropollutants in alkaline condition were higher than those at acidic condition specifically k ho for all micropollutants kept almost stable when ph increased which was consistent with a previous study wu et al 2019 however the contributions of rcs rns for most micropllutants in groups ii and iii significantly increased by 27 420 with increasing ph from 6 to 8 4 these results indicate that micropollutants reactive toward rcs rns were more susceptible to ph compared to those reactive toward ho in uv nh2cl steady state radical concentrations ho and rcs at different ph values were reported almost unchanged at ph from 6 to 8 4 wu et al 2019 while the concentration of no increased with increasing ph chen et al 2021 therefore the change of k especially k rcs rns of micropollutants with increasing ph mainly depended on the acid base characteristics of micropollutants and the reactivity with rns for example k of phenolic compounds e g paracetamol salbutamol increased at a higher ph value this may be partially ascribed to the increased contribution of no that reacts with phenolic antioxidants e g 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenol 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol and α tocopherol actively janzen et al 1993 micropollutants in groups ii and iii contained secondary amine hydroxyl or carboxyl groups increasing ph from 6 to 8 4 promoted their transformation from a cationic form to a neutral form or even to an anionic form which were more reactive to radicals rcs and rns react with electron rich groups faster hasegawa and neta 1978 alfassi et al 1989 hawkins and davies 2001 the rate constants of no2 reacting with phenols in anionic forms k 106 108 m 1 s 1 are much higher than those in neutral forms k 103 105 m 1 s 1 forni et al 1988 ammann et al 2005 therefore the degradation of most micropollutants in groups ii and iii was promoted when these compounds were transformed to the corresponding neutral or anionic forms with increasing ph which contributed to the increases in their k rcs rns values 3 5 degradation of micropollutants in real drinking water fig 8 presents the degradation of micropollutants by uv nh2cl in tap water and in the coexistence of cl and br the total k values of all the micropollutants significantly decreased by 29 97 in the coexistence of cl and br and the k ho for all micropollutants decreased by 93 in the coexistence of cl and br cl transformed cl to cl2 eq 6 which further reacted with br to form clbr eq 13 meanwhile br quickly reacted with ho and cl eqs 11 12 therefore the concentrations of ho and cl2 decreased compared to those in the presence of cl however bromine containing radicals e g clbr broh became major radicals resulting in the decrease of k rhs rns for most micropollutants due to their lower reactivities which was similar to that in the presence of br fig 3a the overall k values of most micropollutants also significantly decreased by 42 99 in tap water except for sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole propranolol and sulfaquinoxaline which decreased slightly or even increased specifically the k ho for all micropollutants decreased by 93 and the k rhs rns co3 for most micropollutants also decreased except for naproxen sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole propranolol and sulfaquinoxaline their k rhs rns co3 increased by 79 negligible 113 34 and 226 respectively which coincided with their high reactivity toward co3 with rate constants 108 m 1 s 1 table s1 the water parameters of tap water are provided in table s8 the high concentrations of total organic carbon toc 2 mg l and hco3 1 9 mm could significantly consume ho and rcs resulting in the decrease of k for most micropollutants however the formation of co3 from hco3 compensated for the degradation of some micropollutants reactive toward co3 table s1 the effects of cl and br were limited due to their low concentrations of 0 3 mm and 0 3 μm no2 could quickly consume ho to form no2 nist 2020 but its effect was not obvious because of the low concentration 1 4 μm therefore the significant inhibition of most micropollutants degradation in tap water was mainly ascribed to dissolved organic matter and hco3 4 conclusions and engineering implications the uv nh2cl process was efficient to degrade all micropollutants tested in this study but exhibited different radical mechanisms this study explored the radical mechanisms for 36 micropollutants at environmental relevant concentrations of 1 μg l for each micropollutant under different matrices micropollutants were grouped based on the radical chemistry of their degradation during uv nh2cl treatment the degradation kinetics depend on the micropollutant structure and water matrix the presence of 5 mm cl decreased ho and cl concentrations while dramatically increased that of cl2 by 20 times the results induced a rise of k rcs rns for micropollutants that were susceptible to cl2 which usually contain 5 member heterocycles alkoxy benzenes anilines and phenols 30 μm br significantly scavenged ho cl and cl2 and formed rbs resulting in the inhibition of micropollutant degradation because of the lower reactivities of micropollutants toward rbs than rcs as for i rapid formation of hoi was found when 1 μm i was present in the nh2cl solution which resulted in decreased production of ho and cl however as hoi is an active oxidant to attack phenolic compounds and ris formed by i photolysis reacts with phenols i e paracetamol bisphenol a and salbutamol and sulfonamides i e sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline rapidly these compounds underwent increased or unchanged degradation processes while others did not hco3 1 mm converted ho cl and cl2 to co3 leading to an increase in the degradation of micropollutants containing anilines phenolic hydroxyl groups and naphthalene rings that were reactive toward co3 nom 1 mg l decreased the k values of micropollutants by approximately 38 74 this was because nom was a filter of uv light and a radical scavenger to consume ho rcs and rns the effect of ph on the degradation efficiency was not important for all micropollutants in group i but increasing ph promoted the degradation of most micropollutants in groups ii and iii due to the deprotonation which were more reactive toward rcs and rns compared to their cationic and neutral forms in real drinking water the degradation of most micropollutants was significantly inhibited due to the consumption of radicals by dissolved organic matter and hco3 except for those reactive to co3 also in the coexistence of cl and br the scavenging effects of br on ho and rcs resulted in the decreased degradation of micropollutants the results obtained in this study reflected complicated impacts of water matrices on uv nh2cl efficiency for treating different micropollutants a variety of radicals were produced during the process involving complex interactions between each other and with other substances in water both synergistic and antagonistic effects were found the results shown in this article offer a reference to researchers who intend to

16631,the uv monochloramine uv nh2cl process has attracted increasing attention in water treatment in which hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive nitrogen species rns are produced this study investigated the effects of water matrices including halides natural organic matter nom alkalinity and ph on the degradation kinetic of a variety of micropollutants and radical chemistry in the uv nh2cl process the presence of chloride blunted ho and cl impacts but enhanced cl2 effect on micropollutants reactive toward cl2 the presence of 30 μm bromide led to an 82 decrease in the specific pseudo first order rate constants k by ho k ho and significantly diminished rcs efficacy reactive bromine species rbs were formed in the presence of bromide while the contribution could not compensate for the decrease of ho and rcs due to their lower reactivity toward micropollutants iodide rapidly transformed to hoi via reacting with nh2cl which resulted in a 59 decrease of k ho and 12 100 decreases of k by reactive halogen species rhs and rns k rhs rns for most micropollutants nevertheless k of phenolic compounds such as paracetamol bisphenol a and salbutamol increased in the presence of iodide by 78 360 and 130 respectively due to the roles of hoi and reactive iodine species ris bicarbonate decreased the contributions of ho and rcs but enhanced that of co3 for micropollutants reactive toward co3 the presence of 1 mg l nom scavenged over half the amount of ho and also consumed rcs and rns resulting in significantly decreased removal of micropollutants high ph value witnessed enhanced degradation for those micropollutants reactive toward rcs and rns through deprotonation the degradation of most micropollutants was inhibited in real drinking water and in the coexistence of halides this study provides a better understanding of radical chemistry in the uv nh2cl process under a practical water treatment condition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords the uv nh2cl process advanced oxidation process hydroxyl radicals halogen radicals water treatment 1 introduction the uv monochloramine uv nh2cl process is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop and has gained increasing attention in water treatment chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2018 wu et al 2019 in fact coexposure of ultraviolet uv and chloramine is also present in real water treatment for example during uv based aop treatment following microfiltration and reverse osmosis in potable water reuse uv chlorine treatment of ammonia containing water and uv treatment of chlorinated swimming pool water chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 bu et al 2018 li et al 2018 patton et al 2018 sun et al 2019 many studies have reported that uv nh2cl effectively degraded micropollutants in water treatment such as 1 4 dioxane carbamazepine benzoate triclosan estradiol sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen and naproxen chuang et al 2017 bu et al 2018 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 nh2cl photolysis due to uv exposure initially produces amidogen radicals nh2 and chlorine atoms cl eq 1 li and blatchley iii 2009 soltermann et al 2013 and subsequently forms secondary radicals such as cl2 cloh ho and reactive nitrogen species rns i e no and no2 eqs 2 8 wu et al 2019 ho reacts with most micropollutants rapidly following second order reaction kinetics with rate constants k higher than 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2020 while reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl and cl2 are selective oxidants preferentially targeting compounds containing electron rich groups with k values ranging 108 1010 m 1 s 1 hasegawa and neta 1978 alfassi et al 1989 lei et al 2019 no and no2 as rns prefer to react with organic molecules containing electron rich groups such as phenolic groups anilines phenothiazines and thiols the k values of no2 vary widely from 103 to 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 huie 1994 huang et al 2018 these reactive species result in efficient removal of micropollutants in the uv nh2cl process chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 however the diverse radicals are probably involved in the degradation of different micropollutants which depends on the structure of specific micropollutant for example in the uv nh2cl process the degradation of carbamazepine is primarily attributed to rcs bu et al 2018 ho is the dominant radical for ethinylestradiol elimination sun et al 2019 and estradiol reacts with ho rcs and rns significantly sun et al 2019 however these previous studies investigated micropollutants at much higher concentrations μm level than those occurred in real water and the micropollutants tested were limited it is necessary to investigate the degradation of structurally diverse micropollutants in uv nh2cl under environmentally relevant conditions 1 nh2cl hv nh2 cl φ 0 1 0 3 2 cl h2o cloh h k 4 5 103 m 1 s 1 3 cl oh cloh k 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 4 cloh ho cl k 6 1 109s 1 6 cl cl cl2 k 6 5 109 m 1

chloride bromide and iodide affect the radical chemistry of uv nh2cl specifically chloride reacts with ho and cl to form cloh and cl2 respectively nist 2020 a previous study reported that cl is transformed to cl2 when the chloride concentration increased in the uv nh2cl system resulting in decreased carbamazepine decay and increased ethinylestradiol decay while the changes in the degradation rates of triclosan and sulfamethoxazole were minimal sun et al 2019 bromide reacts with ho or cl to generate reactive bromine species rbs such as br broh br2 and clbr nist 2020 similar to rcs rbs are selective oxidants reacting with phenolic compounds aniline thioether and n acetylmethionine rapidly with k values of 108 1010 m 1 s 1 qin et al 1985 neta et al 1988 alfassi et al 1990 scaiano et al 1993 merenyi and lind 1994 parker and mitch 2016 as for iodide its role is more complicated on the one hand hoi is rapidly formed in the oxidation of iodide by nh2cl wang et al 2018 which has high reactivity toward phenolic compounds and carbonyl compounds and also reacts quickly with ho zhao et al 2017 li et al 2020 nist 2020 on the other hand the simultaneous uv photolysis of iodide generates reactive iodine species ris such as i and i2 and hydrated electrons sun et al 2017 it was reported that ris leads to fast reactions of phenolic compounds that contain a substituent group in the para position of phenolic hydroxyl with k values of 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2020 thus halides are expected to dramatically change the radical chemistry of the uv nh2cl process while their effects on the radicals for micropollutant abatement are largely unknown moreover bromide and iodide effects on the performance of the uv nh2cl process have not been investigated yet natural organic matter nom and bicarbonate hco3 are widely present in natural water which can compete with micropollutants to consume radicals such as ho cl and cl2 fang et al 2014 lei et al 2021 ho and cl react with hco3 to produce co3 which can contribute to the removal of compounds containing anilines phenolic hydroxyl groups or naphthalene rings such as sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine salbutamol propranolol and naproxen zhou et al 2020 additionally an abundance of phenolic moieties is present in nom molecules which could also promote rns consumption yang et al 2019 for example previous studies showed that the abatement rates of carbamazepine triclosan sulfamethoxazole estradiol ethinylestradiol ibuprofen and naproxen significantly decreased in the presence of nom during uv nh2cl treatment while hco3 enhanced the degradation rates of carbamazepine estradiol ethinylestradiol and naproxen due to the generation of co3 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 thus the effects of nom and hco3 on the radical chemistry and the degradation of structurally diverse micropollutants need to be further investigated this study aimed to figure out the research gaps indicated above the uv nh2cl process efficiency in the removal of thirty six micropollutants with structural discrepancies was systematically investigated table s1 due to their typical structures and frequent occurrence in aquatic environments the effects of water matrices including halides nom and hco3 and different ph values on the degradation kinetics of these contaminants were tested the corresponding radical chemistry was then scrutinized

mg l alkalinity 1 mm hco3 ph 6 7 and 8 4 and tap water were investigated the test solutions at ph 6 7 and 8 4 were all adjusted with phosphate buffer control test to evaluate uv irradiation only was conducted in a similar manner but in the absence of nh2cl while the same way was followed to evaluate nh2cl oxidation in the absence of uv light note that the nh2cl dosage of 10 µm was relevant to that used in practical application to investigate the degradation kinetics of micropollutants by uv nh2cl in water treatment and it gradually decayed to 6 2 μμ within 10 min and the gradually slow alteration did not affect the steady state concentrations of the radicals over the reaction time fig s1 all tests were conducted at least twice the error bars in all plots shown afterwards represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data obtained from duplicate runs 2 3 analytical methods the micropollutants were quantified by an ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc agilent 1290 system coupled with a triple quadrupole mass system with an electrospray ionization source ab sciex 5500 operating in negative or positive mode a c18 column poroshell 4 6 50 mm 2 7 μm was used to separate the micropollutants the mobile phase for negative mode consisted of pure water and acetonitrile acn at a flow rate of 0 35 ml min and 0 1 formic acid was added to replace the pure water for positive mode the gradient elution of acn water v v kept at 5 95 for 2 min then gradually increased to 95 5 from 2 to 6 min and held for 1 min the mass conditions can be found in table s2 an online solid phase extraction spe system spark was used before uhplc a spark infinity flexible cube was employed for online spe following the method described in literature guo et al 2017 the concentration of nb was determined by an hplc system equipped with a diode array detector agilent 1260 usa and a pfp column poroshell 120 4 6 150 mm 4 μm the mobile phase consisting of water a and acetonitrile b with a gradient elution of a b v v was held at 70 30 for 10 min and then gradually changed to 20 80 during 10 to 13 min at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min the concentration of nh2cl was determined using the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 ph was measured using a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo 2 4 modeling simulation the concentrations of radicals were simulated using kintecus ianni 2015 nearly three hundred reactions table s3 obtained from the literatures were considered in the model grebel et al 2010 fang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 nist 2020 to examine model sensitivity to variations in a particular rate constant average normalized square of residuals between the original control model output and the perturbed model output was calculated according to the method reported by rose and waite 2002 sensitivity analysis was undertaken by varying the rate constant of a particular reaction while keeping the other rate constants unchanged to simulate the change in radical concentrations the change in model output was considered at the magnitude level increasing or decreasing certain rate constant by an order of magnitude then the sensitivity of a specific radical to the reaction can be calculated using the radical concentrations 2 5 qsar analysis to explore the relationship between the structures of aromatic micropollutants and their reactivity toward different radicals a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar was employed hammett σ constants were calculated to represent electron withdrawing with a large positive value and electron donating with a large negative value properties of substituents in aromatic micropollutant molecules 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of micropollutants in the uv nh2cl process fig 1 a shows the pseudo first order rate constants k of micropollutant degradation by uv nh2cl alone and uv nh2cl at ph 7 in pure water nh2cl alone was not effective for most micropollutants except nalidixic acid norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin with k nh2cl values of 10 4 s 1 direct photolysis at 254 nm was not effective either for most micropollutants while some degradation was observed with k values varying from 1 0 10 3 to 2 4 10 3 s 1 the uv nh2cl process was much more efficient for all of the micropollutants with k from 0 0011 to 0 010 s 1 indicating significant roles of radicals in the degradation of micropollutants to quantitatively differentiate individual effects of reactive species i e ho rcs and rns on micropollutant degradation in the uv nh2cl process nb was used as a radical probe to determine the steady state concentration of ho this is because nb reacts with ho rapidly k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 while it is resistant to nh2cl uv rcs and rns huang et al 2018 yin et al 2020 the specific k of micropollutant degradation contributed by uv k uv ho k ho and other radicals i e rcs and rns k rcs rns were determined following the method described by the literature chen et al 2021 as shown in fig 1a k uv k ho and k rcs rns were obviously different in terms of different micropollutants to facilitate the discussion the micropollutants were grouped according to relative contributions of ho and rcs rns to the overall k 1 micropollutants degraded primarily by ho k ho k rcs rns 2 were designated as group i including ibuprofen gemfibrozil cyclophosphamide diethyltoluamide chloramphenicol naproxen clofibric acid dimetridazole metronidazole ornidazole tinidazole atrazine primidone caffeine nalidixic acid carbamazepine bezafibrate trimethoprim flumequine theophylline metoprolol and atenolol compared with wu et al 2019 the species of radicals i e ho rcs rns responsible for the degradation of ibuprofen and naproxen were the same while the specific contributions were not completely consistent due to the different experimental conditions 2 micropollutants decomposed primarily due to rcs rns attack k ho k rcs rns 0 5 were defined as group ii which included sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole ofloxacin norfloxacin ciprofloxacin paracetamol and mecoprop 3 the rest of micropollutants were categorized in group iii including ronidazole venlafaxine bisphenol a salbutamol propranolol sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline ho rcs and rns all took comparable contributions to micropollutants in group iii 0 5 k ho k rcs rns 2 note that the grouping of some micropollutants was not consistent with previous study in uv chlorine guo et al 2017 for example the degradation of carbamazepine caffeine gemfibrozil naproxen and trimethoprim was primarily ascribed to rcs in uv chlorine while ho played a dominant role in their degradation in uv nh2cl this was mainly because clo plays a significant role in the degradation of these micropollutants in uv chlorine but not in uv nh2cl note that clo is generated from the reactions between radicals and hocl ocl but hocl ocl is negligible from the hydrolysis of nh2cl with a low rate constant 3 78 10 7 m 1 s 1 in uv nh2cl schreiber and mitch 2005 the micropollutants behaved differently toward radicals mainly because of different functional groups they had it is obvious that the k rcs rns values were relatively high for the micropollutants containing aromatic rings with electron rich functional groups in order to better portray the reactivity of ho rcs and rns to aromatic micropollutants a qsar analysis was performed using the micropollutants with available hammett constants the results are shown in fig 1b it can be seen that as the hammett constants decreased rcs and rns reacted with the micropollutants more rapidly at the reaction rates significantly increasing while the reaction rates for ho kept almost stable this result indicates that the reactivity of rcs and rns with aromatic micropollutants relies on electron donating properties of substituents on the aromatic ring and ho is less selective to electron rich compounds compared to rcs and rns 3 2 effects of halide ions on the radical chemistry of micropollutant degradation figs 2 4 present how halide ions cl br and i affected specific k values of micropollutant treated by uv alone ho and other radicals i e reactive halogen species rhs together with rns in the uv nh2cl process interestingly k ho of all micropollutants decreased in the presence of any kind of halide ions while the effects of cl br and i on the overall k showed significant difference cl had a slight effect on the overall k values for most micropollutants but br and i significantly decreased most k values 3 2 1 effect of chloride the presence of 5 mm cl altered relative proportions of different reactive species leading to inhibited k ho values and enhanced k rcs rns values for most micropollutants fig 2a specifically k ho was observed to decrease by 17 in the presence of 5 mm cl for all subjects contrarily k rcs rns increased by 6 600 in most cases among them micropollutants containing electron rich structures e g 5 member heterocycles alkoxy benzenes anilines and phenols coincided with apparently increased k rcs rns values for example the k rcs rns values of naproxen and propranolol increased from 0 9 10 3 to 1 8 10 3 s 1 and from 5 8 10 3 to 9 7 10 3 s 1 respectively therefore the overall k of all micropollutants changed less than 0 2 in theory radical concentrations change with the presence of different chloride concentrations sensitivity analysis was conducted to verify this phenomenon with the results shown in fig 2b when cl is present in the uv nh2cl system the higher sensitivity values 0 3 1 9 for the reaction between cl and cl eq 6 to ho cl and cl2 indicating that the consumption of cl by cl primarily contributes to the changes of their concentrations meanwhile cloh and cl2 are formed when ho reacts with cl eqs 9 10 however the sensitivity values for eqs 9 10 to ho cl and cl2 were found as low as 0 0008 0 006 fig 2b indicating that direct consumption of ho and cloh by cl was not important therefore as compared to a system without cl 5 mm cl was the main contributor to cl consumption through the reaction shown in eq 6 with a rate constant of 4 25 107 s 1 which resulted in a decrease of cl concentration table s4 accordingly the concentration of ho that was formed from the reactions between cl and h2o oh eqs 2 4 decreased because the rate constant between cl with h2o oh 2 52 105 s 1 was lower than that with cl 9 cl ho cloh k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 k 6 1 109 s 1 10 cl cloh cl2 oh k 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 k 4 5 107 m 1 s 1 thereby according to the model the predicted concentration of ho decreased by 64 in the presence of 5 mm cl table s4 resulting in the decrease of k ho for micropollutant degradation at the same time the simulated cl2 concentration increased dramatically by 20 times as cl increased to 5 mm table s4 which was 1 3 times and 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of ho and cl respectively in the absence of cl cl2 prefers to react with compounds containing 5 member heterocycles alkoxy benzenes anilines and phenols with rate constants as high as 108 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2019 table s1 which are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than ho and cl table s1 therefore the increase in k rcs rns for some micropollutants such as naproxen and propranolol was mainly attributable to the increased formation of cl2 which compensated for the decrease of cl contribution 3 2 2 effect of bromide the presence of 30 μm br decreased the overall k values of all micropollutants fig 3a specifically the overall k values of micropollutants in groups i and iii decreased most significantly by 47 92 and those of micropollutants in group ii decreased relatively less by 38 55 k ho of all micropollutants decreased significantly by 82 while k rhs rns of different micropollutants showed different trends in variation fig 3a for example k rhs rns of micropollutants in group i changed slightly while those of micropollutants in groups ii and iii decreased significantly by 27 97 similar to the effect of cl br is a major scavenger of cl eq 11 with a sensitivity value of 0 78 fig 3b this resulted in a 59 decrease of cl in the presence of 30 μm br table s5 which further inhibited the formation of ho due to that is promoted by cl meanwhile br reacts with ho actively to form broh eq 12 an intermediate that further produces br and br2 guo et al 2020 the reaction between br and ho was important for ho consumption according to a sensitivity value of 0 67 in the presence of 30 μm br fig 3b the forward reaction of br with cl2 to form clbr eq 13 is a rate governing step for the consumption of cl2 with a sensitivity value of 1 27 excess br transforms clbr to generate br2 rapidly with a rate constant of 8 0 109 m 1 s 1 eq 14 guo et al 2020 also br reacts with cloh eq 15 which inhibits the reformation of ho from cloh guo et al 2020 therefore the simulated concentrations of ho and cl2 decreased by 39 and 86 table s5 respectively meanwhile rbs such as br br2 and clbr were formed at concentration levels of 10 12 10 10 and 10 13 m respectively which were 1 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of rcs in the uv nh2cl process table s5 11 br cl clbr k 1 2 1010m 1 s 1 k 1 9 103 s 1 12 br ho broh k 1 1 1010m 1 s 1 k 3 3 107 s 1 13 br cl2 clbr cl k 4 0 109m 1 s 1 k 1 1 102m 1 s 1 14 br clbr br2 cl k 8 0 109m 1 s 1 k 4 3 106m 1 s 1 15 br cloh clbr oh k 1 0 109m 1 s 1 k 3 0 106m 1 s 1 the reaction rate constants of rbs e g br and br2 with micropollutants including phenolic compounds anilines thioether and n acetylmethionine are as high as 108 1010 m 1 s 1 qin et al 1985 neta et al 1988 alfassi et al 1990 scaiano et al 1993 merenyi and lind 1994 parker and mitch 2016 clbr was reported to play an important role in the degradation of caffeine by uv chlorine when both cl and br were present wu et al 2017 therefore the slight effect of br on the k rhs rns for most micropollutants in group i was likely because the low contributions of rbs were similar to rcs the significant decrease of k rhs rns for micropollutants in groups ii and iii in the presence of br was mainly due to their lower reactivities toward rbs than rcs resulting in the increased contribution of k rbs insufficient to compensate for the decreased k rcs note that the transformation of nh2cl to nh2br in the presence of br is slow with k of 0 28 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 trofe et al 1980 thus the effect of br on the concentration of nh2cl was negligible in the reaction time scale of 10 min in uv nh2cl 3 2 3 effect of iodide as shown in fig 4 the presence of 1 μm i significantly decreased the overall k of most micropollutants by 16 65 while those of paracetamol in group ii and bisphenol a and salbutamol in group iii increased by 78 360 and 130 respectively for the specific k by ho and rhs rns 1 μm i scavenged 59 ho in the uv nh2cl process while the k rhs rns of phenols i e paracetamol bisphenol a and salbutamol and sulfonamides e g sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline significantly increased by 35 440 meanwhile the specific k by the oxidation of nh2cl k nh2cl for bisphenol a salbutamol and paracetamol significantly increased from 0 to 0 014 s 1 from 0 to 0 004 s 1 and from 0 to 0 001 s 1 respectively in the presence of i note that since many reactions related to reactive iodine species are not available the modeling simulation was not conducted in the presence of i the reaction rate constant of i with nh2cl was reported to be 2 4 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 eq 16 bichsel and von gunten 1999 indicating that i rapidly transforms to hoi in the presence of nh2cl at the same time hoi reacts with ho quickly with a second order rate constant of 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 eq 17 nist 2020 therefore k ho was inhibited due to direct consumption of ho by hoi and decreased production of cl from nh2cl photolysis which then decreased the formation of ho it is known that hoi reacts rapidly with phenolic compounds including phenol p methoxyphenol p iodophenol p cyanophenol p nitrophenol and para hydroxylbenzoic acid methylparaben bisphenol a bisphenol s and bisphenol af with k hoi from 26 m 1 s 1 to 3 1 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 or 8 li et al 2020 therefore the significant increases of k nh2cl for bisphenol a k hoi 1 6 105 m 1 s 1 salbutamol and paracetamol were attributable to the contribution of hoi which further enhanced their overall k values in the presence of i during the uv nh2cl treatment note that the photolysis of hoi should also happen and might alter the radical mechanisms for the micropollutant degradation which needs further investigation besides the reactions discussed above i photolysis generates i and hydrated electrons eaq eq 18 jortner et al 1964 eaq is consumed by dissolved oxygen quickly with a rate constant of 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2020 while i reacts with i to form i2 eq 19 rahn 1997 nist 2020 i and i2 react with phenolic compounds rapidly at k of 108 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2020 resulting in significant increases in k rhs rns of bisphenol a salbutamol and paracetamol meanwhile the increases in k rhs rns for sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline suggest that ris reacts with sulfonamides selectively the significant contributions of other reactive species mainly ris and small amount of eaq to the degradation of bisphenol a paracetamol sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline in the uv i system fig s2 also indicated the important roles of ris in their abatement 16 nh2cl i h h2o hoi cl nh4 k 2 4 103 m 1 s 1 17 hoi ho io h2o k 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 18 i hv i ctts i eaq 19 i i i2 k 0 76 2 0 1010 m 1 s 1 3 3 effects of alkalinity and nom on the radical chemistry of micropollutant degradation the presence of hco3 decreased the overall k values of most micropollutants by 7 7 76 except sulfonamides i e sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline ofloxacin and propranolol whose k values increased by 11 54 fig 5 specifically the presence of 1 mm hco3 decreased k ho for all micropollutants by 67 however k rcs rns co3 of sulfonamides ofloxacin and propranolol increased significantly by 53 240 in the presence of 1 mm hco3 resulting in their overall k values going up hco3 consumes ho cl and cl2 to form co3 with k of 8 5 106 2 2 108 and 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 respectively grebel et al 2010 nist 2020 therefore the modeling concentrations of ho cl and cl2 decreased by 73 52 and 78 table s6 respectively resulting in decreased k ho and k rcs however the simulated concentration of co3 increased by 15 times in the presence of 1 mm hco3 table s6 which was 4 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of ho cl and cl2 co3 was reported to react with compounds containing anilines phenolic hydroxyl groups and naphthalene rings preferentially zhou et al 2020 therefore the significant enhancement of k rcs rns co3 of sulfonamides ofloxacin and propranolol was mainly due to their high reaction rates with co3 108 m 1 s 1 table s1 the presence of 1 mg l nom decreased k ho values for all micropollutants by 56 meanwhile k rcs rns values of micropollutants in groups ii and iii were also significantly decreased by 30 90 in the presence of 1 mg l nom while those of most micropollutants in group i changed slightly thus the overall k values were observed to decrease by 38 74 for all micropollutants in uv nh2cl fig 6 the molar absorption coefficient of nom at 254 nm is 3 15 mg l 1 m 1 thus 8 2 of uv light was calculated to be blocked by 1 mg l nom in this system resulting in the inhibition of k uv for micropollutants the k for nom reacting with ho cl and cl2 were reported to be 3 0 108 mc 1 s 1 3 71 108 mc 1 s 1 and 1 71 107 mc 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 lei et al 2021 thus the simulated ho cl and cl2 concentrations decreased by 74 11 and 12 in the presence of 1 mg l nom table s7 this indicates that nom significantly inhibited the degradation of micropollutants by consuming ho and rcs a similar effect of nom could be also present on rns consumption because of high richness of phenolic moieties in nom molecules yang et al 2019 although the reaction rate constants of nom with rns were not available to perform modelling work 3 4 effects of ph fig 7 shows the effect of ph on the degradation of micropollutants by uv nh2cl the overall k values slightly changed with ph increasing from 6 to 8 4 for all micropollutants in group i sulfamethoxazole and mecoprop in group ii and ronidazole and venlafaxine in group iii however the overall k values for rest micropollutants in alkaline condition were higher than those at acidic condition specifically k ho for all micropollutants kept almost stable when ph increased which was consistent with a previous study wu et al 2019 however the contributions of rcs rns for most micropllutants in groups ii and iii significantly increased by 27 420 with increasing ph from 6 to 8 4 these results indicate that micropollutants reactive toward rcs rns were more susceptible to ph compared to those reactive toward ho in uv nh2cl steady state radical concentrations ho and rcs at different ph values were reported almost unchanged at ph from 6 to 8 4 wu et al 2019 while the concentration of no increased with increasing ph chen et al 2021 therefore the change of k especially k rcs rns of micropollutants with increasing ph mainly depended on the acid base characteristics of micropollutants and the reactivity with rns for example k of phenolic compounds e g paracetamol salbutamol increased at a higher ph value this may be partially ascribed to the increased contribution of no that reacts with phenolic antioxidants e g 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenol 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol and α tocopherol actively janzen et al 1993 micropollutants in groups ii and iii contained secondary amine hydroxyl or carboxyl groups increasing ph from 6 to 8 4 promoted their transformation from a cationic form to a neutral form or even to an anionic form which were more reactive to radicals rcs and rns react with electron rich groups faster hasegawa and neta 1978 alfassi et al 1989 hawkins and davies 2001 the rate constants of no2 reacting with phenols in anionic forms k 106 108 m 1 s 1 are much higher than those in neutral forms k 103 105 m 1 s 1 forni et al 1988 ammann et al 2005 therefore the degradation of most micropollutants in groups ii and iii was promoted when these compounds were transformed to the corresponding neutral or anionic forms with increasing ph which contributed to the increases in their k rcs rns values 3 5 degradation of micropollutants in real drinking water fig 8 presents the degradation of micropollutants by uv nh2cl in tap water and in the coexistence of cl and br the total k values of all the micropollutants significantly decreased by 29 97 in the coexistence of cl and br and the k ho for all micropollutants decreased by 93 in the coexistence of cl and br cl transformed cl to cl2 eq 6 which further reacted with br to form clbr eq 13 meanwhile br quickly reacted with ho and cl eqs 11 12 therefore the concentrations of ho and cl2 decreased compared to those in the presence of cl however bromine containing radicals e g clbr broh became major radicals resulting in the decrease of k rhs rns for most micropollutants due to their lower reactivities which was similar to that in the presence of br fig 3a the overall k values of most micropollutants also significantly decreased by 42 99 in tap water except for sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole propranolol and sulfaquinoxaline which decreased slightly or even increased specifically the k ho for all micropollutants decreased by 93 and the k rhs rns co3 for most micropollutants also decreased except for naproxen sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole propranolol and sulfaquinoxaline their k rhs rns co3 increased by 79 negligible 113 34 and 226 respectively which coincided with their high reactivity toward co3 with rate constants 108 m 1 s 1 table s1 the water parameters of tap water are provided in table s8 the high concentrations of total organic carbon toc 2 mg l and hco3 1 9 mm could significantly consume ho and rcs resulting in the decrease of k for most micropollutants however the formation of co3 from hco3 compensated for the degradation of some micropollutants reactive toward co3 table s1 the effects of cl and br were limited due to their low concentrations of 0 3 mm and 0 3 μm no2 could quickly consume ho to form no2 nist 2020 but its effect was not obvious because of the low concentration 1 4 μm therefore the significant inhibition of most micropollutants degradation in tap water was mainly ascribed to dissolved organic matter and hco3 4 conclusions and engineering implications the uv nh2cl process was efficient to degrade all micropollutants tested in this study but exhibited different radical mechanisms this study explored the radical mechanisms for 36 micropollutants at environmental relevant concentrations of 1 μg l for each micropollutant under different matrices micropollutants were grouped based on the radical chemistry of their degradation during uv nh2cl treatment the degradation kinetics depend on the micropollutant structure and water matrix the presence of 5 mm cl decreased ho and cl concentrations while dramatically increased that of cl2 by 20 times the results induced a rise of k rcs rns for micropollutants that were susceptible to cl2 which usually contain 5 member heterocycles alkoxy benzenes anilines and phenols 30 μm br significantly scavenged ho cl and cl2 and formed rbs resulting in the inhibition of micropollutant degradation because of the lower reactivities of micropollutants toward rbs than rcs as for i rapid formation of hoi was found when 1 μm i was present in the nh2cl solution which resulted in decreased production of ho and cl however as hoi is an active oxidant to attack phenolic compounds and ris formed by i photolysis reacts with phenols i e paracetamol bisphenol a and salbutamol and sulfonamides i e sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and sulfaquinoxaline rapidly these compounds underwent increased or unchanged degradation processes while others did not hco3 1 mm converted ho cl and cl2 to co3 leading to an increase in the degradation of micropollutants containing anilines phenolic hydroxyl groups and naphthalene rings that were reactive toward co3 nom 1 mg l decreased the k values of micropollutants by approximately 38 74 this was because nom was a filter of uv light and a radical scavenger to consume ho rcs and rns the effect of ph on the degradation efficiency was not important for all micropollutants in group i but increasing ph promoted the degradation of most micropollutants in groups ii and iii due to the deprotonation which were more reactive toward rcs and rns compared to their cationic and neutral forms in real drinking water the degradation of most micropollutants was significantly inhibited due to the consumption of radicals by dissolved organic matter and hco3 except for those reactive to co3 also in the coexistence of cl and br the scavenging effects of br on ho and rcs resulted in the decreased degradation of micropollutants the results obtained in this study reflected complicated impacts of water matrices on uv nh2cl efficiency for treating different micropollutants a variety of radicals were produced during the process involving complex interactions between each other and with other substances in water both synergistic and antagonistic effects were found the results shown in this article offer a reference to researchers who intend to

16632,effluent organic matter efom from wastewater treatment plants wwtp constitutes an important source of dissolved organic matter in receiving waters photodegradation may alter the properties of wwtp efom thereby impacting its biodegradability and microbial respiration however whether and how natural sunlight exposure of efom affects its biodegradability and microbial oxygen consumption in the receiving waters are unclear to address these knowledge gaps incubation experiments of biodegradation photodegradation and bio photodegradation were conducted with the effluent samples from a tertiary wwtp in heifei china the quantity and quality of the efom were examined during the incubations to interpret changes in its lability and composition the results showed that photodegradation facilitated and accelerated the efom biodegradation after natural sunlight exposure the efom degradation rate was significantly enhanced from 0 004 d 1 to 0 065 d 1 measured by dissolved organic carbon doc correspondingly the doc concentration of efom was reduced by 64 2 26 6 by photodegradation and 37 5 by bio photodegradation while the concentration was only reduced by 5 3 in the direct biodegradation sunlight exposure of efom resulted in lower molecular weight less aromatic lower humified more bleached photoproducts these substances could be readily metabolized by the native microbial community in the receiving water stimulating microbial respiration correspondingly the oxygen consumption rate of efom increased from almost 0 11 mg l 1 d 1 in the direct biodegradation to 2 17 mg l 1 d 1 in the bio photodegradation this study highlights that after efom is discharged to the receiving water its post processing by sunlight can enhance biodegradability the existence of the coupled photochemical and biological process is suggested to be considered when determining efom fate and managing effluent discharge in receiving waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter photodegradation biodegradability wastewater treatment plant effluent 1 introduction with the increasing urbanization and proportion of sewage collection and treatment the contribution of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent to urban river discharge is increasing in some riverine systems effluent already dominates the flow hamdhani et al 2020 huang et al 2019 despite pollutants largely removed through secondary or tertiary treatment wwtp effluent still can be an important source of dissolved organic matter dom in the receiving waters o connor et al 2019 yang et al 2014 effluent organic matter efom contains considerable soluble microbial products smps derived during biological processes of wastewater treatment which is commonly accepted to be bio refractory compounds shon et al 2006 wang and chen 2018 therefore despite an important source of organic matter its discharge may not cause fast microbial degradation and dissolved oxygen do depletion in the receiving waters however fast oxygen depletion and hypoxia were still found in an urban river dominated by wwtp effluent after advanced treatment huang et al 2017 this phenomenon drives the motivation to investigate the mechanism of the altered biodegradability of efom in the receiving water body which may be particularly important in understanding the fate of efom in receiving waters efom discharged into the receiving waters is bound to exposure to sunlight and microorganism like natural organic matter nom evidence suggests that photochemical processing of nom is a major control of its biodegradability in many aquatic systems bowen et al 2020 moran and zepp 1997 ward et al 2017 the net effects of photodegradation on nom biodegradability were generally positive lu et al 2013 moran and sheldon 2000 sankar et al 2019 for example sankar et al 2019 found consistently larger decreases in dissolved organic carbon doc concentration for the coupled photochemical and biological degradation than only biodegradation in five watersheds with diverse types of land use and land cover nevertheless ward et al 2017 found that sunlight exposure of doc draining the thawed soil layer caused a decrease in biodegradable doc efom is likely to have different properties than the nom present in receiving waters nam and amy 2008 the effect of photodegradation on efom biodegradability remains poorly investigated evidence shows that efom is susceptible to be photodegraded in receiving waters o connor et al 2019 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 one recent study found that photoreactions would improve the bioavailability of efom to native microbes in the receiving water wang et al 2021 more studies are needed to investigate the effect of photodegradation on efom biodegradability and if there is a positive effect the extent and rate of efom degradation through the coupled photochemical and biological processes understanding the effect of photodegradation on dom biodegradation requires knowledge of how sunlight alters the composition and properties of dom many studies address that photodegradation transformation of dom in natural waters can lead to low molecular weight photo bleached and much simpler bio labile photoproducts such as acetate and formaldehyde which can enhance dom biodegradability and stimulate microbial activity moran and zepp 1997 on the other hand recent works showed that sunlight could also convert bioavailable dom to bio recalcitrant compounds such as carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules through partial photo oxidation ward and cory 2016 for efom the changes in its composition and properties during the photodegradation and their causal relationship with changes in the biodegradability of efom after the photodegradation remains poorly understood thus the primary aim of this study is to understand the effect of efom photodegradation on its biodegradability specifically the objectives are to answer two questions 1 does photodegradation of efom enhance its biodegradability in receiving waters 2 how does photodegradation of efom alter its composition and properties and further controls its biodegradation by microbes in receiving waters finally the findings provide new insights into the fate of efom through the coupled photochemical and biological degradation and offer environmental implications on effluent discharge in the receiving waters 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description the study site is the nanfei river flowing through heifei city the capital of anhui province china fig 1 as the largest in lake tributary this river finally flows into chaohu lake china s fifth largest freshwater lake upstream of nanfei river there is no freshwater inflow and it is mainly fed by wangtang wwtp effluent of 200 000 m3 d see fig 1 the wangtang wwtp adopts advanced tertiary treatment using the anaerobic anoxic oxic process with a nitrification denitrification unit uv is used to disinfect the effluent the treatment process removes over 80 of chemical oxygen demand cod 95 of 5 day biological oxygen demand bod5 85 of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n 70 of total nitrogen tn and 90 of total phosphorus tp from the influent the water quality of the effluent meets the 1 a grade of china s wwtp effluent discharge standard environmental protection agency of china 2002 the average annual cod bod5 nh3 n tn and tp concentrations in the effluent are less than 40 mg l 5 mg l 1 mg l 10 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively the wangtang wwtp discharges its effluent to the nanfei river accounting for over 75 of the flow in its urban reach under dry weather conditions huang et al 2016 despite receiving the tertiary effluent rapid do depletion was reported to occur in the urban reach of nanfei river downstream of the wangtang wwtp huang et al 2017 2 2 sample preparation the effluent samples 30 l were collected in august 2019 from the outlet of wangtang wwtp over the course of the sampling period the river water 10 l was sampled 500 m downstream of the effluent outlet in the nanfei river on the same days as the effluent was collected fig 1 all samples were sealed and transported back to the laboratory in polyethylene containers the effluent samples were filtered using 0 22 μ m membrane filters anpel gf f to remove suspended particles and bacteria the river water samples were not filtered because they were used for the inoculums of native microbial communities both types of samples were stored in pre washed preheated amber glass bottles wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent light exposure and refrigerated at 4 c before each incubation experiment 2 3 experimental design to investigate the biodegradability photodegradability and the effect of photodegradation on the biodegradability of efom three sets of incubation experiments were designed as described below biodegradation experiment aliquots were prepared by dispersing 15 ml of unfiltered river water sample inoculum in 250 ml of filtered effluent sample each in the ratio of 6 1 v v the aliquots were transferred to borosilicate glass bottles foil wrapped and placed into an incubator with a constant temperature of 25 c for 14 days one bottle of the sample was taken out from the incubator every evening at 18 00 in the incubation period the samples taken out were then filtered using 0 22 μ m membrane filters anpel gf f stored under refrigeration and measured together within 1 week after the incubation besides one aliquot was added by 15 ml of milli q water to serve as a control sample altogether three parallel experiments were conducted photodegradation experiment aliquots of the filtered effluent samples 250 ml each were transferred to quartz bottles the samples were exposed to natural sunlight for 7 days with 10 h per day 8 00 to 18 00 alongside a dark control foil wrapped on the unshaded roof of a building on the campus of tongji university the sunlight irradiance was measured using a tes 1339r rs 232 light meter taiwan china at a 3 minute interval see supporting information figure s1 one bottle of the sample was taken out every evening at 18 00 in the incubation period and then stored in the dark at 4 c all samples were analyzed within 1 week after the incubation like the biodegradation experiment three parallel experiments were performed photo biodegradation experiment another set of effluent sample aliquots 250 ml each alongside the sample aliquots in the photodegradation experiment were first exposed to natural sunlight for a full 7 days afterward they were inoculated and placed into the incubator foil wrapped at 25 c for the 7 day photo biodegradation incubation alongside a non inoculated control as described in the biodegradation experiment the daily sample was taken filtered stored and analyzed as was the case for the above two scenarios three parallel experiments were performed 2 4 analytical methods doc concentration is a straightforward measure to probe the quantitative changes in efom apart from direct measurement of doc uv visible and fluorescence spectra have also been widely used to characterize the composition origin and biogeochemical role of efom because of their accuracy rapidity and simplicity wang et al 2021 yang et al 2014 besides fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir is a technique that can quantify various functional groups in dom and provide additional information about the various types of carboxylic that cannot be distinguished using uv visible and fluorescence spectra zhang et al 2019 therefore doc concentration uv visible fluorescence and infrared spectra were analyzed respectively to probe behaviors of the collected samples during the biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation the doc concentration of the samples was measured by high temperature catalytic combustion using a shimadzu toc l carbon analyzer the uv visible absorption characteristics of the samples were analyzed using a shimadzu uv 2000 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette the spectra were collected between 200 and 650 nm wavelengths at the 1 nm interval the blank subtracted sample values were used to remove the effect of water and scattering the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra of the samples were analyzed in a horiba jobin yvon inc fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer edison nj usa the eem spectra for each sample were recorded with excitation wavelengths ranging from 240 to 400 nm at a 3 nm increment the emission spectra of the samples were collected from 280 to 600 nm wavelengths at 3 nm increment with over 0 1 s of integration time the sample eems were corrected for blanks raleigh scattering removal inner filter effects and raman normalization before calculating optical indices and parallel factor analysis parafac modeling mcknight et al 2001 murphy et al 2010 ft ir used to determine structural moieties characteristic of the samples was analyzed using a thermo scientific nicolet is5 usa with a dtgs kbr detector and a liquid pool recording in the 4000 to 400 cm 1 wavenumber range 2 5 parafac modeling eem parafac is a powerful tool to decompose the dom fluorescence signature into different pools yang et al 2014 a parafac model was developed using eems from 99 samples in the biodegradation 48 samples photodegradation 27 samples and photo biodegradation experiments 24 samples using the dom fluor toolbox in matlab stedmon and bro 2008 the duplicates were not used for the parafac modeling because they can artificially increase the sample size and the power of the statistical validation test after the parafac modeling the model validation was carried out using split half analysis both three and four component models were validated then the number of components was determined by examination of the residuals from models with a gradually increasing number of components the residual of the four component model results was smaller than the three component one the eems of the four components were uploaded to the openfluor database http www openfluor org and matched with documented ones murphy et al 2014 finally a four component parafac model was determined the scores of four parafac components were expressed with their fluorescence intensity maximum f max in raman units r u 2 6 absorption and fluorescence indices various spectroscopy indices derived from the absorbance and fluorescence spectra can provide additional information of dom characteristics such as molecular weight aromatic content freshness etc helms et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 weishaar et al 2003 sankar et al 2019 in this study six absorption and fluorescence indices including a355 specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 spectral slope ratio sr fluorescence index fi biological index bix and humification index hix were calculated to probe the changes in compositional and property of efom in the incubation experiments specifically a355 was the uv absorbance measured at 355 nm suva254 was determined by dividing the uv absorbance measured at 254 nm by the doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 sr was calculated by dividing s from 275 to 295 nm s275 295 by s from 350 to 400 nm s350 400 helms et al 2008 where s was determined using the non linear regression of absorption spectra fi was calculated by taking the ratio of emission wavelengths at 470 nm and 520 nm acquired at excitation wavelength 370 nm cory and mcknight 2005 bix was determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength 380 nm by that at 430 nm at excitation wavelength 255 nm huguet et al 2009 hix was determined as the ratio of the average fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength from 435 to 480 nm divided by the average intensity from 300 to 345 nm at excitation wavelength 255 nm zsolnay et al 1999 2 7 microbial do consumption in biodegradation and photo biodegradation to test the effect of the efom photodegradation on its microbial do consumption rate as another measure of biodegradability the do consumptions during the biodegradation and photo biodegradation incubation were measured along with the biodegradation experiment another aliquot of the inoculated effluent sample was transferred to a borosilicate glass bottle with a do probe plugged into the cork cap to measure the do consumption during the biodegradation incubation the bottle was sealed with no airspace wrapped with aluminum foil and placed in an environment controlled at 25 c for 7 days the do concentration of the samples was measured hourly by the wtw muli 3510ids probe when the do level dropped below 4 mg l aeration was used to increase the do level but efforts were made to ensure that such levels did not exceed 7 mg l to avoid oversaturation the same procedure was conducted with another aliquot in the photo biodegradation incubation 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of efom during biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation 3 1 1 doc and uv visible spectroscopy temporal variation of doc and a355 during the biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation experiments was shown in fig 2 during the biodegradation experiment the doc concentration decreased slowly by 5 3 after 14 days of incubation fig 2 in contrast during the photodegradation experiment the doc concentration decreased by 26 6 from 6 16 0 06 mg l 1 at day 0 to 4 44 0 02 mg l 1 at day 7 fig 2 during the photo biodegradation process the doc concentration further decreased by 37 5 to 2 17 0 11 mg l 1 at day 14 the largest decrease occurred on the first day of the photo biodegradation experiment for the a355 a proxy of chromophoric dom concentration their values increased slightly after the biodegradation and photo biodegradation however the a355 value decreased by 46 2 in the photodegradation experiment which was larger than that of doc 3 1 2 parafac components for the detected water samples a total of four different parafac components c1 c2 c3 c4 were determined see supporting information fig s2 among the four fluorescent components two were protein like c1 276 301 nm and c3 294 370 nm components and the other two c2 315 460 nm and c4 275 357 529 nm were humic like components all components identified in this study have been reported in previous parafac models and three components c1 c2 and c3 have been matched similarity score 0 95 in the openfluor database see supporting information table s1 murphy et al 2014 temporal variations of the identified four components were demonstrated in fig 3 during the biodegradation experiment the fluorescence intensities of parafac components did not follow any regular patterns except c4 local fluctuations in intensities were observed throughout the experiments the f m a x of c4 showed a decreasing trend in the biodegradation experiment in contrast during the photodegradation experiment the f m a x for all the components showed a significant decrease from day 0 to day 7 fig 3 the f m a x loss percentages of the humic like components were larger than those of the protein like ones the f m a x of humic like c2 and c4 decreased by 95 5 and 96 7 respectively while the f m a x of protein like c1 and c3 decreased by 91 9 and 70 7 respectively the sum of f m a x of each component dropped significantly by 88 3 in the photodegradation much higher than those of a355 46 2 and doc 26 6 during the photo biodegradation experiment the f m a x for all the components had a significant change on the first day of the incubation from day 7 to day 8 and showed little change in the latter course fig 3 among the four components only the f m a x of the tryptophan like c3 component decreased by 28 3 in the biodegradation process after the photodegradation the f m a x of the tyrosine like c1 component showed an increase of 288 9 the humic like components both showed significant increasing trends the f m a x of c2 increased by 322 the maximum increase in f m a x was observed for c4 348 during the incubation 3 1 3 absorbance and fluorescence indices temporal variations of absorbance and fluorescence indices including suva254 sr fi bix and hix during biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation experiments were shown in fig 4 in the biodegradation experiment all the indices showed no significant change trend this is also consistent with the behaviors of doc and fluorescent components in the same experiment fig 2 and fig 3 in the photodegradation experiment the suva254 value a measure of aromaticity decreased by 25 2 after 7 days of sunlight exposure fig 4 sr a measure of molecule weight showed an increasing trend rising from 0 81 0 01 at day 0 to 3 36 0 40 at day 7 fi a measure of distinguishing dom derived from terrestrial sources vs microbial sources increased by 8 8 times from 0 41 0 21 to 3 99 0 12 gradually hix a measure of humification decreased by 35 7 from 1 27 0 30 to 0 82 0 26 while bix a measure of freshness increased by 246 from 1 05 0 04 to 3 63 0 01 these results proved that efom tended to reduce molecular weight and become less humic and terrestrial derived with sunlight exposure besides extra dom was freshly generated during the exposure as photoproducts in the photo biodegradation experiment all the indices had the most significant change on the first day of the experiment suva254 value increased 201 from day 7 to day 8 and finally increased by 111 at day 14 hix value showed a slight increase while sr fi and bix values decreased during the photo biodegradation experiment the characteristics of dom all changed in the opposite trend to the results of the photodegradation experiment 3 1 4 ft ir spectroscopy and signal intensity variation the ft ir spectra obtained from the wwtp effluent sample and the samples after the photodegradation and photo biodegradation were presented in fig 5 ir signal peaks occurred at 3450 2917 1636 1388 1129 870 and 605 cm 1 respectively these peaks are associated with functional groups of oh stretching of phenols 3450 cm 1 ch stretching of aliphatics 2917 cm 1 c o stretching of carboxylates 1636 cm 1 coo symmetric stretching of carboxylic acid 1388 cm 1 co asymmetric stretching of carbohydrates 1129 cm 1 substituted aromatics 870 cm 1 c br stretching modes of bromides 605 cm 1 respectively bellamy 1975 see table 1 carboxylate like and phenol like dom showed the highest peak values and accounted for the main functional groups of efom after 7 day sunlight exposure the peak intensities of all the ir signals decreased the two maximum intensity decreases were 0 08 for oh stretching of phenols and 0 05 for coo symmetric stretching of carboxylic acid the maximum percentage decrease was 38 for co asymmetric stretching of carbohydrates besides the decrease of brominated compounds showed the photodegradation of the disinfection by products in the effluent as seen in table 1 in the photo biodegradation process 30 of the coo symmetric stretching of carboxylic acid after sunlight exposure was further degraded the magnitude of degradation was even larger than that in the photodegradation experiment besides during the photo biodegradation process ch stretching of aliphatics and aromatic substances were detected to be generated through microbial metabolisms the intensities of the two functional groups increase by 25 and 33 during the photo biodegradation 3 1 5 degradation kinetics of doc and fluorescent components based on the time series experimental results the degradation rates of doc a355 and fluorescent components were also determined it was found the first order reaction kinetics could fit well with the measured time series data with the decaying rate of d 1 the determined reaction rate and half life of efom are provided in table 2 table 2 shows in the biodegradation experiment only doc concentration and the intensities of the humic like component c4 in the efom showed a significant first order decrease rate the doc showed a slow degradation rate of 0 004 0 001 d 1 and its corresponding half life was 155 32 days during the biodegradation the components c1 and c4 had degradation rates of 0 005 0 004 d 1 and 0 049 0 016 d 1 respectively in the photodegradation experiment the first order degradation rate of doc was 0 053 0 011 d 1 and the half life period was 13 0 2 6 days during the photodegradation process a355 and all the four fluorescent components had faster degradation rates and a shorter half life than doc the two humic like components c2 and c4 had the fastest photodegradation rates of 0 440 0 020 d 1 and 0 496 0 084 d 1 respectively next the two protein like components c1 and c3 had photodegradation rates of 0 282 0 072 and 0 180 0 023 d 1 the degradation rate of a355 was 0 106 0 038 d 1 between those of doc and the fluorescent components in the photo biodegradation experiment the first order degradation rate of doc was 0 065 0 043 d 1 and the half life period was 10 6 7 0 days among all components only the intensity of tryptophan like component c3 decreased the degradation rate of c3 was 0 033 0 021 d 1 compared with the results of the direct biodegradation the doc degradation rate was significantly accelerated in the photo biodegradation experiment 3 2 behavior of efom during biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation 3 2 1 biodegradability of efom the biodegradability of efom is often characterized by the ratio of the doc fractions remaining after incubation defined as refractory doc to total doc r doc doc servais et al 1999 lai et al 2011 reported that the r doc doc values of the effluents in five wwtp averaged 82 ranging from 67 91 hur et al 2011b found that the ratio value range of 15 wwtp effluents was wider with the highest close to 100 and the lowest less than 40 the difference in r doc doc values in effluents is affected by various conditions such as types of influent and operational systems in this study the doc concentration decreased by 5 3 after the 14 day direct biodegradation experiment which means that more than 90 of the efom after the tertiary treatment was biorefractory correspondingly the r doc doc value of this study was at a high level in the reported range hur et al 2011b lai et al 2011 indicating the highly biorefractory characteristic of the efom in the wangtang wwtp our biodegradation experiment results of the slow doc degradation rate 0 004 0 001 d 1 and the long half life 155 32 day also confirmed its biorefractory characteristic as a useful proxy for dom aromatic content our suva254 value of 3 18 0 19 l mgc 1 m 1 from the effluent was within the reported range for efom in previous studies hur et al 2011b o connor et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the high suva254 value indicated the high aromaticity of efom in the wangtang wwtp which could be caused by the accumulation of aromatic substances and the preferential use of non aromatic compounds in the biological wastewater treatment process esparza soto et al 2011 hur et al 2011b as an indicator inversely related to molecular weight mw our sr value of 0 84 0 13 fell in the lower range of the reported values helms et al 2013 the low sr value indicated the high mw of efom in the wangtang wwtp this can be explained by the microbial uptake of lower mw fractions and the formation of soluble microbial products smps in the biological wastewater treatment system esparza soto et al 2011 imai et al 2002 besides smp the efom from activated sludge systems is also composed of influent refractory compounds residual degradable substrate and intermediate products barker and stuckey 1999 for the identified fluorescence components c4 represented the terrestrial humic like compounds which could be originated from the influent refractory compounds murphy et al 2011 the existence of fluorescence component c2 was a proof of microbial derived dom in the wwtp effluent e g smps protein like components were usually considered as readily biodegradable however tyrosine like component c1 and tryptophan like component c3 of the efom remained little change in the biodegradation tryptophan like components were widely reported to be associated with bio labile organic matters and can be used as a proxy of bod in wastewaters goffin et al 2018 hudson et al 2008 the bio refractory behavior of c3 in our effluent indicates that the biodegradability of dom characterized by specific fluorescence components was case dependent it cannot be concluded by their commonly reported properties because each fluorescence component represents a heterogeneous mixture of organic substances yang et al 2015 therefore the efom of wangtang wwtp showed the characteristics of high aromaticity high mw and mainly microbial derived these characteristics of the efom determined its non biodegradability which was also supported by our biodegradation experiment results 3 2 2 photodegradation of efom our results showed the efom was photodegraded to a much greater extent and with a faster degradation rate than biodegraded figs 2 and 3 which suggests that efom is more photo labile than bio labile also the degradation extents and rates of the chromophoric and fluorescent fractions were faster than that of doc table 2 these results indicated that chromophores and fluorophores of efom were more susceptible to photodegradation than gross doc which is consistent with the findings in many other studies moran and sheldon 2000 ward and cory 2020 yang et al 2014 the higher loss of chromophores and fluorophores than doc also implies that sunlight irradiation caused more photo bleaching of efom than photo mineralization the photodegradation resulted in the formation of compounds that while still part of the dom pool no longer absorb light to the same extent as the parent material similar conclusions were also found in other photodegradation experiments on efom yang et al 2014 reported a much higher fraction of efom by photo bleaching 45 59 than photo mineralization 15 after sunlight exposure zhang et al 2019 found almost no photo mineralization of the efom but over 50 loss of fluorescent fraction with illumination compared with photo mineralization photo bleaching has a more significant impact on instream microbial metabolism because it changes dom chemical composition and generates photoproducts with different bio availability than the parent compounds ward and cory 2016 ward et al 2017 compositional change of efom after the sunlight exposure was also revealed by fluorescence and ft ir spectral results 95 5 and 96 7 of humic like components c2 and c4 were photodegraded while 91 9 and 70 7 of protein like components c1 and c3 were photodegraded the humic like components also showed faster degradation rates than the two protein like components these results suggest that the humic like substances were more photoreactive than the protein like ones consistent with previous findings of various samples helms et al 2013 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 the decreased intensities of the humic components together with the decreased hix values indicate the reduced degree of humification of efom after the photodegradation in addition the functional groups associated with humic like substances such as phenolic and carboxylic groups were found to be photodegraded with the largest ir signal decreases among all detected groups table 2 previous studies suggested that phenolic groups within the dom pool may quench reactive oxygen species and thereby suppress photodegradation ward and cory 2016 however the considerable reduction of doc and humic like substances in our study suggested the destruction of this quenching effect the phenolics in the efom did not prevent photodegradation carboxylic groups have been proposed to be photo mineralized to inorganic carbon or converted to less reactive groups such as ester ward and cory 2016 2020 zhang et al 2019 found that the carboxylic groups in their efom were partially photo oxidized instead of photo mineralized due to the unchanged doc concentrations and increased content esters with illumination in our study the substantial doc loss and no formation of ester groups after irradiation indicated that photodecarboxylation could account for the efom photo mineralization besides the carboxylic and phenolic groups the aromatics were also associated with the humic like substances and photodegraded the photodegradation of conjugated aromatic rings resulted in decreased efom average mw and aromaticity as indicated by increasing sr and decreasing suva254 values with exposure amide group rings mainly derived from protein like compounds thereby the photodegraded amide groups were ascribed to the photodegradation of the protein like compounds in addition the carbohydrates and aliphatics in the efom were also destroyed with sunlight exposure based on the above discussions the compositional changes in the efom from wangtang wwtp after sunlight exposure indicate the degradation of larger more aromatic higher humified photoreactive compounds into smaller less aromatic lower humified more bleached ones their photoproducts have therefore become bio labile and could serve as a source of microbial substrates 3 2 3 coupled photochemical and biological degradation of efom numerous studies have focused on the photodegradation of nom in natural waters and the induced compositional changes bowen et al 2020 moran and sheldon 2000 sankar et al 2019 by selectively removing or damaging the chromophores and yielding biodegradable compounds photodegradation plays an important role in shaping the microbial utilization of dom cory and kling 2018 ward et al 2017 in our study in the complete absence of sunlight microorganisms in the receiving waterbody can only use 5 3 of the efom however the originally bio refractory efom became bio available after exposure to sunlight after natural sunlight exposure the doc concentration further decreased by 37 5 in the photo biodegradation thus the overall decrease in doc concentration of efom reached 64 2 through the coupled photochemical and biological degradation also the degradation rate in the photo biodegradation 0 065 0 043 d 1 was significantly enhanced compared with that in the biodegradation 0 004 0 001 d 1 this suggests that the photoproducts can be readily used by the microbial microorganisms from the receiving river our findings prove that sunlight changes the composition of efom and can promote further microbial utilization of efom through coupled photochemical and biological degradation another interesting phenomenon is that all the efom indicators had the most significant changes on the first day of the photo biodegradation as the effluent samples were inoculated with the native microbial communities in the receiving river the rapid response showed that the microbes could directly metabolize the photo altered efom even without an acclimation period ward et al 2017 suggested that whether sunlight stimulates microbial metabolism depends on whether the native microbial communities adapt to the photoproducts our results revealed that the native microbial communities in the receiving river were adapted to the photoproducts of efom further such coupled photodegradation and biodegradation processes were prevailing in the river receiving wangtang wwtp effluent during the photo biodegradation a355 increased despite decreased doc concentration this indicates that the microorganisms used non absorbing materials and generated light absorbing materials during the incubation the intensities of two humic like c2 and c4 components also increased significantly indicating that the microorganisms produced humic substances in this process evidence suggests that microbial degradation of dom can lead to the formation and enrichment of higher mw fulvic and humic acids with higher aromatic contents hansen et al 2016 hur et al 2011a among the fluorescence components only the tryptophan like c3 decreased significantly like doc this implies that the organic substances characterized by fluorescence component c3 experienced structural changes and became bio labile after exposure to sunlight the change in its biodegradability before and after sun exposure implies again that the properties of dom characterized by the same fluorescence component can be case dependent measured by ft ir spectra aliphatics and aromatics were detected to be formed during the photo biodegradationhur et al 2011a sankar et al 2019 the generation of aromatics supported the increase in the absorbance and suva254 values in the course the decrease in sr and the increase in suva254 and hix suggested greater production of high mw humified and aromatic dom in the photo biodegradation in contrast with the photodegradation all the optical indices in the photo biodegradation changed in opposite directions our findings are in line with that biodegradation typically leads to the rapid loss of labile and low mw material and it can also be accompanied by the production of high mw and aromatic material through alteration of existing compounds and production of new compounds by heterotrophs bowen et al 2020 moran and zepp 1997 sankar et al 2019 nevertheless the net change in doc concentrations and fluorescence showed still significant decrease after the coupled photochemical and biological reactions based on the above discussion the biodegradability of efom after sunlight exposure was significantly enhanced the native microbes could readily use the low mw bleached efom photoproducts for their metabolisms during the microbial metabolism they produced aromatic substances and synthesized humic like materials this leads to changes in the properties of efom into higher aromaticity higher mw and increased degree of humification 3 3 accelerated microbial do consumption in the photo biodegradation fig 6 provided accumulated do consumption during the biodegradation and photo biodegradation experiments in the direct biodegradation experiment the efom consumed a small amount of do with a zero order rate of 0 11 mg l 1 d 1 in comparison in the biodegradation experiment after sunlight exposure the efom consumed do rapidly with a zero order rate of 2 17 mg l 1 d 1 compared with the direct biodegradation results the do consumption rate was significantly accelerated in the biodegradation experiment after sunlight exposure the accelerated do consumption rate of efom in the photo biodegradation was associated with the enhanced biodegradability after the sunlight exposure the increased rate of do consumption of efom through the coupled photochemical and biological degradation was also reported for the thawing permafrost soil and temperate stream water samples ward and cory 2016 2020 ward et al 2017 our previous study reported the fast oxygen depletion phenomenon in the nanfei river receiving the wangtang wwtp effluent as its dominant water source huang et al 2017 the accelerated oxygen consumption through the coupled photochemical and biological degradation of efom found in this study could explain this phenomenon in the nanfei river in the past the impacts of the effluent discharge after tertiary treatment on instream oxygen consumption were often overlooked because the biodegradability of the effluent was often believed to be low in receiving waters our findings highlight that due to the coupled processes the effluent discharge even after tertiary treatment would still cause potential risks of accelerating microbial oxygen consumption in receiving waters especially in the river reaches with longer water travel time and exposure to abundant sunlight 3 4 environmental implications in today s highly urbanized world treated wwtp effluents have become a supplementary water source to urban rivers hamdhani et al 2020 many urban rivers are even dominated by wwtp effluents hamdhani et al 2020 although the bod concentration in the effluent especially after advanced tertiary treatment is often low sometimes 5 mg l the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration can reach 20 50 mg l wang and chen 2018 indicating that the effluent still contains a lot of organic matters thus efom can be an important source of dom in the receiving waters open canopy rivers offer a natural reactor for post wwtp advanced treatment of efom where the efom undergoes coupled photochemical and biological degradation processes after being discharged into the river the coupled processes of efom are vital for an understanding of the efom fate in the receiving waters which has not been thoroughly studied to date besides the coupled processes of efom may affect microbial composition and metabolism and have considerable implications for aspects of instream carbon and nutrient cycling in addition the fate of the highly toxic and biorefractory organic compounds such as endocrine disrupting compounds pharmaceuticals and personal care products discharged by effluent may be influenced by the coupled processes these hypotheses should be explicitly tested in future work therefore the coupled processes of efom should be increasingly incorporated into experimental frameworks to accurately estimate their role in driving biogeochemical processes in receiving waters a systematic analysis of efom transformations in receiving waters considering the coupled photochemical and biological degradation is thereby strongly suggested with this knowledge the water manager can take the ubiquitous coupled processes of efom and their potential effects on biogeochemistry in receiving waters into account when implementing wwtp effluent discharge permits and considering wastewater treatment approaches for example advanced effluent treatment with long uv irradiation time can be recommended for the sake of environmental and ecological targets in receiving waters 4 conclusions this study proves that photodegradation of efom enhances its biodegradability in receiving waters without sunlight exposure the efom measuring by doc was microbially degraded at the rate of 0 004 d 1 by only 5 3 after 14 day incubation in contrast after sunlight exposure the rest of efom was further microbially degraded at the rate of 0 065 d 1 and by 37 5 correspondingly the microbial oxygen consumption rate of efom could increase from 0 11 mgo l 1 d 1 before sunlight exposure to 2 17 mgo l 1 d 1 after sunlight exposure the change in the biodegradability of efom after sunlight exposure can be explained by the altered composition and properties in the photodegradation absorbance fluorescence with eem parafac technique and ft ir spectra were applied to evaluate the efom compositional and characteristic change the higher loss percentages of chromophores 46 2 and fluorophores 88 3 than doc 22 6 suggest that sunlight irradiation caused more photo transformation of efom than photo mineralization the parafac humic like and protein like components were prone to photodegradation which is also supported by the decreased ir signal peaks of associated functional groups i e phenolic carboxylic aromatics and amide increasing sr and decreasing suva254 values indicates decreased mw and aromaticity of efom in the photodegradation the rapid response of the native microbial communities in the receiving waterbody to the efom on the first day of incubation after the photodegradation showed that they were adapted to the photoproducts as their substrates and readily metabolized the photo altered efom in the end through the coupled photochemical and biological degradations the doc concentration of efom was reduced by 64 2 findings from this study strongly suggest that coupled photochemical and biological processes of discharged efom should be considered to understand its fate in receiving waters and better manage wastewater effluent

16632,effluent organic matter efom from wastewater treatment plants wwtp constitutes an important source of dissolved organic matter in receiving waters photodegradation may alter the properties of wwtp efom thereby impacting its biodegradability and microbial respiration however whether and how natural sunlight exposure of efom affects its biodegradability and microbial oxygen consumption in the receiving waters are unclear to address these knowledge gaps incubation experiments of biodegradation photodegradation and bio photodegradation were conducted with the effluent samples from a tertiary wwtp in heifei china the quantity and quality of the efom were examined during the incubations to interpret changes in its lability and composition the results showed that photodegradation facilitated and accelerated the efom biodegradation after natural sunlight exposure the efom degradation rate was significantly enhanced from 0 004 d 1 to 0 065 d 1 measured by dissolved organic carbon doc correspondingly the doc concentration of efom was reduced by 64 2 26 6 by photodegradation and 37 5 by bio photodegradation while the concentration was only reduced by 5 3 in the direct biodegradation sunlight exposure of efom resulted in lower molecular weight less aromatic lower humified more bleached photoproducts these substances could be readily metabolized by the native microbial community in the receiving water stimulating microbial respiration correspondingly the oxygen consumption rate of efom increased from almost 0 11 mg l 1 d 1 in the direct biodegradation to 2 17 mg l 1 d 1 in the bio photodegradation this study highlights that after efom is discharged to the receiving water its post processing by sunlight can enhance biodegradability the existence of the coupled photochemical and biological process is suggested to be considered when determining efom fate and managing effluent discharge in receiving waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter photodegradation biodegradability wastewater treatment plant effluent 1 introduction with the increasing urbanization and proportion of sewage collection and treatment the contribution of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent to urban river discharge is increasing in some riverine systems effluent already dominates the flow hamdhani et al 2020 huang et al 2019 despite pollutants largely removed through secondary or tertiary treatment wwtp effluent still can be an important source of dissolved organic matter dom in the receiving waters o connor et al 2019 yang et al 2014 effluent organic matter efom contains considerable soluble microbial products smps derived during biological processes of wastewater treatment which is commonly accepted to be bio refractory compounds shon et al 2006 wang and chen 2018 therefore despite an important source of organic matter its discharge may not cause fast microbial degradation and dissolved oxygen do depletion in the receiving waters however fast oxygen depletion and hypoxia were still found in an urban river dominated by wwtp effluent after advanced treatment huang et al 2017 this phenomenon drives the motivation to investigate the mechanism of the altered biodegradability of efom in the receiving water body which may be particularly important in understanding the fate of efom in receiving waters efom discharged into the receiving waters is bound to exposure to sunlight and microorganism like natural organic matter nom evidence suggests that photochemical processing of nom is a major control of its biodegradability in many aquatic systems bowen et al 2020 moran and zepp 1997 ward et al 2017 the net effects of photodegradation on nom biodegradability were generally positive lu et al 2013 moran and sheldon 2000 sankar et al 2019 for example sankar et al 2019 found consistently larger decreases in dissolved organic carbon doc concentration for the coupled photochemical and biological degradation than only biodegradation in five watersheds with diverse types of land use and land cover nevertheless ward et al 2017 found that sunlight exposure of doc draining the thawed soil layer caused a decrease in biodegradable doc efom is likely to have different properties than the nom present in receiving waters nam and amy 2008 the effect of photodegradation on efom biodegradability remains poorly investigated evidence shows that efom is susceptible to be photodegraded in receiving waters o connor et al 2019 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 one recent study found that photoreactions would improve the bioavailability of efom to native microbes in the receiving water wang et al 2021 more studies are needed to investigate the effect of photodegradation on efom biodegradability and if there is a positive effect the extent and rate of efom degradation through the coupled photochemical and biological processes understanding the effect of photodegradation on dom biodegradation requires knowledge of how sunlight alters the composition and properties of dom many studies address that photodegradation transformation of dom in natural waters can lead to low molecular weight photo bleached and much simpler bio labile photoproducts such as acetate and formaldehyde which can enhance dom biodegradability and stimulate microbial activity moran and zepp 1997 on the other hand recent works showed that sunlight could also convert bioavailable dom to bio recalcitrant compounds such as carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules through partial photo oxidation ward and cory 2016 for efom the changes in its composition and properties during the photodegradation and their causal relationship with changes in the biodegradability of efom after the photodegradation remains poorly understood thus the primary aim of this study is to understand the effect of efom photodegradation on its biodegradability specifically the objectives are to answer two questions 1 does photodegradation of efom enhance its biodegradability in receiving waters 2 how does photodegradation of efom alter its composition and properties and further controls its biodegradation by microbes in receiving waters finally the findings provide new insights into the fate of efom through the coupled photochemical and biological degradation and offer environmental implications on effluent discharge in the receiving waters 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description the study site is the nanfei river flowing through heifei city the capital of anhui province china fig 1 as the largest in lake tributary this river finally flows into chaohu lake china s fifth largest freshwater lake upstream of nanfei river there is no freshwater inflow and it is mainly fed by wangtang wwtp effluent of 200 000 m3 d see fig 1 the wangtang wwtp adopts advanced tertiary treatment using the anaerobic anoxic oxic process with a nitrification denitrification unit uv is used to disinfect the effluent the treatment process removes over 80 of chemical oxygen demand cod 95 of 5 day biological oxygen demand bod5 85 of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n 70 of total nitrogen tn and 90 of total phosphorus tp from the influent the water quality of the effluent meets the 1 a grade of china s wwtp effluent discharge standard environmental protection agency of china 2002 the average annual cod bod5 nh3 n tn and tp concentrations in the effluent are less than 40 mg l 5 mg l 1 mg l 10 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively the wangtang wwtp discharges its effluent to the nanfei river accounting for over 75 of the flow in its urban reach under dry weather conditions huang et al 2016 despite receiving the tertiary effluent rapid do depletion was reported to occur in the urban reach of nanfei river downstream of the wangtang wwtp huang et al 2017 2 2 sample preparation the effluent samples 30 l were collected in august 2019 from the outlet of wangtang wwtp over the course of the sampling period the river water 10 l was sampled 500 m downstream of the effluent outlet in the nanfei river on the same days as the effluent was collected fig 1 all samples were sealed and transported back to the laboratory in polyethylene containers the effluent samples were filtered using 0 22 μ m membrane filters anpel gf f to remove suspended particles and bacteria the river water samples were not filtered because they were used for the inoculums of native microbial communities both types of samples were stored in pre washed preheated amber glass bottles wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent light exposure and refrigerated at 4 c before each incubation experiment 2 3 experimental design to investigate the biodegradability photodegradability and the effect of photodegradation on the biodegradability of efom three sets of incubation experiments were designed as described below biodegradation experiment aliquots were prepared by dispersing 15 ml of unfiltered river water sample inoculum in 250 ml of filtered effluent sample each in the ratio of 6 1 v v the aliquots were transferred to borosilicate glass bottles foil wrapped and placed into an incubator with a constant temperature of 25 c for 14 days one bottle of the sample was taken out from the incubator every evening at 18 00 in the incubation period the samples taken out were then filtered using 0 22 μ m membrane filters anpel gf f stored under refrigeration and measured together within 1 week after the incubation besides one aliquot was added by 15 ml of milli q water to serve as a control sample altogether three parallel experiments were conducted photodegradation experiment aliquots of the filtered effluent samples 250 ml each were transferred to quartz bottles the samples were exposed to natural sunlight for 7 days with 10 h per day 8 00 to 18 00 alongside a dark control foil wrapped on the unshaded roof of a building on the campus of tongji university the sunlight irradiance was measured using a tes 1339r rs 232 light meter taiwan china at a 3 minute interval see supporting information figure s1 one bottle of the sample was taken out every evening at 18 00 in the incubation period and then stored in the dark at 4 c all samples were analyzed within 1 week after the incubation like the biodegradation experiment three parallel experiments were performed photo biodegradation experiment another set of effluent sample aliquots 250 ml each alongside the sample aliquots in the photodegradation experiment were first exposed to natural sunlight for a full 7 days afterward they were inoculated and placed into the incubator foil wrapped at 25 c for the 7 day photo biodegradation incubation alongside a non inoculated control as described in the biodegradation experiment the daily sample was taken filtered stored and analyzed as was the case for the above two scenarios three parallel experiments were performed 2 4 analytical methods doc concentration is a straightforward measure to probe the quantitative changes in efom apart from direct measurement of doc uv visible and fluorescence spectra have also been widely used to characterize the composition origin and biogeochemical role of efom because of their accuracy rapidity and simplicity wang et al 2021 yang et al 2014 besides fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir is a technique that can quantify various functional groups in dom and provide additional information about the various types of carboxylic that cannot be distinguished using uv visible and fluorescence spectra zhang et al 2019 therefore doc concentration uv visible fluorescence and infrared spectra were analyzed respectively to probe behaviors of the collected samples during the biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation the doc concentration of the samples was measured by high temperature catalytic combustion using a shimadzu toc l carbon analyzer the uv visible absorption characteristics of the samples were analyzed using a shimadzu uv 2000 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette the spectra were collected between 200 and 650 nm wavelengths at the 1 nm interval the blank subtracted sample values were used to remove the effect of water and scattering the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra of the samples were analyzed in a horiba jobin yvon inc fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer edison nj usa the eem spectra for each sample were recorded with excitation wavelengths ranging from 240 to 400 nm at a 3 nm increment the emission spectra of the samples were collected from 280 to 600 nm wavelengths at 3 nm increment with over 0 1 s of integration time the sample eems were corrected for blanks raleigh scattering removal inner filter effects and raman normalization before calculating optical indices and parallel factor analysis parafac modeling mcknight et al 2001 murphy et al 2010 ft ir used to determine structural moieties characteristic of the samples was analyzed using a thermo scientific nicolet is5 usa with a dtgs kbr detector and a liquid pool recording in the 4000 to 400 cm 1 wavenumber range 2 5 parafac modeling eem parafac is a powerful tool to decompose the dom fluorescence signature into different pools yang et al 2014 a parafac model was developed using eems from 99 samples in the biodegradation 48 samples photodegradation 27 samples and photo biodegradation experiments 24 samples using the dom fluor toolbox in matlab stedmon and bro 2008 the duplicates were not used for the parafac modeling because they can artificially increase the sample size and the power of the statistical validation test after the parafac modeling the model validation was carried out using split half analysis both three and four component models were validated then the number of components was determined by examination of the residuals from models with a gradually increasing number of components the residual of the four component model results was smaller than the three component one the eems of the four components were uploaded to the openfluor database http www openfluor org and matched with documented ones murphy et al 2014 finally a four component parafac model was determined the scores of four parafac components were expressed with their fluorescence intensity maximum f max in raman units r u 2 6 absorption and fluorescence indices various spectroscopy indices derived from the absorbance and fluorescence spectra can provide additional information of dom characteristics such as molecular weight aromatic content freshness etc helms et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 weishaar et al 2003 sankar et al 2019 in this study six absorption and fluorescence indices including a355 specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 spectral slope ratio sr fluorescence index fi biological index bix and humification index hix were calculated to probe the changes in compositional and property of efom in the incubation experiments specifically a355 was the uv absorbance measured at 355 nm suva254 was determined by dividing the uv absorbance measured at 254 nm by the doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 sr was calculated by dividing s from 275 to 295 nm s275 295 by s from 350 to 400 nm s350 400 helms et al 2008 where s was determined using the non linear regression of absorption spectra fi was calculated by taking the ratio of emission wavelengths at 470 nm and 520 nm acquired at excitation wavelength 370 nm cory and mcknight 2005 bix was determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength 380 nm by that at 430 nm at excitation wavelength 255 nm huguet et al 2009 hix was determined as the ratio of the average fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength from 435 to 480 nm divided by the average intensity from 300 to 345 nm at excitation wavelength 255 nm zsolnay et al 1999 2 7 microbial do consumption in biodegradation and photo biodegradation to test the effect of the efom photodegradation on its microbial do consumption rate as another measure of biodegradability the do consumptions during the biodegradation and photo biodegradation incubation were measured along with the biodegradation experiment another aliquot of the inoculated effluent sample was transferred to a borosilicate glass bottle with a do probe plugged into the cork cap to measure the do consumption during the biodegradation incubation the bottle was sealed with no airspace wrapped with aluminum foil and placed in an environment controlled at 25 c for 7 days the do concentration of the samples was measured hourly by the wtw muli 3510ids probe when the do level dropped below 4 mg l aeration was used to increase the do level but efforts were made to ensure that such levels did not exceed 7 mg l to avoid oversaturation the same procedure was conducted with another aliquot in the photo biodegradation incubation 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of efom during biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation 3 1 1 doc and uv visible spectroscopy temporal variation of doc and a355 during the biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation experiments was shown in fig 2 during the biodegradation experiment the doc concentration decreased slowly by 5 3 after 14 days of incubation fig 2 in contrast during the photodegradation experiment the doc concentration decreased by 26 6 from 6 16 0 06 mg l 1 at day 0 to 4 44 0 02 mg l 1 at day 7 fig 2 during the photo biodegradation process the doc concentration further decreased by 37 5 to 2 17 0 11 mg l 1 at day 14 the largest decrease occurred on the first day of the photo biodegradation experiment for the a355 a proxy of chromophoric dom concentration their values increased slightly after the biodegradation and photo biodegradation however the a355 value decreased by 46 2 in the photodegradation experiment which was larger than that of doc 3 1 2 parafac components for the detected water samples a total of four different parafac components c1 c2 c3 c4 were determined see supporting information fig s2 among the four fluorescent components two were protein like c1 276 301 nm and c3 294 370 nm components and the other two c2 315 460 nm and c4 275 357 529 nm were humic like components all components identified in this study have been reported in previous parafac models and three components c1 c2 and c3 have been matched similarity score 0 95 in the openfluor database see supporting information table s1 murphy et al 2014 temporal variations of the identified four components were demonstrated in fig 3 during the biodegradation experiment the fluorescence intensities of parafac components did not follow any regular patterns except c4 local fluctuations in intensities were observed throughout the experiments the f m a x of c4 showed a decreasing trend in the biodegradation experiment in contrast during the photodegradation experiment the f m a x for all the components showed a significant decrease from day 0 to day 7 fig 3 the f m a x loss percentages of the humic like components were larger than those of the protein like ones the f m a x of humic like c2 and c4 decreased by 95 5 and 96 7 respectively while the f m a x of protein like c1 and c3 decreased by 91 9 and 70 7 respectively the sum of f m a x of each component dropped significantly by 88 3 in the photodegradation much higher than those of a355 46 2 and doc 26 6 during the photo biodegradation experiment the f m a x for all the components had a significant change on the first day of the incubation from day 7 to day 8 and showed little change in the latter course fig 3 among the four components only the f m a x of the tryptophan like c3 component decreased by 28 3 in the biodegradation process after the photodegradation the f m a x of the tyrosine like c1 component showed an increase of 288 9 the humic like components both showed significant increasing trends the f m a x of c2 increased by 322 the maximum increase in f m a x was observed for c4 348 during the incubation 3 1 3 absorbance and fluorescence indices temporal variations of absorbance and fluorescence indices including suva254 sr fi bix and hix during biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation experiments were shown in fig 4 in the biodegradation experiment all the indices showed no significant change trend this is also consistent with the behaviors of doc and fluorescent components in the same experiment fig 2 and fig 3 in the photodegradation experiment the suva254 value a measure of aromaticity decreased by 25 2 after 7 days of sunlight exposure fig 4 sr a measure of molecule weight showed an increasing trend rising from 0 81 0 01 at day 0 to 3 36 0 40 at day 7 fi a measure of distinguishing dom derived from terrestrial sources vs microbial sources increased by 8 8 times from 0 41 0 21 to 3 99 0 12 gradually hix a measure of humification decreased by 35 7 from 1 27 0 30 to 0 82 0 26 while bix a measure of freshness increased by 246 from 1 05 0 04 to 3 63 0 01 these results proved that efom tended to reduce molecular weight and become less humic and terrestrial derived with sunlight exposure besides extra dom was freshly generated during the exposure as photoproducts in the photo biodegradation experiment all the indices had the most significant change on the first day of the experiment suva254 value increased 201 from day 7 to day 8 and finally increased by 111 at day 14 hix value showed a slight increase while sr fi and bix values decreased during the photo biodegradation experiment the characteristics of dom all changed in the opposite trend to the results of the photodegradation experiment 3 1 4 ft ir spectroscopy and signal intensity variation the ft ir spectra obtained from the wwtp effluent sample and the samples after the photodegradation and photo biodegradation were presented in fig 5 ir signal peaks occurred at 3450 2917 1636 1388 1129 870 and 605 cm 1 respectively these peaks are associated with functional groups of oh stretching of phenols 3450 cm 1 ch stretching of aliphatics 2917 cm 1 c o stretching of carboxylates 1636 cm 1 coo symmetric stretching of carboxylic acid 1388 cm 1 co asymmetric stretching of carbohydrates 1129 cm 1 substituted aromatics 870 cm 1 c br stretching modes of bromides 605 cm 1 respectively bellamy 1975 see table 1 carboxylate like and phenol like dom showed the highest peak values and accounted for the main functional groups of efom after 7 day sunlight exposure the peak intensities of all the ir signals decreased the two maximum intensity decreases were 0 08 for oh stretching of phenols and 0 05 for coo symmetric stretching of carboxylic acid the maximum percentage decrease was 38 for co asymmetric stretching of carbohydrates besides the decrease of brominated compounds showed the photodegradation of the disinfection by products in the effluent as seen in table 1 in the photo biodegradation process 30 of the coo symmetric stretching of carboxylic acid after sunlight exposure was further degraded the magnitude of degradation was even larger than that in the photodegradation experiment besides during the photo biodegradation process ch stretching of aliphatics and aromatic substances were detected to be generated through microbial metabolisms the intensities of the two functional groups increase by 25 and 33 during the photo biodegradation 3 1 5 degradation kinetics of doc and fluorescent components based on the time series experimental results the degradation rates of doc a355 and fluorescent components were also determined it was found the first order reaction kinetics could fit well with the measured time series data with the decaying rate of d 1 the determined reaction rate and half life of efom are provided in table 2 table 2 shows in the biodegradation experiment only doc concentration and the intensities of the humic like component c4 in the efom showed a significant first order decrease rate the doc showed a slow degradation rate of 0 004 0 001 d 1 and its corresponding half life was 155 32 days during the biodegradation the components c1 and c4 had degradation rates of 0 005 0 004 d 1 and 0 049 0 016 d 1 respectively in the photodegradation experiment the first order degradation rate of doc was 0 053 0 011 d 1 and the half life period was 13 0 2 6 days during the photodegradation process a355 and all the four fluorescent components had faster degradation rates and a shorter half life than doc the two humic like components c2 and c4 had the fastest photodegradation rates of 0 440 0 020 d 1 and 0 496 0 084 d 1 respectively next the two protein like components c1 and c3 had photodegradation rates of 0 282 0 072 and 0 180 0 023 d 1 the degradation rate of a355 was 0 106 0 038 d 1 between those of doc and the fluorescent components in the photo biodegradation experiment the first order degradation rate of doc was 0 065 0 043 d 1 and the half life period was 10 6 7 0 days among all components only the intensity of tryptophan like component c3 decreased the degradation rate of c3 was 0 033 0 021 d 1 compared with the results of the direct biodegradation the doc degradation rate was significantly accelerated in the photo biodegradation experiment 3 2 behavior of efom during biodegradation photodegradation and photo biodegradation 3 2 1 biodegradability of efom the biodegradability of efom is often characterized by the ratio of the doc fractions remaining after incubation defined as refractory doc to total doc r doc doc servais et al 1999 lai et al 2011 reported that the r doc doc values of the effluents in five wwtp averaged 82 ranging from 67 91 hur et al 2011b found that the ratio value range of 15 wwtp effluents was wider with the highest close to 100 and the lowest less than 40 the difference in r doc doc values in effluents is affected by various conditions such as types of influent and operational systems in this study the doc concentration decreased by 5 3 after the 14 day direct biodegradation experiment which means that more than 90 of the efom after the tertiary treatment was biorefractory correspondingly the r doc doc value of this study was at a high level in the reported range hur et al 2011b lai et al 2011 indicating the highly biorefractory characteristic of the efom in the wangtang wwtp our biodegradation experiment results of the slow doc degradation rate 0 004 0 001 d 1 and the long half life 155 32 day also confirmed its biorefractory characteristic as a useful proxy for dom aromatic content our suva254 value of 3 18 0 19 l mgc 1 m 1 from the effluent was within the reported range for efom in previous studies hur et al 2011b o connor et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the high suva254 value indicated the high aromaticity of efom in the wangtang wwtp which could be caused by the accumulation of aromatic substances and the preferential use of non aromatic compounds in the biological wastewater treatment process esparza soto et al 2011 hur et al 2011b as an indicator inversely related to molecular weight mw our sr value of 0 84 0 13 fell in the lower range of the reported values helms et al 2013 the low sr value indicated the high mw of efom in the wangtang wwtp this can be explained by the microbial uptake of lower mw fractions and the formation of soluble microbial products smps in the biological wastewater treatment system esparza soto et al 2011 imai et al 2002 besides smp the efom from activated sludge systems is also composed of influent refractory compounds residual degradable substrate and intermediate products barker and stuckey 1999 for the identified fluorescence components c4 represented the terrestrial humic like compounds which could be originated from the influent refractory compounds murphy et al 2011 the existence of fluorescence component c2 was a proof of microbial derived dom in the wwtp effluent e g smps protein like components were usually considered as readily biodegradable however tyrosine like component c1 and tryptophan like component c3 of the efom remained little change in the biodegradation tryptophan like components were widely reported to be associated with bio labile organic matters and can be used as a proxy of bod in wastewaters goffin et al 2018 hudson et al 2008 the bio refractory behavior of c3 in our effluent indicates that the biodegradability of dom characterized by specific fluorescence components was case dependent it cannot be concluded by their commonly reported properties because each fluorescence component represents a heterogeneous mixture of organic substances yang et al 2015 therefore the efom of wangtang wwtp showed the characteristics of high aromaticity high mw and mainly microbial derived these characteristics of the efom determined its non biodegradability which was also supported by our biodegradation experiment results 3 2 2 photodegradation of efom our results showed the efom was photodegraded to a much greater extent and with a faster degradation rate than biodegraded figs 2 and 3 which suggests that efom is more photo labile than bio labile also the degradation extents and rates of the chromophoric and fluorescent fractions were faster than that of doc table 2 these results indicated that chromophores and fluorophores of efom were more susceptible to photodegradation than gross doc which is consistent with the findings in many other studies moran and sheldon 2000 ward and cory 2020 yang et al 2014 the higher loss of chromophores and fluorophores than doc also implies that sunlight irradiation caused more photo bleaching of efom than photo mineralization the photodegradation resulted in the formation of compounds that while still part of the dom pool no longer absorb light to the same extent as the parent material similar conclusions were also found in other photodegradation experiments on efom yang et al 2014 reported a much higher fraction of efom by photo bleaching 45 59 than photo mineralization 15 after sunlight exposure zhang et al 2019 found almost no photo mineralization of the efom but over 50 loss of fluorescent fraction with illumination compared with photo mineralization photo bleaching has a more significant impact on instream microbial metabolism because it changes dom chemical composition and generates photoproducts with different bio availability than the parent compounds ward and cory 2016 ward et al 2017 compositional change of efom after the sunlight exposure was also revealed by fluorescence and ft ir spectral results 95 5 and 96 7 of humic like components c2 and c4 were photodegraded while 91 9 and 70 7 of protein like components c1 and c3 were photodegraded the humic like components also showed faster degradation rates than the two protein like components these results suggest that the humic like substances were more photoreactive than the protein like ones consistent with previous findings of various samples helms et al 2013 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 the decreased intensities of the humic components together with the decreased hix values indicate the reduced degree of humification of efom after the photodegradation in addition the functional groups associated with humic like substances such as phenolic and carboxylic groups were found to be photodegraded with the largest ir signal decreases among all detected groups table 2 previous studies suggested that phenolic groups within the dom pool may quench reactive oxygen species and thereby suppress photodegradation ward and cory 2016 however the considerable reduction of doc and humic like substances in our study suggested the destruction of this quenching effect the phenolics in the efom did not prevent photodegradation carboxylic groups have been proposed to be photo mineralized to inorganic carbon or converted to less reactive groups such as ester ward and cory 2016 2020 zhang et al 2019 found that the carboxylic groups in their efom were partially photo oxidized instead of photo mineralized due to the unchanged doc concentrations and increased content esters with illumination in our study the substantial doc loss and no formation of ester groups after irradiation indicated that photodecarboxylation could account for the efom photo mineralization besides the carboxylic and phenolic groups the aromatics were also associated with the humic like substances and photodegraded the photodegradation of conjugated aromatic rings resulted in decreased efom average mw and aromaticity as indicated by increasing sr and decreasing suva254 values with exposure amide group rings mainly derived from protein like compounds thereby the photodegraded amide groups were ascribed to the photodegradation of the protein like compounds in addition the carbohydrates and aliphatics in the efom were also destroyed with sunlight exposure based on the above discussions the compositional changes in the efom from wangtang wwtp after sunlight exposure indicate the degradation of larger more aromatic higher humified photoreactive compounds into smaller less aromatic lower humified more bleached ones their photoproducts have therefore become bio labile and could serve as a source of microbial substrates 3 2 3 coupled photochemical and biological degradation of efom numerous studies have focused on the photodegradation of nom in natural waters and the induced compositional changes bowen et al 2020 moran and sheldon 2000 sankar et al 2019 by selectively removing or damaging the chromophores and yielding biodegradable compounds photodegradation plays an important role in shaping the microbial utilization of dom cory and kling 2018 ward et al 2017 in our study in the complete absence of sunlight microorganisms in the receiving waterbody can only use 5 3 of the efom however the originally bio refractory efom became bio available after exposure to sunlight after natural sunlight exposure the doc concentration further decreased by 37 5 in the photo biodegradation thus the overall decrease in doc concentration of efom reached 64 2 through the coupled photochemical and biological degradation also the degradation rate in the photo biodegradation 0 065 0 043 d 1 was significantly enhanced compared with that in the biodegradation 0 004 0 001 d 1 this suggests that the photoproducts can be readily used by the microbial microorganisms from the receiving river our findings prove that sunlight changes the composition of efom and can promote further microbial utilization of efom through coupled photochemical and biological degradation another interesting phenomenon is that all the efom indicators had the most significant changes on the first day of the photo biodegradation as the effluent samples were inoculated with the native microbial communities in the receiving river the rapid response showed that the microbes could directly metabolize the photo altered efom even without an acclimation period ward et al 2017 suggested that whether sunlight stimulates microbial metabolism depends on whether the native microbial communities adapt to the photoproducts our results revealed that the native microbial communities in the receiving river were adapted to the photoproducts of efom further such coupled photodegradation and biodegradation processes were prevailing in the river receiving wangtang wwtp effluent during the photo biodegradation a355 increased despite decreased doc concentration this indicates that the microorganisms used non absorbing materials and generated light absorbing materials during the incubation the intensities of two humic like c2 and c4 components also increased significantly indicating that the microorganisms produced humic substances in this process evidence suggests that microbial degradation of dom can lead to the formation and enrichment of higher mw fulvic and humic acids with higher aromatic contents hansen et al 2016 hur et al 2011a among the fluorescence components only the tryptophan like c3 decreased significantly like doc this implies that the organic substances characterized by fluorescence component c3 experienced structural changes and became bio labile after exposure to sunlight the change in its biodegradability before and after sun exposure implies again that the properties of dom characterized by the same fluorescence component can be case dependent measured by ft ir spectra aliphatics and aromatics were detected to be formed during the photo biodegradationhur et al 2011a sankar et al 2019 the generation of aromatics supported the increase in the absorbance and suva254 values in the course the decrease in sr and the increase in suva254 and hix suggested greater production of high mw humified and aromatic dom in the photo biodegradation in contrast with the photodegradation all the optical indices in the photo biodegradation changed in opposite directions our findings are in line with that biodegradation typically leads to the rapid loss of labile and low mw material and it can also be accompanied by the production of high mw and aromatic material through alteration of existing compounds and production of new compounds by heterotrophs bowen et al 2020 moran and zepp 1997 sankar et al 2019 nevertheless the net change in doc concentrations and fluorescence showed still significant decrease after the coupled photochemical and biological reactions based on the above discussion the biodegradability of efom after sunlight exposure was significantly enhanced the native microbes could readily use the low mw bleached efom photoproducts for their metabolisms during the microbial metabolism they produced aromatic substances and synthesized humic like materials this leads to changes in the properties of efom into higher aromaticity higher mw and increased degree of humification 3 3 accelerated microbial do consumption in the photo biodegradation fig 6 provided accumulated do consumption during the biodegradation and photo biodegradation experiments in the direct biodegradation experiment the efom consumed a small amount of do with a zero order rate of 0 11 mg l 1 d 1 in comparison in the biodegradation experiment after sunlight exposure the efom consumed do rapidly with a zero order rate of 2 17 mg l 1 d 1 compared with the direct biodegradation results the do consumption rate was significantly accelerated in the biodegradation experiment after sunlight exposure the accelerated do consumption rate of efom in the photo biodegradation was associated with the enhanced biodegradability after the sunlight exposure the increased rate of do consumption of efom through the coupled photochemical and biological degradation was also reported for the thawing permafrost soil and temperate stream water samples ward and cory 2016 2020 ward et al 2017 our previous study reported the fast oxygen depletion phenomenon in the nanfei river receiving the wangtang wwtp effluent as its dominant water source huang et al 2017 the accelerated oxygen consumption through the coupled photochemical and biological degradation of efom found in this study could explain this phenomenon in the nanfei river in the past the impacts of the effluent discharge after tertiary treatment on instream oxygen consumption were often overlooked because the biodegradability of the effluent was often believed to be low in receiving waters our findings highlight that due to the coupled processes the effluent discharge even after tertiary treatment would still cause potential risks of accelerating microbial oxygen consumption in receiving waters especially in the river reaches with longer water travel time and exposure to abundant sunlight 3 4 environmental implications in today s highly urbanized world treated wwtp effluents have become a supplementary water source to urban rivers hamdhani et al 2020 many urban rivers are even dominated by wwtp effluents hamdhani et al 2020 although the bod concentration in the effluent especially after advanced tertiary treatment is often low sometimes 5 mg l the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration can reach 20 50 mg l wang and chen 2018 indicating that the effluent still contains a lot of organic matters thus efom can be an important source of dom in the receiving waters open canopy rivers offer a natural reactor for post wwtp advanced treatment of efom where the efom undergoes coupled photochemical and biological degradation processes after being discharged into the river the coupled processes of efom are vital for an understanding of the efom fate in the receiving waters which has not been thoroughly studied to date besides the coupled processes of efom may affect microbial composition and metabolism and have considerable implications for aspects of instream carbon and nutrient cycling in addition the fate of the highly toxic and biorefractory organic compounds such as endocrine disrupting compounds pharmaceuticals and personal care products discharged by effluent may be influenced by the coupled processes these hypotheses should be explicitly tested in future work therefore the coupled processes of efom should be increasingly incorporated into experimental frameworks to accurately estimate their role in driving biogeochemical processes in receiving waters a systematic analysis of efom transformations in receiving waters considering the coupled photochemical and biological degradation is thereby strongly suggested with this knowledge the water manager can take the ubiquitous coupled processes of efom and their potential effects on biogeochemistry in receiving waters into account when implementing wwtp effluent discharge permits and considering wastewater treatment approaches for example advanced effluent treatment with long uv irradiation time can be recommended for the sake of environmental and ecological targets in receiving waters 4 conclusions this study proves that photodegradation of efom enhances its biodegradability in receiving waters without sunlight exposure the efom measuring by doc was microbially degraded at the rate of 0 004 d 1 by only 5 3 after 14 day incubation in contrast after sunlight exposure the rest of efom was further microbially degraded at the rate of 0 065 d 1 and by 37 5 correspondingly the microbial oxygen consumption rate of efom could increase from 0 11 mgo l 1 d 1 before sunlight exposure to 2 17 mgo l 1 d 1 after sunlight exposure the change in the biodegradability of efom after sunlight exposure can be explained by the altered composition and properties in the photodegradation absorbance fluorescence with eem parafac technique and ft ir spectra were applied to evaluate the efom compositional and characteristic change the higher loss percentages of chromophores 46 2 and fluorophores 88 3 than doc 22 6 suggest that sunlight irradiation caused more photo transformation of efom than photo mineralization the parafac humic like and protein like components were prone to photodegradation which is also supported by the decreased ir signal peaks of associated functional groups i e phenolic carboxylic aromatics and amide increasing sr and decreasing suva254 values indicates decreased mw and aromaticity of efom in the photodegradation the rapid response of the native microbial communities in the receiving waterbody to the efom on the first day of incubation after the photodegradation showed that they were adapted to the photoproducts as their substrates and readily metabolized the photo altered efom in the end through the coupled photochemical and biological degradations the doc concentration of efom was reduced by 64 2 findings from this study strongly suggest that coupled photochemical and biological processes of discharged efom should be considered to understand its fate in receiving waters and better manage wastewater effluent

operation in terms of op control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords opportunistic pathogens ops simulated water storage systems swsss rainwater tap water tank materials 1 introduction due to the intensified water scarcity and the usage of intermittent municipal water supplies in certain areas of the world e g loess plateau in china australia india storing rainwater or tap water in household tanks for domestic use is a common practice for hundreds of millions of people chalchisa et al 2018 hamilton et al 2019 kumpel and nelson 2016 wu et al 2016 for example 32 of australians owned a rainwater tank as of 2010 and 13 6 of queensland households used rainwater as the main source of drinking water ahmed et al 2015 more than 120 million people in low and middle income countries receive water from intermittent municipal water supplies which necessitates household collection and storage kumpel and nelson 2014 besides household tanks finished water storage

with microbial proliferation and water quality deterioration due to stagnation warm ambient temperatures inadequate mixing physicochemical and biochemical reactions e g disinfectant decay corrosion as well as biofilm formation and sediment accumulation within tanks lautenschlager et al 2010 li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 slavik et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in recent years a group of waterborne opportunistic pathogens ops including pseudomonas aeruginosa legionella pneumophila mycobacteria avium and acanthamoeba spp have become an emerging public health threat worldwide especially for immunocompromised populations carnt et al 2018 donohue 2018 falkinham iii et al 2015 smith et al 2019 these ops ubiquitously inhabit engineered water systems including drinking water distribution

transmitted enteric pathogens inhalation of aerosols or skin contact represents the primary transmission and exposure route of ops for instance l pneumophila and nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm can cause serious lung infections when inhaling aerosols containing pathogenic species e g during showering and garden hosing falkinham iii et al 2015 acanthamoeba can invade the mucous membranes of the

in engineered water systems falkinham iii et al 2015 a body of literature has linked disease outbreaks and clinical infections to the contamination of drinking water systems with ops carnt et al 2018 donohue 2018 falkinham iii et al 2015 smith et al 2019 at least two outbreaks have been linked to the detection of l pneumophila and m avium complex in rainwater supplies lumb et al 2004 simmons et al 2008 highlighting that rainwater systems could be an important exposure route of ops ahmed et al 2014 hamilton et al 2017b opportunistic pathogens can flourish in oligotrophic environment once favorable conditions are met ahmed et al 2014 hamilton et al 2017a li et al 2018 wang et al 2012b yet factors driving their occurrence persistence and growth in water storage tanks have not been fully explored first it remains unclear if ops would behave differently in rainwater and tap water tanks due to the dramatic water chemistry differences between these two media for instance roof harvested rainwater can harbor much higher concentrations of organic matters and metals relative to tap water due to the presence of debris and animal droppings on roof and being in contact with metallic materials e g roofs fittings abbasi and abbasi 2011 second a variety of materials including plastics steel fiberglass cement are commonly used in water storage tanks lawson et al 2009 which are

increase of ph lawson et al 2009 leaching of metal ions and organic matters kim and han 2014 lawson et al 2009 obiofu et al 2018 corrosion lawson et al 2009 and subsequently affect the microbial proliferation in bulk water and biofilm evison and sunna 2001 obiofu et al 2018 schafer and mihelcic 2012 although a few studies have investigated the effect of tank materials on water physicochemical properties and fecal indicators evison and sunna 2001 kim et al 2012 schafer and mihelcic 2012 the information regarding their influence on the occurrence and persistence of ops during the long term operation of storage tanks is rare hamilton et al 2016 hamilton et al 2017a the knowledge is critical to the microbial risk mitigation in water storage facilities as the control of ops may be targeted differently from that of conventional enteric pathogens hamilton et al 2017a moreover an increasing body of literature has revealed the lack of associations between fecal indicators and ops in water samples hamilton et al 2019 the purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the growth dynamics of ops and related genera species i e p aeruginosa legionella spp l pneumophila mycobacterium spp m avium acanthamoeba spp v vermiformis during the long term operation of rainwater and tap water storage systems we built simulated water storage systems swsss with polyvinyl

reaction q pcr as an indicator of their tendency to grow or attenuate in the swss effluents relative to the influents besides water samples biofilm samples on the coupons were analyzed at the end of the experiment considering that biofilm can provide critical ecological niches for ops falkinham iii et al 2015 the results provide insight into op risks and management approaches in rainwater and tap water storage systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 swsss twelve swsss comparing three commonly used tank materials for household water storage i e commercial pvc 304 stainless steel and portland cement ptl 325 chaurasiya et al 2019 lawson et al 2009 were fed either with tap water or rainwater 3 materials 2 water 2 biological replicates fig s1 in each swss 6 8 pieces of coupons in different materials

tanks due to the presence of coupons but comparable or lower than that of storage modules used for rainwater collection i e up to 4 cm2 ml bottles and coupons were thoroughly cleaned assembled and then sterilized at 121 c for 20 min prior to the experimental set up all swsss were kept in dark without shaking in an incubator at 25 c room temperature during the 36 week study period 2018 11 28

sediments at the bottom swsss were subsequently refilled with the same amount of lately collected rainwater or tap water i e swss influents rainwater was harvested from a 15 m2 color steel tile roof on rainy days which was filtered through uv sterilized 10 μm filter papers hangzhou special paper industry co ltd china to remove particles to simulate pre tank filtration tap water was collected from a regular faucet in lab that was served by local water utilities treating surface water by processes of coagulation sedimentation filtration and chloramination prior to feeding tap water was passed through a household gac filter joyoung china to eliminate disinfectant residuals to simulate the worst case scenario of depleted disinfectant residuals at the distal sites of drinking water distribution systems wang et al 2012b in order to perform water changes on non rainy days and to ensure operational consistency between the two systems both filtered rainwater and tap water were stored at 4 c for 0 14 days as needed and brought to room temperatures if stored prior to swss feedings our previous study demonstrated negligible variations in physicochemical and biological qualities during the 14 day storage of rainwater at 4 c zhang et al 2020 storage of swss influents water changes and samplings were all carried out simultaneously for rainwater and tap water swsss

150 ml of swss influents and effluents wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 were filtered through sterile 0 22 μm pore size mixed cellulose ester filters millipore ma usa collected biomass on filters was aseptically transferred into 2 ml lysing matrix a tubes mp biomedicals usa and then subject to dna extraction for biofilm samples two coupons were aseptically extracted from each swss at weeks 34 36 n

80 wt vol cells were detached from the coupons by sonication for 4 min at a frequency of 28 khz in water bath guilbaud et al 2005 the resulting pbs buffer that contained detached cells was subject to membrane filtration and dna extraction two clean autoclaved coupons of each material were treated in the same way and served as the negative controls of biofilm samples dna extraction on samples

analyzes with a significance level of 0 05 one way analysis of variance anova or kruskal wallis anova with corresponding post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons were conducted to compare water chemistry parameters and gene copy numbers among swsss with different material coupons depending on the normality of datasets wilcoxon rank sum test or two sample t test was used to compare the difference between any two datasets spearman s rank correlation was used to evaluate associations between gene copy numbers and physicochemical data non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and analysis of similarity anosim were performed to compare the occurrence pattern of target microorganisms 16s rrna genes excluded among different swsss using the vegan package method details and the exact p value for each statistical test were summarized in table s2 3 results 3 1 water chemistry in rainwater and tap water swsss elevated ph and conductivity were observed in cement swsss figs 1 and s3 as a result of lime leaching in new cement coupons thomas et al 2018 in cement swsss ph decreased from 11 9 to 8 in tap water swss effluents after 16 weeks while it remained 10 in rainwater swss effluents throughout the experiment the discrepancy was due to the presence of bicarbonate and carbonate ions in tap water which could accelerate the release of lime in cement roy et al 1999 this was confirmed by the xrd analysis of white precipitates that only formed on the glass wall of tap water cement swsss which were determined as caco3 fig s4 conductivity dropped from 158 μs cm to the baseline level 40 μs cm in tap water cement swss effluents within 7 weeks faster than that in rainwater swsss 16 weeks lower conductivity was found in rainwater swss influents pvc and stainless steel swss steel swss thereafter effluents compared to their tap water swss counterparts p 0 05 higher concentrations and variations of toc tn ammonia and nitrate were noted in rainwater swss influents relative to tap water swss influents p 0 05 figs 1 and s3 due to the contamination of chemicals from polluted air roof dust rotting animals and or plants abbasi and abbasi 2011 in rainwater swss effluents pvc swsss had the lowest ammonia concentrations followed by steel and then cement swsss p 0 05 whereas the opposite trend was noted for nitrate pvc stainless steel swsss cement swsss p 0 05 reduced ammonia concentrations and elevated nitrate levels were observed in pvc and steel rainwater swss effluents relative to their influents p 0 05 suggesting the occurrence of nitrification during rainwater storage on the contrary no differences were observed for investigated nitrogen species in tap water swsss with different material coupons p 0 05 different metal levels were observed in rainwater and tap water swsss figs 2 and s5 for instance zn was only observed in rainwater swsss average standard deviation 0 44 0 26 mg l while tap water swsss had higher mg 5 57 2 94 vs 0 21 0 21 mg l p 0 05 and ca 15 09 3 96 vs 8 75 6 20 mg l p 0 05 in effluents than rainwater swsss cement tanks tended to have the lowest zn and mg concentrations if present due to the formation of hydroxide precipitates at high ph levels pb 0 03 0 02 mg l and al 0 50 0 19 mg l were only detected in rainwater pvc swss and cement swss effluents respectively due to coupon leaching which exceeded the limits of standards for drinking water quality in china 0 01 mg l for pb and 0 2 mg l for al gb5749 2006 mh and sac 2006 other heavy metals including cd cr cu mn were under detection limits in both rainwater and tap water swsss 3 2 less proliferation of total bacteria in rainwater relative to tap water total bacteria in tap water swsss as indicated by 16s rrna gene numbers increased from 4 5 0 4 log10 gc ml in influents to 5 1 0 3 log10 gc ml in effluents after one week storage fig 3 a and s6 a p 0 05 slightly lower levels of 16s rrna genes were noted in tap water steel swsss relative to that in pvc and cement swsss p 0 05 no significant bacterial proliferation was found in rainwater swsss p 0 05 however an increase of 16s rrna gene numbers was found in stored rainwater after week 16 p 0 05 likely due to the temperature increase caused by seasonal change from winter to spring figs s2 and s6 3 3 distinct op growth patterns in rainwater and tap water swsss to the authors knowledge this study represents the first to compare the growth dynamics of ops in rainwater and tap water storage systems we detected an array of microorganisms including e coli p aeruginosa legionella spp ntm and v vermiformis in fresh stored rainwater and tap water by q pcr however gene markers of l pneumophila m avium and acanthamoeba spp were not found in any sample during the experiment although methods employed in this study may overestimate target microorganisms by detecting dna that is not necessarily present inside a viable cell the increase or reduction of gene copy numbers of target microorganisms in swss effluents relative to the corresponding swss influents indicate that q pcr successfully evaluated trends of target microorganisms fecal indicator e coli although e coli was intermittently detected in swss influents and effluents the majority of samples 90 had gene copy numbers lower than the loq figs 3 b and s6 b high levels of e coli 3 log10 gc ml were sporadically found in rainwater swsss comparable to a reported e coli concentration range of 0 18 2 88 log10 gc ml in rainwater tank samples using the same q pcr assay ahmed et al 2012 in contrast to q pcr detection of low level e coli in tap water systems the culture based method failed to detect e coli in tap water before and after gac filtration i e swss influents no e coli proliferation or attenuation was found during rainwater and tap water storage p 0 05 p aeruginosa p aeruginosa was 100 detected in rainwater and tap water swss influents and effluents fig 3 c and s6 c although lower p aeruginosa numbers were noticed in rainwater swss influents 1 8 0 2 log10 gc ml compared to tap water swss influents 2 1 0 3 log10 gc ml p 0 05 significant growth was only observed in rainwater swsss p 0 05 especially after week 15 rainwater pvc swsss had the highest p aeruginosa numbers of 3 2 1 2 log10 gc ml followed by rainwater steel 2 1 0 4 log10 gc ml and cement swsss 2 0 0 3 log10 gc ml p 0 05 legionella spp though l pneumophila was nondetectable legionella spp containing other pathogenic members waak et al 2018 was tracked to represent the broader trends at the genus level in both rainwater and tap water swsss figs 3 d and s6 d rainwater and tap water influents had comparable legionella concentrations p 0 05 ranging from 1 8 loq to 4 2 log10 gc ml the frequency of detection fod table s3 of legionella decreased from 72 4 in tap water swss influents to 57 in effluents suggesting the attenuation of legionella in tap water after 1 week storage however legionella proliferated dramatically in rainwater pvc and steel swsss p 0 05 with higher gene copy number noted in steel swsss 4 1 0 6 log10 gc ml relative to pvc swsss 3 2 0 9 log10 gc ml p 0 05 ntm while m avium was not detected in this study the mycobacterium genus was tracked as the representative of ntm species figs 3 e and s6 e wang et al 2015 mycobacteria were sporadically detected in rainwater swsss mainly in pvc swsss with a fod of 19 0 and an average concentration of 2 0 0 4 log10 gc ml in positive samples only two rainwater influent samples were positive for mycobacteria concordant with their detection in steel and cement swss effluents in week 33 and 34 in tap water swsss mycobacteria had the highest fod in pvc swsss 48 3 table s3 followed by steel 39 7 and cement swsss 24 1 various mycobacterial growth patterns were observed in tap water swsss with different material coupons namely mycobacteria proliferated in steel and cement swsss within the first 17 weeks but flourished in pvc swsss during weeks 10 34 fig s6 e v vermiformis v vermiformis is not itself a pathogen but considered as an important host for ops delafont et al 2018 v vermiformis tended to grow in rainwater pvc swsss with the average gene copy number increasing from 2 1 1 4 log10 gc ml in the influents to 2 9 0 9 log10 gc ml in the effluents p 0 05 figs 3 f and s6 f on the contrary a declining trend was noted for v vermiformis in rainwater cement swsss 1 3 0 9 log10 gc ml p 0 05 likely due to the alkaline environment in cement systems elevated v vermiformis gene copy numbers were also found in tap water pvc 1 7

pvc coupons had the highest biofilm densities in tap water swsss p 0 05 fig 4 in general the gene copy numbers of targeted ops were higher on pvc coupons especially relative to cement coupons for instance p aeruginosa and v vermiformis densities on pvc coupons were 1 3 log10 higher than those seen on steel and or cement coupons in rainwater swsss p 0 05 the highest legionella densities were also found in pvc biofilms in both rainwater and tap water swsss approximately 0 5 3 log10 higher than those in cement biofilms p 0 05 this is in contrast to the trends in bulk water which demonstrated the highest legionella number in rainwater steel swss effluents and comparable legionella numbers in the effluents of tap water swsss with different material coupons section 3 3 in rainwater swsss mycobacteria were consistently detected in all pvc biofilm samples with an average density of 4 50 0 79 log10 gc cm2 in contrast to their sporadic detection in bulk water section 3 3

clustering of effluent samples according to tank materials was also noted global r 0 399 0 711 p 0 001 highlighting the critical role of tank materials in governing op dynamics in rainwater storage systems the correlations between physicochemical parameters and the ordination configuration demonstrated that ammonia ph al conductivity toc and ca accounted for the upper left shift of the majority of cement swss effluent samples while zn drove the positive direction the shift of pvc samples was associated with pb on the contrary no apparent pattern was observed for samples in tap water swsss 4 discussion 4 1 growth dynamics of total bacteria and ops in rainwater relative to tap water long detention time in water storage facilities is one of the most important factors related to drinking water quality deterioration epa 2002 the increase of 16s rrna genes in tap water swsss was consistent with the findings of a lab study that demonstrated elevated heterotrophic plate counts hpc after 4 7 day storage of tap water in fiberglass polyethylene and cast iron tanks evison and sunna 2001 even overnight stagnation could result in 2 3 fold increase of total cells by flow cytometry or 4 580 fold increase of hpc in household plumbing pipes lautenschlager et al 2010 however microbial quality as a function of storage time in rainwater tanks remained debatable though we did not observe significant growth or attenuation of total bacteria in rainwater swsss other studies observed gradually increased hpc and 16s rrna gene numbers during 60 day storage of rainwater zhang et al 2020 or reduction of hpc total and fecal coliforms during 1 2 week rainwater storage as a result of rainwater nutrient limitation sedimentation and naturally occurring water quality improvement processes amin et al 2013 vasudevan et al 2001 different rainwater chemistry storage practices and cell enumeration methods might account for the result discrepancy among these studies however the increase of p aeruginosa legionella and v vermiformis in rainwater swsss suggested that stagnant rainwater is conducive to the proliferation of some ops ops are known to flourish in drinking water distribution systems once favorable conditions are met falkinham iii et al 2015 compared to tap water roof harvested rainwater typically contains higher organic matters and heavy metals due to the carryover of contaminants from the collection system and or atmosphere abbasi and abbasi 2011 which might include growth factors of ops for example rainwater containing higher zn concentrations fig 2 may stimulate the growth of legionella as zinc is an essential component of legionella s major secretory protein sahney et al 2001 previous studies demonstrated that zn concentrations 0 375 mg l were able to increase legionella colonization risks in hot water by 2 fold bargellini et al 2011 and zinc dose of 0 5 1 mg l supplemented into tap water could increase the proliferation of legionella by 1 log10 conley et al 1985 moreover the higher proliferation tendency of ops relative to e coli in rainwater observed in this study reinforced prior research indicating that fecal indicators used during regular water quality monitoring cannot reflect op contamination and health risks in rainwater for potable and non potable usages hamilton et al 2016 on the contrary stagnant tap water is not favorable to the proliferation of p aeruginosa and legionella in this study similar results were observed in a simulated water heater study that demonstrated the reduction of legionella and p aeruginosa in 37 c chloraminated water even after the disinfectants were gone wang et al 2015 4 2 effect of tank materials on ops in bulk water and biofilm in general plastic based materials e g polyethylene pvc allow more attachment of biomass and fecal indicators relative to the metal based materials e g galvanized and stainless steel in water storage tanks momba and kaleni 2002 obiofu et al 2018 in terms of ops existing literature mainly focused on legionella biofilm formation potential on various premise plumbing materials e g pvc pe copper stainless steel which typically demonstrated the enhanced legionella growth on synthetic polymeric materials relative to inert materials e g stainless steel and glass van der kooij et al 2020 2005 consistently the present study also demonstrated the highest biofilm formation potential of target microorganisms on pvc coupons in rainwater and or tap water swsss in cement swsss the inhibitory effects toward legionella mycobacteria and v vermiformis were associated with the high ph levels legionella species survive and multiply in the ph range 5 5 9 2 and a ph 9 had been proposed as an approach to control legionella in cooling towers conley et al 1987 mycobacteria prefer acidic to neutral ph environment e g ph 4 6 7 4 portaels and pattyn 1982 it has been reported that ph around 8 9 is inductive to the encystment of v vermiformis resulting in suppressed metabolic activities to resist adverse conditions delafont et al 2018 since elevated ph is commonly observed in rainwater cement tanks in the present study ph 10 during the study period and others 8 1 10 islam et al 2010 thomas et al 2018 cement tanks could be recommended for rainwater storage to minimize the colonization of ops when rainwater is used for non potable purposes e g building washing toilet flushing garden watering other advantages of cement tanks include neutralizing rainwater with low ph e g acid rain lawson et al 2009 and sedimentation of heavy metals abbasi and abbasi 2011 tank material effect on bulk water and biofilm differed for legionella and mycobacteria which might relate to the different ecological niches of biofilms and water phase for instance ntm prefer to attach to surfaces and form biofilm due to the hydrophobicity of cell membrane falkinham 2009 since free living amoebae occur frequently in biofilm and can graze on biofilm associated bacteria cateau et al 2014 residence in biofilms also makes legionella and mycobacteria more accessible to their amoebal hosts enhancing their proliferation in engineered water systems falkinham iii et al 2015 thomas and ashbolt 2010 however the reason for the highest legionella in bulk water of rainwater steel swsss remained unclear although trace metals released from steel coupons e g iron manganese were speculated to stimulate legionella growth our heavy metal analysis figs 2 and s5 indicated comparable levels of these ions in rainwater pvc and steel swsss other uninvestigated factors such as cell detachment from steel surfaces unique ecological niche created in rainwater steel swsss might account for the higher legionella numbers in steel swss bulk water 4 3 factors affecting the op occurrence pattern in rainwater tanks as discussed above the negative associations between target microorganisms and ph could be explained by the inhibitory effect of high ph i e ph 10 towards ops and the positive associations between target microorganisms and zn are due to the involvement of zinc in cell metabolisms banerji et al 2005 lee et al 2014 the negative associations between target microorganisms and ammonia al are likely a direct reflection of the fact that cement rainwater swsss had the highest ammonia al concentrations and the lowest gene copy numbers of target microorganisms the positive associations between p aeruginosa v vermiformis and pb is likely an artifact since pb was only detected in pvc swsss where the highest gene copy numbers of p aeruginosa and v vermiformis were detected furthermore weak to moderate correlations between target microorganisms and water chemistry parameters indicated that other uninvestigated factors might account for the growth of ops in rainwater overall the results suggested that tank materials can have a significant influence on physicochemical qualities and the occurrence of ops in stored rainwater positive correlations between target microorganisms in rainwater swsss were consistent with the findings in drinking water systems wang et al 2012b positive correlations between v vermiformis and p aeruginosa legionella mycobacteria is likely a reflection of host pathogen interactions cateau et al 2008 delafont et al 2018 wadowsky et al 1991 v vermiformis is not only a grazer of bacteria in natural biofilm communities but also a host of numerous bacteria including legionella p aeruginosa and mycobacteria delafont et al 2018 the absence of acanthamoeba in rainwater and tap water swsss were in accordance with previous studies reporting rarer isolation rates and lower densities of acanthamoeba than v vermiformis in different water environments delafont et al 2018 moreover some studies suggested that the proliferation of legionella in engineered water systems is more closely associated with v vermiformis relative to acanthamoeba thomas et al 2014 valster et al 2010 therefore detection and control of v vermiformis could be a part of the regular microbial monitoring in rainwater systems to mitigate op risks 5 conclusions this study provided a comprehensive comparison of the growth dynamics of ops and related microorganisms in stored rainwater and tap water using swsss with different material coupons the key findings include natural occurrences of p aeruginosa legionella spp mycobacteria and v vermiformis in swss bulk water and biofilm samples indicated that both rainwater and tap water storage systems could be op reservoirs higher growth potential of p aeruginosa and legionella was found in rainwater relative to tap water while v vermiformis could proliferate in both rainwater and tap water polyvinyl chloride pvc swsss the results highlighted the necessity of op control and management in rainwater storage systems tank materials exerted stronger influence on target microorganisms in rainwater swsss relative to tap water swsss with species specific responses noted in bulk water and biofilm different tank material effects observed between rainwater and tap water swsss illustrated that it is inappropriate to generalize the design and management experiences in tap water systems to rainwater systems further studies deciphering broader microbial ecology in rainwater storage systems would be of interest considering the complex microbial interactions between ops and other microbes as well as important ecological niches of biofilm and sediments in rainwater tanks declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgments this study

while mycobacteria were largely absent in rainwater swsss tank materials exerted stronger influence on target microorganisms in rainwater swsss relative to tap water swsss with species specific responses noted in bulk water and biofilm for instance p aeruginosa and v vermiformis had the highest gene copy numbers in pvc rainwater swss effluents and biofilm while legionella peaked in stainless

operation in terms of op control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords opportunistic pathogens ops simulated water storage systems swsss rainwater tap water tank materials 1 introduction due to the intensified water scarcity and the usage of intermittent municipal water supplies in certain areas of the world e g loess plateau in china australia india storing rainwater or tap water in household tanks for domestic use is a common practice for hundreds of millions of people chalchisa et al 2018 hamilton et al 2019 kumpel and nelson 2016 wu et al 2016 for example 32 of australians owned a rainwater tank as of 2010 and 13 6 of queensland households used rainwater as the main source of drinking water ahmed et al 2015 more than 120 million people in low and middle income countries receive water from intermittent municipal water supplies which necessitates household collection and storage kumpel and nelson 2014 besides household tanks finished water storage

well as biofilm formation and sediment accumulation within tanks lautenschlager et al 2010 li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 slavik et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in recent years a group of waterborne opportunistic pathogens ops including pseudomonas aeruginosa legionella pneumophila mycobacteria avium and acanthamoeba spp have become an emerging public health threat worldwide especially for immunocompromised populations carnt et al 2018 donohue 2018 falkinham iii et al 2015 smith et al 2019 these ops ubiquitously inhabit engineered water systems including drinking water distribution

transmitted enteric pathogens inhalation of aerosols or skin contact represents the primary transmission and exposure route of ops for instance l pneumophila and nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm can cause serious lung infections when inhaling aerosols containing pathogenic species e g during showering and garden hosing falkinham iii et al 2015 acanthamoeba can invade the mucous membranes of the

in engineered water systems falkinham iii et al 2015 a body of literature has linked disease outbreaks and clinical infections to the contamination of drinking water systems with ops carnt et al 2018 donohue 2018 falkinham iii et al 2015 smith et al 2019 at least two outbreaks have been linked to the detection of l pneumophila and m avium complex in rainwater supplies lumb et al 2004 simmons et al

favorable conditions are met ahmed et al 2014 hamilton et al 2017a li et al 2018 wang et al 2012b yet factors driving their occurrence persistence and growth in water storage tanks have not been fully explored first it remains unclear if ops would behave differently in rainwater and tap water tanks due to the dramatic water chemistry differences between these two media for instance roof harvested rainwater can harbor much higher concentrations of organic matters and metals relative to tap water due to the presence of debris and animal droppings on roof and being in contact with metallic materials e g roofs fittings abbasi and abbasi 2011 second a variety of materials including plastics steel fiberglass cement are commonly used in water storage tanks lawson et al 2009 which are

increase of ph lawson et al 2009 leaching of metal ions and organic matters kim and han 2014 lawson et al 2009 obiofu et al 2018 corrosion lawson et al 2009 and subsequently affect the microbial proliferation in bulk water and biofilm evison and sunna 2001 obiofu et al 2018 schafer and mihelcic 2012 although a few studies have investigated the effect of tank materials on water physicochemical properties and fecal indicators evison and sunna 2001 kim et al 2012 schafer and mihelcic 2012 the information regarding their influence on the occurrence and persistence of ops during the long term operation of storage tanks is rare hamilton et al 2016 hamilton et al 2017a the knowledge is critical to the microbial risk mitigation in water storage facilities as the control of ops may be targeted differently from that of conventional enteric pathogens hamilton et al 2017a moreover an increasing body of literature has revealed the lack of associations between fecal indicators and ops in water samples hamilton et al 2019 the purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the growth dynamics of ops and related genera species i e p aeruginosa legionella spp l pneumophila mycobacterium spp m avium acanthamoeba spp v vermiformis during the long term operation of rainwater and tap water storage systems we built simulated water storage systems swsss with polyvinyl chloride pvc stainless steel and cement coupons which were fed with tap water or rainwater duplicate swsss were operated for each condition with a weekly 80 water change wang et al 2015 to mimic water consumption and refill that routinely occur in rainwater and water storage tanks for 36 weeks gene copy numbers of target microorganisms in bulk water were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction q pcr as an indicator of their tendency to grow or attenuate in the swss effluents relative to the influents besides water samples biofilm samples on the coupons were analyzed at the end of the experiment considering that biofilm can provide critical ecological niches for ops falkinham iii et al 2015 the results provide insight into op risks and management approaches in rainwater and tap water storage systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 swsss twelve swsss comparing three commonly used tank materials for household water storage i e commercial pvc 304 stainless steel and portland cement ptl 325 chaurasiya et al 2019 lawson et al 2009 were fed either with tap water or rainwater 3 materials 2 water 2 biological replicates fig s1 in each swss 6 8 pieces of coupons in different materials 7 cm 2 cm 0 55 1 1 cm were hanged using strings in 625 ml water in a 1 l capped glass bottle to reach an equal surface to volume ratio of 0 44 cm2 ml the surface to volume ratio is higher than regular tanks due to the presence of coupons but comparable or lower than that of storage modules used for rainwater collection i e up to 4 cm2 ml bottles and coupons were thoroughly cleaned assembled and then sterilized at 121 c for 20 min prior to the experimental set up all swsss were kept in dark without shaking in an incubator at 25 c room temperature during the 36 week study period 2018 11 28 2019 07 30 fig s2 in order to mimic water usage events 500 ml water 80 were decanted from swsss weekly i e swss effluents wang et al 2015 using sterilized siphon tubes to avoid the disturbance of sediments at the bottom swsss were subsequently refilled with the same amount of lately collected rainwater or tap water i e swss influents rainwater was harvested from a 15 m2 color steel tile roof on rainy days which was filtered through uv sterilized 10 μm filter papers hangzhou special paper industry co ltd china to remove particles to simulate pre tank filtration tap water was collected from a regular faucet in lab that was served by local water utilities treating surface water by processes of coagulation sedimentation filtration and chloramination prior to feeding tap water was passed through a household gac filter joyoung china to eliminate disinfectant residuals to simulate the worst case scenario of depleted disinfectant residuals at the distal sites of drinking water distribution systems wang et al 2012b in order to perform water changes on non rainy days and to ensure operational consistency between the two systems both filtered rainwater and tap water were stored at 4 c for 0 14 days as needed and brought to room temperatures if stored prior to swss feedings our previous study demonstrated negligible variations in physicochemical and biological qualities during the 14 day storage of rainwater at 4 c zhang et al 2020 storage of swss influents water changes and samplings were all carried out simultaneously for rainwater and tap water swsss despite all these efforts water changes were not performed in both systems in extremely dry periods i e weeks 9 11 25 26 29 fig s2 2 2 sample processing and dna extraction for microbiological analyzes 150 ml of swss influents and effluents wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 were filtered through sterile 0 22 μm pore size mixed cellulose ester filters millipore ma usa collected biomass on filters was aseptically transferred into 2 ml lysing matrix a tubes mp biomedicals usa and then subject to dna extraction for biofilm samples two coupons were aseptically extracted from each swss at weeks 34 36 n

80 wt vol cells were detached from the coupons by sonication for 4 min at a frequency of 28 khz in water bath guilbaud et al 2005 the resulting pbs buffer that contained detached cells was subject to membrane filtration and dna extraction two clean autoclaved coupons of each material were treated in the same way and served as the negative controls of biofilm samples dna extraction on samples reagent negative controls i e blank membranes and biofilm negative controls were performed using fastdna spin kits mp biomedicals according to manufacturer s instruction 2 3 q pcr analysis of dna extracts e coli p aeruginosa legionella spp l pneumophila mycobacterium spp m avium acanthamoeba spp v vermiformis and 16s rrna genes indicative of total bacteria were enumerated by q pcr on a bio rad cfx96 touch real time pcr system using previously published methods optimized for drinking water or rainwater samples li et al 2018 wang et al 2012a zhang et al 2020 the method details including target genes and sizes primers and probes annealing temperatures reaction programs and recipes and positive standard preparations were summarized in table s1 dna extracts negative controls i e sterilized nanopure water and 10 fold serial dilutions of dna standards were included in triplicate in each plate run all samples were diluted at a ratio of 1 10 to minimize pcr inhibition the amplification efficiency of all q pcr assays ranged from 90 to 110 the limits of quantification loq were 10 gene copies reaction for all assays except for 16s rrna genes i e 100 gene copies reaction for samples with a gene copy concentration loq samples that yielded a detectable threshold cycle in at least two out of three reactions were scored positive wang et al 2012a and half of the loq was recorded for graphing and statistical purposes rhoads et al 2015 the gene copy gc numbers in bulk water samples were normalized to sample volumes and expressed as log10 x 1 gc ml and the gene copies in biofilm samples were normalized to coupon surfaces log10 x 1 gc cm2 q pcr analysis demonstrated the absence of target microorganisms except for 16s rrna genes in all reagent control and biofilm control samples 2 4 enumeration of e coli cells e coli were enumerated by enzyme substrate method using chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates according to the national environmental protection standards of china hj1001 2018 moee 2018 2 5 physicochemical analysis water physicochemical parameters including ph conductivity total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrate and heavy metal concentrations were measured by methods provided in the supporting information white precipitates found in tap water cement swsss were scraped off the glass bottle surfaces with a medicine spoon which was subject to chemical composition determination by an x ray diffractometer panalytical netherlands 2 6 statistical analysis r 3 4 1 r development core team 2013 was used for statistical analyzes with a significance level of 0 05 one way analysis of variance anova or kruskal wallis anova with corresponding post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons were conducted to compare water chemistry parameters and gene copy numbers among swsss with different material coupons depending on the normality of datasets wilcoxon rank sum test or two sample t test was used to compare the difference between any two datasets spearman s rank correlation was used to evaluate associations between gene copy numbers and physicochemical data non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and analysis of similarity anosim were performed to compare the occurrence pattern of target microorganisms 16s rrna genes excluded among different swsss using the vegan package method details and the exact p value for each statistical test were summarized in table s2 3 results 3 1 water chemistry in rainwater and tap water swsss elevated ph and conductivity were observed in cement swsss figs 1 and s3 as a result of lime leaching in new cement coupons thomas et al 2018 in cement swsss ph decreased from 11 9 to 8 in tap water swss effluents after 16 weeks while it remained 10 in rainwater swss effluents throughout the experiment the discrepancy was due to the presence of bicarbonate and carbonate ions in tap water which could accelerate the release of lime in cement roy et al 1999 this was confirmed by the xrd analysis of white precipitates that only formed on the glass wall of tap water cement swsss which were determined as caco3 fig s4 conductivity dropped from 158 μs cm to the baseline level 40 μs cm in tap water cement swss effluents within 7 weeks faster than that in rainwater swsss 16 weeks lower conductivity was found in rainwater swss influents pvc and stainless steel swss steel swss thereafter effluents compared to their tap water swss counterparts p 0 05 higher concentrations and variations of toc tn ammonia and nitrate were noted in rainwater swss influents relative to tap water swss influents p 0 05 figs 1 and s3 due to the contamination of chemicals from polluted air roof dust rotting animals and or plants abbasi and abbasi 2011 in rainwater swss effluents pvc swsss had the lowest ammonia concentrations followed by steel and then cement swsss p 0 05 whereas the opposite trend was noted for nitrate pvc stainless steel swsss cement swsss p 0 05 reduced ammonia concentrations and elevated nitrate levels were observed in pvc and steel rainwater swss effluents relative to their influents p 0 05 suggesting the occurrence of nitrification during rainwater storage on the contrary no differences were observed for investigated nitrogen species in tap water swsss with different material coupons p 0 05 different metal levels were observed in rainwater and tap water swsss figs 2 and s5 for instance zn was only observed in rainwater swsss average standard deviation 0 44 0 26 mg l while tap water swsss had higher mg 5 57 2 94 vs 0 21 0 21 mg l p 0 05 and ca 15 09 3 96 vs 8 75 6 20 mg l p 0 05 in effluents than rainwater swsss cement tanks tended to have the lowest zn and mg concentrations if present due to the formation of hydroxide precipitates at high ph levels pb 0 03 0 02 mg l and al 0 50 0 19 mg l were only detected in rainwater pvc swss and cement swss effluents respectively due to coupon leaching which exceeded the limits of standards for drinking water quality in china 0 01 mg l for pb and 0 2 mg l for al gb5749 2006 mh and sac 2006 other heavy metals including cd cr cu mn were under detection limits in both rainwater and tap water swsss 3 2 less proliferation of total bacteria in rainwater relative to tap water total bacteria in tap water swsss as indicated by 16s rrna gene numbers increased from 4 5 0 4 log10 gc ml in influents to 5 1 0 3 log10 gc ml in effluents after one week storage fig 3 a and s6 a p 0 05 slightly lower levels of 16s rrna genes were noted in tap water steel swsss relative to that in pvc and cement swsss p 0 05 no significant bacterial proliferation was found in rainwater swsss p 0 05 however an increase of 16s rrna gene numbers was found in stored rainwater after week 16 p 0 05 likely due to the temperature increase caused by seasonal change from winter to spring figs s2 and s6 3 3 distinct op growth patterns in rainwater and tap water swsss to the authors knowledge this study represents the first to compare the growth dynamics of ops in rainwater and tap water storage systems we detected an array of microorganisms including e coli p aeruginosa legionella spp ntm and v vermiformis in fresh stored rainwater and tap water by q pcr however gene markers of l pneumophila m avium and acanthamoeba spp were not found in any sample during the experiment although methods employed in this study may overestimate target microorganisms by detecting dna that is not necessarily present inside a viable cell the increase or reduction of gene copy numbers of target microorganisms in swss effluents relative to the corresponding swss influents indicate that q pcr successfully evaluated trends of target microorganisms fecal indicator e coli although e coli was intermittently detected in swss influents and effluents the majority of samples 90 had gene copy numbers lower than the loq figs 3 b and s6 b high levels of e coli 3 log10 gc ml were sporadically found in rainwater swsss comparable to a reported e coli concentration range of 0 18 2 88 log10 gc ml in rainwater tank samples using the same q pcr assay ahmed et al 2012 in contrast to q pcr detection of low level e coli in tap water systems the culture based method failed to detect e coli in tap water before and after gac filtration i e swss influents no e coli proliferation or attenuation was found during rainwater and tap water storage p 0 05 p aeruginosa p aeruginosa was 100 detected in rainwater and tap water swss influents and effluents fig 3 c and s6 c although lower p aeruginosa numbers were noticed in rainwater swss influents 1 8 0 2 log10 gc ml compared to tap water swss influents 2 1 0 3 log10 gc ml p 0 05 significant growth was only observed in rainwater swsss p 0 05 especially after week 15 rainwater pvc swsss had the highest p aeruginosa numbers of 3 2 1 2 log10 gc ml followed by rainwater steel 2 1 0 4 log10 gc ml and cement swsss 2 0 0 3 log10 gc ml p 0 05 legionella spp though l pneumophila was nondetectable legionella spp containing other pathogenic members waak et al 2018 was tracked to represent the broader trends at the genus level in both rainwater and tap water swsss figs 3 d and s6 d rainwater and tap water influents had comparable legionella concentrations p 0 05 ranging from 1 8 loq to 4 2 log10 gc ml the frequency of detection fod table s3 of legionella decreased from 72 4 in tap water swss influents to 57 in effluents suggesting the attenuation of legionella in tap water after 1 week storage however legionella proliferated dramatically in rainwater pvc and steel swsss p 0 05 with higher gene copy number noted in steel swsss 4 1 0 6 log10 gc ml relative to pvc swsss 3 2 0 9 log10 gc ml p 0 05 ntm while m avium was not detected in this study the mycobacterium genus was tracked as the representative of ntm species figs 3 e and s6 e wang et al 2015 mycobacteria were sporadically detected in rainwater swsss mainly in pvc swsss with a fod of 19 0 and an average concentration of 2 0 0 4 log10 gc ml in positive samples only two rainwater influent samples were positive for mycobacteria concordant with their detection in steel and cement swss effluents in week 33 and 34 in tap water swsss mycobacteria had the highest fod in pvc swsss 48 3 table s3 followed by steel 39 7 and cement swsss 24 1 various mycobacterial growth patterns were observed in tap water swsss with different material coupons namely mycobacteria proliferated in steel and cement swsss within the first 17 weeks but flourished in pvc swsss during weeks 10 34 fig s6 e v vermiformis v vermiformis is not itself a pathogen but considered as an important host for ops delafont et al 2018 v vermiformis tended to grow in rainwater pvc swsss with the average gene copy number increasing from 2 1 1 4 log10 gc ml in the influents to 2 9 0 9 log10 gc ml in the effluents p 0 05 figs 3 f and s6 f on the contrary a declining trend was noted for v vermiformis in rainwater cement swsss 1 3 0 9 log10 gc ml p 0 05 likely due to the alkaline environment in cement systems elevated v vermiformis gene copy numbers were also found in tap water pvc 1 7

pvc coupons had the highest biofilm densities in tap water swsss p 0 05 fig 4 in general the gene copy numbers of targeted ops were higher on pvc coupons especially relative to cement coupons for instance p aeruginosa and v vermiformis densities on pvc coupons were 1 3 log10 higher than those seen on steel and or cement coupons in rainwater swsss p 0 05 the highest legionella densities were also found in pvc biofilms in both rainwater and tap water swsss approximately 0 5 3 log10 higher than those in cement biofilms p 0 05 this is in contrast to the trends in bulk water which demonstrated the highest legionella number in rainwater steel swss effluents and comparable legionella numbers in the effluents of tap water swsss with different material coupons section 3 3 in rainwater swsss mycobacteria were consistently detected in all pvc biofilm samples with an average density of 4 50 0 79 log10 gc cm2 in contrast to their sporadic detection in bulk water section 3 3 in tap water swsss higher mycobacterial numbers were noted in pvc biofilm 4 0 0 6 log10 gene copies cm2 relative to steel biofilm 0 7 1 1 log10 gene copies cm2 p 0 05 mycobacteria were not detected on cement coupons in either rainwater or tap water swsss 3 5 association between ops and water physicochemical parameters weak to moderate correlations were observed between target microorganisms and physicochemical parameters in rainwater and tap water swss effluents fig 5 rho 0 66 p 0 05 in brief gene copy numbers of p aeruginosa legionella and v vermiformis were negatively associated with ph in rainwater swsss rho 0 5 0 43 p 0 05 legionella was found to correlate with conductivity in both rainwater and tap water swsss rho 0 64 0 39 p 0 05 gene copy numbers of p aeruginosa legionella mycobacteria and v vermiformis were negatively associated with ammonia and al concentrations in rainwater swsss rho 0 7 0 25 p 0 05 on the contrary gene copy numbers of p aeruginosa legionella and v vermiformis displayed positive correlation with zn concentrations rho 0 4 0 42 p 0 05 the positive associations between p aeruginosa v vermiformis and pb were also noted in pvc swsss rho 0 55 0 7 p 0 05 further weak to moderate positive correlations were found between any two target microorganisms in rainwater swsss rho 0 25 0 64 p 0 05 with some exceptions mainly when e coli and legionella are involved nmds analyzes were further employed to illustrate the occurrence patterns of ops in swsss and their associations with water physicochemical parameters fig 6 nmds plots and anosim analysis table s4 of rainwater swss samples demonstrated significant shift of the occurrence patterns of target microorganisms during rainwater storage in different material swsss global r 0 353 0 634 p 0 001 clustering of effluent samples according to tank materials was also noted global r 0 399 0 711 p 0 001 highlighting the critical role of tank materials in governing op dynamics in rainwater storage systems the correlations between physicochemical parameters and the ordination configuration demonstrated that ammonia ph al conductivity toc and ca accounted for the upper left shift of the majority of cement swss effluent samples while zn drove the positive direction the shift of pvc samples was associated with pb on the contrary no apparent pattern was observed for samples in tap water swsss 4 discussion 4 1 growth dynamics of total bacteria and ops in rainwater relative to tap water long detention time in water storage facilities is one of the most important factors related to drinking water quality deterioration epa 2002 the increase of 16s rrna genes in tap water swsss was consistent with the findings of a lab study that demonstrated elevated heterotrophic plate counts hpc after 4 7 day storage of tap water in fiberglass polyethylene and cast iron tanks evison and sunna 2001 even overnight stagnation could result in 2 3 fold increase of total cells by flow cytometry or 4 580 fold increase of hpc in household plumbing pipes lautenschlager et al 2010 however microbial quality as a function of storage time in rainwater tanks remained debatable though we did not observe significant growth or attenuation of total bacteria in rainwater swsss other studies observed gradually increased hpc and 16s rrna gene numbers during 60 day storage of rainwater zhang et al 2020 or reduction of hpc total and fecal coliforms during 1 2 week rainwater storage as a result of rainwater nutrient limitation sedimentation and naturally occurring water quality improvement processes amin et al 2013 vasudevan et al 2001 different rainwater chemistry storage practices and cell enumeration methods might account for the result discrepancy among these studies however the increase of p aeruginosa legionella and v vermiformis in rainwater swsss suggested that stagnant rainwater is conducive to the proliferation of some ops ops are known to flourish in drinking water distribution systems once favorable conditions are met falkinham iii et al 2015 compared to tap water roof harvested rainwater typically contains higher organic matters and heavy metals due to the carryover of contaminants from the collection system and or atmosphere abbasi and abbasi 2011 which might include growth factors of ops for example rainwater containing higher zn concentrations fig 2 may stimulate the growth of legionella as zinc is an essential component of legionella s major secretory protein sahney et al 2001 previous studies demonstrated that zn concentrations 0 375 mg l were able to increase legionella colonization risks in hot water by 2 fold bargellini et al 2011 and zinc dose of 0 5 1 mg l supplemented into tap water could increase the proliferation of legionella by 1 log10 conley et al 1985 moreover the higher proliferation tendency of ops relative to e coli in rainwater observed in this study reinforced prior research indicating that fecal indicators used during regular water quality monitoring cannot reflect op contamination and health risks in rainwater for potable and non potable usages hamilton et al 2016 on the contrary stagnant tap water is not favorable to the proliferation of p aeruginosa and legionella in this study similar results were observed in a simulated water heater study that demonstrated the reduction of legionella and p aeruginosa in 37 c chloraminated water even after the disinfectants were gone wang et al 2015 4 2 effect of tank materials on ops in bulk water and biofilm in general plastic based materials e g polyethylene pvc allow more attachment of biomass and fecal indicators relative to the metal based materials e g galvanized and stainless steel in water storage tanks momba and kaleni 2002 obiofu et al 2018 in terms of ops existing literature mainly focused on legionella biofilm formation potential on various premise plumbing materials e g pvc pe copper stainless steel which typically demonstrated the enhanced legionella growth on synthetic polymeric materials relative to inert materials e g stainless steel and glass van der kooij et al 2020 2005 consistently the present study also demonstrated the highest biofilm formation potential of target microorganisms on pvc coupons in rainwater and or tap water swsss in cement swsss the inhibitory effects toward legionella mycobacteria and v vermiformis were associated with the high ph levels legionella species survive and multiply in the ph range 5 5 9 2 and a ph 9 had been proposed as an approach to control legionella in cooling towers conley et al 1987 mycobacteria prefer acidic to neutral ph environment e g ph 4 6 7 4 portaels and pattyn 1982 it has been reported that ph around 8 9 is inductive to the encystment of v vermiformis resulting in suppressed metabolic activities to resist adverse conditions delafont et al 2018 since elevated ph is commonly observed in rainwater cement tanks in the present study ph 10 during the study period and others 8 1 10 islam et al 2010 thomas et al 2018 cement tanks could be recommended for rainwater storage to minimize the colonization of ops when rainwater is used for non potable purposes e g building washing toilet flushing garden watering other advantages of cement tanks include neutralizing rainwater with low ph e g acid rain lawson et al 2009 and sedimentation of heavy metals abbasi and abbasi 2011 tank material effect on bulk water and biofilm differed for legionella and mycobacteria which might relate to the different ecological niches of biofilms and water phase for instance ntm prefer to attach to surfaces and form biofilm due to the hydrophobicity of cell membrane falkinham 2009 since free living amoebae occur frequently in biofilm and can graze on biofilm associated bacteria cateau et al 2014 residence in biofilms also makes legionella and mycobacteria more accessible to their amoebal hosts enhancing their proliferation in engineered water systems falkinham iii et al 2015 thomas and ashbolt 2010 however the reason for the highest legionella in bulk water of rainwater steel swsss remained unclear although trace metals released from steel coupons e g iron manganese were speculated to stimulate legionella growth our heavy metal analysis figs 2 and s5 indicated comparable levels of these ions in rainwater pvc and steel swsss other uninvestigated factors such as cell detachment from steel surfaces unique ecological niche created in rainwater steel swsss might account for the higher legionella numbers in steel swss bulk water 4 3 factors affecting the op occurrence pattern in rainwater tanks as discussed above the negative associations between target microorganisms and ph could be explained by the inhibitory effect of high ph i e ph 10 towards ops and the positive associations between target microorganisms and zn are due to the involvement of zinc in cell metabolisms banerji et al 2005 lee et al 2014 the negative associations between target microorganisms and ammonia al are likely a direct reflection of the fact that cement rainwater swsss had the highest ammonia al concentrations and the lowest gene copy numbers of target microorganisms the positive associations between p aeruginosa v vermiformis and pb is likely an artifact since pb was only detected in pvc swsss where the highest gene copy numbers of p aeruginosa and v vermiformis were detected furthermore weak to moderate correlations between target microorganisms and water chemistry parameters indicated that other uninvestigated factors might account for the growth of ops in rainwater overall the results suggested that tank materials can have a significant influence on physicochemical qualities and the occurrence of ops in stored rainwater positive correlations between target microorganisms in rainwater swsss were consistent with the findings in drinking water systems wang et al 2012b positive correlations between v vermiformis and p aeruginosa legionella mycobacteria is likely a reflection of host pathogen interactions cateau et al 2008 delafont et al 2018 wadowsky et al 1991 v vermiformis is not only a grazer of bacteria in natural biofilm communities but also a host of numerous bacteria including legionella p aeruginosa and mycobacteria delafont et al 2018 the absence of acanthamoeba in rainwater and tap water swsss were in accordance with previous studies reporting rarer isolation rates and lower densities of acanthamoeba than v vermiformis in different water environments delafont et al 2018 moreover some studies suggested that the proliferation of legionella in engineered water systems is more closely associated with v vermiformis relative to acanthamoeba thomas et al 2014 valster et al 2010 therefore detection and control of v vermiformis could be a part of the regular microbial monitoring in rainwater systems to mitigate op risks 5 conclusions this study provided a comprehensive comparison of the growth dynamics of ops and related microorganisms in stored rainwater and tap water using swsss with different material coupons the key findings include natural occurrences of p aeruginosa legionella spp mycobacteria and v vermiformis in swss bulk water and biofilm samples indicated that both rainwater and tap water storage systems could be op reservoirs higher growth potential of p aeruginosa and legionella was found in rainwater relative to tap water while v vermiformis could proliferate in both rainwater and tap water polyvinyl chloride pvc swsss the results highlighted the necessity of op control and management in rainwater storage systems tank materials exerted stronger influence on target microorganisms in rainwater swsss relative to tap water swsss with species specific responses noted in bulk water and biofilm different tank material effects observed between rainwater and tap water swsss illustrated that it is inappropriate to generalize the design and management experiences in tap water systems to rainwater systems further studies deciphering broader microbial ecology in rainwater storage systems would be of interest considering the complex microbial interactions between ops and other microbes as well as important ecological niches of biofilm and sediments in rainwater tanks declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgments this study

16634,the increasing microplastic pollution together with the plastisphere associated ecological threats in coastal areas have aroused global concern tropical cyclones have been increased in both frequency and intensity under global warming causing intense impact on the microplastics distribution and the structure of coastal ecosystems however until most currently the extent to which typhoon impacts the microplastics and plastisphere community remains poorly known this study analyzed the effects of typhoon wipha code 1907 on microplastics abundance and composition in surface water and sediment crossed coastal areas of shenzhen here we found a significant typhoon induced increase in microplastics abundance in surface water whereas an opposite trend was observed in sediment despite the evident transportation of microplastics from sediment to surface water by agitation a possible microplastics influx was introduced by typhoon as evidenced by the large attribution of unknown force in source tracking analysis furthermore typhoon had adeptly uniformed the plastisphere community in the sediment along the 190 km costal line overnight a significant increase of nitrogen fixer bradyrhizobiaceae was observed ubiquitously after typhoon which might alter the nitrogen cycling and increase eutrophic condition of the coastal ecological system together this study expanded the knowledge about the impact of typhoon induced influx of the microplastics on coastal biogeochemical cycling moreover the microplastics and the plastisphere compositional pattern revealed here will underpin future studies on adsorption behavior interfacial processes and ecotoxicity of the coastal microplastic pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords typhoon microplastics coastal areas plastisphere 1 introduction the emergence of plastic has provided huge social benefits but also brought serious environmental problems thompson et al 2009 according to the updated statistics 368 million tons of plastics have been produced globally in 2019 plasticseurope 2020 and the output is expected to double in the next 20 years alimi et al 2018 it is no exaggeration to say that we live in the plasticene era reed 2015 of this only 6 26 of the plastic is recycled which means that up to 94 of the plastic is kept in the environment alimi et al 2018 after a period of weathering processes such as photooxidation gewert et al 2015 ter halle et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 biodegradation hergenrother et al 1992 kandasamy 2003 and mechanical abrasions karp et al 1988 the plastic will eventually become microplastics 5 mm in size betts 2008 large amounts of microplastics have been found in the ocean mu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 lakes su et al 2016 rivers eo et al 2019 soil de souza machado et al 2018 and sewage treatment plants sun et al 2019 etc studies have shown that microplastics have a negative impact on organisms jeong and choi 2019 and humans are also exposed to microplastics via the food chain nowadays microplastic pollution is deemed as an emerging environmental and human health crisis kane et al 2020 wu et al 2020 due to the long half life and the hydrophobic surface of plastics it is generally believed that microplastics can be served as vehicles to promote microbial colonization and biofilm formation zettler et al 2013 the so called plastisphere and eventually become a pelagic habitat for microorganisms at the same time microplastics provide more ways for the long distance transmission of potentially pathogenic microorganisms yang et al 2020 posting ecological impacts on the original ecosystem viršek et al 2017 although some studies have shown that microplastics in the marine environment are rapidly colonized by microorganisms harrison et al 2014 the plastisphere community in marine sediment is still largely unexplored amaral zettler et al 2020 besides that extreme storm events such as tropical cyclones i e tropical storms and typhoons can significantly affect coastal ecosystems ares et al 2020 the total number of typhoons observed during the period from 1979 to 2018 was approximately 640 in the western north pacific shan and yu 2020 and the tropical cyclones will increase in both frequency and intensity with climate changing ares et al 2020 owing to the ecological threat of microplastics many researchers have focused on the shaping factors of microplastics distribution in the environment including natural and anthropogenic factors alam et al 2019 quesadas rojas et al 2021 wilson et al 2021 previous studies have stated that typhoons could alter the microplastic abundance composition and distribution lo et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2015 however the studies above only attempted to evaluate the effect of typhoon on the distribution of coastal microplastics the extent to which the impacts of typhoons on the distribution of microplastics as well as the plastisphere community in both water and sediment still remains poorly known lo et al 2020 therefore more research is urgently needed to better understand how do the typhoons impact the microplastic distribution in the environment and ultimately impact ecosystem function by regulating microplastics distribution the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area known as the greater bay area gba is praised as one of the four bay areas in the world together with new york bay area san francisco bay area and tokyo bay area hui et al 2020 shenzhen one of the four engines for building gba is the first special economic zone in china to lead reform and opening up wu et al 2020 however with the rapid development environmental issues have followed closely several studies have shown that there are high concentrations of microplastics in some mangroves and estuaries of shenzhen wu et al 2020 zuo et al 2020 besides that shenzhen coastal areas have been frequently affected by typhoons with a total number of 29 entering the 500 km warning zone of shenzhen from 2015 to 2018 reported by the meteorological bureau of shenzhen municipality therefore it is essential to conduct a systematic microplastic survey on shenzhen coastal areas before and after typhoon to uncover the interference of typhoon on the distribution of microplastics and microbial community and further help to improve the database of microplastics pollution in the gba taking advantage of shenzhen s natural contours of the coastline the microplastics in surface water and sediment were collected along the 190 km shoreline of shenzhen city before and after the summer tropical cyclone attack by typhoon wipha code 1907 maximum wind force near the center was 9 in 2019 the microplastics abundance and composition as well as the microbial community of the attached biofilm hereafter plastisphere was measured with mainstream analytical and bioinformatic pipelines with the purpose to 1 reveal microplastic pollution influx introduced by typhoon 2 decipher the influence of typhoon on plastisphere community 3 disclose potential ecological threats to coastal environment associated with typhoon induced microplastics variation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection surface seawater and sediment samples were collected from 9 sites along the coastal line of shenzhen fig 1 the latitude and longitude information of the sampling sites is displayed in table s1 sites 1 s1 is the estuary of the maozhou river the largest river of shenzhen while sites 2 s2 sites 3 s3 sites 4 s4 and sites 5 s5 are in the park area sites 6 s6 sites 7 s7 sites 8 s8 and sites 9 s9 are in the exposed sandy beach area sites s6 s9 are in intertidal area while s1 s5 belong to the subtidal zone in this case a stainless steel shovel was used for samples from s6 s9 while the box corer was used for sampling at sites s1 s5 typhoon wipha landed on the coast of zhanjiang city guangdong province at 17 40 on august 1st 2019 with the maximum wind force near the center as 9 sampling was taken timely before july 22 2019 and after august 2 2019 the time typhoon wipha attacked shenzhen and before that s1 s9 had not been subjected to any cleanup activities organized by the authorities on each site 5 l surface water was sampled by a stainless steel bucket from the top 20 cm of the water body and then preserved in 4 c until further analysis 1 kg of surface sediments top 0 5 cm were collected at each site martin et al 2017 tally et al 2020 and then transported into aluminum foil bags and stored in a refrigerated enclosure 4 c before analysis two replicates were taken at each site for both water and sediment samples firdaus et al 2020 pavithran et al 2021 2 2 microplastics extraction and observation following our previous protocols wu et al 2020 the surface water samples were treated with 30 h2o2 for 12hours before each sample was filtered through the gf c glass microfiber filter paper 47 mm ø 0 45 μm pore size and the sediment samples were separated by flotation the moisture content of sediment samples was calculated and then a certain quality of wet sediment 100 g dry weight was selected from each sample to perform peroxide oxidation with 30 h2o2 samples that need to explore microbial information on microplastics were not subjected to peroxide oxidation all the selected sediment samples were suspended in 1 l of zncl2 solution density 1 6 1 7 g cm3 and stirred for 30minutes the mixture was allowed to settle deposit for 24 h and afterwards the supernatant was passed through the 0 45 μm gf c glass microfiber filter paper 30 μm nylon filter paper for microorganism extraction to optimize the recovery rate of microplastics this separation process was performed twice after extraction all filter papers were transferred to the glass dish with a lid for further identification and observation to avoid potential contamination in the laboratory a series of procedural controls used by wu et al wu et al 2020 and nuelle et al nuelle et al 2014 were taken in this work keeping the workplace always clean the non textile lab coats masks and nitrile gloves were always worn the covering of all containers was washed 3 times with milli q water millipore co usa before reuse during the flotation process the sediment samples were covered with tinfoil before filtering potential airborne contamination was assessed by sucking the air through a clean glass fiber membrane 47 mm ø 0 45 μm pore size this test result showed no microplastics observed confirming that the lab environment is suitable for performing microplastic experiments the microplastics were enumerated by categorizing them according to 3 size classes class 1 1 5 mm class 2 0 5 1 mm and class 3 0 5 mm the microplastics were also classified according to shape sphere foam film fiber and fragment and color purple transparent white black yellow green blue and red all the suspected microplastics in class 1 and class 2 were retrieved from the filter and confirmed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet is5 thermo scientific usa for the microplastics in class 3 the identification procedure was directly conducted on the ftir microscope μ ftir configured with a ge tip atr nicolet in10 mx thermo scientific usa the spectra obtained were compared with the reference spectra in the hummel polymer library and matching of 70 was considered reliable 2 3 dna extraction sequences processing and bioinformatics analysis for sediment plastisphere total genomic dna was extracted in duplicate from microplastic samples using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp bio solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the concentration of dna was quantified with a nanodrop spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa the duplicate dna extracts were then mixed for pcr amplification universal bacterial primers 515f and 907r targeting v4 v5 region were used to amplify the 16s rrna gene of the total genomic dna xiong et al 2012 finally the extracted and purified pcr products were sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform magigene co ltd guangzhou china with pe250 strategy samples collected from sites s1 s5 s8 and s9 of before the typhoon and sites s1 and s2 after the typhoon were sequenced with two biological replicates qiime1 software package was used to demultiplex and quality filter the resulting illumina reads to remove low quality sequences with default parameters caporaso et al 2010 and chimeric sequences were further identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 the sequences were clustered into otus operational taxonomic units at 97 level similarity taxonomy annotation was conducted by aligning the representative sequences for each otu against the silva database https www arb silva de quast et al 2012 the alpha diversity indexes of shannon and pielou s evenness was calculated by default qiime1 protocols the picrust2 pipeline was used to forecast the functional potential of microbial communities douglas et al 2020 2 4 statistical analysis the units of the microplastic abundances in surface water and sediment were recorded as the number of microplastics per liter n l and the number of microplastics per kilogram dry weight n kg dw respectively all statistical analyses were performed using r or spss 22 0 software kolmogorov smirnov test was used to test the microplastic abundance data for normality and the results showed a non normal distribution therefore the microplastic abundance data was ln transformed before variation between before and after typhoon samples were assessed using the paired sample t test the correlation between microplastic abundances before and after typhoons was tested using pearson s correlation analysis the spearman s correlation coefficient between the otus was used to establish the co occurrence networks of bacterial communities the student s t test was used to compare the means of alpha diversity indexes derived from different groups principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed to visualize bacterial community clustering among samples the clustering significance between sample categories was evaluated using analysis of similarity anosim statistics with the vegan r package clarke 1993 distance based redundancy analysis db rda was performed to explore the correlation between plastisphere community and microplastic characterization with the vegan r package the bray curtis distance was used to calculate the similarity of the plastisphere community between the samples before the db rda we used the forward selection procedure to select microplastic characterization using the forward sel function from the packfor r package dray et al 2007 spearman correlation analysis were conducted to delineate correlations between microplastic characteristics and relative abundance of otus using spss software with the threshold of r 0 6 and p 0 01 2 5 source tracking analysis in this study sourcetracker was used to perform source tracking analysis knights et al 2011 since most plastic debris accumulates in the sediment claessens et al 2011 we assume that it can serve as a source leaving the water as a sink sourcetracker uses a bayesian approach to estimate the proportion of microorganisms in a given community that come from possible source environments claessens et al 2011 here we performed plastic community source tracking based on chemical composition the wilcoxon test was used to compare the sediment source proportions before and after the typhoon 3 results and discussion 3 1 typhoon induced redistribution of microplastics from sediment to surface water microplastics were detected in all the surface water and sediment samples collected before and after the typhoon showing the pervasiveness of microplastic contamination in shenzhen coastal areas fig 2 for water samples the average microplastic abundance was respectively 35 6 22 1n l and 42 0 13 3n l se before and after typhoon period respectively which was comparable with the previous study xia et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 for sediment samples the average microplastic abundance was respectively 4955 8 2325 0n kg and 3198 0 3107 3n kg se for the pre and post typhoon period and was also comparable to that reported for qinzhou bay li et al 2018 and maowei sea li et al 2019 before typhoon microplastic distribution exhibited evident heterogeneity in both water and sediment across the shoreline fig 2 the abundance of microplastics at s1 and s2 is obviously higher than that of other sites s1 is located downstream the heavily polluted maozhou river and adjacent to the pearl river estuary where water velocity slows down fig 1 and the hydrodynamic condition of the site is conducive to the accumulation of microplastics ding et al 2019 wu et al 2020 s2 is also close to the pearl river estuary and surrounded by residence and industrial parks where locate numerous plastic and electronic products producing factories causing the high microplastic abundance at s2 andrady 2011 the disturbance during typhoon showed opposite impact on microplastic concentration in surface water and sediment figs 2a b typhoon significantly increased the average microplastic abundance by approximately 18 for surface water samples whereas the average microplastic abundance in the sediment dropped about 35 after the typhoon as expected typhoons agitated the coastal sediment prompting the microplastics that settled in the sediment to be released again resulting in the decrease of average microplastic abundance while the released microplastics were resuspended and redistributed together with the original microplastics in the water resulting in an increase of microplastic abundance in surface water previous studies have also discovered that typhoon induced exogenous input and sediment resuspension could significantly increase the nutrient levels of water ding et al 2012 gao et al 2021 worth to note is that the microplastic abundance at s2 was decreased by 47 after the typhoon which is contradictory to other water samples fig s4 s2 is located in the mangrove wetland park where the coastal mangrove forests can serve as natural shelter against waves and tides hayden and granek 2015 the well developed root system of mangroves was natural buffer against the typhoon disturbance consequently there was no significant release of microplastics in the sediments of s2 after the typhoon fig 2b without release of microplastics from the sediment the microplastics in surface water were diffused and thus diluted by waves resulting in a decrease in the concentration in the surface water at this site therefore impact of typhoon on microplastic abundance is site specific and affected by the combined effects of typhoon trajectory and topography of the sampling sites which can be reflected from another study conducted at four beaches in hong kong reporting that the cyclone led to an increase of average microplastic abundance lo et al 2020 despite such site specific pattern significant positive correlation between microplastic abundance before and after typhoon was observed in both surface water and sediment samples figs 2c d suggesting that the impact of typhoon induced disturbance is generally comparable among sites and not strong enough to reshape the overall microplastic background along coastline in summary despite the effect of typhoon could be site specific and related to factors such as orientation and topography of the site a general redistribution of microplastics from sediment to surface water was observed previous studies have shown that typhoons affected the hydrodynamic conditions of estuaries and bays causing the resuspension of fine grained sediments and destroying the previously stratified water column lou et al 2016 nowacki and ganju 2018 compared with fine particle sediments the microplastics are more susceptible to typhoon processes with smaller particle size and density therefore by disturbing the microplastics the typhoons may further promote the spread of contaminants and microorganisms absorbed attached to the microplastics increasing the risk of biological exposure and ultimately affect the stability of the ecosystem 3 2 typhoon induced microplastics influx as revealed by altered composition and source tracking analysis the size color and shape are important features facilitating the identification of potential sources and hazards of microplastics therefore such composition information of microplastics in surface water fig s1 and sediments fig s2 were measured at all sites before and after typhoon in this work microplastics collected were grouped into three size categories 0 5 mm 0 5 1 mm and 1 5 mm microplastics with size 0 5 mm were the most abundant prevalent in surface water and sediment samples in surface water the microplastics 0 5 mm accounted for 70 2 and 51 7 before and after typhoon respectively fig 3 a in the sediment samples the proportion of microplastics 0 5 mm was comparable to that in surface water with average values of 88 4 and 53 0 respectively for samples before and after typhoon period a previous study showed a comparable size distribution of the microplastics 63 of microplastics with size 0 5 mm in marine sediments collected from the south yellow sea and the east china sea zhang et al 2019 additionally the declined proportion of small sized microplastics 0 5 mm after typhoon was also observed in the previous study on hong kong beaches lo et al 2020 the decline proportion of small sized microplastics in surface water might be attributed to the introduction of large sized microplastics by typhoon from open sea for sediment the fast resuspension of small sized microplastics might be the main reason for its decreasing proportion the microplastics collected were in various colors such as black white transparent and colored red blue green yellow purple in all surface water samples transparent microplastics were the major part followed by colored black and white fig 3a since the weathering process will cause microplastic decoloring he et al 2019 the high concentration of transparent microplastics in water may be attributed to the fact that the microplastics are more susceptible to weathering processes such as photooxidation wave erosion in the surface water after typhoon the proportion of transparent microplastics in the surface water samples increased from 59 6 to 83 5 while the percentage of transparent microplastics in the sediment samples dramatically decreased from 60 2 to 26 1 which is consistent with the previous study wang et al 2019a it is worth noting that a certain number of purple microplastics appeared in the surface water and sediments after the typhoon indicating the import of microplastics caused by typhoon according to the previous research hidalgo ruz et al 2012 microplastics detected in our study can be segmented into five groups fragment fiber film foam and sphere fig 3a showing that the fragment and fiber were the most abundant microplastics in the surface water and sediments the microplastics is defined as fragment when it cannot be defined as fiber film foam or sphere fishing tools cole et al 2011 and clothes browne et al 2011 can be important sources of fibers while the breakdown of plastic containers packaging materials and cosmetics is the source of fragments napper et al 2015 yan et al 2019 in this case the high proportion of fragment and fiber in shenzhen coastal areas can be attributed to the plastic manufacture industries fisheries and tourism before typhoon the fragments were numerically dominant in surface water and sediment accounting for 59 6 and 76 2 respectively after typhoon the proportion of fragments decreased but the proportion of fibers in surface water and sediments increased reaching 65 8 and 51 9 respectively these results indicated a typhoon associated influx of fiber like microplastics which has significantly altered the shape distribution of microplastics in the coastal areas pcoa based on the microplastics appearance characteristics size shape and color showed clear clustering between samples collected before and after typhoon in both surface water p 0 001 and sediment p 0 001 fig 3b although typhoons can cause severe erosion on beaches mudflats and other coastal areas leading to the alteration of microplastics appearance aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 the unbalanced increase of fiber like and purple microplastics in surface water suggested a typhoon induced microplastic influx the variation in color distribution of microplastics may change the colonization of microorganisms and functional diversity of the plastisphere wen et al 2020 such typhoon induced alternation may disturb the feeding behavior of organisms de tender et al 2015 yang et al 2020 and eventually disturb the stability of coastal ecosystem generally it is not easy to determine the source of microplastics in surface water and sediment but their type may provide a potential indication wang et al 2019b the type of microplastics randomly selected from each sample were identified by μ ftir typical ftir spectra and images of the selected microplastics are shown in fig s3b cellophane polystyrene ps polypropylene pp polyester pet polyethylene pe and other polymers polyvinyl chloride polyamide were found in the samples collected from the shenzhen coastal area fig s3a in surface water pet cellophane pp and pe accounted for 29 7 25 9 23 5 and 20 9 of the microplastic contents respectively after typhoons the fraction of cellophane increased to 67 0 whereas those of pe pp and pet decreased to 11 9 9 8 and 9 5 respectively in sediment samples before typhoon the cellophane accounted for the largest proportion 44 5 followed by pe 29 2 pet 14 2 and pp 11 7 however for the sediment after typhoon the proportion of cellophane and pp changed slightly within 0 4 while that of the pet and pp changed to 17 7 and 22 8 respectively fig s3a as the most commonly identified type in the present study cellophane is an organic cellulose based polymer commonly used in cigarettes and food packaging paper yan et al 2019 prior investigations have pointed out the widespread of cellophane microplastic particles in water systems castillo et al 2016 lo et al 2020 yang et al 2015 while the possible sources can be attributed to the atmospheric fall out effluent from sewage treatment works and soil application of the residual sludge bråte et al 2018 pp and pe often existing as plastic bags bottles and fishing tools etc are also common types of polymers in coastal environments andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 worth noting is that the diversity of polymer types in the shenzhen coastal areas has increased after typhoon such as the emergence of ps and polyamide which are generally used in cosmetics daily decoration liu et al 2018 and textile zhu et al 2018 which again supported the notion of typhoon induced microplastics influx at coastal areas to further illustrate the microplastics influx brought by typhoon we estimated the contribution of sediment microplastics to those in surface water based on chemical characteristics using sourcetracker in general before typhoon the microplastic community in water tended to be composed mainly from sediment whereas that after the typhoon was more attributed from unknown source fig 4 a which is obviously associated with typhoon induced microplastics influx the overall contribution of sediment to water decreased significantly after the typhoon fig 4b wilcoxon test p 0 01 and the abundance of microplastics in water was increased significantly after the typhoon fig 2a taken together typhoon wipha might have driven the microplastics from open ocean to the coastal areas of shenzhen given the general properties of microplastics to carry pathogenic or invasive microorganisms bhagwat et al 2021 viršek et al 2017 such typhoon induced influx may inevitably impact the local ecological system 3 3 the promptly uniformed plastisphere community by typhoon to reveal the impact of typhoon on microbial community and identify potential biological threats associated 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed on the microplastics attached biofilm the so called plastisphere in sediment samples with several sites excluded owning to pcr failure caused by low biomass site s3 of samples before the typhoon and sites s6 s7 s8 and s9 after the typhoon a total of 299 142 high quality sequences were obtained with an average of 16 619 sequences per sample correlation between taxa relative abundance of biological replicates displayed good consistency table s3 67 of spearman s correlation r 0 67 thus relative abundances were averaged for further analysis plastisphere before the typhoon was dominated by proteobacteria 55 32 bacteroidetes 9 25 acidobacteria 9 13 cyanobacteria 6 90 and actinobacteria 4 99 by comparison plastisphere after the typhoon was dominated by proteobacteria 75 03 actinobacteria 7 40 tenericutes 3 51 acidobacteria 3 29 and cyanobacteria 2 65 fig 5 a consistent with previous studies proteobacteria was the most predominant phylum wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 whether before or after the typhoon a possible explanation is that the marine microbiome was universally predominated by proteobacteria hoshino et al 2020 sunagawa et al 2015 which necessitates the prevalence of proteobacteria in sediment plastisphere furthermore bradyrhizobiaceae comamonadaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae the most abundant taxa belonging to proteobacteria in this study are often important members for the formation of biofilms barnes et al 2015 chao et al 2015 di gregorio et al 2017 the high biofilm forming ability maybe another significant explanation for the domination of proteobacteria in plastisphere to further identify plastisphere community response to typhoon perturbation we focused on changes in alpha and beta diversity both shannon and pielou s evenness indexes indicated that the bacterial alpha diversity in the plastisphere decreased significantly after the typhoon fig s5 t test p 0 05 interestingly the coefficient of variation cv of shannon and pielou s evenness indexes also both decreased after the typhoon fig s5 suggesting that communities become more similar after the typhoon perturbation next plastisphere community structure was compared among samples using pcoa analysis which measures dissimilarity among communities to represent beta diversity the results showed that the plastisphere communities before and after the typhoon were significantly distinct from each other fig 5c anosim r 0 39 p 0 01 and those after typhoons were firmly clustered together indicating a promptly uniformed plastisphere community after typhoon a previous study has reported a typhoon induced adaptation in bacterial community composition of lake water jones et al 2008 as such in addition to the extensive mixing of microplastics in the sediment and surface water the geographically wide reaching perturbation during typhoon would redistribute microplastics among its affecting areas resulting in direct homogenization of plastisphere across the shoreline after typhoon 3 4 bacterial co occurrence pattern and potential metabolic functions a co occurrence network analysis on the microplastics microbiome was performed to better understand the biofilm formation pattern and potential microbial interaction among taxa in the plastisphere community a total of 76 nodes showed 75 5 positive and 24 5 negative correlations within total 322 interaction links fig 6 positive relationship may arise from cross feeding and co aggregation in biofilms whereas negative relationship implies a competitive interaction faust and raes 2012 the observed modularity index 0 676 0 4 indicates that the network has a modular structure newman 2006 six distinct individual modules were observed for the network of plastisphere bacterial otus the alphaproteobacteria was the most abundant class in the co occurrence network which is consistent with the previous study on marine ecosystem debroas et al 2017 furthermore the microbial keystone taxa are highly connected taxa within community which are critical for maintaining community structure and functions banerjee et al 2018 in the network otu1 bradyrhizobiaceae otu18 phyllobacteriaceae otu99 flavobacteriaceae and otu753 rhodobacteraceae are inferred to be keystone taxa within the plastisphere community fig 6a the bradyrhizobiaceae has the capability of biological nitrogen fixation de souza et al 2014 which suggests that otu1 may in some circumstances provide nitrogen nutrition for other plastisphere members the ability of rhodobacteraceae to produce quorum sensing signals regulating biofilm formation huang et al 2009 suggests that otu753 may contribute to the biofilm formation and stability of plastisphere as such these keystone taxa can play vital role in the biofilm formation and maintenance of the plastisphere a change in the composition of microbial population may be accompanied by variation in metabolic function to confirm the effects of typhoon on functional diversity of plastisphere a function prediction analysis was conducted using picrust2 the mean sd of the nearest sequenced taxon index nsti value was 0 327 0 323 fig s6 which was far below the maximum confidence cutoff by default in picrust2 value of 2 douglas et al 2019 and comparable to other environmental studies applied this tool ogola et al 2021 toole et al 2021 suggesting that the predicted functionality of the plastisphere had high confidence and sequence identity consistent with the previous study jiang et al 2018 the metabolic pathway of the plastisphere community was dominated by amino acid metabolism 11 07 0 20 followed by carbohydrate metabolism 8 72 0 23 fig 7 overall the functionality of the plastisphere differed significantly before and after the typhoon the metabolic pathway abundance of biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics including styrene aminobenzoate and benzoate fig s7 increased significantly following the typhoon suggesting bacteria capable of utilizing plastic polymers or the additives increased after the typhoon ye et al 2021 together these results revealed that typhoon could affect microbial community and metabolic performance of plastisphere simultaneously 3 5 increased nitrogen fixation potential in plastisphere community after typhoon the db rda analysis was further performed to estimate the effect of the characterization of microplastics on plastisphere community the results showed that only plastic color was significantly correlated with the plastisphere community composition using the forward model selection fig 5d p 0 05 whereas size shape and material type showed no significant correlation this is similar to previous observations that the plastic colors affected the community structure of plastisphere and the blue microplastics accommodated more unique species of burkholderiaceae wen et al 2020 however we found the transparent microplastics as the main shaping factor of plastisphere community in this study rather than other pigment colors the microplastic color before typhoon was mainly composed of transparent 64 9 whereas the microplastics of other pigment colors 72 7 was the main component after typhoon the pigments and additives of plastics may be acting as an organic source for the plastisphere community and affecting the selection of microbial biofilm composition mccormick et al 2014 wen et al 2020 therefore plastisphere divergency before and after typhoon may be attributed to the metabolite behavior of microbes towards microplastics of different color pigments suggesting a plastic color additive induced selection of plastisphere community interestingly the most abundant otu1 affiliated with bradyrhizobiaceae was only significantly affected by the percentage of transparent microplastics exhibiting a negative relationship r 0 69 p 0 01 fig 8 the enrichment cultures of bradyrhizobiaceae must be incubated in the dark de souza et al 2014 suggesting that the growth of bradyrhizobiaceae could be inhibited by the sunlight therefore the greater light intensity on transparent microplastics would repress dominancy of bradyrhizobiaceae by positive selection the reduced proportion of the transparent microplastic after typhoon helped to remove a weighty ecological barrier for this adaptive population resulting in its boost in the plastisphere community soon after typhoon more importantly many species affiliated with bradyrhizobiaceae have shown capability to biologically fix nitrogen de souza et al 2014 lindström and mousavi 2020 confirming their roles in natural nitrogen cycling therefore the increased abundance of bradyrhizobiaceae may promote the process of nitrogen fixation and add nitrogen input to sediments such increase in the microbial nitrogen fixation potential in sediments plus an important contribution of settled sediments microbiome in overall coastal nitrogen fixation process hou et al 2018 indicates that typhoon wipha would potentially alter the nitrogen cycling and increase eutrophic condition of the coastal environment of shenzhen and therefore with frequently occurrence of typhoon events in shenzhen lai et al 2015 it can be anticipated that their impact on the plastisphere and nitrogen cycling is non negligible and would cause fierce disturbances on coastal ecosystem biogeochemical processes 4 conclusions this work at shenzhen a representative city in the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area reported that typhoon wipha increased the average microplastic abundances in surface water by about 18 and decreased the average microplastic abundances in sediment by about 35 typhoon induced microplastics influx could be inferred by the increased contribution of typhoon associated unknown source by sourcetracker and the unbalanced increase of fiber like purple microplastics after typhoon in surface water additionally the wide reaching disturbance and erosion effects of typhoons can promote the redistribution of microplastics in surface water and sediments across the shoreline which leads to a promptly uniformed plastisphere community with potential enrichment of nitrogen fixer in coastal environment this study provides valuable information for a more integrated and dynamic understanding of coastal microplastic contamination under the impact of global climate change further work at different geographical locations of the ocean coastline sea to different meteorological events will be needed to

16634,the increasing microplastic pollution together with the plastisphere associated ecological threats in coastal areas have aroused global concern tropical cyclones have been increased in both frequency and intensity under global warming causing intense impact on the microplastics distribution and the structure of coastal ecosystems however until most currently the extent to which typhoon impacts the microplastics and plastisphere community remains poorly known this study analyzed the effects of typhoon wipha code 1907 on microplastics abundance and composition in surface water and sediment crossed coastal areas of shenzhen here we found a significant typhoon induced increase in microplastics abundance in surface water whereas an opposite trend was observed in sediment despite the evident transportation of microplastics from sediment to surface water by agitation a possible microplastics influx was introduced by typhoon as evidenced by the large attribution of unknown force in source tracking analysis furthermore typhoon had adeptly uniformed the plastisphere community in the sediment along the 190 km costal line overnight a significant increase of nitrogen fixer bradyrhizobiaceae was observed ubiquitously after typhoon which might alter the nitrogen cycling and increase eutrophic condition of the coastal ecological system together this study expanded the knowledge about the impact of typhoon induced influx of the microplastics on coastal biogeochemical cycling moreover the microplastics and the plastisphere compositional pattern revealed here will underpin future studies on adsorption behavior interfacial processes and ecotoxicity of the coastal microplastic pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords typhoon microplastics coastal areas plastisphere 1 introduction the emergence of plastic has provided huge social benefits but also brought serious environmental problems thompson et al 2009 according to the updated statistics 368 million tons of plastics have been produced globally in 2019 plasticseurope 2020 and the output is expected to double in the next 20 years alimi et al 2018 it is no exaggeration to say that we live in the plasticene era reed 2015 of this only 6 26 of the plastic is recycled which means that up to 94 of the plastic is kept in the environment alimi et al 2018 after a period of weathering processes such as photooxidation gewert et al 2015 ter halle et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 biodegradation hergenrother et al 1992 kandasamy 2003 and mechanical abrasions karp et al 1988 the plastic will eventually become microplastics 5 mm in size betts 2008 large amounts of microplastics have been found in the ocean mu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 lakes su et al 2016 rivers eo et al 2019 soil de souza machado et al 2018 and sewage treatment plants sun et al 2019 etc studies have shown that microplastics have a negative impact on organisms jeong and choi 2019 and humans are also exposed to microplastics via the food chain nowadays microplastic pollution is deemed as an emerging environmental and human health crisis kane et al 2020 wu et al 2020 due to the long half life and the hydrophobic surface of plastics it is generally believed that microplastics can be served as vehicles to promote microbial colonization and biofilm formation zettler et al 2013 the so called plastisphere and eventually become a pelagic habitat for microorganisms at the same time microplastics provide more ways for the long distance transmission of potentially pathogenic microorganisms yang et al 2020 posting ecological impacts on the original ecosystem viršek et al 2017 although some studies have shown that microplastics in the marine environment are rapidly colonized by microorganisms harrison et al 2014 the plastisphere community in marine sediment is still largely unexplored amaral zettler et al 2020 besides that extreme storm events such as tropical cyclones i e tropical storms and typhoons can significantly affect coastal ecosystems ares et al 2020 the total number of typhoons observed during the period from 1979 to 2018 was approximately 640 in the western north pacific shan and yu 2020 and the tropical cyclones will increase in both frequency and intensity with climate changing ares et al 2020 owing to the ecological threat of microplastics many researchers have focused on the shaping factors of microplastics distribution in the environment including natural and anthropogenic factors alam et al 2019 quesadas rojas et al 2021 wilson et al 2021 previous studies have stated that typhoons could alter the microplastic abundance composition and distribution lo et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2015 however the studies above only attempted to evaluate the effect of typhoon on the distribution of coastal microplastics the extent to which the impacts of typhoons on the distribution of microplastics as well as the plastisphere community in both water and sediment still remains poorly known lo et al 2020 therefore more research is urgently needed to better understand how do the typhoons impact the microplastic distribution in the environment and ultimately impact ecosystem function by regulating microplastics distribution the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area known as the greater bay area gba is praised as one of the four bay areas in the world together with new york bay area san francisco bay area and tokyo bay area hui et al 2020 shenzhen one of the four engines for building gba is the first special economic zone in china to lead reform and opening up wu et al 2020 however with the rapid development environmental issues have followed closely several studies have shown that there are high concentrations of microplastics in some mangroves and estuaries of shenzhen wu et al 2020 zuo et al 2020 besides that shenzhen coastal areas have been frequently affected by typhoons with a total number of 29 entering the 500 km warning zone of shenzhen from 2015 to 2018 reported by the meteorological bureau of shenzhen municipality therefore it is essential to conduct a systematic microplastic survey on shenzhen coastal areas before and after typhoon to uncover the interference of typhoon on the distribution of microplastics and microbial community and further help to improve the database of microplastics pollution in the gba taking advantage of shenzhen s natural contours of the coastline the microplastics in surface water and sediment were collected along the 190 km shoreline of shenzhen city before and after the summer tropical cyclone attack by typhoon wipha code 1907 maximum wind force near the center was 9 in 2019 the microplastics abundance and composition as well as the microbial community of the attached biofilm hereafter plastisphere was measured with mainstream analytical and bioinformatic pipelines with the purpose to 1 reveal microplastic pollution influx introduced by typhoon 2 decipher the influence of typhoon on plastisphere community 3 disclose potential ecological threats to coastal environment associated with typhoon induced microplastics variation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection surface seawater and sediment samples were collected from 9 sites along the coastal line of shenzhen fig 1 the latitude and longitude information of the sampling sites is displayed in table s1 sites 1 s1 is the estuary of the maozhou river the largest river of shenzhen while sites 2 s2 sites 3 s3 sites 4 s4 and sites 5 s5 are in the park area sites 6 s6 sites 7 s7 sites 8 s8 and sites 9 s9 are in the exposed sandy beach area sites s6 s9 are in intertidal area while s1 s5 belong to the subtidal zone in this case a stainless steel shovel was used for samples from s6 s9 while the box corer was used for sampling at sites s1 s5 typhoon wipha landed on the coast of zhanjiang city guangdong province at 17 40 on august 1st 2019 with the maximum wind force near the center as 9 sampling was taken timely before july 22 2019 and after august 2 2019 the time typhoon wipha attacked shenzhen and before that s1 s9 had not been subjected to any cleanup activities organized by the authorities on each site 5 l surface water was sampled by a stainless steel bucket from the top 20 cm of the water body and then preserved in 4 c until further analysis 1 kg of surface sediments top 0 5 cm were collected at each site martin et al 2017 tally et al 2020 and then transported into aluminum foil bags and stored in a refrigerated enclosure 4 c before analysis two replicates were taken at each site for both water and sediment samples firdaus et al 2020 pavithran et al 2021 2 2 microplastics extraction and observation following our previous protocols wu et al 2020 the surface water samples were treated with 30 h2o2 for 12hours before each sample was filtered through the gf c glass microfiber filter paper 47 mm ø 0 45 μm pore size and the sediment samples were separated by flotation the moisture content of sediment samples was calculated and then a certain quality of wet sediment 100 g dry weight was selected from each sample to perform peroxide oxidation with 30 h2o2 samples that need to explore microbial information on microplastics were not subjected to peroxide oxidation all the selected sediment samples were suspended in 1 l of zncl2 solution density 1 6 1 7 g cm3 and stirred for 30minutes the mixture was allowed to settle deposit for 24 h and afterwards the supernatant was passed through the 0 45 μm gf c glass microfiber filter paper 30 μm nylon filter paper for microorganism extraction to optimize the recovery rate of microplastics this separation process was performed twice after extraction all filter papers were transferred to the glass dish with a lid for further identification and observation to avoid potential contamination in the laboratory a series of procedural controls used by wu et al wu et al 2020 and nuelle et al nuelle et al 2014 were taken in this work keeping the workplace always clean the non textile lab coats masks and nitrile gloves were always worn the covering of all containers was washed 3 times with milli q water millipore co usa before reuse during the flotation process the sediment samples were covered with tinfoil before filtering potential airborne contamination was assessed by sucking the air through a clean glass fiber membrane 47 mm ø 0 45 μm pore size this test result showed no microplastics observed confirming that the lab environment is suitable for performing microplastic experiments the microplastics were enumerated by categorizing them according to 3 size classes class 1 1 5 mm class 2 0 5 1 mm and class 3 0 5 mm the microplastics were also classified according to shape sphere foam film fiber and fragment and color purple transparent white black yellow green blue and red all the suspected microplastics in class 1 and class 2 were retrieved from the filter and confirmed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet is5 thermo scientific usa for the microplastics in class 3 the identification procedure was directly conducted on the ftir microscope μ ftir configured with a ge tip atr nicolet in10 mx thermo scientific usa the spectra obtained were compared with the reference spectra in the hummel polymer library and matching of 70 was considered reliable 2 3 dna extraction sequences processing and bioinformatics analysis for sediment plastisphere total genomic dna was extracted in duplicate from microplastic samples using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp bio solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the concentration of dna was quantified with a nanodrop spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa the duplicate dna extracts were then mixed for pcr amplification universal bacterial primers 515f and 907r targeting v4 v5 region were used to amplify the 16s rrna gene of the total genomic dna xiong et al 2012 finally the extracted and purified pcr products were sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform magigene co ltd guangzhou china with pe250 strategy samples collected from sites s1 s5 s8 and s9 of before the typhoon and sites s1 and s2 after the typhoon were sequenced with two biological replicates qiime1 software package was used to demultiplex and quality filter the resulting illumina reads to remove low quality sequences with default parameters caporaso et al 2010 and chimeric sequences were further identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 the sequences were clustered into otus operational taxonomic units at 97 level similarity taxonomy annotation was conducted by aligning the representative sequences for each otu against the silva database https www arb silva de quast et al 2012 the alpha diversity indexes of shannon and pielou s evenness was calculated by default qiime1 protocols the picrust2 pipeline was used to forecast the functional potential of microbial communities douglas et al 2020 2 4 statistical analysis the units of the microplastic abundances in surface water and sediment were recorded as the number of microplastics per liter n l and the number of microplastics per kilogram dry weight n kg dw respectively all statistical analyses were performed using r or spss 22 0 software kolmogorov smirnov test was used to test the microplastic abundance data for normality and the results showed a non normal distribution therefore the microplastic abundance data was ln transformed before variation between before and after typhoon samples were assessed using the paired sample t test the correlation between microplastic abundances before and after typhoons was tested using pearson s correlation analysis the spearman s correlation coefficient between the otus was used to establish the co occurrence networks of bacterial communities the student s t test was used to compare the means of alpha diversity indexes derived from different groups principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed to visualize bacterial community clustering among samples the clustering significance between sample categories was evaluated using analysis of similarity anosim statistics with the vegan r package clarke 1993 distance based redundancy analysis db rda was performed to explore the correlation between plastisphere community and microplastic characterization with the vegan r package the bray curtis distance was used to calculate the similarity of the plastisphere community between the samples before the db rda we used the forward selection procedure to select microplastic characterization using the forward sel function from the packfor r package dray et al 2007 spearman correlation analysis were conducted to delineate correlations between microplastic characteristics and relative abundance of otus using spss software with the threshold of r 0 6 and p 0 01 2 5 source tracking analysis in this study sourcetracker was used to perform source tracking analysis knights et al 2011 since most plastic debris accumulates in the sediment claessens et al 2011 we assume that it can serve as a source leaving the water as a sink sourcetracker uses a bayesian approach to estimate the proportion of microorganisms in a given community that come from possible source environments claessens et al 2011 here we performed plastic community source tracking based on chemical composition the wilcoxon test was used to compare the sediment source proportions before and after the typhoon 3 results and discussion 3 1 typhoon induced redistribution of microplastics from sediment to surface water microplastics were detected in all the surface water and sediment samples collected before and after the typhoon showing the pervasiveness of microplastic contamination in shenzhen coastal areas fig 2 for water samples the average microplastic abundance was respectively 35 6 22 1n l and 42 0 13 3n l se before and after typhoon period respectively which was comparable with the previous study xia et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 for sediment samples the average microplastic abundance was respectively 4955 8 2325 0n kg and 3198 0 3107 3n kg se for the pre and post typhoon period and was also comparable to that reported for qinzhou bay li et al 2018 and maowei sea li et al 2019 before typhoon microplastic distribution exhibited evident heterogeneity in both water and sediment across the shoreline fig 2 the abundance of microplastics at s1 and s2 is obviously higher than that of other sites s1 is located downstream the heavily polluted maozhou river and adjacent to the pearl river estuary where water velocity slows down fig 1 and the hydrodynamic condition of the site is conducive to the accumulation of microplastics ding et al 2019 wu et al 2020 s2 is also close to the pearl river estuary and surrounded by residence and industrial parks where locate numerous plastic and electronic products producing factories causing the high microplastic abundance at s2 andrady 2011 the disturbance during typhoon showed opposite impact on microplastic concentration in surface water and sediment figs 2a b typhoon significantly increased the average microplastic abundance by approximately 18 for surface water samples whereas the average microplastic abundance in the sediment dropped about 35 after the typhoon as expected typhoons agitated the coastal sediment prompting the microplastics that settled in the sediment to be released again resulting in the decrease of average microplastic abundance while the released microplastics were resuspended and redistributed together with the original microplastics in the water resulting in an increase of microplastic abundance in surface water previous studies have also discovered that typhoon induced exogenous input and sediment resuspension could significantly increase the nutrient levels of water ding et al 2012 gao et al 2021 worth to note is that the microplastic abundance at s2 was decreased by 47 after the typhoon which is contradictory to other water samples fig s4 s2 is located in the mangrove wetland park where the coastal mangrove forests can serve as natural shelter against waves and tides hayden and granek 2015 the well developed root system of mangroves was natural buffer against the typhoon disturbance consequently there was no significant release of microplastics in the sediments of s2 after the typhoon fig 2b without release of microplastics from the sediment the microplastics in surface water were diffused and thus diluted by waves resulting in a decrease in the concentration in the surface water at this site therefore impact of typhoon on microplastic abundance is site specific and affected by the combined effects of typhoon trajectory and topography of the sampling sites which can be reflected from another study conducted at four beaches in hong kong reporting that the cyclone led to an increase of average microplastic abundance lo et al 2020 despite such site specific pattern significant positive correlation between microplastic abundance before and after typhoon was observed in both surface water and sediment samples figs 2c d suggesting that the impact of typhoon induced disturbance is generally comparable among sites and not strong enough to reshape the overall microplastic background along coastline in summary despite the effect of typhoon could be site specific and related to factors such as orientation and topography of the site a general redistribution of microplastics from sediment to surface water was observed previous studies have shown that typhoons affected the hydrodynamic conditions of estuaries and bays causing the resuspension of fine grained sediments and destroying the previously stratified water column lou et al 2016 nowacki and ganju 2018 compared with fine particle sediments the microplastics are more susceptible to typhoon processes with smaller particle size and density therefore by disturbing the microplastics the typhoons may further promote the spread of contaminants and microorganisms absorbed attached to the microplastics increasing the risk of biological exposure and ultimately affect the stability of the ecosystem 3 2 typhoon induced microplastics influx as revealed by altered composition and source tracking analysis the size color and shape are important features facilitating the identification of potential sources and hazards of microplastics therefore such composition information of microplastics in surface water fig s1 and sediments fig s2 were measured at all sites before and after typhoon in this work microplastics collected were grouped into three size categories 0 5 mm 0 5 1 mm and 1 5 mm microplastics with size 0 5 mm were the most abundant prevalent in surface water and sediment samples in surface water the microplastics 0 5 mm accounted for 70 2 and 51 7 before and after typhoon respectively fig 3 a in the sediment samples the proportion of microplastics 0 5 mm was comparable to that in surface water with average values of 88 4 and 53 0 respectively for samples before and after typhoon period a previous study showed a comparable size distribution of the microplastics 63 of microplastics with size 0 5 mm in marine sediments collected from the south yellow sea and the east china sea zhang et al 2019 additionally the declined proportion of small sized microplastics 0 5 mm after typhoon was also observed in the previous study on hong kong beaches lo et al 2020 the decline proportion of small sized microplastics in surface water might be attributed to the introduction of large sized microplastics by typhoon from open sea for sediment the fast resuspension of small sized microplastics might be the main reason for its decreasing proportion the microplastics collected were in various colors such as black white transparent and colored red blue green yellow purple in all surface water samples transparent microplastics were the major part followed by colored black and white fig 3a since the weathering process will cause microplastic decoloring he et al 2019 the high concentration of transparent microplastics in water may be attributed to the fact that the microplastics are more susceptible to weathering processes such as photooxidation wave erosion in the surface water after typhoon the proportion of transparent microplastics in the surface water samples increased from 59 6 to 83 5 while the percentage of transparent microplastics in the sediment samples dramatically decreased from 60 2 to 26 1 which is consistent with the previous study wang et al 2019a it is worth noting that a certain number of purple microplastics appeared in the surface water and sediments after the typhoon indicating the import of microplastics caused by typhoon according to the previous research hidalgo ruz et al 2012 microplastics detected in our study can be segmented into five groups fragment fiber film foam and sphere fig 3a showing that the fragment and fiber were the most abundant microplastics in the surface water and sediments the microplastics is defined as fragment when it cannot be defined as fiber film foam or sphere fishing tools cole et al 2011 and clothes browne et al 2011 can be important sources of fibers while the breakdown of plastic containers packaging materials and cosmetics is the source of fragments napper et al 2015 yan et al 2019 in this case the high proportion of fragment and fiber in shenzhen coastal areas can be attributed to the plastic manufacture industries fisheries and tourism before typhoon the fragments were numerically dominant in surface water and sediment accounting for 59 6 and 76 2 respectively after typhoon the proportion of fragments decreased but the proportion of fibers in surface water and sediments increased reaching 65 8 and 51 9 respectively these results indicated a typhoon associated influx of fiber like microplastics which has significantly altered the shape distribution of microplastics in the coastal areas pcoa based on the microplastics appearance characteristics size shape and color showed clear clustering between samples collected before and after typhoon in both surface water p 0 001 and sediment p 0 001 fig 3b although typhoons can cause severe erosion on beaches mudflats and other coastal areas leading to the alteration of microplastics appearance aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 the unbalanced increase of fiber like and purple microplastics in surface water suggested a typhoon induced microplastic influx the variation in color distribution of microplastics may change the colonization of microorganisms and functional diversity of the plastisphere wen et al 2020 such typhoon induced alternation may disturb the feeding behavior of organisms de tender et al 2015 yang et al 2020 and eventually disturb the stability of coastal ecosystem generally it is not easy to determine the source of microplastics in surface water and sediment but their type may provide a potential indication wang et al 2019b the type of microplastics randomly selected from each sample were identified by μ ftir typical ftir spectra and images of the selected microplastics are shown in fig s3b cellophane polystyrene ps polypropylene pp polyester pet polyethylene pe and other polymers polyvinyl chloride polyamide were found in the samples collected from the shenzhen coastal area fig s3a in surface water pet cellophane pp and pe accounted for 29 7 25 9 23 5 and 20 9 of the microplastic contents respectively after typhoons the fraction of cellophane increased to 67 0 whereas those of pe pp and pet decreased to 11 9 9 8 and 9 5 respectively in sediment samples before typhoon the cellophane accounted for the largest proportion 44 5 followed by pe 29 2 pet 14 2 and pp 11 7 however for the sediment after typhoon the proportion of cellophane and pp changed slightly within 0 4 while that of the pet and pp changed to 17 7 and 22 8 respectively fig s3a as the most commonly identified type in the present study cellophane is an organic cellulose based polymer commonly used in cigarettes and food packaging paper yan et al 2019 prior investigations have pointed out the widespread of cellophane microplastic particles in water systems castillo et al 2016 lo et al 2020 yang et al 2015 while the possible sources can be attributed to the atmospheric fall out effluent from sewage treatment works and soil application of the residual sludge bråte et al 2018 pp and pe often existing as plastic bags bottles and fishing tools etc are also common types of polymers in coastal environments andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 worth noting is that the diversity of polymer types in the shenzhen coastal areas has increased after typhoon such as the emergence of ps and polyamide which are generally used in cosmetics daily decoration liu et al 2018 and textile zhu et al 2018 which again supported the notion of typhoon induced microplastics influx at coastal areas to further illustrate the microplastics influx brought by typhoon we estimated the contribution of sediment microplastics to those in surface water based on chemical characteristics using sourcetracker in general before typhoon the microplastic community in water tended to be composed mainly from sediment whereas that after the typhoon was more attributed from unknown source fig 4 a which is obviously associated with typhoon induced microplastics influx the overall contribution of sediment to water decreased significantly after the typhoon fig 4b wilcoxon test p 0 01 and the abundance of microplastics in water was increased significantly after the typhoon fig 2a taken together typhoon wipha might have driven the microplastics from open ocean to the coastal areas of shenzhen given the general properties of microplastics to carry pathogenic or invasive microorganisms bhagwat et al 2021 viršek et al 2017 such typhoon induced influx may inevitably impact the local ecological system 3 3 the promptly uniformed plastisphere community by typhoon to reveal the impact of typhoon on microbial community and identify potential biological threats associated 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed on the microplastics attached biofilm the so called plastisphere in sediment samples with several sites excluded owning to pcr failure caused by low biomass site s3 of samples before the typhoon and sites s6 s7 s8 and s9 after the typhoon a total of 299 142 high quality sequences were obtained with an average of 16 619 sequences per sample correlation between taxa relative abundance of biological replicates displayed good consistency table s3 67 of spearman s correlation r 0 67 thus relative abundances were averaged for further analysis plastisphere before the typhoon was dominated by proteobacteria 55 32 bacteroidetes 9 25 acidobacteria 9 13 cyanobacteria 6 90 and actinobacteria 4 99 by comparison plastisphere after the typhoon was dominated by proteobacteria 75 03 actinobacteria 7 40 tenericutes 3 51 acidobacteria 3 29 and cyanobacteria 2 65 fig 5 a consistent with previous studies proteobacteria was the most predominant phylum wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 whether before or after the typhoon a possible explanation is that the marine microbiome was universally predominated by proteobacteria hoshino et al 2020 sunagawa et al 2015 which necessitates the prevalence of proteobacteria in sediment plastisphere furthermore bradyrhizobiaceae comamonadaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae the most abundant taxa belonging to proteobacteria in this study are often important members for the formation of biofilms barnes et al 2015 chao et al 2015 di gregorio et al 2017 the high biofilm forming ability maybe another significant explanation for the domination of proteobacteria in plastisphere to further identify plastisphere community response to typhoon perturbation we focused on changes in alpha and beta diversity both shannon and pielou s evenness indexes indicated that the bacterial alpha diversity in the plastisphere decreased significantly after the typhoon fig s5 t test p 0 05 interestingly the coefficient of variation cv of shannon and pielou s evenness indexes also both decreased after the typhoon fig s5 suggesting that communities become more similar after the typhoon perturbation next plastisphere community structure was compared among samples using pcoa analysis which measures dissimilarity among communities to represent beta diversity the results showed that the plastisphere communities before and after the typhoon were significantly distinct from each other fig 5c anosim r 0 39 p 0 01 and those after typhoons were firmly clustered together indicating a promptly uniformed plastisphere community after typhoon a previous study has reported a typhoon induced adaptation in bacterial community composition of lake water jones et al 2008 as such in addition to the extensive mixing of microplastics in the sediment and surface water the geographically wide reaching perturbation during typhoon would redistribute microplastics among its affecting areas resulting in direct homogenization of plastisphere across the shoreline after typhoon 3 4 bacterial co occurrence pattern and potential metabolic functions a co occurrence network analysis on the microplastics microbiome was performed to better understand the biofilm formation pattern and potential microbial interaction among taxa in the plastisphere community a total of 76 nodes showed 75 5 positive and 24 5 negative correlations within total 322 interaction links fig 6 positive relationship may arise from cross feeding and co aggregation in biofilms whereas negative relationship implies a competitive interaction faust and raes 2012 the observed modularity index 0 676 0 4 indicates that the network has a modular structure newman 2006 six distinct individual modules were observed for the network of plastisphere bacterial otus the alphaproteobacteria was the most abundant class in the co occurrence network which is consistent with the previous study on marine ecosystem debroas et al 2017 furthermore the microbial keystone taxa are highly connected taxa within community which are critical for maintaining community structure and functions banerjee et al 2018 in the network otu1 bradyrhizobiaceae otu18 phyllobacteriaceae otu99 flavobacteriaceae and otu753 rhodobacteraceae are inferred to be keystone taxa within the plastisphere community fig 6a the bradyrhizobiaceae has the capability of biological nitrogen fixation de souza et al 2014 which suggests that otu1 may in some circumstances provide nitrogen nutrition for other plastisphere members the ability of rhodobacteraceae to produce quorum sensing signals regulating biofilm formation huang et al 2009 suggests that otu753 may contribute to the biofilm formation and stability of plastisphere as such these keystone taxa can play vital role in the biofilm formation and maintenance of the plastisphere a change in the composition of microbial population may be accompanied by variation in metabolic function to confirm the effects of typhoon on functional diversity of plastisphere a function prediction analysis was conducted using picrust2 the mean sd of the nearest sequenced taxon index nsti value was 0 327 0 323 fig s6 which was far below the maximum confidence cutoff by default in picrust2 value of 2 douglas et al 2019 and comparable to other environmental studies applied this tool ogola et al 2021 toole et al 2021 suggesting that the predicted functionality of the plastisphere had high confidence and sequence identity consistent with the previous study jiang et al 2018 the metabolic pathway of the plastisphere community was dominated by amino acid metabolism 11 07 0 20 followed by carbohydrate metabolism 8 72 0 23 fig 7 overall the functionality of the plastisphere differed significantly before and after the typhoon the metabolic pathway abundance of biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics including styrene aminobenzoate and benzoate fig s7 increased significantly following the typhoon suggesting bacteria capable of utilizing plastic polymers or the additives increased after the typhoon ye et al 2021 together these results revealed that typhoon could affect microbial community and metabolic performance of plastisphere simultaneously 3 5 increased nitrogen fixation potential in plastisphere community after typhoon the db rda analysis was further performed to estimate the effect of the characterization of microplastics on plastisphere community the results showed that only plastic color was significantly correlated with the plastisphere community composition using the forward model selection fig 5d p 0 05 whereas size shape and material type showed no significant correlation this is similar to previous observations that the plastic colors affected the community structure of plastisphere and the blue microplastics accommodated more unique species of burkholderiaceae wen et al 2020 however we found the transparent microplastics as the main shaping factor of plastisphere community in this study rather than other pigment colors the microplastic color before typhoon was mainly composed of transparent 64 9 whereas the microplastics of other pigment colors 72 7 was the main component after typhoon the pigments and additives of plastics may be acting as an organic source for the plastisphere community and affecting the selection of microbial biofilm composition mccormick et al 2014 wen et al 2020 therefore plastisphere divergency before and after typhoon may be attributed to the metabolite behavior of microbes towards microplastics of different color pigments suggesting a plastic color additive induced selection of plastisphere community interestingly the most abundant otu1 affiliated with bradyrhizobiaceae was only significantly affected by the percentage of transparent microplastics exhibiting a negative relationship r 0 69 p 0 01 fig 8 the enrichment cultures of bradyrhizobiaceae must be incubated in the dark de souza et al 2014 suggesting that the growth of bradyrhizobiaceae could be inhibited by the sunlight therefore the greater light intensity on transparent microplastics would repress dominancy of bradyrhizobiaceae by positive selection the reduced proportion of the transparent microplastic after typhoon helped to remove a weighty ecological barrier for this adaptive population resulting in its boost in the plastisphere community soon after typhoon more importantly many species affiliated with bradyrhizobiaceae have shown capability to biologically fix nitrogen de souza et al 2014 lindström and mousavi 2020 confirming their roles in natural nitrogen cycling therefore the increased abundance of bradyrhizobiaceae may promote the process of nitrogen fixation and add nitrogen input to sediments such increase in the microbial nitrogen fixation potential in sediments plus an important contribution of settled sediments microbiome in overall coastal nitrogen fixation process hou et al 2018 indicates that typhoon wipha would potentially alter the nitrogen cycling and increase eutrophic condition of the coastal environment of shenzhen and therefore with frequently occurrence of typhoon events in shenzhen lai et al 2015 it can be anticipated that their impact on the plastisphere and nitrogen cycling is non negligible and would cause fierce disturbances on coastal ecosystem biogeochemical processes 4 conclusions this work at shenzhen a representative city in the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area reported that typhoon wipha increased the average microplastic abundances in surface water by about 18 and decreased the average microplastic abundances in sediment by about 35 typhoon induced microplastics influx could be inferred by the increased contribution of typhoon associated unknown source by sourcetracker and the unbalanced increase of fiber like purple microplastics after typhoon in surface water additionally the wide reaching disturbance and erosion effects of typhoons can promote the redistribution of microplastics in surface water and sediments across the shoreline which leads to a promptly uniformed plastisphere community with potential enrichment of nitrogen fixer in coastal environment this study provides valuable information for a more integrated and dynamic understanding of coastal microplastic contamination under the impact of global climate change further work at different geographical locations of the ocean coastline sea to different meteorological events will be needed to
